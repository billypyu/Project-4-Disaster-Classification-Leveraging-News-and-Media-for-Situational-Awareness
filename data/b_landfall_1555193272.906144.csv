KURT ANDERSEN,"Rice is the most compelling character. Allie pities poor Condi, who seemed to have spent a lifetime offering graciousness as a kind of microwaved substitute for actual warmth. Barbara Bush reckons Rice wanted her real personality to break through; she was merely afraid of it as opposed to Hillary who despised her own real self. But Rice has an authentic center, knows that if she ran for office every compromise and stifling and self-suppression to be performed would devour her with shame.
At an Army base in Germany, preparing to address the troops outdoors, she unbuttons her coat so it will blow open and reveal a pair of knee-high boots tightly encasing two legs whose several inches of exposed thigh had been made shapely by uncountable hours on the elliptical. Our Miss Brooks morphing into Lucy Lawless. Dominatrix? Who, me? Three hundred pages later, shes in bed with the named, real Canadian foreign minister, a man 11 years her junior. Condi admired the forearm flexors of Canadas Sexiest Male M.P., and later proudly thinks I got laid, but also recognizes that their lovemaking resembled the U.S.-Canadian relationship affectionate; not especially dramatic; and unlikely to evolve.
As for Bush, Im willing to buy that he really is kind, particularly to the women in his life; emotional about the wounded and displaced; sickened by corruption more than any dovishness; and realized after being re-elected how much he already wanted the whole thing to be over. And he might have the dark, funny thought that if the plane aiming for the Capitol dome on September 11 had actually hit it, he could imagine his vice president muttering No loss through that sly slit of a mouth.
But the W. of Landfall is unbelievably wonderful. He makes charming fun of his reputation for ignorance and then disproves it again and again. Hes fluent geopolitically, historically, philosophically. He knows minutiae, like the Iraqi village where Saddams regime executed over 140 people in 1982, and hes smart about the bigger picture, understanding that his war to incite regional democratization was, hed come to realize, his own domino theory, a reversal of the L.B.J. version. When Rumsfeld and Rice have a spat, he angrily asks: What would you call that? A dialectic? His born-again Christianity, he figures, gives him more in common with, and more insight into, the most radical Muslim who read his Quran than the unbeliever who never opened his Bible. And Mallons Bush is this much of a brainiac mensch: Hes trying to finagle a happy ending for Allie and Ross because hed failed in Iraq and New Orleans, and thus felt required to amalgamate the miniature and the giant. If he could help to solve their problems, writ small in the ink of a double catastrophe, maybe that could lead him toward a solution for the catastrophes themselves.
His flaws are barely flaws. Dole rags on him for always choking up and Kissinger, likewise, for possibly being the sincerest man Ive ever met. In this book his biggest problem, which Mallon diagnoses well, is a fundamental uneasiness, the lack of an even keel. Young Laura worries how long it would be before the quick, constant movements between overindulgence and athletic self-punishment broke the spring of her husbands metronome. When Allie first beholds him, she remarks on the fake good humor Hes actually pissed off. I can see it in his eyes and three decades later still sees the bipolarity: Half the time he was without self-confidence; the other half he spilled an excess of it. But this is such a mature and self-aware Bush that he knows he had to fight it, the sudden shift from merriment to irritability, from runners high to cramp, the flight and crash he experienced a dozen times an hour. He wonders at one point if he is getting as paranoid as Nixon, and then decides that maybe President Ford was the only normal guy to have occupied the place, including himself and his father.
I was surprised how little space such a thoughtful writer devotes in this long novel to the awful particulars of its central catastrophe. Hes too easy on everyone. The action starts nearly two years into the war, well after the administration made its big, terrible decisions. The profound bungling and cynicism and deception behind those decisions is elided, practically ignored, eclipsed by Bushs present-moment sincerity and idealism. Dick Cheney is generally absent, as are any real discussions of waterboarding or renditions or Guantánamo. Rices predecessor, Colin Powell, who warned the president in 2002 that if we broke Iraq wed own it, is recalled as a self-righteous ass. The war years Mallon has chosen to focus on, 2005 and 2006, perfectly stack the moral deck in Bushs favor after breaking Iraq but before committing to trying to put it back together. In fact, the military surge that started in 2007 reduced the chaos the United States had unleashed. The one main character in the war zones is likable, lovable Allison, whose work doesnt involve killing or torturing, and the Iraqi (and Afghan) characters we meet still welcome the Americans as liberators, years into the wars.
Rosss government job also consists of doing nice things. The most Republican opinion he expresses isnt very right-wing annoyance at P.C. colleagues in his department with their theory-ridden view of American history as a sort of ongoing atrocity. In fact, hes a deep-state RINO, finding the new bureaucratic term homeland a trifle Third Reich-ish, and arguing against funding a hagiography of the conservative pundit Norman Podhoretz: Lets not reject their junk just so we can start pushing our junk.",Thomas Mallon’s “Landfall” imagines the goings-on inside the Bush White House.,2019-02-11T10:00:05Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Fiction: A Comic Novel About the George W.

"Ray Sanchez, CNN","Puerto Rico's emergency management director Abner Gómez's resignation is effective Saturday Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, appointed by Pentagon to lead military relief efforts, leaves island next week (CNN) Puerto Rico's emergency management director resigned Friday as the island's slow recovery continues nearly two months after Hurricane Maria made landfall. In announcing the resignation of Abner Gómez, effective Saturday, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló praised the work of his emergency management chief following the passage of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in early and later September. The governor also announced that Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, who was appointed by the Pentagon to lead all military relief efforts, will be reassigned outside the island next week. About 60% of the US territory is still without power as the island's approximately 3.4 million US citizens struggle through the aftermath of the storm. A massive power outage struck the capital of San Juan on Thursday after a major north-south transmission line failed, according to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as PREPA. No reason given for resignation Héctor Pesquera, secretary of Puerto Rico's Department of Public Safety, will take over emergency management duties. Rosselló did not give a reason for Gómez's resignation. The emergency management director came under fire after the island's El Nuevo Dia newspaper reported that Gómez took a two-week vacation shortly after Maria made landfall on September 20. Buchanan, a three-star star general and commander of US Army North (5th Army), arrived in Puerto Rico in late September as the military was tasked with improving distribution networks of relief supplies. 'We've moved out of the crisis' ""The cessation of General Buchanan's work does not mean that the military is leaving,"" Rosselló said in a statement. ""His departure marks a positive transition. We have not finished the recovery, but there is progress in the missions that have been carried out."" Buchanan will be replaced by a two-star general, according to the governor. ""From my perspective, we've moved out of the crisis,"" Buchanan told reporters. ""We're moving out of response and most places are moving on towards recovery... FEMA is going to be here for very much the long term and the rebuilding effort, and we in the military generally don't do that."" The changes come as the island's government faces questions about the official death toll of 55 from the massive storm. Government officials acknowledged this week that nearly 500 more people died in Puerto Rico in September than in the same month the previous year. An official with Puerto Rico's forensics institute told reporters that 472 more people died this September than in the same month in 2016 -- up from 2,366 to 2,838. Wanda Llovet, director of the Demographic Register, said there were about 82 deaths a day reported from September 1 through September 19, compared to some 117 per day during the last ten days of the month. ""We are not going to say there could be more or less,"" Pesquera, whose oversees the count, said of hurricane-related fatalities. ""We've quantified the number of deaths."" Pesquera has staunchly defended government efforts to generate an accurate count under extremely trying conditions: most lines of communication were cut and many roads on the island were initially impassable.

 Tens of thousands have been asked to evacuate from seaside towns and villages
Tropical storm Pabuk has begun pelting southern Thailand with rain and wind, in what is expected to be the worst storm to hit the region in 30 years.
The storm made landfall at 12:45 local time (05:45 GMT) in the province of Nakhon Si Thammarat, the Meteorological department said.
It is expected to move across southern Thailand hitting several popular tourist spots.
Thousands of people have left Koh Samui, Koh Tao and Koh Phangan islands.
While storms are common in the Gulf of Thailand at this time of year, Pabuk is the first in decades to strike during the peak holiday season.
Thailand's meteorological department said the storm will over the next days affect the south of the country ""with widespread rainfalls, and torrential downpours are possible much of the area"".
""People should beware of the severe conditions that cause forest runoffs and flash floods,"" the officials warned. 
The storm will likely weaken as it crosses over from the Gulf of Thailand to the Andaman Sea, but tourists there are also being warned to be prepared for heavy rain, rough seas and landslides.",Storm Pabuk has made landfall in southern Thailand and is expected to hit many popular tourist spots.,2019-01-04T07:28:56Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Thailand Pabuk: Tourist spots hit by worst storm in decades,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46756239,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1315/production/_105058840_779ba8dc-cdbd-4556-b5c7-0776095a25f7.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,landfall,1
MATT STEVENS,"Forecasters said they expect the Florida Panhandle as well as parts of eastern and central Alabama and western Georgia to get between four and eight inches of rain through Tuesday, with some isolated areas getting as much as a foot; they warned that flash flooding was possible in Florida, much of Alabama, and western Georgia. Storm surge in Florida could cause water to rise as high as three feet from the Aucilla River to Mexico Beach, they said. Isolated tornadoes were also possible over parts of Georgia and southeast Alabama. After the exceptionally destructive season last year, forecasters said last week that the possibility of a weak El Niño, along with near-average sea surface temperatures, suggest that this year’s hurricane season will be normal or only slightly more active than average. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s forecasters predicted a 70 percent likelihood of 10 to 16 named storms this year with winds of 39 miles per hour or higher. Hurricane season runs from June 1 until Nov. 1 and peaks from mid-August through late October. Last year, there were 17 named storms, 10 of which became hurricanes ; the first named storm was Arlene — a rare preseason tropical storm that arrived in April. “We’re not expecting the season to be one of the most active on record,” said Gerry Bell, lead hurricane season forecaster with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center.

Morgan Sung,"Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate were so destructive, no other hurricanes will be given the same names. The World Meteorological Organization announced Thursday that it's retiring the names Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate from its rotation because of 2017's devastating season. It's replacing the names with Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel instead. SEE ALSO: Shell knew truth of global warming in 1980s; foresaw a Hurricane Sandy scenario WMO names each hurricane based on an alphabetical rotation of names, alternating between male and female names. The selection of names for each rotation is usually used every six years, so we won't see Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel come into use until 2023. If a hurricane is especially fatal and causes significant damage, its name is taken off the rotation and replaced with a different one. According to the WMO's FAQ, this naming system makes it easier for news outlets to report on the storms and increases community preparedness. ""Experience shows that the use of short, distinctive given names in written as well as spoken communications is quicker and less subject to error than the older more cumbersome latitude-longitude identification methods,"" WMO's FAQ says. WMO says that the 2017 hurricane season was ""one of the most destructive on record,"" with damages in the United States alone costing $250 billion. The 2017 hurricane season was one of the most destructive on record. Image: world METEOROLOGICAL organization The hurricanes taken off the WMO's rotation of names caused 224 deaths during their tropical cyclone phases. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria were the first Category 4 storms to make landfall in the United States on record. Irma and Maria both reached Category 5 storms when they made landfall on the Caribbean islands. The damage caused in the Caribbean is likely to take years to recover, according to WMO. Seventeen tropical storms were named in 2017, and 10 of those storms became hurricanes. Six reached ""major hurricane strength"" and clocked in at Category 3 or higher. This is above the average for annual storms; from 1981-2010, the average was 12 tropical storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. Harvey made landfall over or near Texas last August as a Category 4 hurricane. It lasted for four days, devastating Houston and causing the deaths of 68 people. It was the costliest hurricane after Katrina, causing an estimated $125 billion in damages. Irma caused significant destruction in the Caribbean as a Category 5 hurricane, nearly wiping out Barbuda. It was the first hurricane to make landfall in Cuba since 1932, and it prompted the evacuation of about 6 million people in southern Florida. Maria ripped through Dominica and Puerto Rico in September. Dominica's damages are estimated at $1.3 billion, or about 224 percent of its GDP according to WMO. The entire island of Puerto Rico lost power, which one report concluded was the second largest blackout in history. Nate crossed from Nicaragua to Honduras as a tropical storm, but made landfall as a category 1 hurricane. The rainfall from Nate caused 44 deaths in Central America. 2017 retired almost as many names as 2005, when the severe hurricane season resulted in WMO removing Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan, and Wilma from the rotation.","Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate were so destructive, no other hurricanes will be given the same names.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","A pair of fierce tropical cyclonesCyclone Trevor and Cyclone Veronicaare poised to strike Australia on two coasts within a day of each other, prompting mass evacuations as well as official warnings of severe and dangerous weather.
A state of emergency was declared in Australias Northern Territory this week ahead of Trevors second landfall early Saturday. As the cyclone moved through the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Northern Territory saw its largest evacuation since 1974 during Cyclone Tracy, according to ABC News Australia.
Thousands of people were reportedly evacuated from areas that lay in Trevors path. ABC News reported that some residents of the region, including those on the island Groote Eylandt and the coastal town of Borroloola, had to be airlifted to safety.
Trevor made landfall on the Northern Territory on Saturday at around 11 a.m. local time as a Category 4 cyclone, delivering dangerous winds that were felt more than 200 kilometers from the storms center. ABC News reporter Kristy OBrien was situated in Borroloola when the storm struck the Northern Territory and described the system to the BBC as delivering a guttural howling roar.
The cyclone first made landfall on the Cape York Peninsula earlier this week, which according to the Washington Post resulted in flooding and other destruction in the area. The force of the cyclones first landfall was reportedly equivalent to that of a Category 3 hurricane.
The Bureau of Meteorology Northern Territory said Saturday that Cyclone Trevor had been downgraded to a tropical low system, but added that it would be delivering dangerous conditions and severe weather as it moved further inland.
Tropical Cyclone Veronica, meanwhile, was nearing Western Australias Pilbara coast as of Sunday morning local time, bringing with it powerful and destructive winds and prompting safety warnings from the Bureau of Meteorology.
While the destructive wind and heavy rain are the obvious impacts, this system also has the potential to bring significant storm surge and flooding to the region, the Bureau of Meteorology Western Australia tweeted Saturday evening eastern time. Its worth thinking about what you would do if those threats occur.
The government agency said its been more than four years since twin cyclones have pummeled Australia at once, with the last event occurring in 2015 with Cyclones Marcia and Lam.
As the Washington Post noted, the pair of cyclones arrives as Australia recently experienced its hottest summer on record with a mean national temperature average of 30.8 degrees Celcius in January. As the paper noted, surrounding sea waters saw above normal surface temperatures, a recipe for brewing tropical storms.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","On March 15, a rare, giant cyclonemade landfall in Mozambique before making its way west to Malawi and Zimbabwe. By Saturday, Cyclone Idai had dissipated, but not before causing widespread infrastructural damage throughout eastern Africa and claiming more than 200 lives,reports Al Jazeera.
The Mozambican city of Beira, the fourth largest in the country, is 90 percent destroyed, according to a preliminary estimate by Jamie LeSueur of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). With a population of more than 500,000, Beiras recovery is bound to be long: Aid workers couldnt reach the city until Sunday because flooding cut off roads, and IFRC team lead LeSueur said almost everything is destroyed. 
Mozambique had received some5.5 to 7.4 inchesof rain in 24 hours in the week before the storm even hit. Seven people died then, and more than 30,000 were already experiencing displacement, according to ReliefWeb. The cyclones heavy rainfallit was expected to drop up to 18 inches onto Mozambiquehas only made things worse. 
This cyclone was, indeed, unusual, as its the seventh cyclone in the Indian Ocean this season. Thats more than double the average for this time of year. Unfortunately, although the cyclone has fizzled out Mozambiques Institute of Meteorology expects conditions of extreme rain, thunder, and wind to persist throughout the country until Thursday.
Meanwhile, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs activated an international charter Monday, which should help agencies map out the damage and necessary response through satellite imagery. 
The United Nations is requesting $40.8 million in U.S. dollars for emergency relief. The European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations has already allocated 150,000 Euros to Mozambique to provide shelter and health needs and another 100,000 Euros to help Malawi with relief efforts. 
So far, agencies estimate that the cyclone has impacted about 850,000 people in Malawi and Mozambiquehalf of whom are children. The flood waters have also taken down 145 houses and four major bridges in Zimbabwe, according to ReliefWeb. Schools and clinics have likely suffered extensive damage throughout the region, as have crops and local water supplies, per the World Meteorological Organization. Currently, healthcare and clean water are high priorities for government relief efforts, according to Al Jazeera.
Its hard to say whether climate change had an influence on this cyclone, which was big but not unprecedented for the region. Butthe strongest cyclones have grown more common in the Southern Indian Ocean since 1994, according to a 2018 study, and their frequency is likely to continue increasing as our oceans warm. Overall, climate change is forecasted put more pressure on southern Africa in the future, through more heavier rainfall events and more drought.

Now, a new satellite image reveals the extent of unloaded rainfall in the nearby desert of Rub’ al-Khali, the world’s largest sand desert and (normally) one of the driest places on Earth. The image, taken by NASA’s Operational Land Imager three days after the storm brought heavy rains to the region—Salalah saw 11 inches of precipitation in just 24 hours, more than double its yearly average—captures the arid desert’s typical large swaths of sand with ripples sculpted by wind. But there’s one novel feature: water lakes in the flat lowlands between the sand dune tops. This water lake phenomenon has not been seen in the desert in almost two decades, according to NASA’s Earth Observatory. The desert, also known as the Empty Quarter, receives about 1.2 inches of rain per year on average. Aside from being quite the sight, these bountiful rainwater deposits could be beneficial for local business. “The land will need 30 days to sprout their summer plants,” Ali Al- Hatish, a regular visitor desert visitor, told Al Arabiya.net. After that, camel owners expect this vegetation to feed their camels for the next two years. The paper also reports that the rare sight of lakes interspersed with dunes could send to tourists flocking to the area. Tropical Cyclone Mekunu spun up in the Arabian Sea in late May. Extremely warm waters (31-32 degrees Celsius or 88-90 degrees Fahrenheit) fed the storm until its winds equalled that of a Category 3 hurricane prior to making landfall in the Arabian Peninsula, according to The Weather Channel. This made Mekunu’s landfall historic; the Arabian Peninsula sees a tropical cyclone every year or every couple of years, but a tropical cyclone making landfall with hurricane-like wind speeds is a rarity in Oman and Yemen. As myriad media outlets reported, Oman and Yemen bore the brunt of the tropical cyclone with destructive winds, heavy rainfall, and flooding wreaking havoc in cities. These new satellite images are a reminder that powerful storms have the potential to dramatically reshaping natural landscapes, too.","When Tropical Cyclone Mekunu rumbled over Oman in May, it dumped torrential rainfall on the city of Salalah.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","After a sluggish start to eastern Pacific hurricane season, the basin is making up for lost time. Hurricane Bud is the second of back-to-back major hurricanes to form in less than a week. The Category 3 storm is currently churning toward Baja California, though it’s thankfully forecast to weaken before likely landfall this weekend. As of 3 a.m. local time this morning, Bud was still picking up steam roughly 235 miles south of Manzanillo, Mexico. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) put Bud’s winds at 115 mph, making it a Category 3 storm. That’s the threshold for classifying storms as major hurricanes. Meteorologist Ryan Maue tweeted a more recent satellite image with data indicating Bud had reached Category 4 strength with winds around 132 mph. Either way, it’s quite a difference from how the storm looked yesterday. At 4 a.m. local time on Sunday, Bud had winds of just 50 mph, making it a moderate tropical storm. But just as Aletta before it, Bud underwent rapid intensification thanks to warm waters and low wind shear. Rapid intensification is a term used when a storm’s winds increase 65 mph in less than 24 hours. The outer bands of Bud’s winds could reach Mexico, prompting the NHC to issue tropical storm watches from Manzanillo north to the Puerto Vallarta area. The agency also forecast that up to 10 inches of rain could fall in isolated locations on Tuesday and “cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides.” From there, Bud will continue to lumber northward. While the storm is expected to strengthen a bit more in the next day or two, it will then begin gradually decaying as it moves over cooler waters. It could reach Baja California near Los Cabos by Saturday as a tropical storm where floods and mudslides could again be a concern. From there, Bud or its remnants could push into the Southwest. While it’s too early to forecast what locations could be impacted or when they could get hit, it’s worth remembering that tropical systems can bring major flash flooding to the region, so keep an eye out as the forecast develops. The remnants of Hurricane Newton reached Arizona in September 2016, the last time a tropical system impacted the Southwest. Eastern Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 without much fanfare. But the season has since gotten much more active. Bud follows Hurricane Aletta last week. That storm whipped up into a Category 4 hurricane on Friday, thankfully posing no threat to land. Aletta has since been downgraded to a tropical storm and is meandering westward into the Pacific as it weakens. No other storms appear to be on the horizon, but the next one that forms and attains a name will be Carlotta.","After a sluggish start to eastern Pacific hurricane season, the basin is making up for lost time.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"Hurricane Michael comes as undecided voters and polls suggest there are not many of them in Florida this year are finalizing their choices less than four weeks before statewide elections. It presents opportunities and hazards for a host of candidates eager to display competence and gravitas as voters make up their minds and begin casting their ballots. Among the candidates are Gov. Rick Scott, who is running a fierce race for Senate against the Democratic incumbent, Bill Nelson, and Mayor Andrew Gillum of Tallahassee, the Democratic nominee for governor. How they tackle the preparations and response to the storm could cement their standing as front-runners or upend months of painstaking campaign work, rendered useless by the late-arriving taint of a botched disaster. Its a chance to show leadership, but its also a chance to fail at leadership, said former Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, who faced a hurricane about a month before the election he lost in 2016.

"RICHARD FAUSSET, ALAN BLINDER and JOHN SCHWARTZ","With bread in hand, Mr. Perryman and Ms. Long, 32, were headed back to their home in Panama City, about a 30-minute drive south. They lived near a bayou, he said, which they feared would overflow with the storm surge. But they were still on the fence about leaving. The plan was to keep waiting and watching the news. If by Wednesday morning Michael still looked like it was going to slam straight into Panama City, then maybe they, too, would head to Dothan to bunk with relatives. As he waited to buy a 20-pound bag of ice, Mike Sanville, 64, puffed on a cigarette and said that he was also going to try to ride the storm out in Fountain, in the small house he shares with two other men. He was expecting the town to get punched hard. Its coming right at us, he said. Were dead center. Mr. Sanville, a retired construction worker, said he worried that the roof would blow off his house as the winds picked up Tuesday night. If that happened, he said, he might ride out the rest of the storm in an outhouse he had built out back. He said that it had survived a blow from a falling tree a few years ago. But would all three residents fit in an outhouse? Maybe, he said. No question it would be a tight fit.

Willa is expected to make landfall on Mexico's south-western coast on Tuesday and is ""potentially catastrophic"", the National Hurricane Centre (NHC) warned. It threatens to bring torrential rains and major flooding, the NHC added. Earlier this month areas of the US were devastated by Hurricane Michael, which left at least 27 people dead.

JESS BIDGOOD,"• Hurricane Lane was expected to bring tropical storm and hurricane-force winds to parts of Hawaii, with up to 30 inches of rain in some areas, according to the National Weather Service. The storm was approaching Hawaii on Wednesday. • President Trump issued an emergency declaration for the State of Hawaii on Thursday morning, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts. • The state’s 15 airports were set to remain open during the storm, barring infrastructure damage. As of Thursday morning, flightaware.com reported some delays at airports across the islands. The approach of Hurricane Lane is the third time in less than a year that Hawaii has braced for potential disaster. In January, an errant emergency alert about an incoming ballistic missile triggered an island-wide panic. In May, the Kilauea Volcano began to erupt, sending lava rolling over roads and homes in the same area that is now under a flash flood watch. Photo Alex Krivoulian, right, stocked up on water in Honolulu. Residents have been advised to gather supplies of food and water that could last them as long as 14 days. Credit Kat Wade/Getty Images And yet, with strong hurricanes rare in this part of the world, the threat of Hurricane Lane felt new and deeply unsettling to some residents, who heeded the National Weather Service’s advice that preparations to safeguard life and property should be “rushed to completion.” “Maui has not faced anything like this before. It’s serious,” Audrey Reed, 76, a resident of that island, said on Wednesday. “We’ve got everything we need: batteries, water, canned and dry foods, medication, first-aid kit, flashlights. It’s just a matter now of hunkering down and trying to ride it out.” Hawaii’s remote geography and mountainous terrain could pose challenges for recovery in the event of widespread damage, and Gov. Ige urged people to have a 14-day supply of food before the storm. Hurricane Lane arrives as other parts of the nation are still recovering from the megastorms of 2017. Hurricane Harvey hit Houston almost exactly one year ago, causing dozens of deaths and catastrophic flooding, and it was followed by Hurricane Irma’s wallop to Florida. Then came Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, which may have killed more than 1,400 people, according to one analysis, and caused massive power outages.

A.A. Newton,"The National Hurricane Center expects Hurricane Florence to cause “ life-threatening, catastrophic flash flooding ” when it makes landfall later this week, and now there’s a tool that gives us an idea of just how catastrophic that impact will be. This tracker from ESRI Media takes the familiar prediction model and uses it to calculate some key demographic data for the area inside the error cone. ESRI’s tracker shows the total population, total households, and total educational organizations in Florence’s projected path: Clicking on the individual items in the legend pulls up more data, including the proportion of the total population that’s over age 65, and how many of the total households are below the poverty line. At the time of writing, 16% of the affected population is over 65, with 15% of affected households living in poverty; the median household income is $51,000. Whether you’re smack dab in the danger zone or watching the storm from afar, you should know how to correctly read an error cone projection. ESRI has an efficient summary in the description of their tracker (emphasis mine) that hits on the main points: “The Cone of Uncertainty...represents the probable track of the center of a tropical cyclone, and is formed by enclosing the area swept out by a set of circles along the forecast track (at 12, 24, 36 hours, etc). It is important to note that the area affected by a tropical cyclone can extend well beyond the confines of the cone enclosing the most likely track area of the center.” In other words, if your city—or your loved ones’—is outside the error cone, it just means that the center of the storm isn’t expected to pass over; areas outside the cone can still expect high winds and heavy rain, and should watch local forecasts extra-carefully in the days to come. That’s the most important thing to take away from error cone projections, but if you’d like a more in-depth explainer, this Wall Street Journal piece briefly explains how they’re calculated, how to correctly interpret them, and what the limitations are. Understanding the potential human cost of a storm—especially among vulnerable populations—is a crucial first step to mobilizing support for communities that’ll see the worst of it. Get your hurricane plan locked down, check in on your friends and family, and be prepared to do some vetting before making any donations to relief efforts.","The National Hurricane Center expects Hurricane Florence to cause “ life-threatening, catastrophic flash flooding ” when it makes landfall later this week, and now there’s a tool that gives us an idea of just how catastrophic that impact will be.

Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

Adam Rogers,"Michael introduced itself to North America with 155-mile-per-hour gusts of wind and a barometric pressure of 919 millibars, the third-strongest hurricane to ever make continental US landfall. It was a monster, and it stayed a monster as it rolled through Georgia and then on toward the Carolinas. And monsters are made, not born. The most striking thing about Michael is that it was barely a tropical storm a couple of days ago, and all of a sudden it almost touched cat-5 intensity, says Karthik Balaguru, an oceanographer who studies hurricanes at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Typically hurricanes ramp up more slowly (if at all), and landfall reduces their intensity. The thing with Michael is, it just kept on intensifying, Balaguru says. Thats calledperhaps as youd expectrapid intensification, and it used to be a rare phenomenon among Atlantic hurricanes. Thats good, because rapidly intensifying hurricanes also tend to be the ones that are the most dangerous, the deadliest and the most expensive. Unfortunately, rapidly intensifying hurricanes seem to be a rarity no longer. Of the record-breaking hurricane season of 201717 named storms, 6 major hurricanesall four category-4 or 5 storms underwent rapid intensification. Thats Harvey, which drowned Houston, Irma, Jose, and Maria, which was so devastating to Puerto Rico. Now, to be fair, most Atlantic cat-4 and cat-5 storms go through rapid intensification; the dangerous ones do it near the coastline, just before landfall. More intense hurricanes are one of the central predictions scientists have made about Earths changing climate. Human beings pump more greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the air, and the air changes. The planets overall temperature goes up, and that means, in part, more energy in the top of the oceans. Thats a hurricanes engine. Advances like satellites and radar have made high accuracy possible in predicting a hurricanes eventual track, the path it takes across ocean and land. Intensity, though, is another story. Its hardas the hurricane researcher Kerry Emanuel wrote last year, a good intensity prediction would require better numerical models, better understanding of boundary layers between air and water, and a better model of how the upper ocean interacts with storms. Scientists dont have any of those. Forecasting rapid intensification is even harder. And again, perhaps as one might expect, a warmer climate makes rapid intensification more likely. Emanuels group calculated from observations of past storms that a hurricane with wind speeds that grew 68 miles per hour in the day before making landfall should only happen once in a century under the conditions of an unchanged climatebasically a hundred-year storm. And the vulnerable cities were just about where youd expect, too: Houston, New Orleans, Tampa, Miami. But, the researchers then calculated, in the post climate-change climate of our Burning World, those storms could happen once every five years. And the new hundred-year storm? Pre-landfall intensifications of 114 mph, so massive as to be essentially nonexistent in the late twentieth-century climate, Emanuel writes. People will have never seen anything that bad. Balagurus group found similarly grim news. Their calculations, based again on observed rapid intensification, say that climate change and variations in Atlantic conditions could drive up the magnitude of that intensification. Point is, climate change means more rapid intensification like what Michael did, and worse. How did Michael pull it off? If I had to guess, Id say it experienced perfect conditions for a hurricanea lot of heat available in the ocean and favorable atmospheric conditions, Balaguru says. Wind shear, the changes in magnitude and direction of winds from the oceans surface all the way up to the top of the troposphereabout six miles upmust have also subsided. High enough wind shear can disrupt convection at the storms center, weakening it overall. That didnt happen here. The result: yet another perfect storm in yet another season of perfect storms, crashing into a heavily populated coastline full of environmental disasters waiting to happen. As of Thursday, Michael has ramped back down. Its merely a powerful tropical storm now. And its tracking right over the towns where Hurricane Florence made landfall last month.

People living in one of Mozambique's largest cities have been warned to expect the ""worst-case scenario"" as a major cyclone makes landfall.
Cyclone Idai, which is carrying winds of up to 165km/h (103mph), is making landfall near the port of Beira.
A storm surge of at least six metres (20 feet) is expected near low-lying Beira, a city of 500,000 people, Météo France said.
Heavy rains have already killed about 100 people in Mozambique and Malawi.
Beira is the fourth largest city in Mozambique and its major port sits on the mouth of the Pungwe river, that runs to Zimbabwe.
Météo France, which monitors French territories in the Indian Ocean, said Idai was ""an extremely dangerous tropical cyclone"" packing a ""life-threatening"" storm surge of at least four metres along the coast, and six metres near the mouth of the Pungwe river near Beira.
The surge could be even higher because of high tide, Météo France warned.
The cyclone's late change of course meant that ""the worst case scenario is very likely"", it added.
Images posted on social media showed significant damage to Beira as the storm approached, with large trees uprooted. 
Mozambique has been struck by severe cyclones in the past, including Eline in 2000, when 350 people died and 650,000 were displaced across the wider region.
Beira has often seen the brunt of the storms and has worked to limit the effects of rising waters brought about by climate change through a series of infrastructure projects.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Atlantic hurricane season may be slipping by to little fanfare ( so far ), but it’s a different story in the northwest Pacific. A dangerous super typhoon currently packing 170 mph winds could make landfall in Japan early next week. Typhoon Jebi, which started getting organized east of Guam on August 27, exploded to life over the last few days, intensifying from a Category 1 to a Category 5-equivalent storm between August 29-30. Currently located 300 miles northwest of Saipan, Jebi is moving northwest at 16 miles per hour, continuing its trek over open ocean into the weekend before making an expected northward veer early next week. That turn will place it on a direct course for mainland Japan. Recent model runs show a high chance of the storm making landfall near Kyoto, potentially as a powerful typhoon. “Jebi was in a fairly classic environment for rapid strengthening,” Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson told Earther via email, citing warm ocean waters and favorable upper level wind conditions. “Its forecast track is also a textbook case of recurvature,” with initial movement toward the west or northwest before curving around to the north at mid-latitudes. Henson added that because Japan’s islands run southwest to northeast, “a small change in the track could have a big impact on exactly where Jebi makes landfall.” East of Shioku and south of Honshu, the storm could kick up waves up to 10 meters (33 feet) high as it approaches Japan, creating a hazard for ships, according to AccuWeather. But the real concern is the impact on the heavily populated areas within the storm’s forecast cone of uncertainty, including Tokyo. Flooding, mudslides, and destructive winds are all possible impacts. If this feels familiar, it is because we’ve been here before. Japan has already seen heavy rainfall associated with two typhoons, a tropical depression and a tropical storm this month, AccuWeather notes. In July, western and central Japan experienced historic rainfall and deadly landslides brought on in part with Typhoon Prapiroon, with Typhoon Maria following closely on its heels and delivering even more rain to the nation’s southern Ryukyu islands. With northern hemisphere tropical cyclone activity often peaking in September and lasting through November, Japan may not be out of the woods for a while.","The Atlantic hurricane season may be slipping by to little fanfare ( so far ), but it’s a different story in the northwest Pacific.

Juliet C. Revita,"THE Office of Civil Defense (OCD)-Davao noted a total of 4,103 evacuees in Davao region who evacuated due to Tropical Depression (TD) Chedeng, but no casualties have been so far recorded during its onset.
Leslie Francisco, information officer of OCD-Davao, said based on their situation report issued Tuesday, March 19, around 8 a.m., there were 19 barangays affected with 978 families forced to leave their homes to seek safer ground. Some of these evacuees were temporarily sheltered in the gym and barangay hall.
Data showed that Davao Occidental, where Chedeng had made landfall in Malita around 5:30 a.m. on Tuesday, noted a total of 1,675 displaced individuals, Davao Oriental with 2,413, Davao City with 15 individuals. Their consolidated data for Compostela Valley province has yet to be determined. Figures may possibly go up as OCD is still gathering all reports from different provinces.
In the weather bureaus advisory at 4 p.m., Chedeng has weakened into a low pressure area; thus, all tropical cyclone warning signals have been lifted. However, they further advised that scattered to at times widespread moderate to heavy rains will still be experienced over Surigao del Sur, Agusan del Sur, Davao region, Soccsksargen, and portions of Northern Mindanao, Bangsamoro and Zamboanga Peninsula.
In preparation for Chedeng, OCD-Davao participated in the Simultaneous Pre-Disaster Risk Assessment Emergency Preparations for Response (PDRA-EPR) meeting spearheaded by National Disaster and Risk Reduction Management Council (NDRRMC) on March 17 to iron out plans and strengthen coordination with other government agencies.
The alert status of operations center in Regional Disaster and Risk Reduction Management (RDRRMC 11) has been elevated to Blue Alert Status. OCD 11 had issued memorandum to local DRRMCs to likewise hoist their respective operations center alert status to Blue to closely monitor their respective area of responsibility for the possible effects of the tropical depression.
All the RDRRMC-Davao Response agencies were also on guard and were advised to allow all local DRRMCs to optimize the utilization of their response assets including food and non-food assistance to the affected families or IDPs.
The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), meanwhile, prepared a total of 6,049 on-floor and readily available family food packs for the displaced victims and continuous repacking in the warehouse is ongoing. A P3 million disaster stand-by fund is also readily available for any eventualities.
In Davao City, the CDRRMO has conducted pre-emptive evacuation to landslide prone areas in Matina Crossing (Purok Guadalupe, Quiniones Compound, Pluto Street GSIS, Shrine Hills Diversion Road, Milky Way St. and Virgo St. GSIS heights; Barangay Mandug (DDF Village Mandug); Barangay Buhangin (Purok Damayan); Barangay Maa (Juario Village, Purok 9 Shrine Hills, Nacilla Village Shrine Hills, Dinaville Subdivision and Iñigues Village), Barangay 19 (Awhag Subdivision, Barangay Matina Pangi (Diversion Road Dumpsite; and Barangay Tigatto (Purok 16); Talomo (Bypass Road) to ensure the safety of the residents susceptible to disaser.
Davao Oriental Governor Nelson Dayanghirang has ordered all concerned agencies to fast track the repairs of the Masipit Bridge in Tarragona town which was damaged yesterday when Chedeng struck.
Governor Dayanghirang, who was joined by Vice Governor Niño Uy, ordered the Provincial Engineers Office to work and coordinate with the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) District Office and Municipal Engineers Office to fast track the repair as they inspected the site earlier today, the statement in their official Facebook page read.
The bridge was impassable Tuesday after the incessant downpour has made the bridge unstable and unsafe for vehicles. The statement added that the engineering teams from the province, municipal government, and DPWH are working together and consolidating efforts to build the embankment to make it passable.","Typhoon Chedeng displaces 4000 in Davao SunStar Philippines Families evacuate as Chedeng nears land ABS-CBN News Chedeng makes landfall in Davao Occidental, becomes LPA Rappler Davao orders preemptive evacuation ahead of 'Chedeng' SunStar Philippines Chedeng …",2019-03-19T14:28:30Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Sunstar.com.ph'}",Typhoon Chedeng displaces 4000 in Davao - SunStar Philippines,https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1797674,https://www.sunstar.com.ph/uploads/images/2019/03/19/132613.jpg,,Sunstar.com.ph,landfall,1

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by AJ Dellinger to Gizmodo","Just an extremely normal radar loop of a tropical cyclone over Indiana. GIF: National Weather Service The early start to hurricane season continues with what could be the first landfalling tropical cyclone to make it to Lake Michigan on record. Tropical Depression Alberto has been the weird storm that could, improbably moving from the Gulf of Mexico to Indiana. The last advisory the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued for the storm, which came at 4 p.m. Central Time, noted that flash flood watches associated with the storm extend across the Appalachians from Georgia to Virginia. The storm already triggered flooding in North Carolina earlier on Wednesday. But the real weird part is where Alberto is centered, 70 miles south of South Bend, Indiana where the outer bands are already bringing rain to the city. South Bend itself is about 25 miles southeast of Lake Michigan, and the storm’s current track could clip or even make it all the way to the lake. That would make Alberto the first tropical system to ever hit Lake Michigan’s shores (h/t hurricane expert Brian McNoldy ). Beyond Lake Michigan, only seven tropical systems have ever made it to the Great Lakes according to data on historical hurricane tracks maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. All have struck Lakes Huron, Erie or Ontario, the three easternmost lakes. Of the tropical systems that have made it that far north, three even managed to hit the lakes as full blown hurricanes. In comparison, Alberto is quite a bit weaker. It’s currently a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph. But its present status just adds to Alberto’s strange tale. The storm has been a meteorological oddity since its inception in the Gulf of Mexico. It spun up there as a subtropical storm, borrowing elements from tropical weather like hurricanes and extratropical weather like nor’easters. The storm made landfall along the Gulf Coast over the weekend in its subtropical form. But rather than petering out or going full extratropical, the storm made a bizarre transition to a tropical system over land. On Tuesday, the NHC began calling the storm Tropical Depression Alberto. Since then, it has chugged through the Midwest with heavy rain bands swirling around its center. The storm could be maintaining its tropical nature through “brown ocean effect,” a gross-sounding meteorological phenomenon where waterlogged soil can mimic the ocean and provide fuel to storms (Marshall Shepherd, the atmospheric scientist who helped coin the term, has a great primer on it if you want to geek out). Regardless of whether it makes landfall ( or is it waterfall ?) on the shores of Lake Michigan, Alberto has been a whacky kickoff to hurricane season.",The early start to hurricane season continues with what could be the first landfalling tropical cyclone to make it to Lake Michigan on record.

NICOLE STEPHENS,"During survey interviews, survivors who stayed focused on interdependence, emphasizing themes of sticking together, religious faith and communal and family ties. In fact, over two-thirds of those who stayed explicitly discussed the importance of connections to others. “We had a good community” one Katrina survivor in the New Orleans area said. “All the people here help one another.” Another said, “I was worried and not only for myself, but for a lot of the people.” As critics of storm holdouts may suspect, nearly half of those who stayed also discussed the importance of being tough or strong in the face of hardship, but this was never the sole factor. The silver lining of residents weathering a dangerous storm with one another is visible in the ways communities come together in a chaotic aftermath to share boats, food, and emergency supplies. Such acts of neighborly bravery have been caught on camera, or retold on social media, during ad hoc rescue operations for multiple hurricanes. These benefits may especially resonate with working-class Americans, who are more likely to think of themselves as part of a broader social network, with responsibilities to vulnerable neighbors; in contrast, members of the middle- and upper-class, who tend to evacuate, are more likely to think of themselves as independent families, free to come and go as they please. Considering the government’s slow and inept response to recent natural disasters, it is not surprising that people — especially those in working-class and minority communities — frequently do not trust the government’s disaster preparation. When the sentiment that the government doesn’t care about “people like us” is widespread, the likelihood of those people complying with mandatory evacuation orders drops. Like Hurricane Katrina before it, the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, in 2017, was a tragic reminder that our government desperately needs to improve its ability to respond effectively to the immediate and long-term needs of citizens who endure natural disasters.","Jay Allen swam in the pool at his residence in Garden Beach, S.C., on Thursday, having decided to ignore an order to evacuate the day before Hurricane Florence makes landfall.",2018-09-14T10:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Why Do People Stay When a Hurricane Comes?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/opinion/hurricane-maria-staying-home.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/14/opinion/14nicolestephens/14nicolestephens-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,landfall,1

ERIKA P. RODRIGUEZ,"Credit Photographs by Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times A group of friends in Guaynabo, P.R., were singing by the light of their cellphones. Days before Christmas, and three months after Hurricane Maria made landfall, parts of the Puerto Rico are still without water, and over a million people are in the dark. Hundreds of residents remain in shelters, unable to return home. Schools that have been able to resume classes are still without power. But in towns around the island, residents are trying to keep holiday traditions alive, despite the circumstances. The group in Guaynabo had arrived at the home of Juan Pablo González for a parranda, a Puerto Rican Christmas tradition that brings friends together to sing carols, usually in the middle of the night. Mr. González’s home was still without power, so people used cellphones and flashlights to see one another and read song lyrics. In Old San Juan, Marta Cirino performed Christmas songs with Caiko y Los del Soberao, an Afro-Puerto Rican music group. The neighborhood is usually crowded with tourists, but on a recent night, it was full of locals who sang and danced to the music. The Eugenio María de Hostos School in Canóvanas has been used as a shelter for weeks, and is currently home to 94 people. Mildred Rodriguez, a resident at the shelter, brought an artificial Christmas tree salvaged from the debris at her home, and decorated it with what she could find. Workers cleaned and decorated the Escuela del Pueblo Trabajador, a Montessori institution near Trujillo Alto. The school decided to continue a decades-long tradition and hold a holiday celebration for the children after parents asked for it. The area has been without power since Hurricane Irma made landfall a few weeks before Maria swept over the island, but the school reopened in early October. In previous years, only one Puerto Rican flag would hang near the Three Kings altar at the school, but this year dozens of flags were integrated in the decoration. The academic director of the school, Marlyn Souffront, wanted to focus on reaffirming the island’s cultural identity.","Large parts of Puerto Rico still don’t have power after Hurricane Maria, but some residents are determined to celebrate Christmas one way or another.",2017-12-22T10:00:58Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","After Surviving Maria, Trying to Keep Holiday Traditions Alive",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/22/us/hurricane-maria-christmas-puerto-rico.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/21/us/00navidad-01/00navidad-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,landfall,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The Atlantic hurricane season has suddenly found its legs. Following some summer doldrums, a number of factors have come together to fuel a run of tropical weather. That includes Hurricane Florence, which just became the first major hurricane of the season. The storm reached Category 3 status—the threshold for major hurricanes—on Wednesday morning. The storm was packing winds of 120 mph and the National Hurricane Center said it was “still strengthening.” The storm is still out in the middle of the Atlantic, which is good news. Hurricane-force winds extend only 15 miles from its center, making it only slightly bigger than Hurricane Beryl, this season’s first hurricane (though that said, tropical storm-force winds extend 90 miles from the storm’s its core). The bad news, though, is that Florence strengthened faster than predicted. It’s also now likely to maintain hurricane strength through the weekend as opposed to yesterday’s forecast indicating it would dip back into tropical storm status. All of this is a concern because recent weather model runs take it near Bermuda by the middle of next week, with a possible U.S. landfall after that. This is not say landfall in either location is by any means a given, but it does mean that Florence is worth watching if you live in either locale. September is usually the most active time of Atlantic hurricane season, and this year has proven to be no exception. Colorado State hurricane guru Philip Klotzbach tweeted that on average, one major hurricane has formed by September 5, so we’re pretty on schedule. The tropics are expected to stay active for the next few weeks as a parade of potential storms could form. That includes an area of low pressure currently sitting to the west of Africa that’s likely to become a tropical depression by the end of this week.","The Atlantic hurricane season has suddenly found its legs.

Miriam Kramer,"On Friday morning, Hurricane Florence made landfall in North Carolina, bringing extreme winds, surging seas, and huge amounts of rain to the coast. While forecasters have been keeping a close eye on the storm from the ground, the International Space Station watched the slow-moving hurricane make landfall from above. SEE ALSO: Stunning astronaut photos show multiple hurricanes swirling in the Atlantic A new 5-minute video from the space station shows Florence coming ashore in the U.S. for the first time. ""Cameras outside the International Space Station captured views of Hurricane Florence on Sept. 14 at 7:41 a.m. EDT minutes after the storm made landfall near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina packing winds of 90 miles an hour,"" NASA said in a video description. ""The National Hurricane Center said Florence is moving very slowly to the west at only 6 miles an hour, then is expected to turn to the southwest, increasing the threat for historic storm surge and catastrophic flooding to coastline areas and inland cities in North Carolina and South Carolina."" NASA astronaut Ricky Arnold also captured Florence making landfall from his spot on the orbiting outpost. The photo shows just how huge Florence looks, with its wind field stretching for hundreds of miles. Forecasters are predicting that the storm will continue to weaken but still dump potentially record-breaking amounts of rain as it moves slowly inland. ""Heavy rain has been occurring in and around Oriental, North Carolina, where 20.37 inches of rainfall has been measured thus far,"" the National Hurricane Center said in an update. These types of slow-moving storms — like Hurricane Harvey — can be particularly dangerous because of the rain and flooding they can bring. According to a study in June, hurricanes and typhoons, on average, appear to be slowing down in part because of human-caused climate change. As the climate warms, the way air moves through the atmosphere can become disrupted, possibly blocking these types of storms in place more often. A warming climate also means that the atmosphere can hold more and more water vapor, fueling hurricanes with even more water that can fall on coastal areas.","On Friday morning, Hurricane Florence made landfall in North Carolina, bringing extreme winds, surging seas, and huge amounts of rain to the coast.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Not even a week has passed since Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle as a Category 4 storm, obliterating much of the infrastructure in its path. Despite the fair warning before impact, the state Department of Corrections failed to evacuate most of its prison facilities. Now that the storms rolled through and road access has allowed the state to assess the damage Michael inflicted, the Department of Corrections announced Sunday and Monday it was evacuating a total of more than 4,000 inmates from three facilities in northern Florida. The state hasnt clarified the conditions of specific facilities, but its press releases note that all of the facilities sustained significant damage to roofs and security infrastructure. Including the 850 inmates evacuated before the storm, nine prisons have now had their nearly 5,000 inmates moved out of harms way. The state told Earther that other facilities in the area suffered minor damage, none of which has impacted housing or security, and that all incarcerated people have had access to meals and drinking water. None of this, however, is enough to quell the fears and concerns family members have for their loved ones who are incarcerated in the state. Deandra Cram, 52, has a 22-year-old son doing time at the Apalachee Correctional Institution, West Unit in Sneads, Florida, which wasnt evacuated though it sat in the storms path. Cram told Earther shes been in touch with her son over the phone and he alleges the state isnt feeding inmates or providing them with safe drinking water. Shes worried the conditions he describes will fuel a riot. When asked for comment on these allegations, a spokesperson for the Department of Corrections emphasized that all inmates continue to have access to food and water and referred us to the states most recent press release for additional information. What would they do if all those prisoners were killed? Would they care? Because theyre criminals, would they care? They forget theyre someones family. I just think they dont care. Ive been through Hurricane Irma, and they told me to evacuate or else, Cram told Earther. I feel like their [my sons] rights have been violated by not having that same opportunity. Theresa Guarino-Cruz, 49, isnt lucky enough to be in communication with her 29-year-old son, who is located at the Northwest Florida Reception Center in Chipley, another prison that was not evacuated but sat closer to the edge of the hurricanes path. Her son used to call about every day to speak to his son, Guarino-Cruzs grandson. Now, she has to face a questioning 7-year-old who doesnt understand why daddy wont call. Colleen Millett, 51, also has a son at this facility. She got in touch with her 27-year-old son a day before the hurricane hit. He told her both sides of his dorm had been boarded up, but theres been no news since the storm. She hates the uncertainty, the wondering and worrying about how her son is doing. The Florida Department of Corrections (DOC) has evacuated six of its facilities, amounting to about Read more Read I feel that [the Florida Department of Corrections] failed me, my son, and every other inmate, their families, and staff members by choosing to not relocate them with the approaching hurricane that was notably increasing in strength and said to be of catastrophic intensity, Millett wrote to Earther in an email. I am desperate for information on my sons well being as well as the conditions that he and so many others are living in. Hurricanes spell health troubles even for those outside prison. The situation for those behind bars almost never looks better. And while some may scoff that these are lawbreakers who deserve what they got, theyre still peopleand the state is responsible for their welfare. Nobody deserves to suffer or die by a storm.","Not even a week has passed since Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle as a Category 4 storm, obliterating much of the infrastructure in its path.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","In a year of wild heat waves, wildfires, and record-setting hurricanes, why not add one more weird weather phenomenon to the list? Tropical Depression Rosa made landfall in Baja California on Monday and is crawling into the Southwest, bringing with it the threat of flash floods from southern Arizona to Idaho. All told, 9 million people are under a flash flood watch or warning as of Tuesday morning Mountain Time as Rosa lumbers inland. The storm attained Category 4 status at its peak late last week, but has lost steam since then (at least in the wind department). It made landfall as a tropical storm in Baja California late last night and has since become Rosas lowly remnant low. But the winds were never the biggest concern for the Southwest. Instead, its the threat of torrential rain as the storm brings tropical moisture to an arid landscape. More than half an inch of rain has already fallen in and around Phoenix, making this one of the heaviest rain events to hit the city since 1990. Phoenix is already up to its seventh-wettest October on record despite it being just Oct. 2. With the heaviest bands of rain to come in the afternoon, the storm is likely to continue climbing the record books. All told, up to six inches of rain are expected in Arizonas mountains. That may not sound like a lot, especially after Florences recent deluge in the Carolinas, but the parched soil ups the risk of runoff. The scenic slot canyons and dry washes that cut across the desert landscape are disguised highways for water, waiting for rain events like this to send torrents rushing downstream. A recent drought has hardened soils even further, which could help accelerate the runoff process. Large portions of the Four Corners area are in exceptional or extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Rosas rain will certainly help alleviate that drought, but it will also exact a toll on the desert landscape and those living in it. Indeed, footage from Phoenixitself chock full of impervious pavementand the surrounding area shows that roads are already becoming inundated as the aforementioned dry washes fill up with frothing, muddy water. The Utah National Guard has already been activated according to CBS News, and we could see more resources mobilized as flooding continues to unfold. Its weird but not unprecedented for tropical systems to amble into the Southwest. Tropical Depression Storm Newton reached Arizona in 2016, the last tropical system to hit the region. Rosas remnants are just the latest example of a growing problem: Heavy rain events are on the rise owing to a warmer atmosphere. Were seeing that trend driven by named storms like hurricanes Harvey, Lane, and Florence as well as random rain events like the one that hit Kauai in April. The Southwest has seen a five percent increase in heavy downpours since 1958 even as the region becomes drier, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment. This type of weather whiplash poses a huge infrastructure challenge as city and state planners have to figure out how to prepare communities both for downpours and water conservation in increasingly dry times.","In a year of wild heat waves, wildfires, and record-setting hurricanes, why not add one more weird weather phenomenon to the list?

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Hurricane Michael is on track to make landfall in Floridas Panhandle Wednesday as one of the fiercest storms the region has ever seen. While Florence drenched the Carolinas with record rainfall and other hurricanes attack with wind, Michaels main threat will be surge. The National Hurricane Center is forecasting Michael could send up to 13 feet of storm surge roaring ashore. Thats a lot of water, and there are a handful of interwoven factors explaining why the surge could be so high. First, theres the storm itself. Michael is a pretty big. Hurricane-force winds extend 35 miles out from the now Category 3 storms core, but tropical storm-force winds extend a whopping 185 miles outward. As the storm rotates, its long, windy arms scoop up water and push it along. The underwater and shoreline topography of the Gulf Coast will lend a hand. The area Michael is headed has a shallow continental shelf that extends up to 90 miles offshore. That water is a lot easier to stir up than the deep ocean. Apalachee Bay very efficiently generates storm surge because of its concave shape and shallow bathymetry, or water depth, Hal Needham, a storm surge expert and founder of Marine Weather and Climate, told Earther. Apalachee Bay sits smack between Cedar Key and Indian Pass, right at the epicenter of the highest surge forecasts. Needham also warned of a terrifying-sounding shelf wave as Michael pushes north. Because the storms movement mirrors the Florida coastline, it basically traps a wave that travels along the coast in the same direction as the storm according to Needham. This happened during Hurricane Dennis, the last major hurricane to hit the Panhandle in 2005, and contributed to higher surge. The pile on doesnt stop there, though. Michaels arrival coincides with the king tides, an annual tradition of the highest tides of the year in Florida which occur when the moon is full or new and the Earth is closest to the Sun. The storm is expected to make landfall sometime in the late morning or early afternoon. Thankfully the high tide isnt until around 10 p.m., but Michael will still strike when the tide is rising. And complete the whole shit show scenario, theres sea level rise. Carbon pollution has contributed to melting land ice and warming and expanding the ocean. Floridas Gulf Coast has seen sea level rise 8-9 inches over the past century. Sea level rise has ushered in a sunny day flooding crisis across the U.S., and its giving storms like Michael a boost they dont really need. Update 5:07 p.m. ET: This post has been updated to reflect the 5 p.m. update from the National Hurricane Center, which upgraded Michael to Category 3 storm with 13 feet of surge potential.","Hurricane Michael is on track to make landfall in Florida’s Panhandle Wednesday as one of the fiercest storms the region has ever seen.

Mark Kaufman,"Hurricane Florence has done something strange. The Category 4 storm — which is expected to make landfall somewhere in the Southeastern U.S. on early Friday morning as a major hurricane — has broken with a 170-year long history of Atlantic hurricanes to now target the United States. Since 1851, there have been 33 named-storms that churned within 100 miles of Florence's position in the middle of the Atlantic. None of them, according to a tweet from hurricane scientist Phil Klotzbach, ever made landfall in the U.S. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Florence is on its way to the East Coast. Here's what to expect. But some unusual weather is steering Florence westward, straight into the U.S. ""All its friends of years gone by have all been going to the north, while this one is going to the west,"" Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said in an interview. 33 named storms (since 1851) have been within 100 miles of #Florence 's current position. None of these storms made US landfall. The closest approach was #Hurricane George (1950) - the highlighted track. However, Florence does not appear to be taking a climatological track. pic.twitter.com/4x02pasgPg — Philip Klotzbach (@philklotzbach) September 7, 2018 Specifically, a potent mass of high pressure over the Atlantic has blocked Florence from traveling north, away from the U.S. ""Usually storms that are located there are already recurving toward the north,"" said McNoldy. ""This an anomalous storm."" Coming back to life Last Thursday, Florence had lost its status as a hurricane, weakening to a tropical storm, which has sustained maximum winds speeds of less than 74 mph. ""It weakened significantly,"" said McNoldy. The storm passed through an area of powerful wind shear — winds that hit storms at their sides, and weaken a hurricane's strength. But as meteorologists predicted, Florence made it through this temporary threat. ""As soon as it got out of that [shear] it began to regain strength,"" said McNoldy. ""There's nothing to inhibit it now."" What's more, hurricanes feed off of warmer ocean waters, and Florence has now entered an area of the Atlantic with waters that are typically warm enough to support a hurricane. But right now, these already-warm waters are even warmer than usual, noted McNoldy. The ocean temperatures Florence will pass through will peak near 85 degrees Fahrenheit, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. ""That certainly doesn't help the situation,"" McNoldy said. The end result is that the NHC forecasts a powerful, destructive storm hitting the Southeastern U.S. early Friday with intense wind speeds of 145 mph, which are then expected to fall to around 85 mph after moving inland. But from there, the situation will likely grow worse. There are no influential weather systems, like the high-pressure system that steered Florence toward the U.S. in the first place, to keep it moving along. This portends heavy rainfall and flooding as the storm stalls over the area. ""That's actually what happened last year for Hurricane Harvey,"" said McNoldy, noting that Harvey stagnated over Houston and dropped historic rainfall on southeastern Texas, becoming the second-most costly hurricane in U.S. history. As for Florence in the Southeastern U.S., ""It could remain in place for the entire weekend,"" said McNoldy.",Hurricane Florence has done something strange.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","It’s been a year of unique weather to say the least. The latest potentially bizarre weather happening to add to the list? Florence, the first major hurricane of the season, could follow a highly unusual route from the center of the Atlantic into the heart of the Eastern Seaboard thanks to a weird atmospheric setup. There are a lot of factors that will affect the storm’s track over the coming days, and slight shifts in any of them could have major consequences. A U.S. landfall is not a given by any means, but Florence is a storm that bears watching into next week, especially with the latest model runs. The storm has already had a wild ride. On Wednesday, it whipped up into a Category 3 hurricane before running into turbulent winds that are part of the subtropical jet stream, a fast-flowing river of air in the atmosphere. By Thursday, Florence had weakened back to a tropical storm. It continued its subdued simmer into Friday with winds at 65 mph. That weakening is the start of the potential bad news for the East Coast, but it also means Florence will in all likelihood spare Bermuda. Hurricanes in the Atlantic usually follow a track that looks roughly like a backwards C owing to steering winds and the location of high pressure system known as the Bermuda High that generally sits parked in the middle of the Atlantic. If the storm had kept tracking northwestward, it would eventually have gotten sucked in by the high and spit back out into the North Atlantic, potentially clipping Bermuda in the process. But weaker winds and the storm’s interaction with the jet stream have nudged it on a more westerly track that’s very unusual. “It’s so far north for that longitude that storms in the area are historically in the process of recurving toward the north,” Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami, told Earther. “Not Florence.” Of the 57 named storms that have passed within 200 miles of Florence’s location as of late this morning, none have come close to striking the U.S. Most have curved out to sea with the exception of a few freak storms that skirted southwest toward the Dominican Republic. Florence’s northerly position is the East Coast’s first piece of bad news. The second is that an exceptionally strong ridge of high pressure air is building to the north that could essentially bottle up Florence and keep it rumbling westward. “No hurricane can turn north into that,” McNoldy said. In other words, if the ridge comes to bear at the strength recent model runs are showing, it would put Florence on a collision course with the East Coast. Not only that, it would steer the storm over a pool of very warm water, allowing it to roar back to life and potentially reach major hurricane status again. The vaunted Euro model has pretty consistently been pointing toward an East Coast landfall and the American weather model known as the GFS has been nudging that way, too. The Friday afternoon ensemble run of the Euro pushes Florence further westward with a likely landfall in the Southeast or Carolinas. If it happens, the storm will have essentially taken an unprecedented track across the Atlantic. Still, this is not the time to freak out. Florence remains 1,800 miles east of Florida. There are still a number of moving parts that will have to fall into place to make things go wrong for East Coasters. That said, it’s the time to listen to the National Hurricane Center and weather professionals and think about how you’ll prepare if the forecast continues to shape up poorly.","It’s been a year of unique weather to say the least.

Shannon Connellan,"'Alberto,' the first named storm of the 2018 hurricane season, has essentially demonstrated its version of a storm in a teacup. The subtropical storm made landfall in Florida on Monday afternoon, and saw strong winds creating a mini-waterspout in a hotel swimming pool in Panama City Beach. Justin Ray Parker, a guest at Shores of Panama captured the little rampaging waterspout on their smartphone, even the moment when a pool float is tossed into the air. The storm, while projected to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to areas in Florida and some Gulf Coast states through Wednesday, will not become a hurricane, according to NOAA — in fact, it has already been downgraded to a subtropical depression. Alberto has, sadly, already killed two people, WYFF-TV anchor Mike McCormick and photojournalist Aaron Smeltzer, who were covering the storm.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Hurricane Florence, which was briefly downgraded to a tropical storm last week, was re-upgraded to hurricane status on Sunday and looks like it is destined to barrel straight at the U.S.’ East Coast. According to CNN, odds are good that it will have strengthened to Category 4 status—meaning sustained winds in the range of 130-156 miles per hour—before the time it makes landfall later this week, likely on Thursday or Friday. CNN wrote: “Maximum sustained winds are now 75 mph, and further strengthening is forecast over the coming days,” said CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen. “Florence continues on a track to impact the US mainland by Thursday or Friday.” The hurricane center said, “All indications are that Florence will be an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane while it moves over the western Atlantic toward the southeastern United States.” Florence was some 1,500 miles away from the East Coast and moving west at roughly six miles per hour on Sunday morning, according to CNN. It’s projected to pass between the Bahamas and Bermuda on its way to land. According to CNN, weather experts say the storm is most likely to hit in the Carolinas. However, the Washington Post noted that the hurricane’s exact placement is “within a large cone of uncertainty” and residents anywhere “Florida to southern New England” should be aware of the storm’s progression. The Post’s weather team noted that Florence will pass over oceans that are warmer than normal, which will provide fuel and “favors at least a Category 3 hurricane landfall on the Southeast coast by week’s end” (emphasis theirs). It’s possible it could become a Category 5 storm. The National Hurricane Center warned on Twitter that there may be a high risk of “storm surge at the coast and freshwater flooding from a prolonged heavy rainfall event inland.” Accuweather added that storm swells are expected to stretch for hundreds of miles around Florence and impact, and there’s a possibility that the storm could stall right as hits land, resulting in sustained battering of the coast and flooding. The Post wrote: In these coastal areas, heavy surf and elevated water levels arrive by Wednesday morning, and rainfall could begin by Thursday morning. Tropical-storm-force winds could reach the coastline as early as Wednesday night, at which point all outdoor preparations should be completed. Extremely dangerous hurricane-force winds could batter coastal locations Thursday into Friday. Hurricane to tropical-storm-force winds could extend inland depending on the storm’s exact track. Two tropical storms are following behind it: Isaac and Helene. Helene is expected to veer north well before coming close to the coast, though Isaac is expected to turn into a hurricane as it continues heading west towards the Windward Islands, the Miami Herald wrote. In preparation for the storm, the governments of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia have all declared states of emergency and are mobilizing resources. As Axios noted, many areas in the path of the storm have not seen hurricanes of this strength for decades—like Charleston, South Carolina, where the last Category 4 storm was Hugo in 1989. Thanks to rising ocean waters from climate change, the area is already prone to the phenomenon of “sunny day flooding” in good conditions. As Earther noted on Friday, this course is unprecedented. Almost all of the 57 named storms that have passed within 200 miles of Florence’s position at that time have curved out to sea, other than a handful which slammed into the Dominican Republic.

JACEY FORTIN,"Hurricanes in Categories 3, 4 and 5 are considered “major.” Hurricane Maria was a Category 4 storm when it hit Puerto Rico last year, ultimately killing thousands and causing months of power failures. If a hurricane’s winds reach Category 5 speeds, “a high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed,” according to the National Hurricane Center, and “power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.” Only a few hurricanes have ever made landfall in the United States as a Category 5 storm. The last was Andrew, in 1992. Meteorologists caution that a hurricane can be very dangerous no matter what its category, especially since the Saffir-Simpson scale doesn’t tell the whole story. It does not, for example, account for rainfall levels or storm surges — not directly, anyway — and those factors have a lot to do with flood risk. Take Hurricane Sandy. In 2012, it never made landfall as anything stronger than a Category 2 storm. But it led to flooding, mudslides, power failures and dozens of fatalities in the Caribbean and the United States. Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 storm last year and was soon downgraded to a Category 3. That rating did not account for the days of heavy rain that would follow, which led to fatal, catastrophic flooding.","On the morning of a mandatory evacuation in North Carolina, clouds dotted the skies over Nags Head on Tuesday.",2018-09-11T22:12:23Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",What Is a Category 5 Hurricane?

The National Hurricane Center said in its 8 a.m. ET advisory that Subtropical Storm Alberto still has top sustained winds of 65 mph, and is located about 100 miles south of Destin, moving northwest at 7 mph. ""On the forecast track, the center of Alberto will cross the northern Gulf Coast in the warning area this afternoon or evening,"" the center said. ""The weakening system is forecast to move well inland into the Tennessee Valley on Tuesday and into the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region on Wednesday and Thursday."" The NHC warned of life-threatening surf conditions, the possibility of a few brief tornadoes in much of Florida and parts of Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama. Heavy rains are also expected in many areas, with some locations seeing between up to a foot of rain across the Florida panhandle into Alabama. Alberto's approach to the region triggered mandatory evacuations of some small, sparsely populated Gulf Coast barrier islands in one Florida county.

Tom McKay,"On Tuesday, Google announced yet another massive subsea cable project, this time a private line stretching across the Atlantic Ocean to connect a data center in the US directly to another in Europe. Per TechCrunch, the planned “Dunant” cable (named after Red Cross founder Henry Dunant) will make landfall in France after crossing nearly 4,000 miles of ocean floor and “connect Google’s North Virginia region directly to its Belgium region.” It’s expected to be operational by late 2020. As Google’s Jayne Stowell explained in a blog post, companies which handle massive amounts of data have three options when trying to cross the ocean: leasing capacity from an existing cable, partnering with other companies with similar needs in what is called a consortium deal to build one, or simply doing it themselves. Though such projects typically cost hundreds of millions of dollars—including both the cost of the cable and the specialized surface facilities that need to be built to connect them at either end—owning its own cable will allow Google to directly connect its data centers without having to share any of the bandwidth. “Cables are often built to serve a very specific route,” Stowell wrote. “When we build privately, we can choose this route based on what will provide the lowest latency for the largest segment of customers.” The announcement follows three others declared by Google this year, per PC Mag. Two of them, the Havfrue cable connecting the US to Denmark and Ireland and the Hong-Kong-Guam cable, are part of consortium deals. The third, the Curie cable connecting the US to Chile, will be privately operated by Google. The cables are generally intended to improve the performance of the company’s cloud computing infrastructure, with Curie being the first subsea cable commissioned by a major non-telecommunications company, PC Mag wrote. Google says Curie will be Chile’s “ largest single data pipe.” According to TechCrunch, Google has also made a number of other substantial consortium investments in subsea cables.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","All weather watchers’ eyes are on Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 beast on a collision course with the Carolina coast. But while the winds are generating headlines and there’s a lot of questions about what category it will be when it makes landfall, the real issue is the water. And there’s going to be lots of it. It’s not that Florence’s winds aren’t a big deal—they are likely to be extremely dangerous and produce deadly flying debris—but there’s going to be a potentially historic amount of rainfall inland and powerful storm surge along the coast. Together, they’re responsible for 76 percent of all direct hurricane deaths. “There’s an old saying that those that live near the water will eventually live in the water,” Stephen Strader, a geographer who studies disasters at Villanova, told Earther. So let’s talk about that water likely to inundate people. Florence is likely to be a copious rain maker owing to how it fast (or slow) it moves ashore. Unfortunately, the National Hurricane Center calls for it to slow down as it reaches the Carolinas and then crawl inland as the winds in the upper atmosphere steering it slacken. That means the storm will have more time to unload heavy rain over the entire area under its shroud. But the slowing also means the bands of the heaviest rain that swirl around the hurricane are likely to do what meteorologists call training, a phenomenon where rain bands pass over one location repeatedly. It’s essential a race track for rain and can cause massive amounts of water to pile up on the ground in a very short period. While the National Hurricane Center is currently forecasting a wide area of 15-20 inches of precipitations, higher localized totals are likely because of training. Some model runs show upwards of 40-50 inches could fall, obliterating the rainfall record for wettest storm set by Hurricane Floyd in 1999 when it dropped 24 inches of rain as it strafed the North Carolina coast. Models are but one piece of putting together a forecast, but the guidance they’re providing right now is really worrisome. “When these environmental wind patterns weaken, there is no mechanism to continue moving the [tropical cyclone],” Sarah Griffin, a tropical cyclone expert at the University of Wisconsin, told Earther. “A similar set-up happened with Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area last year, causing Harvey to move very little for about 2 days.” Harvey was, of course, the biggest rainfall event to ever hit the U.S. so this is an extremely worrisome comparison. Compounding the issue of flooding is the type of summer North Carolina has had. In a word, it’s been a rainy one. A number of weather stations right in the center of Florence’s cone of probability have had some of their wettest summers on record. That means soils are saturated and won’t be able to handle the deluge that’s coming. “A lot of regions are associated with soil that drains poorly to begin with,” Strader said. “One thing we do know is when you replace natural vegetation with parking lots and homes and impervious surfaces, you increase the runoff.” So the rain is a huge issue. But it will likely be compounded by powerful storm surge on the coast, which also has the potential to be exacerbated by the storm slowing down as it approaches land. “If it stalls offshore or near the coast, storm surge threat will increase dramatically,” Hal Needham, a storm surge expert and founder of Marine Weather and Climate, told Earther. Needham said the size of the storm will also play a big role. Right now, Florence is wrapping up an eyewall replacement cycle, a sign that the storm is re-intensifying and could grow larger. If it does grow, the bigger wind field will give it a wider reach to whip more water toward the coast. Since we’re more than two days away and surge is very localized, we don’t yet have specific forecasts from the National Hurricane Center. But again, there’s bad news preceding the storm. Areas in Florence’s path are already seeing floodwaters rising ahead of the storm and tides are projected to remain high in the run up to Florence’s arrival. You can in part thank sea level rise for that, as it makes sunny day floods more common. “Even if you don’t think you’ll have to evacuate, the best thing to do is treat this as a trial run.” We can’t talk about the potential impacts of this storm without talking about how many people now call the area in Florence’s path home. Strader pointed to the fact that since 1940, the population residing in Florence’s cone of probability grew 1,325 percent, including a large spurt in the wake of Hurricane Hugo—the last major hurricane to make landfall in the Carolinas—in 1989. That includes growth ringing metro areas like Myrtle Beach and Wilmington on the coast and Raleigh-Durham inland. “I’m concerned people may be taken off-guard by a change in forecast track,” Needham said. “People need to think not only about their elevation but their evacuation route. I’m also concerned for people inland who may think they will not be impacted by this event.” All the growth also means there’s a lot more of the pavement, which increases runoff and flooding. “It’s a backhand forehand slap with this event with the removal of natural wetlands that protect cities and landscape,” Strader said. Both Strader and Needham urged residents to have a plan in place before the hurricane arrives and pay attention to local authorities. South Carolina has already ordered the evacuation of a million people, and residents in the Outer Banks and elsewhere in North Carolina being told to go inland, ideally out of the river flood zone. If you live in these areas or anywhere else evacuation orders pop up, follow them even if you don’t feel you’re in harm’s way.","All weather watchers’ eyes are on Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 beast on a collision course with the Carolina coast.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Super Typhoon Mangkhut (known locally as Ompong) as it approaches the Philippines. GIF: CIMSS While the world watches Florence make a historic landfall in the Carolinas, there’s another storm on the other side of the planet worthy of our attention. Super Typhoon Mangkhut is the biggest, baddest storm on the planet, and it’s bearing down on the Philippines’ most populous island. After ripping apart houses in Guam like tin cans, Mangkhut—known as Ompong in the Philippines, which uses a different typhoon naming system—has continued its westward march across the Pacific. The storm is packing wind gusts up to 200 mph, taking the title from Super Typhoon Jebi for the strongest cyclone to grace our fair planet this year. Tropical storm-force winds radiate roughly 300 miles out from its center. The forecast indicates that the storm will likely make landfall overnight or early Saturday morning in the northeast corner of Luzon, an island that’s home to 43 million. The huge wind field means that even Manila, located 250 miles south, could still feel the impacts of Mangkhut. But those in the direct vicinity of Mangkhut’s landfall will have to contend with much more than that. The storm could produce nearly 20 feet of storm surge according to the Red Cross, creating deadly conditions along the coast. The Philippines meteorological service warned that all evacuations should already have taken place and that the “situation is potentially very destructive.” The group notes that trees could be uprooted, coconut plantations could be destroyed, and that the electrical system and homes and commercial buildings are likely to see “severe” damage. Mangkhut has drawn comparisons to Super Typhoon Haiyan, which is a really ominous sign. That storm tore through the Philippines in 2013, leaving 6,000 dead and obliterating entire communities. Mangkhut, however, isn’t quite as strong and is forecast to take a more northerly path through the island nation, passing over a less densely populated region. While there hasn’t been any work to attribute Mangkhut specifically to climate change, the warmer oceans and higher seas that are both hallmarks of our warming world are clear links. Mangkhut is passing over waters that are up to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above normal, providing the fuel it needs to stay strong. The Philippines is also a sea level rise hot spot, with waters rising five times faster than the global average. The Philippines is also a hot spot for typhoons owing to its tropical location. The nation has been hit by more tropical cyclones than any other country save China since 1970.","While the world watches Florence make a historic landfall in the Carolinas, there’s another storm on the other side of the planet worthy of our attention.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","One of the things you can count on in the wake of a hurricane making landfall is people clamoring for a new classification system. Like clockwork, that’s what’s happening with Florence. And frankly, the discussion has never been more urgent thanks to climate change. After rapidly intensifying into a Category 4 beast, Florence slowly decayed until it landed in the Carolinas as a Category 1 storm. It was degraded further over the course of the weekend to a tropical storm and then a depression. All of these changes were based on one factor: How strong the maximum winds were. The idea that our sole way of defining hurricanes is by winds is supremely misguided. Some meteorologists hate it. Many people are confused by it. For storms that take a major human toll, it seems especially wrong-footed given that water is responsible for 90 percent of all deaths according to 2016 research. It’s like if Madden ratings where only based on a player’s ability to run (sorry Tom Brady). And with a storm like Florence, it’s easy to see why we need a new scale. The winds did a small portion of the damage while historic rainfall has created a flooding crisis that’s still unfolding. Storm surge—which was driven by Florence’s huge wind field and not just peak winds—further damaged the coast. Some people ignored evacuation orders because the storm was continually downgraded until landfall. Our current ranking system is literally putting people in danger. But that’s not even the worst part. Climate change is clearly intensifying the rainfall and surge associated with storms, making the Saffir Simpson scale even more out of synch with the hazards people living in hurricane zones face. The heaviest downpours are getting heavier thanks to climate change for a simple reason: A warmer atmosphere can hold more water. When that water falls out, look out below. The heavy rains from Florence and Harvey as well as what we saw recently with Lane in Hawaii exemplify that trend. In Harvey’s case, it was second-most costly hurricane on record with much of that rain falling over one of the largest cities in the U.S. Research published earlier this year indicates that hurricanes will get wetter still. Then there’s the storm surge part. Thanks again to climate change, oceans are rising. Seas have climbed about a foot since record keeping began. That gives storm surge a huge lift to inundate areas further inland. The costliest hurricane in U.S. history was Katrina (a Category 3 at landfall), which did most of its damage from storm surge. Ditto for Hurricane Sandy (Category 1) and Hurricane Irma (Category 3 at landfall in Florida), which are also among the five most destructive hurricanes. Like Florence, those storms has massive wind fields that also allowed them to stir up more of the ocean. And also like Florence, they got a lift from sea level rise. Sandy’s surge wouldn’t have done nearly as much damage to New York’s subway system, for example, if it weren’t for the extra sea level rise boost. Future storm surge will only be worse and it won’t take a Sandy-level storm to inundate New York. In fact, the only hurricane on the top five list that did beaucoup damage from wind is Maria. That speaks to a lot of things, notably the bad shape Puerto Rico’s grid was in and how slow the federal response was. That points to how we need to improve how and where we build, but it doesn’t alter the changing calculus of climate change and its influence on the storms themselves. Now look, the Saffir Simpson scale has a great back story. It came into existence in 1971 owing to the efforts of Herbert Saffir, a wind engineer, and Bob Simpson, the head of the National Hurricane Center. Their goal was the give the public a better sense of the risks hurricanes pose. And the scale originally focused on the impact of winds on cheap buildings like mobile homes. You could argue there’s a little bias since Saffir was a wind guy, but to be fair this was also progressive thinking given that it’s inevitably the poor that suffer the most from storms. But with climate change set to make poor people’s lives even worse (to say nothing of the rest of us as well), Saffir’s namesake scale needs to be redrawn. And we should do it soon so people get out of harm’s way before the pig shit hits the fan.","One of the things you can count on in the wake of a hurricane making landfall is people clamoring for a new classification system.

Jennifer Kay / AP,"Forecasters downgraded Alberto to a still-dangerous depression Monday evening, warning heavy rains and an accompanying flood threat would continue in the aftermath of the storm’s landfall in the Florida Panhandle. The Memorial Day strike on the Gulf Coast by the first named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season drove holiday beachgoers away from roiling, dangerous surf. What had sprung up from the Gulf of Mexico as a subtropical storm was now a vast, soggy system trekking inland as it flung rain — heavy at times — all around the Southeast. Forecasters warned that heavy downpours from the weakening system could raise the potential for life-threatening flash floods in coming hours or days across north Florida, much of Alabama and large areas of Georgia — and eventually into Tennessee and the Carolinas. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the depression was centered at 11 p.m. Monday about 50 miles west-northwest of Dothan, Alabama. Its top sustained winds had dropped nearly in half to about 35 mph. What remains of Alberto was crawling northward at about 12 mph. Subtropical Storm Alberto is approaching the Florida panhandle and is expected to make landfall sometime Monday. It had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph early Monday and can create dangerous waves for people not in its path. Authorities did not immediately attribute any deaths or injuries directly to Alberto. But in North Carolina, a television news anchor and a photojournalist were killed Monday when a tree that had been uprooted from rain-soaked ground toppled on their SUV as they reported on severe weather on the fringes of the huge system. That was hundreds of miles from Alberto’s center and more rain is on the way. Between four and eight inches of rain could soak the Florida Panhandle, Alabama, and western Georgia before the storm moves on. Isolated deluges of 12 inches also are possible in spots as the system heads toward the Tennessee Valley on Tuesday and later this week into the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region. Earlier Monday, Alberto rolled up big waves and tides along beaches of the northern Gulf Coast. Lifeguards posted red flags along the white sands of Pensacola Beach, where swimming and wading were banned as Alberto disrupted long holiday weekend plans for millions. The storm also forced some Memorial Day tributes to be cancelled across Florida’s Panhandle. Safety was the priority, but the decision was still a “heartbreaker,” said Tom Rice, a 29-year-old Army veteran who had helped with planning for a ceremony at Beal Memorial Cemetery in Fort Walton Beach. Some stragglers still made their way through the rain to pay tribute at the cemetery’s Veterans Tribute Tower, however. Rice said American flags had been placed Saturday on the graves of all 1,700 veterans buried in the cemetery. “We got the flags out,” Rice told the Northwest Florida Daily News as wind whipped a massive U.S. flag flying at half-staff. “That’s what’s important.” Along the Florida Panhandle, tourists vowed Alberto wouldn’t dampen their fun. Jason Powell sought to keep his children entertained with movies and TV, adding he hoped the sun would come out again after Alberto blew over. “So far we’ve seen a lot of wind and the ocean is really high, covering up the entire beach,” Powell remarked. Janet Rhumes said her group of friends from Kansas had been planning their Memorial Day weekend on Navarre Beach since October. They stocked up on groceries and settled in for card games. “We’ve never seen one before and we’re here celebrating a friend’s 20th birthday,” Rhumes told the Daily News. “So how often can you say you rode a storm out?” As Alberto’s weakening center heads inland it is being deprived of the warm waters that fuel tropical weather systems. As a subtropical storm, Alberto had a less defined and cooler center than a tropical storm, and its strongest winds were found farther from its center. Some of the rain bands spread hundreds of miles away from the center. Elsewhere, the North Carolina Highway Patrol said, a large tree toppled on a news television vehicle Monday near Tryon, North Carolina. WYFF-TV of Greenville, South Carolina, said a news anchor, Mike McCormick, and photojournalist, Aaron Smeltzer, with that station were both killed. McCormick and Smeltzer had just interviewed Tryon Fire Chief Geoffrey Tennant as they covered storms in North Carolina. “Ten minutes later we get the call and it was them,” Tennant said at a news conference, his voice cracking. Tennant did not directly blame the up to 2 inches of rain that fell Monday from the fringes of Alberto for the deaths. He said the roots of a large tree that toppled on the vehicle came loose from ground saturated by a week’s worth of earlier rain. The men died instantly, their TV vehicle’s engine still running, Tennant said.",A flood threat continues in the aftermath of the storm’s landfall in Florida,2018-05-29T09:48:31Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Alberto Downgraded to a Depression, But Heavy Rains Are Still to Come",http://time.com/5293644/alberto-storm-downgraded-depression/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/800-41.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,landfall,1

Hillary Leung,"A major cyclone the equivalent of a strong Category 2 hurricane approached the coast of Mozambique late Thursday, prompting residents to brace for what weather authorities have called a likely “worst case scenario.”
Cyclone Idai was forecast to make landfall just south of Beira, the nation’s fourth-largest city with a population of half a million, late Thursday night. It is now carrying sustained 110 mph winds gusting to above 130 mph, according to the Washington Post.
Flooding from Idai’s path inland has already killed 122 people in Mozambique and Malawi, making it the deadliest weather disaster this year.
The landfall will pose further threat to the African country, with authorities saying it could bring a “life-threatening” storm surge of up to 13 feet along Mozambique’s coastline, and close to 20 feet at the mouth of the Pungwe river, which runs to Zimbabwe. The surge could submerge thousands of homes and businesses, and potentially displace more than 1,000 residents, the Post reports.
Mozambique ranks third among countries in Africa most susceptible to weather-related hazards, according to the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. In 2015, Cyclone Chedza killed 140, and in 2000, Tropical Cyclone Eline left 350 dead and 650,000 homeless across southern Africa. Cyclone Idai is predicted to be the strongest to make landfall in Mozambique since Eline.
Mozambican authorities have issued a red alert regarding Tropical Cyclone Idai and humanitarian response is ongoing in Malawi and Mozambique. The government, with support from local and international partners, is providing assistance to people already displaced by floods, but access is being impeded by road damage, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

"RICHARD FAUSSET, ALAN BLINDER and PATRICIA MAZZEI","But the storm intensified far more than unexpected overnight, and by sunrise on Wednesday, the winds had reached 140 miles per hour. Later they were even higher, reaching 155 miles per hour just two miles per hour short of Category 5 strength by landfall. The shear was high, so nobody expected it was going to intensify this rapidly, said Haiyan Jiang, an associate professor at Florida International University who studies tropical cyclones. The storm was the first major hurricane a storm with winds of at least 111 miles per hour to make landfall in the continental United States since Hurricane Irma last year. That storm, which struck a different part of Florida, caused an estimated $50 billion in damage and was cited in 92 deaths.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Heavy rain, gusting winds and rising floodwaters from Hurricane Florence deluged the Carolinas on Thursday as the massive, slow-moving storm crept toward the coastline, threatening millions of people in its path with record rainfall and punishing surf. Florence, downgraded to a Category 2 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale and moving west at only 5 miles per hour (8 kph), remained huge, unpredictable and potentially deadly ahead of its forecast landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina, at mid-day on Friday. For graphic, click: tmsnrt.rs/2p5XM5i North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference that the “historic” hurricane would unleash rains and floods that would inundate almost the entire state in several feet of water. The sheer size of the storm meant it could batter the U.S. East Coast with hurricane-force winds for nearly a full day, according to weather forecasters. North Carolina will see the equivalent of up to eight months of rain in a two- to three-day period, National Weather Service forecaster Brandon Locklear said in a video briefing. North Carolinians made last-minute preparations and hunkered down to await Florence’s arrival. In downtown Wilmington, a few hearty locals gathered at Cape Fear Wine and Beer pub. “We lost power at home so we figured we should come to the bar,” said Carla Mahaffee, a 33-year-old actor from Wilmington, as she drank a cider. “We’ve prepared all our supplies at home and frankly, we were bored.” Holly Waters, a retired special education teacher from Wilmington, said she was happy to have a place to go to relax before the storm worsened. “It’s not the middle of a hurricane yet, so why not come for a beer?” said Waters, 54. Elsewhere in Wilmington, Linda Smith, a 67-year-old retired nonprofit director, was concerned as she watched wind gusts stir up frothy white caps on the Cape Fear River. “We’re a little worried about the storm surge so we came down to see what the river is doing now,” Smith said. “I am frightened about what’s coming. We just want prayers from everyone.” ROADS FLOODED, POWER OUT At least 88,000 people were without power in North Carolina with the brunt of the storm yet to come, according to the state’s emergency management agency. Millions of people were expected to lose power from the storm and restoration could take weeks. Roads and intersections on North Carolina’s Outer Banks barrier islands were already inundated with water. Florence’s top winds were clocked on Thursday at 100 miles per hour (170 km per hour) as it churned in the Atlantic Ocean, down from a peak of 140 mph (224 kph) earlier this week when it was classified a Category 4 storm. The storm’s center was about 85 miles east-southeast of Wilmington at around 8 p.m. EST. About 10 million people could be affected by the storm and more than 1 million had been ordered to evacuate the coasts of the Carolinas and Virginia, jamming westbound roads and highways for miles. At least 12,000 people had taken refuge in 126 emergency shelters, Cooper said, with more facilities being opened. The National Hurricane Center warned the threat of tornadoes was increasing as Florence neared shore and South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said the heavy rains could trigger landslides in the western part of his state. NHC Director Ken Graham said on Facebook the storm surges could push in as far as 2 miles (3 km). Heavy rains were forecast to extend into the Appalachian Mountains, affecting parts of Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia. Emergency declarations were in force in Georgia, South and North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Despite pleas from officials, some residents rejected calls to evacuate. Near the beach in Wilmington, a Waffle House restaurant, part of a chain with a reputation for staying open during disasters, had no plans to close, even if power is lost, and on Thursday evening there were lines to get in. Will Epperson, a 36-year-old golf course assistant superintendent, said he and his wife had planned to ride out the storm at their home in Hampstead, North Carolina, but then reconsidered. Instead, they drove 150 miles (240 km) inland to his mother’s house in Durham. “I’ve never been one to leave for a storm but this one kind of had me spooked,” Epperson said.

Tamara Lush and Rebecca Santana / AP,"(ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.) — Subtropical Storm Alberto gained the early jump on the 2018 hurricane season as it headed toward anticipated landfall sometime Monday on the northern Gulf Coast, where white sandy beaches emptied of their usual Memorial Day crowds. Though the Atlantic hurricane season doesn’t officially start until Friday, Alberto has become the first named storm this year, throwing disarray into long holiday weekend plans up and down Florida’s Gulf Coast. And just as Memorial Day marked summer’s unofficial start in the U.S., Alberto gave it the unofficial start of what forecasters recently predicted would be an active hurricane season. At 11 p.m. EDT Sunday, Alberto was centered about 205 miles west of Tampa and had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph — up from 50 mph only hours earlier. Forecasters said Alberto has most recently taken a northwesterly course at 9 mph that was expected to bring it over the northern Gulf Coast in coming hours on or near the Florida Panhandle. “On the forecast track, the center of Alberto will move over the northern Gulf of Mexico overnight and cross the northern Gulf Coast in the warning area on Monday,” the National Hurricane Center said. It warned of life-threatening surf conditions, the possibility of a few brief tornadoes in much of Florida and parts of Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama. And, it said, heavy rains are also expected in many areas. Lifeguards posted red flags along the white sands of Pensacola Beach, where swimming and wading were banned amid high surf and dangerous conditions. Gusty showers were to begin lashing parts of Florida on Sunday, and authorities were warning of the possibility of flash flooding. The hurricane center said a tropical storm warning was in effect from the Suwannee River in Florida to the Mississippi-Alabama state line. The storm’s approach also triggered mandatory evacuations of some small, sparsely populated Gulf Coast barrier islands in one Florida county. The Florida Division of Emergency Management said in a statement Sunday that a mandatory evacuation has been issued in Franklin County for all barrier islands there and those in the county living directly on the coast in mobile homes or in recreation vehicle parks. A subtropical storm like Alberto has a less defined and cooler center than a tropical storm, and its strongest winds are found farther from its center. Subtropical storms can develop into tropical storms, which in turn can strengthen into hurricanes. Forecasters cautioned that heavy rain and tropical storm conditions could reach the northern Gulf Coast well ahead of the center of Alberto making landfall. The storm prompted Florida, Alabama and Mississippi to launch emergency preparations over the weekend amid expectations Alberto would reach land sometime Monday. Rough conditions were expected to roil the seas off the eastern and northern Gulf Coast region through Tuesday. Mark Bowen, the Bay County Emergency management director, said at a Sunday afternoon news conference that the concern isn’t with storm surge due to the timing of landfall and the tides. He said Alberto’s biggest threat will be its heavy rains, with forecasts of anywhere from four to 12 inches of rain in some areas. In Taylor County, there were voluntary evacuations for those in coastal zones and beach communities, mobile homes, RV parks and low-lying areas. In Gulf County, T. H. Stone Memorial St. Joseph Peninsula State Park began evacuations Sunday morning. In Miami, organizers called off the sea portion of the Miami Beach Air &amp; Sea Show on Sunday because of heavy rain and rough waters. And in the Tampa Bay area on the central Gulf Coast, cities offered sandbags for homeowners worried about floods. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a hurricane season forecast Thursday that calls for 10 to 16 named storms, with five to nine hurricanes. One to four hurricanes could be “major” with sustained winds of at least 111 mph. If that forecast holds, it would make for a near-normal or above-normal season. An average hurricane season produces 12 named storms, of which six become hurricanes, including three major hurricanes. “There are no strong climate signals saying it’s going to be extremely active, like last year, or extremely weak,” said Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, speaker with reporters Thursday.",The storm is expected to make landfall Monday,2018-05-28T04:38:18Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Subtropical Storm Alberto Gains Strength as It Nears the Northern Gulf Coast,http://time.com/5292933/storm-alberto-gains-strength-gulf-coast/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gettyimages-962479016.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,landfall,1

Anticipated to make landfall on Monday, Alberto is the first storm ahead of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, which formally starts on 1 June. It will bring heavy rain and winds of 100kmh (65mph) across southern states, the US National Hurricane Center said. It was centred about 185km (115 miles) south-west of Florida's Panama City, at 01:00 CET (6:00GMT). Alberto had picked up strength as it headed north through the Gulf of Mexico, bringing with it the warning of life-threatening inundation, said the Miami-based hurricane centre. It is forecast to drop as much as 30cm (12in) of rain across Mississippi to western Georgia and to bring storm swells of about 60-120cm (2-4ft) to low-lying areas. Alberto comes during the Memorial Day weekend, and is expected to affect travel on Monday, when many people will return from their holidays. It is the first named storm of the season, with 21 other names still to be used, including Beryl, Ernesto, Kirk, Nadine and Rafael. Last year, a number of deadly hurricanes hit the US and Caribbean.

THOMAS KAPLAN,"Photo Damage from Hurricane Maria in Utuado, Puerto Rico, was still visible last week. The storm made landfall on Sept. 20. Credit Alvin Baez/Reuters WASHINGTON — The White House asked Congress on Friday for $44 billion in additional relief from this year’s devastating hurricanes but urged lawmakers to make spending cuts to offset disaster costs that are now approaching $100 billion. The White House request for more disaster relief after the hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, set up a possible confrontation over whether Congress must to find spending cuts to pay for relief even as President Trump pushes for as much as $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over a decade. White House officials suggested a raft of cuts to pay for the relief, including $730 million from the Army Corps of Engineers’ operations, maintenance, flood control and coastal emergencies funds, $196 million from the Department of Agriculture’s rural economic development program, and $72 million from the Agriculture Department’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The State Department’s Democracy Fund would lose $99 million and the Department of Transportation highway aid to states would lose $1 billion. Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, immediately rebuked the White House over its requests to offset the funding. “Just one day after pushing the House to pass a massive tax cut for corporations and the wealthy that would add $1.5 trillion to the debt, it is galling that the administration is requesting offsets in exchange for helping Americans rebuild their lives,” Ms. Lowey said in a statement. “Holding vital recovery funding hostage to unrelated and often divisive spending debates is wrong, and only delays fulfillment of our obligation to help disaster victims.” Republicans have been conspicuously quiet about their concerns over adding to the ballooning national debt.

Reuters Editorial,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Seven refineries in eastern Louisiana plan to continue normal operations while keeping a careful eye on Tropical Storm Gordon, whose forecast path moved eastward on Tuesday with landfall in Mississippi, said sources familiar with plant operations. Being west of the storm, the refineries should be on the side of Gordon producing the least rain and wind, though all of the plants have prepared for high wind and possible flooding. At PBF Energy’s 190,000 bpd Chalmette, Louisiana, refinery, which is 72 miles (116 km) west of Biloxi, Mississippi, where Gordon is forecast to make landfall, scaffolding erected for planned maintenance has been removed until the storm ends, sources familiar with plant operations said. No change in operations were planned at the Chalmette refinery, the sources said. A PBF spokesman declined to discuss operations at the plant. The Valero Energy Corp 125,000 bpd plant in Meraux, Louisiana, also plans to keep running as usual overnight and into Wednesday. “Business as usual,” said a source familiar with plant operations at the Meraux refinery. A Valero spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment about operations at Meraux. Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s refineries in Convent and Norco, Louisiana, are prepared for high wind and rain, a company spokesman said. Operations at the 502,500 bpd Exxon Mobil Corp refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were normal on Tuesday, said Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Nordin. The company has activated its storm preparedness plan for the refinery and adjoining chemical plant, Nordin said. Production is expected to continue normally overnight and into Wednesday at the Baton Rouge complex, said sources familiar with plant operations. Phillips 66’s 247,000 bpd refinery in Alliance, Louisiana, was operating normally on Tuesday, a company spokesman said.

Kathy Finn,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Gordon weakened after making landfall just west of the Alabama-Mississippi border and lashing the U.S. Gulf Coast with high winds and heavy rain early on Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Gordon was about 40 miles (70 km) west of Mobile, Alabama and was packing maximum sustained winds of 70 miles per hour, it said. As of early Wednesday morning, the storm had not reached 74 mph winds, the minimum to become a hurricane, and was weakening as it moved inland. The storm was expected to become a tropical depression later in the day, the NHC said. Hurricane and storm surge warnings and watches were in effect across the region, the NHC said. Though the Louisiana coast remained calm as of early Tuesday evening, Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency and companies cut 9 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production. “I’m asking all residents to do their part in getting ready for this storm,” New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said in a statement. “The city’s absolute No.1 priority is to ensure the safety of our residents.” Tropical-storm force winds were already lashing the Alabama and western Florida panhandle coastlines and some areas still recovering from last year’s storms could see 12 inches (30 cm) of rain. Beaches around Mobile, Alabama were washed by storm-driven waves, said Stephen Miller, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service. “We’re expecting an increase in winds,” Miller said in a telephone interview. “We could see flooding.” Sea levels could rise as much as 5 feet (1.5 m) from Shell Beach, Louisiana, to Dauphin Island, Alabama, forecasters said. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency told South Mississippi residents to be prepared to evacuate. EVACUATIONS At LaFrance Marina near Ansley, Mississippi, a mile north of Heron Bay on the Gulf of Mexico, marina owner Sue Cates said that a tidal surge is sure to push water into the marina’s low-lying campgrounds, making evacuation “the only choice” people have to protect themselves. Nevertheless, she said she and her husband will remain in their home, which sits on tall pilings, 24 feet above ground. Built after Hurricane Katrina, the home is made to withstand a 150 mile-an-hour wind, she said. “We’re way up here, and I think we’ll be OK,” Cates said. “People around here are well-trained for this sort of thing.” U.S. oil producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp evacuated workers and shut production at two offshore oil platforms on Monday, and other companies with production and refining operations along the Gulf Coast said they were securing facilities. The Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of U.S. crude oil and 5 percent of natural gas output daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The U.S. Coast Guard said the ports of New Orleans and Gulfport and Pascagoula, Mississippi, may have to close within 48 hours. Last year, hurricanes hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, causing widespread destruction and thousands of deaths. The Inn at Ocean Springs and the Roost Hotel in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, had guests planning to ride out the storm, said Kristin Smith, general manager of both hotels. “A lot of guests are real comfortable sticking it out in our rooms,” Smith said in a telephone interview. “Any of our guests who feel like they want to go home we encourage them to follow their instincts.” Reporting by Kathy Finn in NEW ORLEANS; Additional reporting by Gina Cherelus in NEW YORK, Brendan O'Brien in MILWAUKEE, Scott Malone in BOSTON and Dan Whitcomb in LOS ANGELES; Editing by Toni Reinhold, Lisa Shumaker and Darren Schuettler","Tropical Storm Gordon weakened after making landfall just west of the Alabama-Mississippi border and lashing the U.S. Gulf Coast with high winds and heavy rain early on Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.",2018-09-05T08:50:02Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}","Storm Gordon hits near Alabama-Mississippi border, seen weakening",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-gordon/storm-gordon-hits-near-alabama-mississippi-border-seen-weakening-idUSKCN1LL0W6,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180905&t=2&i=1300894946&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEE840HM,reuters,Reuters,landfall,1
"Jay Croft, CNN","How are you preparing for Hurricane Florence? Text, iMessage or WhatsApp your videos, photos and stories to CNN: 347-322-0415 (CNN) Forecasts generally have Wilmington, North Carolina, as the city most likely to bear the brunt of powerful Hurricane Florence as it makes landfall. But no matter where the monster storm ultimately crosses the southern East Coast of the US, Florence's high winds and heavy rains will hit communities for miles north, south -- and even west. Damaging effects from the storm are expected to be felt far inland, particularly as it's projected to stall once it crosses the coastline. A big worry with Florence is that the system could linger for days, similar to the manner in whch Harvey hovered over Texas last year. That means high rainfall totals and consequent inland flooding could become a huge concern. The current forecast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration calls for more than 20 inches of rain where the storm makes landfall. But more than 10 inches is forecast for a larger area, including most of eastern North Carolina inland to just north of Richmond, Virginia. A new National Hurricane Center map predicting the likelihood of tropical storm-force winds stretches from northern Florida to eastern Kentucky and Ohio, and even up to the New York City area -- although there's only a 5% to 10% chance of those conditions stretching that far north. Tropical storm force winds have sustained speeds of at least 39 mph. CNN's Judson Jones contributed to this report.","Forecasts generally have Wilmington, North Carolina, as the city most likely to bear the brunt of powerful Hurricane Florence as it makes landfall.

Bill Chappell,"Gordon is predicted to make landfall on the Mississippi coast late Tuesday, drenching a large swath of Gulf Coast states. National Weather Service Tropical Storm Gordon will likely strengthen into a hurricane before hitting the northern Gulf Coast Tuesday night, forecasters say, urging people along the coast from Louisiana to Florida to beware high winds and a dangerous storm surge. The eye of Gordon is heading toward an area around Gulfport, Miss., the National Hurricane Center said in its 5 a.m. ET update. When the storm arrives at the north-central Gulf Coast, it is expected to have strengthened into a low-level hurricane. Early Tuesday, Gordon was packing maximum sustained winds of 65 mph — short of the 74-mph threshold for a hurricane. A hurricane watch is in effect for the area from the Mississippi-Louisiana border to the Alabama-Florida border. When Gordon makes landfall, a storm surge of 3-5 feet is possible for all of coastal Mississippi and from Shell Beach in eastern Louisiana to Dauphin Island, Ala., the hurricane center says. ""The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves,"" according to NHC meteorologist Richard Pasch. The storm's turbulent center is expected to plow a path from the southwest corner of Alabama and central Mississippi into part of Louisiana and southern Arkansas. Early Tuesday, Gordon was moving west-northwest at 17 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. After it makes landfall, the storm is predicted to rapidly lose force. But forecasters warn that flash floods could be triggered by heavy rainfall from the western Florida Panhandle to Louisiana, with 4-8 inches predicted in many areas. Isolated areas could see up to 12 inches of rain, the weather service says. Gordon is expected to slow its forward motion as it nears the coast, possibly adding to its rainfall totals in the region.","When Gordon makes landfall, a storm surge of 3-5 feet is possible for all of coastal Mississippi and from eastern Louisiana to Dauphin Island, Ala., forecasters say.",2018-09-04T11:36:10Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Gordon Is Forecast To Hit Northern Gulf Coast As A Hurricane Tuesday Night,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/04/644460773/gordon-is-forecast-to-hit-northern-gulf-coast-as-a-hurricane-tuesday-night,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/09/04/gordon-track_wide-537747fd629c0f19bcd2d4eecc1feb0f5d5a85cc.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,landfall,1
MATTHEW HAAG and KAREN ZRAICK,"Besides those possible leads, Mr. Merritt said there might be a connection between Jazmines killing and the shooting of two people nearby a year and a half earlier. On Aug. 30, 2017, a white man in a pickup truck opened fire with an AR-15-style rifle at a car carrying AVonta Williams and his then-girlfriends family, according to the sheriffs office and Mr. Williamss mother.
No one was killed but a bullet traveled through Mr. Williamss legs, shattering both of them, his mother, Kisshima Williams, said in an interview on Wednesday. Another bullet was lodged in the stomach of his then-girlfriends grandmother.
After the sheriffs office faced criticism for not aggressively investigating the shooting, which occurred in the chaotic days after Hurricane Harvey made landfall, the authorities announced a renewed effort to identify the gunman. But no one has been arrested.
Sheriff Gonzalez said that investigators were looking into the 2017 case once again to see if we may have missed anything. He added that the previous shooting occurred about six miles from the site of the more recent attack, though the victim eventually drove to the area where the more recent one took place.
Ms. Williams said that another son read about Jazmines killing on Sunday and immediately called her to point out the similarities between the two cases.
It has to be the same person, Ms. Williams said. Its too similar.
She said that AVonta, who is now 22, did not want to talk about the shooting but that he also believed the cases were connected.
I talked to him last night, and its rough for him because hes a young man, she said.

ABS-CBN News,"MANILA - Hundreds of families were evacuated Monday night as tropical depression Chedeng roared closer to landfall over Davao Occidental.
Almost 500 families in Malita town in Chedeng's path took shelter in evacuation centers, many of them in schools.
State weather bureau PAGASA said Chedeng, the third tropical cyclone to enter the country this year, is expected to hit land early Tuesday.
In its 5 a.m. bulletin, Chedeng was last spotted 105 kilometers east of General Santos City, packing maximum sustained winds of 45 kilometers per hour (kph), with gusts of up to 60 kph. It is moving west-southwest at a speed of 15 kph.
Tropical cyclone warning signal no. 1 remains hoisted over the following areas, which could be whipped by winds of up to 30 to 60 kph in at least 36 hours:
-Compostela Valley-Davao City-Davao del Sur-Davao Occidental-Davao Oriental-eastern portion of North Cotabato-eastern portion of South Cotabato-eastern portion of Sarangani-eastern portion of Sultan Kudarat-General Santos City-southern portion of Davao del Norte, including Samal Island
PAGASA said Chedeng is expected to weaken into a low-pressure area (LPA) after landfall, but would still dump moderate to heavy rains over most of Mindanao.
Those with small sea crafts are advised not to venture out over the eastern seaboards of the Visayas and Mindanao.
Classes were suspended Tuesday in parts of Mindanao due to rains from the tropical depression.

Cyclone Owen is moving slowly over waters off the Northern Territory with winds of up to 200km/h (124 mph), meteorologists said. It is expected to intensify into a category four system before making landfall sometime early on Saturday local time (late on Friday GMT). Residents have been urged to stay safe. Forecasters predict the cyclone will travel from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Queensland's east coast, bringing destructive winds inland for hundreds of kilometres.

Parts of the state were likely to receive up to 400mm of rain in coming days, Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said. Authorities warned that flash-flooding and storm surges were also expected, urging residents to secure items and stay indoors. The cyclone is forecast to be downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves inland, but could redevelop into a cyclone on Monday.

 The storm had earlier caused destruction in Mozambique
A tropical storm has swept away bridges and homes in eastern Zimbabwe, killing at least 24 people, officials say.
Cyclone Idai cut off power and communications in parts of Manicaland province on the border with Mozambique. Some 40 people are missing.
People fled from their homes to the slopes of mountain and were waiting to be rescued, but strong winds have hampered helicopter flights.
In Mozambique, where Idai made landfall on Thursday, at least 19 people died.
Flooding across the rest of the country had already killed nearly 70 people before the storm's arrival.
Zimbabwe's information ministry said the town of Chimanimani had been cut from the rest of Manicaland province. The country's national army was leading the rescue efforts, it added.
The death toll was expected to rise as authorities continued to assess the situation.
Jacob Mafume, a spokesman for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, said a ""serious humanitarian crisis [was] unfolding"" in the east of the country.
The cyclone hit Mozambique with winds of up to 177km/h (106 mph). It cut off more than 500,000 residents in the port city of Beira, one the country's largest cities. Roads were flooded and the airport was shut down.
Mozambique has been struck by severe cyclones in the past, including Eline in 2000, when 350 people died and 650,000 were displaced across the wider region.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Less than a month after facing down Florence, the U.S. faces another historic storm. Hurricane Michael is churning its way toward Floridas Panhandle as a Category 4 monster. As of 7 a.m. on Wednesday, the storms winds were roaring at a sustained 145 mph with gusts higher, according to data gathered by Hurricane Hunter aircraft. Michael was 90 miles offshore from Panama Beach and is expected to make landfall late morning or early afternoon. The threats will be manifold, but among the most dangerous will be up to 14 feet of storm surge for large parts of the coast. Florida is no stranger to hurricanes, but there has never been a storm like Michael to hit this part of the state. Atmospheric scientist Phil Klotzbach tweeted that Michaels 933 millibar central pressurea key meteorological measure of intensity where lower generally means strongeris the seventh lowest of any storm ever to reach Florida. The list of storms with lower pressures is an ignominious one, including last years Irma, Andrew in 1992, and the Lake Okeechobee and Great Miami hurricanes that decimated the state in the 1920s. This is not the type of company you want to keep. The National Weather Service Tallahassee office issued a stark graphic and warning late last night to underscore what the region is facing. The statement in part reads: We searched the historical database for category 4 hurricanes that have made landfall in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend. The map says it allits BLANK this situation has NEVER happened before... If you have been told to evacuate, LEAVE. Do not stay and risk your life or that of your family. Tropical storm-force winds have already been recorded at Apalachicola Regional Airport and rain bands are spiraling ashore. Conditions will deteriorate quickly over the coming hours. Florida Governor Rick Scott has announced that for those who didnt or couldnt afford to evacuate, the window to get out of Michaels way has closed.

Leigh Morgan,"Subtropical Storm Alberto moved farther into the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday as tropical storm warnings went up for part of the Gulf Coast and heavy rainfall spread northward over the Florida peninsula. Forecasters again adjusted the forecast track slightly to the east on Saturday night while stressing that Alberto's worst effects could be felt far from where its center makes landfall. The hurricane center also adjusted the timeline again, suggesting landfall in northwest Florida could come on Monday evening instead of early Tuesday morning. After landfall Alberto is forecast to move slightly to the northwest, which could bring the center of the weakening system through Alabama. A tropical storm warning is in effect for the northern Gulf Coast from the Aucilla River westward to the Mississippi/Alabama border. A tropical storm warning is in place for the west coast of the Florida peninsula from Bonita Beach to the Anclote River. A tropical storm warning also continued for the Dry Tortugas in the Florida Keys. Storm surge watches were also in effect from Florida's Crystal River to the Mississippi/Alabama border. Alberto could get a bit stronger before landfall, though it is not expected to become a hurricane. Alberto latest beach conditions: Updates for Gulf Shores, Panama City As of 10 p.m. CDT Saturday Alberto was located about 400 miles south of Apalachicola, Fla., and was moving north-northeast at 13 mph. Forecasters said that Alberto's center reformed a little to the northeast on Saturday night. The storm is forecast to turn toward the north later tonight, and a track to the north-northwest is expected Sunday through Monday night. The hurricane center thinks Alberto should move generally northward for the next 12 hours, ""although some additional eastward reformation of the center remains possible,"" forecasters said. Alberto is forecast to make landfall somewhere along the northern Gulf Coast by Monday. However, heavy rain and tropical storm conditions will likely reach the northern Gulf Coast well before the arrival of the center of Alberto, according to the hurricane center. Forecasters stressed not to focus solely on the exact point of landfall because many of the storm's affects will be felt far away from that point. Alberto is a not a fully tropical storm and much of its worst weather is displaced from its center on its east side. Alberto was still a minimal tropical storm as of Saturday with winds of 40 mph. The hurricane center said gradual strengthening will be possible until landfall. Forecasters had noted on Friday that Alberto had the potential to become a hurricane but dialed that back on Saturday, saying models were trending away from that scenario. Instead Alberto could be a stronger tropical storm near the time of landfall with sustained winds up to 65 mph. Storm surge flooding along the coast could reach 2-4 feet from Alberto, according to the hurricane center. Alabama hurricanes: Biggest, strongest, most surge Forecasters were also very concerned about the rainfall potential with Alberto. The storm has the potential to drop 10-15 inches of rain on western Cuba and 3-7 inches across the Florida Keys. Forecasters in Alabama were getting prepared for a ""multitude of impacts"" from Alberto starting this weekend. Up to a foot of rain will be possible for areas near the coast in Alabama and northwest Florida, where many are vacationing for the Memorial Day weekend. The National Weather Service has expanded flash flood watches for south Alabama and said the rain could begin as soon as tonight and last through Tuesday. The weather service said storm surge could become an issue as soon as this evening and last into Tuesday. However the maximum water rise looks to be on Sunday night into Monday night. There is a high risk of rip currents in place this weekend as well as high surf and coastal flooding advisories. The weather service is particularly concerned about rip currents, which are south Alabama's deadliest weather hazard. Forecasters stressed that the water will be dangerous for all levels of swimmers through Tuesday. The weather service said tropical storm force winds will likely impact coastal Alabama and northwest Florida late Sunday into Monday. Forecasters will also be monitoring the potential for severe storms and tornadoes, which could become an issue as Alberto moves closer to the coast on Sunday and Monday.",AL.com Alberto's track continues to shift eastward on path to Gulf Coast AL.com Subtropical Storm Alberto moved farther into the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday as tropical storm warnings went up for part of the Gulf Coast and heavy rainfall spread northward over …,2018-05-27T03:16:15Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Al.com'}",Alberto's track continues to shift eastward on path to Gulf Coast - AL.com,http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/05/albertos_track_still_puts_gulf.html,https://expo.advance.net/img/a62d5154f2/width960/ab3_0257413dayconewithlineandwind.png,,Al.com,landfall,1
Gina Cherelus,"(Reuters) - Florida’s governor mobilized National Guard troops and ordered Gulf Coast residents to head inland or evacuate as Hurricane Michael churned toward shore on Monday, with the storm forecast to strengthen rapidly before making landfall on Wednesday. Michael was expected to strengthen to a major Category 3 storm by Tuesday with winds over 100 miles per hour (160 km per hour), making it one of the most powerful storms to hit the Panhandle of Florida in decades, state officials said. The storm was expected to bring up to 12 inches (30 cm) of rain with storm surges up to 12 feet (3.7 meters), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC). Michael was currently a Category 1 hurricane, at the bottom of the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in 26 counties along the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend. Locally ordered evacuations of thousands of homes have begun, with 1,250 National Guard soldiers aiding the process and over 4,000 troops on standby, Scott tweeted. “The FL panhandle needs to be prepared for a direct hit with sustained hurricane force winds,” Scott wrote on Twitter on Monday. “Hurricane Michael is forecast to be a Category 3 storm when it makes landfall and the impact could be devastating. Get prepared NOW.” The NHC said in a tweet that a “life-threatening” storm surge and flash flooding is likely in areas of the Florida Panhandle and described the storm as “dangerous”. KILLS 13 IN CENTRAL AMERICA As the storm moved north it battered Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba with drenching rains and winds of up to 80 mph (130 kph), forecasters said. Heavy rains at the weekend caused 13 deaths in Central America after Michael formed off the coast of northern Honduras. In Florida, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who is also the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in the Nov. 6 election, canceled campaign events and returned to Tallahassee, the state capital, to focus on storm preparations. Florida State University said its campuses in Tallahassee and Panama City would be closed from Tuesday through Friday. Mandatory evacuation orders were issued on Monday for residents in Florida’s Gulf and Bay counties, according to a statement from emergency officials. Jeff Hanson, the owner of Paisley Cafe in Tallahassee, said he was waiting until Wednesday morning to decide whether he would close the restaurant. “It depends on what the city says in terms of the people getting around. That’s our biggest concern, if our staff is safe,” Hanson said by telephone. OIL PRODUCTION After hitting Florida, the storm is forecast to move northeast on Wednesday and Thursday along the Atlantic Coast and batter the Carolinas, which are still recovering from Hurricane Florence last month. Energy companies halted nearly a fifth of Gulf of Mexico oil production and evacuated staff from 10 platforms on Monday as Michael was forecast to become the strongest of three named storms to affect the U.S. Gulf of Mexico this year. Exxon Mobil Corp, BP Plc, BHP Billiton Ltd and Equinor ASA each pulled staff from production platforms and others were monitoring conditions. The Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of daily U.S. crude oil output and 5 percent of daily natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

DANIEL VICTOR,"Hawaii is bracing for possible landfall from Hurricane Lane, a Category 4 storm that forecasters are warning could bring whipping winds, flooding and high surf. Tropical storm-force winds could arrive on the Big Island by Wednesday afternoon local time, with hurricane-force winds to follow soon afterward, said Gavin Shigesato, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The storm would then continue north toward Maui and Oahu around Thursday morning, he said. As of 5 p.m. Tuesday in Hawaii, the storm, packing 155 mile-per-hour winds, was moving west-northwest toward Hawaii at about 9 m.p.h., he said. Hurricane-force winds were extending about 40 miles from the center. “It’s still a very strong storm,” Mr. Shigesato said. Mountainous areas could be particularly prone to flooding, and the southern shores could experience damaging surf levels, with more than 20 inches of rain possible. There is danger of tornadoes and large waterspouts, and the National Weather Service warned residents to prepare for considerable property damage, saying some locations “may be uninhabitable for weeks.”","Brianna Sugimura loading supplies into her car in Lihue, on the island of Kauai, Hawaii, in preparation for Hurricane Lane, which may hit the archipelago later this week.",2018-08-22T04:06:06Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Hurricane Lane, a Category 4 Storm, Closes In on Hawaii",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/us/hurricane-lane-hawaii.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/us/22hawaii_xp/22hawaii_xp-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,landfall,1
Gina Martinez,"Hurricanes are slowing down – and leaving behind a lot more damage when they make landfall, according to a new study. The study, published in the journal Nature, found that since 1949, tropical cyclones have decreased their speed by an average of 10% worldwide. The change is even more dramatic in storms that have made landfall from the North Atlantic – they’re moving 20 percent slower. The result is more rainfall and more damage to buildings as hurricanes hover over population centers for longer periods of time. “The unprecedented rainfall totals associated with the ‘stall’ of Hurricane Harvey over Texas in 2017 provide a notable example of the relationship between regional rainfall” and hurricane speed, wrote the study’s author, James P. Kossin of the NOAA’s Center for Weather and Climate in Madison, Wisconsin. Hurricane Harvey lingered over south Texas for more than a week last September, dumping up to 60 inches of rain that left most of Houston underwater and resulted in 93 deaths. Kossin argues that the slow-down is caused by global warming, which is both increasing rainfall and decreasing wind currents. Kossin told Nature that a 10% slow-down in storm speed corresponds to a 10% increase in rainfall when a hurricane makes landfall.",Hurricane Harvey is a devastating example of the trend,2018-06-06T20:11:34Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Hurricanes Are Slowing Down and Leaving More Damage When They Hit Land,http://time.com/5303486/hurricanes-slowing-down-study/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/hurricane-harvey-houston.jpeg?quality=85,time,Time,landfall,1

The storm is expected to reach category three strength before it makes landfall on Wednesday. Forecasters say some regions may see 12in (30cm) of rain, and storm surges of up to 12ft (3.6m). Governor Rick Scott warned residents to get out of the way, saying on Tuesday: ""This is a monstrous storm"". Is it expected to crawl up the US East Coast after making landfall in the Gulf Coast, and could bring rains to the Carolinas, which were drenched by Hurricane Florence last month. The US National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, warned on Tuesday that warm waters will probably further strengthen Michael before it makes landfall. Over 300 miles of coastline are currently under threat, the National Weather Service has cautioned. The agency warned residents in Florida and Alabama of the risk of storm surges, damaging winds and flash flooding. Gov Scott warned in a news conference that Hurricane Michael is a ""massive storm that could bring total devastation to parts of our state, especially in the panhandle"". He added that its predicted to be ""the most destructive storm to hit the Florida panhandle in decades"". Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.

Megan Molteni,"For the last two days, a colossal, coursing stream of super-soaked subtropical air has been pummeling California with record-shattering amounts of moisture. On Wednesday, parts of northern California received more snow in a day than New England cities like Boston have seen all winter. On Thursday, Palm Springs got eight months worth of rain in as many hours. In San Diego and Los Angeles, brown water thick with desert dust flooded streets, triggered mudslides, and opened up sinkholes.
The 300-mile-wide, 1,000-mile-long atmospheric river that carried all this precipitation is starting to dry up, and the worst of the drench-fest is over. But all the new rainfall records highlight the fact that atmospheric rivers, while long a distinctive feature of weather in the American West, are intensifying in a climate-changed world.
Data from NOAA satellites shows an atmospheric river pummeling the California coast.
If you havent heard the phrase atmospheric river before, dont feel too bad. Its a meteorological term of art that hasnt yet cracked the pop cultural lexicon, unlike some of its flashier cousinsthe polar vortex, bomb cyclone, and fire clouds, to name a few. Even the American Meteorological Society only added a definition for atmospheric river to its glossary last year.
The phenomenon itself isnt a new one: For a long time its been pretty normal for California to receive most of its yearly precipitation in just a few big storms. Most of those multi-day deluges are the product of atmospheric rivers, high-altitude streams of air that originate near the Equator and are packed with water vapor. But its only been in the last decade or so that scientists have learned enough about this type of weather system to tell the difference between the beneficial, run-of-the-mill storms that keep water reserves full and the disastrous ones that overwhelm dams, levees, and reservoirs, like the one that pummeled California this week. As that balancing act gets even tougher for the regions water managers, some scientists are making a push to put a number on those differences, in the same way you would a tornado or a hurricane.
Your typical weather forecast displays a symbola sun for sunny days, a cloud for cloudy days. But the rain cloud symbol doesnt really describe if its going to be a few showers or one of these more unusually substantial storms, says F. Marty Ralph, a research meteorologist at UC San Diegos Scripps Institution of Oceanography and director of its Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes. Hes been spearheading a multi-year effort to develop a five-category scale for diagnosing the strength of atmospheric rivers so that water managers, emergency personnel, and the general public can quickly get a grasp on just how destructive (or beneficial) the next storm will be.
Ralphs team unveiled their AR Cat scale earlier this month, in an article published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. The key feature it uses to assess the severity of such storms is the amount of water vapor flowing horizontally in the air. Called integrated vapor transport, or IVT, this number tells you how much fuel is feeding the system.
Its not an easy number to calculate. To do it well requires taking multiple wind and water vapor measurements across miles of atmosphere. In the same way that terrestrial rivers flow at different rates at different depths, the water vapor molecules in atmospheric rivers travel at different speeds in the air column. Adding them all up vertically gives you the true measure of how strong a storm really is. Ralphs team classifies storms as atmospheric rivers if theyre moving more than 250 kilograms of water per meter per second, ranging up from weak to moderate, strong, extreme, and exceptional.
But strength alone doesnt predict how dangerous a storm will be. Thats why the AR Cat scale combines a storms IVT with how long its expected to linger. Storms that blow through in fewer than 24 hours get downgraded by one category, whereas storms that last longer than 48 hours immediately get bumped up a notch. So an extreme storm could be either a Cat 3 (balance of beneficial and hazardous), Cat 4 (mostly hazardous), or Cat 5 (hazardous) depending on what it does once it makes landfall.
Thats because the longer a storm hovers over land, funneling many Mississippi Rivers worth of moisture into its watersheds, the more strain it puts on those systems. The most destructive hurricanes in recent memoryHarvey in Texas and Florence in North Carolinaproved so catastrophic because they stalled over land, inundating those areas with multiple days of intense rainfall. But the current hurricane scales, which are based on wind speed, dont take time into account. With atmospheric rivers we had the opportunity to bake those numbers in from the very beginning, says Ralph.
The AR Cat scale is, of course, only as reliable as the forecast model its built upon. And accurately predicting atmospheric rivers has long buggered meteorological researchers. Models built on satellite data regularly flub the location of landfall by 250 miles even when the storm is just three days out. Some of that data got a signal boost this week, as GOES-17, NOAAs next-generation satellite, became operational over the western part of the United States.
GOES-17s powerful new camera will fill in important gaps, especially over the Pacific Ocean, where coverage was previously sparse. It was like watching a black-and-white television, and now we have full HD, says Scott Rowe, a meteorologist with the National Weather Services Bay Area station. The new satellite also refreshes data at a much higher ratetaking a new image once every five minutes as opposed to every ten or 15. In special circumstances, NWS forecasters can request to crank it up one notch further. On Thursday, when Rowes office was busy trying to predict where the California storm would go next, GOES-17 was snapping and sending images once every minute.
But according to Ralph, the new satellites not a complete fix for atmospheric river forecasting, because high clouds can mask whats going on inside the storm. More fruitful are the regular reconnaissance missions Ralph has been coordinating for the last three years, sending US Air Force pilots in hurricane hunter airplanes to crisscross incoming streams of hot, wet air. At regular intervals they drop meteorological sensing devices known as dropsondes, which draw a more intimate portrait of eachs storms potential for precipitation.
Its all part of a broader effort to help stewards of the regions freshwater resources make better decisions about whether to keep water and risk a flooding event, or let it out ahead of the storm and risk it being a bust. The AR Cat scale, which Ralph says still needs some tuning to better articulate the risks and benefits of different kinds of storms, is aimed at making those decisions for reservoir operators as easy as one, two, three, four, five.
Knowing that a storm like the one that hit this week is a Cat 4 atmospheric river may not mean much to the average person just yet. Calibrating an arbitrary value to observed reality takes time and experience. But its a sign of the American Wests intensifying weather patterns that its residents need that language at all.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates that 75 percent of the island will have power by the end of January. According to their website, Unity March organizers are calling for more aid in rebuilding Puerto Rico, the permanent repeal of the Jones Act (which slows down recovery efforts), and the cancellation of Puerto Rico's more than $70 billion in debt.

Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. As of 5 a.m., the storm was about 125 miles south of Destin, Florida, and moving northwest at about 7 mph. Alberto is moving toward the Florida Panhandle on the satellite and radar on Monday morning. The current projected path shows it will make landfall near Pensacola around 1 p.m. Monday as a subtropical storm, with winds of 65 mph. A tropical storm warning is in effect from the Suwannee River, the unofficial start of the Florida Panhandle, west to the Mississippi/Alabama border. After making landfall in Florida, the storm will begin to significantly weaken as it tracks through Alabama and into the Tennessee Valley by Tuesday. The current track shows Alberto making landfall near Pensacola, Florida, on Monday. The biggest threat will be the heavy rainfall that could cause flash flooding well inland and away from the coast. The heaviest rain will fall along the Gulf Coast where more than a half a foot of rain could accumulate. Parts of Midwest could see more than 3 inches of rain as the remnants move through the area by Wednesday. Flash flooding is possible. Rainfall totals will be highest in the Southeast, but areas of the Midwest could also see over 3 inches. Midwest tornadoes possible Almost 140 damaging storm reports, including eight tornadoes, were made Sunday from the Midwest into the Rockies, where damage was reported to homes in Wyoming. On Monday, a huge area of severe weather is expected in the Plains. Tornadoes, damaging winds and hail are the biggest threats. Flash flooding is also possible. Strong winds, hail and tornadoes are possible in the Great Plains on Monday. Record heat hits central US Dozens of record highs fell across the Midwest and the Great Lakes over the weekend. The hottest temperature was in Madison, Minnesota, where it reached 102 degrees Sunday. More record temperatures could fall in the Midwest and Great Lakes on Monday. Chicago hit 97, the hottest temperature in the last five years, and the second-hottest temperature in May all-time. Milwaukee reached 95 degrees, the hottest May temperature ever, and Green Bay, Wisconsin, reached 97 degrees -- second-hottest temperature ever recorded in the month of May. Even hotter temperatures are forecast for some areas Monday -- with more records possible.","The season’s first named subtropical storm, Alberto, is nearing landfall by Pensacola, Florida, as it brings heavy rain from Florida to Georgia to the Carolinas.

Jeremy Berke,"A car drives through a road that's beginning to flood on September 4, 2018, in Dauphin Island, Alabama. AP Photo/Dan Anderson Tropical Storm Gordon made landfall Tuesday night, slamming into the Alabama-Mississippi border with heavy rains, a storm surge, and flooding. Coastal communities such as Dauphin Island in Alabama and Shell Beach, Mississippi were among the hardest hit. The National Hurricane Center issued a storm surge warning for those and other areas along the Mississippi and Alabama coastlines, and sea levels rose as much as five feet there on Tuesday night. Though Gordon weakened from a category 1 hurricane — which has a minimum wind speed of 74 miles per hour — to a tropical depression before it made landfall, the storm unfortunately still claimed the life of a young child when a tree fell on a mobile home in Pensacola, Florida, according to local officials. Had the storm remained a hurricane when it hit land, it would have been the first hurricane to make landfall in the US in the 2018 hurricane season. The storm is expected to continue lashing the region through Saturday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Some areas in the storm's track could see a total of over 12 inches of rain through the week.

"Aaron Kessler, CNN","(CNN) When a hurricane hits, people often focus too much on its category -- which only measures wind -- and not on the massive amounts of rain that accompany a storm. For days, federal and state emergency managers cautioned that Hurricane Florence's danger was primarily about rainfall and catastrophic flooding, as rivers overflowed throughout the Carolinas and into Virginia. Especially now that pockets of sunshine have broken out, and the rain is gone, it's easy to think the worst is over. But take a look: the map below shows gauges monitored by the National Weather Service that measure where rivers were flooding on Saturday, a day after Florence made landfall in North Carolina. That might not look too bad, all things considered, right? But take a look at how many more flooding events were recorded by Sunday night. And finally, here is what things looked like along the rivers as of Tuesday afternoon. Four days after Florence made landfall, 45 gauges now measure flooding along rivers throughout the region. And there could be more challenges ahead -- the Cape Fear River in North Carolina may not crest until later Tuesday or even Wednesday, where it could reach an estimated 61.5 feet near Fayetteville. In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster warned residents that the waters hadn't crested there either in many areas. He said with the wind and rain gone, the state's emergency resources are being marshaled to combat river flooding. ""We've had two threats. One is the hurricane with the wind and the water and the surge, and that part is over,"" McMaster said. ""But the second part, which has been predicted with great certainty, is the flooding, and we know it's coming."" CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","The storm may have lost strength, and the sun has come out in some areas. But flooding has gotten consistently worse in recent days, placing people, property and sensitive facilities at risk.",2018-09-18T23:13:35Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Flooding from Florence: Maps show why the worst is not behind us,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/18/us/florence-flooding-has-gotten-much-worse/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180918130752-01-cape-fear-river-0918-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,landfall,1
Christopher Carbone,"China’s out-of-control, defunct space station is hurtling toward Earth and currently expected to make landfall sometime in the next 24 hours. The 8.5-ton space lab, known as Tiangong-1, is likely to burn up upon re-entry, which is expected to happen about 37 miles above ground, so it only poses a small risk to people and property. However, the exact timing of when the craft, which is about the size of a school bus, will fall back to Earth is uncertain due to how quiet the sun has been. The European Space Agency says it will happen between today and early Monday, while the Chinese Space Agency extends the potential landfall window to Wednesday. A rogue Chinese space station that weighs 8.5 tons is hurtling toward Earth. (European Space Agency) According to Space.com, if the sun is active, its energy pushes more strongly against Earth’s atmosphere. The atmosphere then balloons and becomes denser at higher altitudes, and the density impacts the drag against Tiangong-1’s orbital speed. Most of the U.S. appeared to be outside the likely landfall area, but a senior member of Aerospace Corp. told Space.com that all predictions are subject to change based on new information. In this June 13, 2013, file image released by China's Xinhua News Agency, the Shenzhou-10 manned spacecraft is seen while conducting docking with the orbiting Tiangong-1 space module. (AP) Although the Chinese station has received intense media coverage, each year around 1,000 large objects such as lost satellites and rocket stages fall back to Earth. These numbers are projected to increase over the coming years as more and more satellites are placed into orbit. Experts say there is also an economic risk that Tiangong-1 could present to air traffic as it hurtles toward Earth. This undated file photo shows researchers installing China's first space station module Tiangong-1 at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China's Gansu Province prior to its launch on Sept. 29, 2011. (AP) “The problem here is less the probability for an aircraft to be directly hit by space debris (which is low, but not zero), but the difficulty to predict precisely the area of possible impacts and their exact time of occurrence, because of uncertainties resulting from variations of solar activity,” Dieter Isakeit, chair of the information and communication committee for the International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety, told Fox News in a statement. Air traffic controllers could take a more conservative approach, Isakeit says, and “totally close” large areas to air traffic for several hours if they don’t have more reliable data about where the station is headed. That type of closure has happened during other events, such as volcanic eruptions. In this June 18, 2012, file image released by China's Xinhua News Agency, Chinese astronauts, from left, Liu Wang, Liu Yang and Jing Haipeng wave while aboard the orbiting Tiangong-1 space station. (Xinhua News Agency/AP) The good news is that it’s very unlikely that anyone will be hit with debris from the rogue space station. CHINA'S TIANGONG-1 SPACE LAB SET TO FALL TO EARTH: WHAT TO EXPECT “When considering the worst-case location, the probability that a specific person will be struck by Tiangong-1 debris is about one million times smaller than the odds of winning the Powerball jackpot,” the nonprofit Aerospace Corporation told the Sun. “In the history of spaceflight, no known person has ever been harmed by re-entering space debris.” Indeed, only one person is known to have been hit by falling space debris: American woman Lottie Williams, who was struck but not injured by a falling piece of a U.S. Delta II rocket while exercising in an Oklahoma park in 1997. Most famously, America's 77-ton Skylab crashed through the atmosphere in 1979, spreading pieces of wreckage near the southwestern Australia city of Perth, which fined the U.S. $400 for littering.

Christopher Zara,"With maximum sustained winds of 140 mph, Hurricane Micheal is bearing down on the Florida panhandle this morning, having intensified into what the National Weather Service called an “extremely dangerous” Category 4 hurricane. The hurricane is expected to make landfall today. Florida has issued mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders in at least 22 counties on the Gulf Coast, with Governor Rick Scott urging people yesterday to get out of the way of the “monstrous storm,” CNN reported. If you’re looking to keep track of the storm, here are a few resources for live updates: Here are a few other key details about the storm: Position: The hurricane was about 120 miles southwest of Panama City, Florida, as of 6 a.m. ET this morning, per CNN.

Laignee Barron,"One person was reportedly killed and thousands are without power as Tropical Storm Gordon smashed into the central Gulf Coast, making landfall between Alabama and the Florida panhandle Tuesday night with high-force winds and a heavy downpour. In Pensacola, Florida, a child was killed when the wind felled a tree on top of a mobile home, CNN reports. The fast-moving storm careened into the coastline around 10 p.m. registering maximum sustained winds of 70 miles-per-hour, according to the National Hurricane Center. The system did not reach the hurricane status previously forecast, however, warnings of “life-threatening” conditions remain in effect for areas expected to be hit with rapidly rising storm surges between Mississippi and Alabama. More than 27,000 customers were hit with power cuts as Gordon came ashore Tuesday night, the Associated Press reports. The outages primarily affected Alabama, with cuts also reported around the western edge of the Florida Panhandle around Pensacola as well as in Mississippi. Gordon is expected to lose momentum as it moves inland, and is forecast to become a tropical depression by Wednesday.

Dinah Voyles Pulver,"Volusia and Flagler counties escaped the window for a direct strike from a dangerous Hurricane Florence, with the hurricane forecast to make a landfall in the Carolinas this week. But the storm's big waves and rip currents already are having an impact on local beaches and that's expected to continue for several days. Florence returned to hurricane strength Sunday and was forecast to become a major hurricane with winds of 121 mph or more by Monday as it plods westward in the Atlantic Ocean. The center of Florence is forecast to strike somewhere along the coast of North or South Carolina by Thursday as a Category 4 hurricane, with winds and rain arriving well before the center makes landfall. Emergency preparations began taking place along the Eastern Seaboard this weekend, with impacts expected well inland in North and South Carolina and Virginia, as the forecast indicated the hurricane could linger and cause widespread flooding in that region. There, the National Hurricane Center said residents face an ""increasing risk of two life-threatening impacts from Florence, storm surge at the coast and freshwater flooding from a prolonged heavy rainfall event inland."" Florence is one of several systems the Hurricane Center is watching, including Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Isaac, upgraded to a hurricane on Sunday night, becoming the fifth hurricane of the season. Hurricane fast facts: Hurricane Florence, 685 miles southeast of Bermuda, moving west at 7 mph with winds of 90 mph. Hurricane Helene - 195 miles west southwest of the southernmost Cabo Verde Islands, moving west-northwest at 13 mph, with winds of 85 mph Hurricane Isaac - 1,305 miles east of the Windward Islands, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, moving west at 14 mph. On Sunday evening, Florence was about 1,100 miles southeast of Bermuda, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph. The hurricane was moving west at 7 mph. It's forecast to eventually begin a turn northward the northwest, but the timing of that turn could mean the difference in major impacts along the coastal Carolinas. If the hurricane picks up speed, as some models suggested it would, the Hurricane Center said it would increase the potential for higher, more dangerous winds at landfall. Damage increases exponentially with each increase in hurricane wind speed. Florence is forecast to increase to peak winds of 150 mph on Wednesday and then drop slightly to 140 mph by Thursday. Forecast maps from the Hurricane Center indicate Volusia and Flagler counties face a slight risk of tropical storm-force winds from the outer reaches of Florence, as the hurricane moves northward off the coast on Wednesday night. Those probabilities dropped with each new advisory on Sunday, said Jonathan Lord, emergency management chief for Flagler County. The probability in Daytona Beach was 3 percent on Sunday evening and 5 percent in Jacksonville, Lord said. ""So it's looking better and better at this time for wind — for us that is."" Along Volusia County beaches, Capt. Andrew Ethridge with Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue said the surf is expected to ""build over the next few days and into the latter part of the week."" ""With the larger surf we expect an elevated risk of rip currents,"" Ethridge said. The building surf already is causing problems, and he reminded beachgoers to be aware of the conditions.. ""We are also experiencing impact injuries due to the larger waves,"" he said. On Sunday, they took two patients to local hospitals who were injured when driven into the sand bar by large waves. One experienced a fractured arm and the other was treated for neck and back injuries. Forecasters also are keeping a watchful eye on Isaac. It's forecast to strike the islands by Thursday and then become a tropical storm as it moves into the Caribbean Sea. Helene is forecast to turn north into the Atlantic Ocean. Elsewhere, an upper-level trough and tropical wave are producing an area of showers and thunderstorms between Cuba and Honduras. That system will move slowly northwestward and could encounter favorable conditions for tropical storm formation once it reaches the Gulf of Mexico. The Hurricane Center gives it a 30 percent chance of developing into a tropical storm over the next five days. The Associated Press reported Sunday that preparations were underway along the coasts of South Carolina, North Carolina and into Virginia. No-swimming flags had been posted as far north as the town of Nags Head on the outer banks of North Carolina. In southeast Virginia, Naval Station Norfolk told its employees they should not leave their vehicles parked at the sprawling base in coming days because of the flood threat, the Associated Press reported. Parking lots adjacent to the waterfront are prone to flooding. The Navy stated it planned to send ships from Hampton Roads out to sea.","Daytona Beach News-Journal Surf conditions growing more dangerous along Volusia, Flagler coasts as Hurricane Florence strengthens Daytona Beach News-Journal Volusia and Flagler counties escaped the window for a direct strike from a dangerous Hurricane Florenc…",2018-09-10T03:22:30Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'News-journalonline.com'}","Surf conditions growing more dangerous along Volusia, Flagler coasts as Hurricane Florence strengthens - Daytona Beach News-Journal",http://www.news-journalonline.com/article/20180909/NEWS/180907660,http://www.news-journalonline.com/storyimage/LK/20180909/NEWS/180907660/AR/0/AR-180907660.jpg,,News-journalonline.com,landfall,1
James Pomfret,"HONG KONG/MANILA (Reuters) - A super typhoon made landfall in China’s Guangdong on Sunday, the country’s most populous province, after barreling past Hong Kong and Macau and killing at least 29 people in the Philippines. Packing gale force winds of more than 200 kph (125 mph), tropical cyclone Mangkhut is considered the strongest to hit the region this year, equivalent to a maximum Category 5 “intense hurricane” in the Atlantic. Mangkhut, the Thai name for Southeast Asia’s mangosteen fruit, skirted 100 km (62 miles) south of Hong Kong and veered west toward the coast of Guangdong and the gaming center of Macau. Hong Kong raised its highest No. 10 typhoon signal at mid-morning as ferocious winds uprooted trees and smashed windows in office and residential buildings, some of which swayed in the gusts, residents said. “It swayed for quite a long time, at least two hours. It made me feel so dizzy,” said Elaine Wong, who lives in a high-rise tower in Kowloon. Water levels surged 3.5 m (12 ft) in some places, waves swamped roads and washed up live fish, washing into some residential blocks and a mall in an eastern district. “It’s the worst I’ve seen,” resident Martin Wong told Reuters. “I’ve not seen the roads flood like this, (and) the windows shake like this, before.” The plans of tens of thousands of travelers were disrupted by flight cancellations at Hong Kong’s international airport, a major regional hub. Airlines such as flagship carrier Cathay Pacific canceled many flights last week. Philippine authorities said a baby and a toddler were among the 29 dead, most of them in landslides in mountainous areas that left at least 13 missing. “The landslides happened as some residents returned to their homes after the typhoon,” disaster response coordinator Francis Tolentino told DZMM Radio, adding that most of the 5.7 million people affected had made advance preparations. “It was not so severe as we expected it to be because earlier it was noted it would also be strong,” said President Rodrigo Duterte, following an aerial survey of some affected areas. In Macau, which halted casino gambling late on Saturday and put China’s People’s Liberation Army on standby for disaster relief help, some streets were flooded. “The suspension is for the safety of casino employees, visitors to the city, and residents,” said authorities in the world’s largest gambling hub, who faced criticism last year after a typhoon that killed nine and caused severe damage. China has ordered thousands of boats to return to harbor, and evacuated thousands of offshore oil platform workers, the state news agency, Xinhua, said. GRAPHIC: Typhoon Mangkhut - tmsnrt.rs/2oZmnIS “KING OF STORMS” The typhoon, dubbed the “King of Storms” by Chinese media, made landfall in Haiyan town at 5:00 p.m. local time, packing winds of more than 160 kph (100 mph), weather officials said. Ports, oil refineries and industrial plants in the area have been shut. Power to some areas were also reduced as a precaution. The storm has fueled concern about sugar production in Guangdong, which accounts for a tenth of national output, at about 1 million tonnes. China sugar futures rose last week on fears for the cane crop. Guangdong is also China’s most populous province, with a population of more than 100 million. The airport in the boomtown of Shenzhen has been shut since midnight, and will be closed until 8:00 a.m. (2400 GMT) on Monday. Flights have been canceled in Guangzhou and the neighboring island province of Hainan. High winds and swells have also hit Fujian province north of Guangdong, shutting ports, suspending ferry services and cancelling more than 100 flights. Waves as high as 7.3 meters (24 ft) were sighted in the Taiwan Strait, Xinhua said. Mangkhut’s northwesterly track will bring heavy rain and winds to the autonomous region of Guangxi early on Monday, before it weakens into a tropical depression to reach southwestern Yunnan next day.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected on Wednesday to visit North Carolina, where thousands of homes and roadways remain underwater and swollen rivers threaten more flooding less than a week after Hurricane Florence made landfall. Trump, who has been criticized for his response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, plans to arrive at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina, at about 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) and return to Washington at 6:15 p.m. (2215 GMT), according to the White House. More than 15,000 people remain in shelters and more than 200,000 customers are without power across North Carolina, six days after Florence made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, according to state officials. “We continue to feel the effects of this massive storm,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Tuesday. “Even though there is no substantial rain in the forecast and the sun may be shining across many parts of our state, rivers continue to rise and we will see more flooding.” The Cape Fear River was expected to crest at 61.5 feet (19 meters), four times its normal height, on Wednesday in Fayetteville, a city of 200,000 near the Fort Bragg army base in the southern part of the state, according to the National Weather Service. That has disrupted efforts to restore power, clear roads and allow evacuated residents to go home. “There is a strong potential that those who live within the 1-mile evacuation area of the Cape Fear River will be impacted by flooding,” the city said in a statement. The city manager told CNN that 12,000 people are “in harm’s way.” Florence has killed at least 35 people, including 26 in North Carolina and eight in South Carolina, where local media reported that two female mental health patients drowned on Tuesday after a sheriff’s van they were in crashed. One person was killed in Virginia by a tornado that spun off from Florence. SWOLLEN RIVERS Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas. Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage resulting from Florence, which has dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina since Thursday. At least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage, with three others set to crest in the coming days in North Carolina, the state said. In the town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, which has struggled to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, only about 50 residents remained on Tuesday, Fair Bluff Police Chief Chris Chafin told Reuters. The town has largely been cut off by flooding from the still-rising Lumber River, which was expected to crest on Wednesday. As Florence was bearing down on the Carolinas last week, Trump reignited the controversy over his handling of Maria by disputing the official death toll of 2,975 in the U.S. territory, which was compiled by public health experts at George Washington University. Trump said, without offering evidence, that Democrats had inflated the figure to make him look bad.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - U.S. Southeast power companies said more than 188,000 homes and businesses in North Carolina and South Carolina were without power early Friday as Hurricane Florence caused a deluge ahead of its landfall later in the day. Florence was downgraded to a Category 1 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale on Thursday evening and was located about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Morehead City, North Carolina with maximum sustained winds of 90 miles per hour (150 km/h). Heavy rain, wind gusts and rising floodwaters from Hurricane Florence swamped the Carolinas as the massive storm crawled toward the coast, threatening millions of people in its path with record rainfall and punishing surf. Duke Energy Corp, the biggest utility in the area with over 4 million customers, estimated the storm could cause between 1 million to 3 million outages. Restoring power to all customers could take weeks, it said. Duke said it had more than 20,000 personnel ready to start fixing outages as soon as conditions allowed, including over 8,000 from the Duke’s Carolinas utilities, 1,700 from the Midwest, 1,200 from Florida and 9,400 from other utilities.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Marina Galperina to Gizmodo","I sat for a while trying to figure out what image should be at the top of this post. Punching in different keywordshurricane, wildfire, heat waveturned up photos from around the world. Eventually, I settled on Southern Californias Woolsey Fire bearing down on the mansions of Malibu, because it best encapsulates this moment in time. Its the perfect metaphor for 2018, the year when climate changes influence on our weather crystalized further, when it the flames showed up in our proverbial (and in some cases, literal) backyard. And the planet, our home, will go up in smoke if we dont act soon. It wasnt just fires either. Heat, winds, water, and other weather disasters created horrific damage all over. Here are all the ways the world burned in 2018, a catastrophe that will only get worse if we dont address climate change soon. Flames The Woolsey Fire was a $1.6-billion disaster that wouldve been the worst imaginable fire this year if not for what was happening in Northern California at the same time. The Camp Fire burned an entire town to the ground, left dozens dead, thousands without a home, and caused California to temporarily have the worst air quality on the planet. But Californias fire story doesnt even stop there. In August the Mendocino Complex became Californias largest in history, just a year after the Thomas Fire took the title. Oh, and of course there was the Carr Fire, which also cracked the list of most destructive fires in Californias history and spawned a massive firenado. And flames were hardly limited to California. British Columbia saw day turn into night thanks to wildfires. Sweden went up in smoke. So did Siberia. Even as winter has quashed the flames in the northern hemisphere, now its Australias turn to face unprecedented fire conditions. Heat You cant really have flames with heat. And in a warming world, theres heat in spades. This year will likely go down as the fourth-warmest on record for the globe. Next year could be even hotter. While only the Earth itself really experiences the global average temperature, the rest of us felt its rise in the form of heat waves. The aforementioned Scandinavian fires wouldve been impossible without record heat that seared the region this summer. In fact, much of Europe was gripped by heat, and weird things happened. The ice on top of Swedens tallest mountain shrunk so much, it lost the title of tallest mountain. Englands long-buried ancient villages emerged in the form of crop markings. Then there were the records. Temperatures rose above freezing at the worlds northernmost weather station in the dead of the dark, Arctic winter. Japan had its hottest day ever recorded. A heat wave led to the hottest day ever recorded in all of Africa. Pakistan saw the hottest April day ever recorded on Earth. Death Valley recorded the hottest month on Earth period. It was hot, yall. Waves, wind, and rain After 2017, you would think we could get a break with the hurricanes and typhoons and whatnot. But no. The U.S. saw record-setting Florence and Michael devastate North Carolina and Florida, respectively. Each storm is a multi-billion dollar disaster, marking a second straight year of multiple violent hurricanes hitting the U.S. A freak tropical storm also made landfall in the Great Lakes, because why not. Other cyclone basins also delivered punch after punch after punch. The eastern Pacific churned out multiple storms that underwent rapid intensification. In the central Pacific, Hurricane Lane brought torrential rain to Hawaii, while Walaka washed an entire island off the map. In the western Pacific, we saw a freaky annular typhoon with a huge eye as well as widespread destruction in the Marianas Islands thanks to Typhoon Yutu. The basin also spawned the strongest storm on Earth of 2018: Super Typhoon Mangkhut had winds reach 200 mph over the open ocean, though thankfully they quieted down by landfall. This list is hardly exhaustive, but then, wed be here for days if it were. The point is were seeing more catastrophic weather, climate change is in part behind it, and the time to address it is in short supply. The weather wont stop in 2019. There will be more records and losses and questions about how to rebuild or even if we should. But that doesnt mean were screwed. It means we need courage, and on that front there are some encouraging signs, including new members of Congress who actually get the monumental challenge we face and are willing to rise and meet it. Hopefully with their leadership, 2019 will look a little less bleak.","I sat for a while trying to figure out what image should be at the top of this post.

Bill Chappell,"A satellite image shows Hurricane Florence looming in the Atlantic Ocean as the sun rises over the U.S. Florence is expected to bring tropical storm conditions to North Carolina and South Carolina on Thursday. NOAA/STAR Hurricane Florence is blasting toward the Carolinas, carrying sustained winds of up to 130 mph and the threat of ""life-threatening storm surge and rainfall,"" the National Hurricane Center says. A hurricane warning – meaning hurricane conditions are expected within 36 hours — is in effect for a long stretch of the coast, from the Santee River in South Carolina to Duck, N.C. — part of the Outer Banks. Hurricane conditions will likely hit on Friday, but tropical storm conditions will arrive on Thursday, the hurricane center said. ""Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,"" the agency says. The threat has sparked a rush of evacuation efforts in South Carolina and North Carolina, with more than a million people urged to get out of Florence's way. Governors of those states have already declared states of emergency, as have the governors of Virginia and Maryland. Hurricane Florence is now expected to head more directly west after making landfall, cross through South Carolina. The storm will bring dangerously high amounts of rain, forecasters say. NOAA/NWS, Esri, HERE, Garmin, USGS Forecasters have adjusted Hurricane Florence's predicted path, saying that after it makes landfall, it will likely take a more southerly route than had previously been expected. Rather than pushing up toward western Virginia, the storm's center is now predicted to move across the middle of South Carolina. For a swathe of the North Carolina shore from Cape Fear to Cape Lookout, the storm surge could range from 9-13 feet, the NHC said. In Myrtle Beach, S.C., and nearby areas, the surge could hit 6-9 feet. As of 8 a.m. ET, Florence was 530 miles southeast of Cape Fear, N.C., moving west-northwest at 17 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. ""An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft that was in the hurricane until just after midnight"" recorded a peak wind gust of around 150 mph, the hurricane center said. Florence is currently heading for ocean water with surface temperatures of around 85 degrees, meaning it will likely strengthen on its way to the East Coast. Even with some weakening that's predicted just before it makes landfall, the storm ""is expected to remain a dangerous major hurricane as it approaches the coastline,"" the hurricane center said. Satellite images show the storm has maintained a distinct eye, and it's well organized. Its maximum sustained winds are expected to top 145 mph before it loses some steam near the coast. Current forecasts call for its winds to be at least a Category 3 storm when it arrives at the Carolinas. ""A motion toward the northwest is forecast to begin by this afternoon and continue through Thursday,"" the hurricane center says. ""Florence is expected to slow down considerably by late Thursday into Friday, and move slowly through early Saturday."" Rainfall totals from Hurricane Florence will top 20 inches in some areas, the National Weather Service says. National Weather Service The slow movement, combined with the massive amount of moisture this storm holds, will bring dangerous rains – from 20 to 30 inches in coastal North Carolina, with 40 inches possible in isolated areas, the weather service says. In South Carolina and inland parts of North Carolina, 5 to 10 inches of rain could fall, with 20 inches possible in some areas. ""This rainfall would produce catastrophic flash flooding and significant river flooding,"" the hurricane center said.","Rather than pushing up toward western Virginia, the storm's center is now predicted to move across the middle of South Carolina after it makes landfall.",2018-09-12T13:02:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Hurricane Florence Zeroes In On Carolinas, Bringing 130 MPH Winds",https://www.npr.org/2018/09/12/647005403/hurricane-florence-zeroes-in-on-carolinas-bringing-130-mph-winds,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/09/12/flo-satellite-color_wide-b1d67968e6ceb5343b2ec3d747874a434da725cd.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,landfall,1
Bill Chappell,"Hurricane Florence is expected to be a Category 4 storm when it arrives at the coast of North Carolina late this week. National Weather Service Hurricane Florence ""is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday night"" – and the Category 4 storm has now triggered a hurricane watch for all of North Carolina and part of South Carolina, the National Hurricane Center says. Florence is packing maximum sustained winds of 130 mph, with higher gusts, the hurricane center said in its 8 a.m. ET update. At the time, the imposing storm was 405 miles south of Bermuda. Florence is expected to hit the Carolinas and Virginia late Thursday or early Friday. It's currently predicted to make landfall somewhere north of Wilmington, before its center heads inland toward Raleigh and Durham. As of 8 a.m. ET, the hurricane was moving west-northwest at 15 mph, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. The storm will pick up additional strength as it passes over ocean water with sea surface temperatures of up to 85 degrees, the National Hurricane Center said. The large and powerful hurricane has prompted evacuation orders in North and South Carolina and Virginia, as officials urge residents in coastal and low-lying areas to prepare for strong winds, a deep storm surge, and a deluge of rainfall that could last more than 24 hours. Florence will bring a perilous risk of flooding to a broad area, and its wind and rains will also bring downed trees and other destruction to areas in its path, the hurricane center said. ""All the rainfall we're going to have, plus you talk about the wind — that means a lot of trees coming down, it's a lot of power outages, a lot of impacts with this system,"" NHC director Ken Graham said on Tuesday. The hurricane watch notice is significant because it signals the opening of a 48-hour window for the expected first arrival of tropical-storm-force winds. After that point, it would be difficult for people in the storm's path to either finish preparations or flee affected areas. A satellite image shows Hurricane Florence bearing toward the coast of North Carolina. The storm is predicted to make landfall as a major hurricane late this week. NOAA/STAR On Tuesday morning, data from an Air Force Reserve hurricane hunter aircraft found that Florence's sustained winds had weakened somewhat from the 140-mph speeds reported earlier. But the storm is expected to restrengthen over the next day or so. A hurricane watch is now in effect for hundreds of miles of the U.S. East Coast, from Edisto Beach in South Carolina up north to the North Carolina-Virginia border. Tropical storm conditions could hit those areas by Thursday morning, forecasters say. If it makes landfall as predicted, Florence could become the northern-most Category 4 hurricane to hit the U.S. since records were first kept in 1851. It's expected to strike far above the point where Hurricane Hazel arrived close to the South Carolina/North Carolina border in October 1954. In addition to strong winds, Florence brings the threat of a devastating storm surge – as high as 6-12 feet in the area from Cape Fear, N.C., to Cape Lookout, N.C. ""Prolonged and exceptionally heavy"" rains will also inundate parts of the coast and inland areas, the National Hurricane Center said: ""Florence is expected to produce total rainfall accumulations of 15 to 20 inches with isolated maxima to 30 inches near Florence's track over portions of North Carolina, Virginia, and northern South Carolina through Saturday. This rainfall may produce life-threatening flash flooding."" Florence is expected to stall over North Carolina and slowly make its way across the state and into southwestern Virginia. The hurricane center predicts a ""heavy rainfall event, which may extend inland over the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic for hundreds of miles."" Overnight, Florence went through an ""eyewall replacement cycle,"" Senior Hurricane Specialist Stacy Stewart said in an update from the hurricane center on Tuesday. ""That's good news and bad news,"" he said. ""It's weakened, but unfortunately the eye has expanded out to a diameter now of about 30-35 nautical miles."" Stewart added, ""We're going to have a fairly stable, powerful hurricane with the potential for some additional slow strengthening over about the next 24 hours.""","If it makes landfall as predicted, Florence could become the northern-most Category 4 hurricane to hit the U.S. since records were first kept in 1851.",2018-09-11T12:51:03Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Hurricane Watch Issued For Carolinas Ahead Of Category 4 Florence,https://www.npr.org/2018/09/11/646598687/hurricane-watch-issued-for-carolinas-ahead-of-category-4-florence,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/09/11/florence-satellite_wide-5f0e7dad6528e6aeb2094a1218e8e666dfc1947f.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,landfall,1
Gina Martinez,"Hurricane Michael made landfall in Mexico Beach, Fla. on Wednesday with sustained winds of 155 miles per hour. That put it just shy of a Category 5 hurricane, which would require wind speeds of 157 mph, but Michael is nevertheless one of the strongest storms to ever strike the American mainland. Michael was continuing to intensify even as it made landfall Wednesday, an unusual phenomenon that surprised some experts. Hurricanes typically lose power as they move inland away from the warm waters that fuel them and encounter less favorable wind conditions. “I think that if people are comparing storms, what was really fascinating was that it was still intensifying when it was making landfall, which is similar to Hurricane Camille also intensifying as it moved inland,” says AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Kottlowski. “Other storms like Hurricane Opal in 1995 actually went from a Category 4 to 3, just like most storms that make landfall on the Gulf Coast tend to weaken.” There are several ways to measure a hurricane’s strength. The most recognizable measurement, the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, rates hurricanes from 1-5 based on their sustained wind speeds. But hurricanes can also be measured by their barometric pressure: generally speaking, the lower the pressure, the more intense the storm. And so far, Hurricane Michael’s pressure ranks as the third-lowest for any hurricane to strike the U.S. mainland, at 919 millibars. The only storms with lower pressure were Hurricane Camille in 1969, and the unnamed Labor Day hurricane of 1935. But Kottlowski noted that meteorologists are still analyzing Hurricane Michael, and it’s possible that it will be retroactively upgraded to Category 5 status based on wind speeds. “That’s what happened with Hurricane Andrew — [the National Hurricane Center] looked at the pressure and reanalyzed and upgraded it to a Category 5 storm. It was very close. I think it’s possible that it will happen with Michael. It was only two miles per hour slower than a Category 5. They’ll do a thorough reanalysis of the data … but it’ll take two to three months at least until the final report.” Regardless of Hurricane Michael’s ultimate classification, those in the path of the storm are facing life-threatening winds, storm surge and other dangerous conditions. The NHC said Michael could cause a storm surge of up to 14 feet, for instance. “Storm surge will be the most damaging aspect of the storm,” says Kottlowski. “A lot of places on video showed houses under water. We’re seeing up to nine feet of inundation in parts of Apalachicola, Florida, and that wasn’t even where Michael made landfall.”","Hurricane Michael made landfall in Mexico Beach, Fla. on Wednesday with sustained winds of 155 miles per hour.",2018-10-10T22:13:29Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Hurricane Michael Is the Third Most Powerful Storm to Ever Hit the U.S. Mainland,http://time.com/5421189/hurricane-michael-category/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/hurricane-michael-strength.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,landfall,1
Katie Reilly,"Hurricane Michael made landfall in Mexico Beach on Wednesday, destroying homes and creating dangerous levels of storm surge as the Category 4 hurricane moved inland. Tess Talarico shared Instagram videos from Mexico Beach, about 20 miles south of Panama City, showing the progression of storm damage over several hours. Whipping winds bent palm trees, tore pieces of metal off roofs, destroyed buildings and left some structures fully submerged in water. “The wind is now 140 and we can barely see anything,” Talarico posted Wednesday with a video that showed tumultuous waves and wind outside her window. “A whole house is gone and is floating in front of our place,” she posted a couple of hours later, with more wreckage and rising waters below. “This is what it looks like right now,” she said in another update. “All the houses are submerged.” With winds that reached 155 miles per hour, Hurricane Michael is “the worst storm that the Florida Panhandle has seen in more than 100 years,” Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Wednesday morning. Officials had warned residents to evacuate and seek shelter before the storm made landfall. “This is the final call for anyone who needs to get out,” FEMA chief Brock Long said at a press conference Wednesday morning. “Those who stick around to experience storm surge don’t typically live to tell about it.”","Hurricane Michael made landfall in Mexico Beach on Wednesday, destroying homes as the Category 4 hurricane moved inland.",2018-10-10T21:20:57Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",‘A Whole House is Gone.’ Videos Show the Devastation Caused by Hurricane Michael,http://time.com/5421134/hurricane-michael-mexico-beach-storm-videos/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/hurricane-michael.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,landfall,1
Beth Skwarecki,"A hurricane’s category only tells you about its wind speed, but much of its devastation comes from flooding. With Hurricane Florence, some areas could see as many as 30 inches of rain plus ten feet of storm surge. What is a storm surge? The winds of a hurricane push water around, even while the storm is still in the ocean. Water that is pushed onto land becomes the storm surge. Think of how the tide can roll in from the sea and cover up land that was previously bare. It’s like that, except you have tides in addition to the storm surge, raising water levels even higher. Where does the storm surge happen? It’s not just an issue at the coast. Storm surges can cause flooding in upstream rivers, or in any low-lying areas the surge water reaches. North Carolina is so flat that the surge is expected to cause flooding many miles inland. How much flooding should we expect? Total flooding depends on the storm surge, including storm tides, plus rainfall. It varies depending on the exact contours of the land. And your safety in the storm depends on other factors as well: perhaps your house will be dry, but if all the roads are flooded, that doesn’t help you much. Bottom line, if you or a loved one are in the area, the most important map is an evacuation map. But if you’re curious about the predicted flooding, here is the storm surge prediction map from the National Hurricane Center. Predictions change as more information comes in, and the NHC notes that the map “includes many assumptions and has limitations, and it cannot tell you what amount of flooding will definitely occur at any given location.” Hurricane Florence is expected to make landfall along the Atlantic coast as early as this coming… Read more Read Rainfall predictions are shown on a separate map, and those predictions are likewise going to change as forecasters watch the storm approach. In the meantime, keep an eye on public advisories from weather.gov and listen to local warnings and evacuation orders. Also check out our rundown of hurricane tracking tools.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Customers at a hardware store in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which may be in the path US President Donald Trump has issued a series of warnings to prepare for Hurricane Florence, which is gathering power as it approaches the Carolinas. Mr Trump tweeted that this was ""one of the worst storms to hit the East Coast in many years"". Florence is at present a Category Four storm, with sustained winds of about 140mph (220km/h). On its current track it is predicted to make landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, late on Thursday. A number of mandatory evacuations have been ordered in South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia, affecting more than a million people. South Carolina's Governor Henry McMaster has given the entire coastline until noon on Tuesday to leave. The University of North Carolina at Wilmington has also ordered a mandatory evacuation of students. In its latest advisory at 23:00 eastern time (0300 GMT). the National Hurricane Center said of Florence: ""Some strengthening is expected during the next 36 hours, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday."" It said hurricane-force winds would ""extend outward up to 40 miles (65km) from the centre and tropical-storm-force winds [would] extend outward up to 150 miles (240km)"". The 23:00 report placed Florence about 465 miles south-east of Bermuda, moving west-north-west at about 13mph. This would see it pass between Bermuda and the Bahamas on Tuesday and Wednesday and make landfall on the North Carolina coast at about 22:00 local time on Thursday. The chief meteorologist for WCBD-TV in South Carolina, Rob Fowler, told the BBC that Florence was a large storm and getting bigger, and those even 100 miles away would feel the impact. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boarding up under way in Holden Beach, North Carolina He said the predicted heavy rain and storm surges could threaten areas such as Charleston, which is only a few metres above sea level, and that Florence could rival the impact of Hurricane Hugo, which wreaked $7bn (£5.3bn) in damage and claimed 49 lives in 1989. Schools in affected areas will begin to close on Tuesday and lanes on some highways will be reversed to aid evacuations. Media caption Will hurricanes like those in 2017 wreak havoc yet again? ""We are not going to gamble with the lives of the people of South Carolina,"" Mr McMaster said. The office of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam predicted ""catastrophic inland flooding, high winds and possible widespread power outages"". Rainfall could be up to 20in (50cm) in some areas. This could worsen if, as some meteorologists predict, Florence stalls after it makes landfall. Image copyright Reuters Image caption South Carolina airmen are deployed for the expected rescue efforts National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham told the Associated Press news agency: ""It's not just the coast. When you stall a system like this and it moves real slow, some of that rainfall can extend well away from the centre."" A similar event caused devastation in Texas last year when Hurricane Harvey hit. 'We were nonstop' President Trump has signed approvals for the declarations of emergency in the Carolinas and said he had spoken to the governors of the affected states. He sent out five tweets over four hours warning people to heed advice and stay safe: The US Navy is sending 30 ships stationed in Virginia out to sea. Residents of affected areas have been flocking to stores to stock up on essentials. Hardware store manager John Johnson told Agence France-Presse news agency there had been a rush on batteries, flashlights, plastic tarpaulins and sandbags at his Charleston shop.

Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged. Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h Houses suffer damage, severe flooding Storm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h Some roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses. Storm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+ Serious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland. Storm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless ""For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.""

ABC News,"Today is the last day of the 2017 Atlantic Basin hurricane season, which has left hundreds dead and was the most active season since 2005, the year of Katrina. Interested in Hurricanes? Add Hurricanes as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricanes news, video, and analysis from ABC News. This year had triple the usual amount of major hurricanes: six major hurricanes, as opposed to the norm of two. In total, there were 10 hurricanes this year and 17 named storms. For the first time on record, three Category 4 hurricanes made landfall in the U.S.: Harvey, Irma and Maria. September 2017, was the most active month on record for Atlantic hurricanes. Here are more facts and records about the 2017 hurricane season: Irma With winds reaching up to 185 mph, Hurricane Irma was the second-strongest hurricane in the Atlantic Basin in history. It set a world record for the longest-lasting, strongest cyclone. Irma was also the strongest storm to impact the Leeward Islands, on the border of the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, in recorded history. The monster storm completely destroyed the Caribbean island of Barbuda with 185 mph winds; it was also the first Category 5 hurricane to make landfall in Cuba since 1924 and the first to hit the Bahamas since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. When Hurricane Irma made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida, as a Category 4 hurricane, it still had winds up to 130 mph. It was the first Category 4 hurricane to make landfall in Florida since hurricane Charlie 2004. The hurricane's second landfall in Florida was on Marco Island as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115. GRAPHIC: In this graphic, shows the path of Hurricane Irma. Irma's path through Caribbean shows it hit the Virgin Islands, but missed direct landfall in Puerto Rico: GRAPHIC: In this graphic, shows the path of Hurricane Irma. Maria Hurricane Maria increased strength very rapidly, ramping up from a Category 1 storm to Category 5 in just 15 hours. At its strongest, Maria's winds reached 175 mph. Maria hit the island of Dominica on Sept. 18, the first Category 5 storm to make landfall there, with winds up to 160 mph. The island was nearly completely restored. On the island of St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Maria's winds gusted up to 137 mph. In Puerto Rico, winds gusted to 110 mph, in San Juan, and rainfall totaled 35 inches causing some rivers to rise 20 feet in just a few hours. On September 20, the storm made landfall in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, as a Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 155 mph. Maria was the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Puerto Rico since 1928. GRAPHIC: In this graphic, shows the path of Hurricane Maria. Harvey Harvey produced the biggest rainfall total from a single storm in the U.S. on record: 51.88 inches. Rainfall in Port Arthur, Texas, broke records; more than two feet of rain fell in 24 hours. Harvey was the first Category 4 hurricane to hit Texas since 1961. It made landfall in Rockport, Texas, as with winds of 130 mph. Harvey made three landfalls in the U.S. -- two in Texas and one in Louisiana.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright WYFF Image caption News channel WYFF 4 paid tribute to its two journalists Two journalists were killed in a ""freak of nature"" accident while covering weather conditions in North Carolina during storm Alberto. Mike McCormick and Aaron Smeltzer, from news outlet WYFF, died when a falling tree crushed their car as they drove down a highway. Fire chief Geoff Tennant had recorded an interview with the pair minutes before he received the emergency call. He said they had each exchanged wishes to stay safe just 10 minutes earlier. Mr McCormick was a reporter and anchor, and Mr Smeltzer was a photojournalist. Both were on assignment covering the extreme weather. The tree, Mr Tennant said, ""probably fell in excess of 30 feet"". While the deaths of the two journalists are not being directly attributed to the storm itself, the heavy rainfall had waterlogged the soil, probably contributing to the tree's fall. ""It is one of those things you know is going to happen, or you can predict it may happen - you don't know when,"" Mr Tennant said. He said the death of both men has ""personally affected me"", and that although it was his first meeting with Mr McCormick and Mr Smeltzer, ""you feel a sense of responsibility for them"". The news station which employed both men paid tribute to them in its reporting. ""Our news family grieves over the loss of two special journalists - and two special friends,"" news anchor Carol Goldsmith said as she reported the news on WYFF 4's evening news. Mr McCormick was an anchor and reporter covering the Spartanburg area with more than a decade's experience in the role. Mr Smeltzer had joined WYFF this year from local competitor station WSPA. In their own story on the tragedy, WSPA 7's anchors said: ""The journalists who died in today's crash were friends to many of us. ""They were committed to their work, to this community, and while we are of course competitors on air, Mike and Aaron were our friends and they were part of our larger journalism family. ""We will miss them both terribly."" Viewers also sent in their messages of sympathy after the news was broadcast. Subtropical storm Alberto is the first named Atlantic storm of 2018. It made landfall on Florida's north-western coast on Monday, which was also the Memorial Day holiday in the United States. It has since weakened to a subtropical depression, with maximum winds of 35 mph (55km/h) and sustained heavy rainfall, the US National Hurricane Centre said.",Two journalists are found dead by the fire official they interviewed just 10 minutes earlier.,2018-05-29T08:48:58Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Storm Alberto: Journalists killed while covering US storm,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44287035,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/162B9/production/_101790809_deuvrfnv4aa6uod.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,landfall,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Flash floods and landslides have led to fatalities in the Philippines Heavy rain and strong winds are lashing the south coast of China as Typhoon Mangkhut closes in. Authorities in the heavily populated province of Guangdong have issued their highest warning level, a red alert. More than 100 people were injured when the storm touched Hong Kong. Landslide warnings are in place. At least 25 people have already died in the Philippines as a result of Typhoon Mangkhut but the full impact on rural areas is not yet known. Mangkhut lost power as it made landfall but it is considered the strongest storm of 2018. Is China ready? In Hong Kong, authorities issued their maximum alert, with residents warned to stay indoors to avoid flying debris. Winds there reportedly reached more than 110 mph (117 kph). Some apartment blocks had windows blown out. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The typhoon has been lashing Hong Kong but the territory dodged a direct hit Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Authorities issue their highest alert Most shops and public services are shut, and more than 800 flights have been cancelled at Hong Kong International Airport - affecting more than 100,000 passengers. Not everyone paid attention to the warnings, though. ""I went running this morning. I love fresh air and there's no one on the streets, no cars. On normal days we can't see this,"" Hong Kong resident Hao Chen told the AFP news agency. In neighbouring Macau, for the first time in its history the territory's famous casinos were ordered to close. Thousands of people have been evacuated from Guangdong, where Mangkhut is due to strike later on Sunday. The typhoon is the 22nd of the year but China's National Meteorological Centre says it could be the strongest one yet to make landfall. What's the impact on the Philippines? Most of the deaths in the Philippines were caused by landslides in the Cordillera and Nueva Vizcaya regions, officials say. Among the dead are a baby and a toddler. Blocked roads and downed communications lines mean reports are still coming in. Typhoon Mangkhut made landfall on Saturday, tearing through the main island of Luzon. Five million people were in its path and more than 100,000 sheltered in temporary centres. There is also concern over the economic cost of the typhoon, which has caused extensive damage to farmland in Cagayan, a key agricultural province. Francis Tolentino, a political adviser to President Rodrigo Duterte, told the BBC that he estimated only a fifth of produce there had been harvested in advance - threatening staples like rice and corn. Image copyright AFP Image caption Farmland has been badly damaged by the storm Image copyright EPA Image caption The full impact is still emerging The Philippines is routinely hit during the typhoon season but the strength of Manghukt evoked memories of the deadliest storm on national record - Super Typhoon Haiyan - which killed more than 7,000 in 2013. However, preparation and evacuation procedures have been improved since then. Warnings were issued, travel was restricted, schools shut and the army was put on standby in advance. Mangkhut is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by Tuesday. How have you been affected by the typhoon? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

Ciara Nugent,"Hurricane Hector is gaining strength as it barrels through the Pacific — and could make landfall in Hawaii by the middle of the week. The hurricane, which was upgraded to a Category 4 storm late Sunday night by the National Hurricane Center (NHC), is carrying sustained winds of up to 140 miles per hour, with hurricane force winds extending 30 miles from its center. Hurricane Hector is currently 1,130 miles southeast of Big Island and moving west, according to the NHC’s latest advisory. The storm could make a direct hit near Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano, which has been spewing lava and molten rock since it erupted May 3. Meterologist James Spann said on Twitter that it was “too soon to determine what kind of impacts might occur in the state, since track errors can be large at long time ranges.” Forecasters say it is still too soon to say whether Hurricane Hector will touch down in Hawaii since the storm is still fluctuating and will likely weaken by Wednesday. The Hawaii Coast Guard has set a port condition of “WHISKEY” due to the impending storm, during which time commercial traffic and transfer operations are allowed to continue.","Hurricane Hector is gaining strength as it barrels through the Pacific — and could make landfall in Hawaii by the middle of the week.

Dell Cameron,"The head of the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday slammed wireless carriers over what he described as unsuitably slow progress in restoring communications in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael. Even though efforts to restore communications services have been going well in most of the areas affected by Hurricane Michael, the slow progress in restoring wireless service in areas close to where the hurricane made landfall is completely unacceptable, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. Saying the actions of the companies on the ground dont match the urgency conveyed by the commission, Pai announced he was joining with Florida Gov. Rick Scott in pushing a list of demands. The officials are now calling on wireless carriers to waive the monthly bills of subscribers in the affected areas, at least for the month of October, and allow them to change carriers without paying a contract penalty. Pai added that hes directed the FCCs Public Safety &amp; Homeland Security Bureau to investigate the matter. However, two of the largest carriersAT&amp;T and Verizonare at least already offering to waive the bills of those in counties struck hardest by the hurricane. Prior to the Michaels landfall as a Category 4 storm, AT&amp;T announced it would credit and waive fees for those in the affected areas. The company is currently offering credit through October 21 to subscribers in the Bay, Calhoun, Franklin, Gulf, Liberty, Taylor, and Wakulla counties. We began preparing for this storm before it arrived and our work continues today, said an AT&amp;T spokesperson, noting the company has also deployed 15 large-scale cell sites to improve coverage in the most damaged areas. Verizon is going a little further. Every customer in Bay and Gulf counties, business or consumer, will be automatically credited for 3 months of mobile service for each line, Verizon Executive VP Ronan Dunne said in a statement. Verizon came to the decision a week after Michael hit, said a spokesperson, who noted the company has never offered three months free service in the wake of a disaster before. Gizmodo has asked both T-Mobile and Sprint to respond to Pais remarks, and well update when they do. The FCC did not respond to a request for comment. Governor Scotts office could not be immediately reached. Authorities continue to assess the damage caused by Hurricane Michael. By some estimates, the death toll has reached 30, though officials warn the number of fatalities is likely to change as surveys continue in the most affected counties. Many of the Floridians who evacuated their homes in time are unable to return until after search and rescue operations have ceased. As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 158,000 power customers were without electricity, according to CNN.",The head of the Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday slammed wireless carriers over what he described as unsuitably slow progress in restoring communications in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael.

"Paola Rosa-Aquino on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","If the internet went down, America would devolve into chaos. A new study suggests that’s an increasingly likely possibility as rising sea levels submerge critical infrastructure buried along densely-populated coastlines. Thousands of miles of fiber optic cables buried underground make up what’s known as the “physical internet.” But as sea levels steadily creep up our coastlines, more and more subterranean infrastructure could become submerged. By 2033, over 4,000 miles of fiber optic cables buried along U.S. coastlines could be underwater, according to a new study presented on Monday at an internet research conference. And unlike the undersea marine cables that send data across continents, fiber optic cables along coastlines generally aren’t waterproof. “The results in the paper are startling,” Paul Barford, University of Wisconsin-Madison professor of computer science and lead author of the paper, told Earther. “There’s gonna be a great deal of infrastructure that’s gonna be underwater in the next 15 years.” To reach their findings, the researchers combined the Internet Atlas, an expansive repository of maps of physical internet infrastructure, with federal sea level rise projections across the U.S. done by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The resulting picture is pretty grim. If more than 4,000 miles of underground fiber optic cables are flooded by rising seas within the next 15 years as predicted by the study’s worst-case scenario, internet reliability for millions of Americans, especially those in coastal cities like New York and Miami, will be impacted. Powerful storms, which could be more frequent due to climate change, have already hinted at what a flooded internet infrastructure could look like. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy drowned and damaged some of New York City’s underground fiber optic cables. Researchers at the University of Southern California tied Hurricane Sandy’s landfall to a notable spike in internet outages across the country. It took about four days for internet outages return to normal. Though the world wide web, the most important application of the internet, was actually invented around about the same time as climate scientists James Hansen’s landmark 1988 testimony about global warming, no safeguards were in place to address potential damage caused by sea level rise. The new study underscores the need for deploying solutions to protect our internet infrastructure sooner rather than later. “Hopefully, our findings will alert people that we don’t have 100 years to solve this,” Barford told Earther. “We need to start looking at it very soon so that we can take steps to ensure our communication capability in the United States.” What those steps look like is still unclear. According to Barford, further research is needed to quantify just how much physical damage infrastructure will be subjected to from flooding in high-risk areas. “That will give us targets for where we need to make changes sooner rather than later,” Barford said.","If the internet went down, America would devolve into chaos.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday as the worst storm ever to hit that region and the third most intense hurricane to ever slam into the continental United States, with its minimum pressure recorded at 919 millibars (mb) on Wednesday afternoon. Michael was a Category 4 hurricane at landfall, with sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (249 km per hour). The lower the minimum pressure, the more intense the hurricane. Here are five of the most powerful hurricanes to make landfall in the mainland United States based on minimum pressure: - Florida Keys Labor Day hurricane, 1935, 892 mb The hurricane struck the Florida Keys as a Category 5, the highest ranking possible. It killed more than 200 World War One veterans who were in the Keys to build a highway. It generated wind speeds of up to 200 miles per hour (322 km per hour). After ravaging the Keys, the storm moved north off the western coast of Florida before turning inland. In all, more than 400 people died in Florida. - Hurricane Camille, 1969, 900 mb Camille struck the Mississippi Gulf Coast as a Category 5 hurricane, bringing with it devastating storm tides and strong winds that demolished buildings and destroyed orchards. More than 200 people were killed. - Hurricane Katrina, 2005, 920 mb The hurricane made a direct hit on New Orleans as a Category 3 storm, causing levees and flood walls to fail in dozens of places. Most of New Orleans was flooded, and some people who were stranded in their homes climbed to the roofs to await rescue. About 1,200 people died, according to the National Weather Service. Most victims were in Louisiana, but neighboring Mississippi also was hard hit. Katrina caused an estimated $108 billion in damage, making it the costliest hurricane ever to strike the United States. - Hurricane Andrew, 1992, 922 mb The hurricane struck South Miami-Dade County in Florida and caused an estimated $26 billion in damage. That ranked as the most expensive storm in U.S. history, until Hurricane Katrina inundated New Orleans and pummeled other parts of the U.S. South in 2005. More than a dozen people were directly killed by the storm in Florida, with others dying of indirect causes. - The Indianola, Texas hurricane, 1886, 925 mb The hurricane destroyed the Texas town of Indianola, which at the time was vying with Galveston to become the state’s main port. Several dozen people were killed in the storm, which also ended a catastrophic drought in the region.

Devika  Krishna Kumar,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (Reuters) - Hurricane Michael howled closer to Florida’s Gulf shore on Tuesday as a major Category 3 storm, and half a million coastal residents were urged to seek higher ground on the eve of a landfall forecast to bring towering waves and roof-shredding winds. Michael is projected to plow into Florida’s Panhandle at midday on Wednesday, unleashing potentially devastating waves as high as 13 feet (4 meters) that could rush inland for miles around the storm’s center, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned. By late Tuesday, Michael was causing major disruptions to U.S. oil and gas production as it churned north, gathering greater strength over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for the entire state of Florida, freeing up federal assistance to supplement state and local disaster response. The NHC said the storm was packing sustained winds of up to 120 miles per hour (195 km per hour), jumping from a Category 2 to Category 3 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson wind scale. Winds of that magnitude can inflict substantial damage to roofs and walls of even well-constructed homes, according to the National Weather Service. NHC Director Ken Graham said Michael represented a “textbook case” of a hurricane system that may grow stronger as it draws near shore, in contrast to Hurricane Florence, which struck North Carolina last month after a slow, halting approach and weakening before landfall. As of late Tuesday, storm trackers were still seeing signs of Michael intensifying. “If this trend continues overnight, people in the Florida Panhandle could wake up to having a Category 4 hurricane on their doorstep,” senior NHC hurricane specialist Stacy Stewart said during a live webcast. Hurricane-force winds extend about 40 miles from the center, with tropical storm-force winds reaching 185 miles, Graham said. The storm is likely also to dump prodigious amounts of rain over Florida, Alabama and Georgia as well as the Carolinas, which are still reeling from severe flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence. Up to a foot of rainfall (30 cm) is forecast for some areas. “This is a storm that is going to be life-threatening in several ways,” said Bo Patterson, the mayor of Port St. Joe, Florida, whose small beachfront town lies directly in the storm’s projected path. Florida Governor Rick Scott said Michael was expected to be “the most deadly, destructive storm to the Panhandle in decades.” The region should brace for “major infrastructure damage,” specifically to electricity distribution, wastewater treatment systems and transportation networks, Jeff Byard, associate administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), told reporters on a conference call. Byard said an estimated 500,000 people face evacuation orders and advisories in Florida, where residents and tourists were fleeing low-lying areas in at least 20 counties stretching along 200 miles (322 km) of shore in the Panhandle and adjacent Big Bend regions. Among them was Betty Early, 75, a retiree who joined about 300 fellow evacuees huddled on makeshift bedrolls of blankets and collapsed cardboard boxes at an elementary school converted into an American Red Cross shelter in Panama City, near the storm’s expected landfall. She was unsure how well her old, wood-framed apartment block would hold up. “I’m blessed to have a place to come,” she told Reuters. “My greatest concern is not having electricity, and living on a fixed income, losing my food.” “THIS STORM COULD KILL YOU” A hurricane warning was posted along more than 300 miles (483 km) of the coast from the Florida-Alabama border south to the Suwannee River. “If you don’t follow warnings from officials this storm could kill you,” said Scott, a Republican running for the U.S. Senate in November’s congressional elections. While the swiftly moving storm is not expected to linger over Florida for long, widespread heavy downpours will likely track inland to flood-stricken areas of the Carolinas even as rain-gorged rivers there begin to recede, National Weather Service meteorologist Ken Widelski told the conference call. “The last thing we need is more water,” said Carolyn Causey, business manager of the Trinity United Methodist Church in Conway, South Carolina. Floodwaters from Florence destroyed two of the church’s buildings and gutted three others. Some of the storm’s most significant early impact was to offshore energy production. U.S. producers in the Gulf cut oil production by about 40 percent and natural gas output by 28 percent on Tuesday, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. Scott declared a state of emergency in 35 Florida counties, mostly encompassing rural areas known for small tourist cities, beaches, wildlife reserves and Tallahassee, the state capital. Georgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency on Tuesday for 92 counties in his state. About 2,500 National Guard troops were deployed to assist with evacuations and storm preparations, and more than 4,000 others were on standby. Some 17,000 utility restoration workers were also on call. In Panhandle counties, most state offices, schools and universities were closed for the rest of the week. Lines at gasoline stations grew as people left. Those who stayed emptied grocery store shelves of water and other supplies. The last major hurricane to hit the Panhandle was Hurricane Dennis in 2005, according to hurricane center data. Torrential downpours and flash flooding from the storm over the weekend caused 13 deaths in Central America.

Devika  Krishna Kumar,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (Reuters) - Hurricane Michael howled closer to Florida’s Gulf shore on Tuesday as a major Category 3 storm, with half a million coastal residents strongly urged to seek higher ground on the eve of a landfall forecast to bring towering waves and roof-shredding winds. Michael is projected to plow into Florida’s panhandle at midday on Wednesday, unleashing potentially devastating waves of seawater as high as 13 feet (4 meters) that could rush inland for miles around the storm’s center, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned. By Tuesday, Michael was already causing major disruptions to U.S. oil and gas production as it churned north over the Gulf of Mexico. President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for the entire state of Florida, freeing up federal assistance to supplement state and local disaster response. At latest report, the NHC said the storm was packing sustained winds of up to 120 miles per hour (195 km per hour), jumping from a Category 2 to Category 3 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson wind scale. Winds of that magnitude can inflict substantial damage to roofs and walls of even well-constructed homes, according to the National Weather Service. The storm also is likely to dump prodigious amounts of rain over Florida, Alabama and Georgia, and on the Carolinas which are still reeling from severe flooding last month in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence. Up to a foot of rainfall (30 cm) is forecast for some areas. “This is a storm that is going to be life-threatening in several ways,” said Bo Patterson, the mayor of Port St. Joe, Florida, whose small beachfront town lies directly in the storm’s projected path. Florida Governor Rick Scott said Michael was expected to be “the most deadly, destructive storm to the panhandle in decades.” The region should brace for “major infrastructure damage,” specifically to electricity distribution, wastewater treatment systems and transportation networks, Jeff Byard, associate administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), told reporters on a conference call.

The church saw two of its buildings destroyed and three others gutted by floodwaters from Florence. Some of the storm’s most significant early impact was to offshore energy production. U.S. producers in the Gulf cut oil production by about 40 percent and natural gas output by 28 percent on Tuesday, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said, citing reports from 27 companies. The Gulf accounts for 17 percent of daily U.S. crude oil output and 5 percent of daily gas production, according to government figures. The partial shutdown ahead of Michael helped drive oil prices slightly higher on Tuesday. Scott declared a state of emergency in 35 counties, mostly encompassing rural areas known for small tourist cities, beaches, wildlife reserves and the state capital, Tallahassee. Georgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency on Tuesday for 92 counties in his state. FEMA has deployed numerous disaster response teams to the region, with about 2,500 National Guard troops assisting, and more than 4,000 others were on standby.

Lines at gasoline stations grew as people left. Those who stayed emptied grocery store shelves of water and other supplies. Gary Givens, owner of Gary’s Oyster Shack in Panama City, Florida, said he was closing his restaurant around lunchtime on Tuesday but planned to stay put rather than evacuate because he owns two businesses in the area. “I just got a crew that came in that are staying also and they’re in here helping me get everything buttoned up, tightened down, getting the food secure,” Givens said. Some Panama City residents were on the beach enjoying a cool breeze ahead of the storm, while others were loading up cars with luggage, and visitors were checking out of hotels.

ABC News,"Five days after Hurricane Harvey slammed into the southern coast of Texas, William Weeks came face to face with his worst nightmare. Interested in ABC News Features? Add ABC News Features as an interest to stay up to date on the latest ABC News Features news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Just a month before, he and his wife, Danielle Weeks, had been giddy as they moved their two young daughters into an RV park in Port Aransas, Texas. Living by the beach had been their dream, and with another baby on the way, they felt things were finally falling into place. After the storm hit, Weeks made his way to his family’s home for the first time. What he found were the remnants of that life, remnants of everything he had worked for. He struggled to make his way through the park, where trailers had been tossed around like toys. He and his mother found his family’s home on its side, wedged between a tree and a car, two parking spots from where he left it. Most of the contents — from fishing rods and spatulas, to bathing suits and children’s books — were on the ground, covered in mud. From the debris, his mother plucked the dress his 5-year-old daughter, Annabella, wore to her first day of kindergarten. Emblazoned with an anchor, it was a gift from her and a nod to what was meant to be the family’s new life by the beach. In tears, Weeks added the dress to a pile of other belongings he managed to salvage, including some of 1-year-old Alizabeth’s toys and books. “When you’re actually there, looking at it, looking at your belongings all over the ground, you just cry,” Weeks told ABC News. “It was almost like a war zone,” he added. “I’ve never been through anything like that before.” Just the day before, his wife had given birth to the couple’s third child, Loralynn. He was still wearing a hospital bracelet on his wrist. “It was intense, crazy, different emotions — from bottom-of-the-barrel sad to giving birth to a new baby that brought so much hope,” he said. Now — like more than 70,000 other Texans displaced by Harvey, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency — he would have to find a new place for his young family to live. William Weeks looks at the site of his destroyed home in Port Aransas, Texas five days after Hurricane Harvey made landfall. ‘We were just being hopeful’ The tumultuous two weeks that would dramatically change the Weeks’ lives started on Friday, Aug. 25. Hurricane Harvey was barreling toward the Corpus Christi area of Texas, forecast to be a Category 3 storm or stronger when it made landfall. Only 40 hours before, the National Weather Service had predicted the storm would hit as a tropical depression. But it was gaining strength as it moved toward the coast. The Weeks family scrambled to prepare. Aside from securing their new home, the family faced a more pressing challenge. Danielle Weeks was nine months pregnant and had been advised by her doctors not to travel far from Corpus Christi, where she had a cesarean section scheduled for the following week. If she missed her C-section because of the storm, it could put her life and her baby’s life in danger. But if she went into labor early, during the hurricane, it could also prove dangerous. So the young family made a last-minute decision to leave their RV in Port Aransas and ride out the storm at a Holiday Inn in downtown Corpus Christi. “We thought it would do a little bit of damage to the trailer,” Danielle Weeks told ABC News. “I guess we were just being hopeful.” Harvey was the family’s first hurricane and, as it came closer to landfall, she wondered what would become of their home. “We’ve lived in Texas pretty much all of our lives. So Port A was always our vacation home,” Danielle Weeks said. “We honeymooned here after our wedding. It had always been our dream to move down here one day, and we were finally able to do that.” The angst they felt about their choice to leave the RV behind was palpable. “We’re pretty worried that we won’t have a home to go back to,” she said choking up as she sat on her bed in the Holiday Inn. Annabella Weeks, 5, poses outside her elementary school in Port Aransas, Texas for her first day of school. That evening, Harvey made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. Storm surges in the town of Port Aransas were recorded to be at least 6 feet, according to the National Weather Service. “As the storm moved through, it sounded like it was a train going through our balcony,” William Weeks recalled. “You could hear the balcony door vibrating due to the winds. [We] got close to putting a mattress up. It was intense. I don’t think many of us got sleep that night.” The couple tried to stay cheerful for the children, who had no idea what was happening outside. “The kids slept through it,” Danielle Weeks said. “At their age, they don’t really know what was going on,” William Weeks said. “It was more a vacation. They were upset that the pool was closed.” ‘Hoping for the best but expecting the worst’ The next morning, Aransas County awoke to find close to 80 percent of its buildings were damaged, ABC Corpus Christi affiliate KIII-TV reported. The neighboring community of Rockport, where the storm made direct landfall, saw roofs torn off stores, brick walls blown out and a total communications blackout after local cellphone towers went down. Immediately after the storm, Port Aransas did not get as much media attention as Rockport. The Weeks family struggled to find information about what became of their town — and the little that trickled out was not good. ""People who stayed, who didn’t leave the island, were saying that it was destroyed,” William Weeks said. “The anticipation of not knowing was getting to us,” Danielle Weeks said. So on Saturday afternoon, close to 24 hours after Harvey’s landfall, the family decided to try to check on their home. ABC News accompanied them on the drive. Rockport, Texas has been hard hit by Hurricane Harvey's wrath of torrential rain and high wind, Aug. 26. 2017. “I’m hoping for the best but expecting the worst,” Danielle Weeks said in the car on the way there. “I just hope that if it is the worst, we can at least get some of our stuff I didn’t think to pack or we didn’t have room to pack.” When they reached the outer limits of Port Aransas, they were stopped at a police checkpoint. An officer walked up to the Weeks’ car window. “We’ve got an active search-and-rescue going on right now. No one’s allowed in until that’s taken care of,” the officer said. “We have a list of about a hundred people that we’re still trying to find.” Shocked, William Weeks turned to his wife, who was wiping away tears. “I’m just worried about all the people they’re looking for,” Danielle Weeks said. “Like I said, our belongings can wait or be replaced. People’s lives can’t.” Then 5-year-old Annabella began to cry in the backseat. “She didn’t really understand that a storm had come and our house was potentially damaged,” Danielle Weeks later said. “It was heartbreaking seeing her upset. And I didn’t know how I could explain to her why we couldn’t go in there.” “I think that’s the worst part as a parent,” she added. “When something comes up and you have no control over how it affects your kids.” The family was forced to turn back, but authorities allowed ABC News to enter Port Aransas. William Weeks gave ABC News permission to check on his home. Danielle Weeks looks sadly out the window of her car after being told by authorities that there is an active search-and-rescue going on in Port Aransas, Texas and she and her family are not allowed to come into town limits to check on their home. The RV had been thrown onto its side and slammed up against a tree, and its contents had spilled everywhere. ABC News recorded the scene and took the video back to the family. “I could see my kids’ stuff outside on the ground, and my house was turned over on its side,” Danielle Weeks recalled, in tears. On Monday the couple decided to focus on applying for assistance, as more than 13,000 of people in Port Aransas would, according to FEMA. While William Weeks sat on hold on the phone, Danielle Weeks filled out the online paperwork. It was just 24 hours before her scheduled C-section. “I’m excited to see her and get to hold her,” Danielle Weeks said of her baby while filling out the paperwork. “But at the same time, it’s a very overwhelming feeling knowing that I don’t have a home to take her to and that her big sisters are without a place to stay right now too.” At her feet, Annabella played with tiny Smurf dolls on a carousel, absorbed in her own little world. Annabella Weeks, 5, plays with toys on the floor of her hotel room while her parents apply for FEMA disaster assistance. ‘The happiness we needed after the down’ The next day, the joy of their new baby temporarily put the stress of homelessness on hold. At 7:30 a.m., Danielle Weeks was wheeled into surgery at a Corpus Christi hospital, and 41 minutes later, Loralynn Cole Weeks was born. “Light at the end of the tunnel for us. The happiness we needed after the down,” William Weeks said of the birth of his daughter. “She was a blessing.” William Weeks followed the nurse, beaming with happiness, as baby Loralynn was brought out of surgery. “I just stared at her and thanked God she was OK,” he said. “Just an amazing little baby. Precious.” All eyes were glued to the family’s newest addition as she met her sisters, Annabella and Alizabeth Weeks. Annabella scrunched up her face in glee as she held her for the first time. Alizabeth poked Loralynn as she slept, unsure of what this new creature would mean for her status as the baby of the family. “That’s the only thing that matters — our family,” Danielle Weeks said. “Making sure that we all stay together.” “Everything else is replaceable,” William Weeks said. William Weeks spends time with his newborn daughter, Loralynn, in the nursery room of Christus Spohn Hospital Corpus Christi South in Corpus Christi, Texas. ‘There’s no fixing it’ The next day, William Weeks went to meet a FEMA representative at his RV. It was the first time he would see his home with his own eyes. His mother went with him. He called his wife in tears as he picked up the pieces of their lives. ""All sides, demolished. There’s no fixing it. It’s history. It’s a goner. Everything is,” he told his wife over the phone, who was still recovering in the maternity ward. “I found Bella’s first outfit for school,” he added, his voice cracking. “We’re bringing it back with us.” A neighbor offered to make a hole in the RV with his chainsaw so William Weeks could collect what he could from inside. He put everything he wanted to save on a toy wagon. Only a few things had survived. “It’s even hard to put it in words,” William Weeks later said. “Your heart drops. It was hard.” “I was worried,"" Danielle Weeks said. ""What were we going to do?” Steve and Candice Nelson of Durango, Colorado talk about how they learned of the Weeks' plight on T.V. and how they decided to help. ‘All the things a family needs’ Two states away, in a polar opposite climate full of ski slopes and cabins, the Nelson family watched the Weeks’ plight on TV. “When we heard the story on ABC, we just kinda — I blurted it out, I think. I just said, ‘Why don’t we just give them it? Give them the tiny house,’"" Steve Nelson later told ABC News. Steve and his wife, Candice Nelson, own a construction company, Nelson Builders, in Durango, Colorado. The couple had been experimenting with building tiny homes. “It’s got all the things that a family needs, obviously,” Steve Nelson said of the dwellings, which are a few hundred square feet but contain a kitchen, bathroom and sleeping lofts. The Nelsons had built a predesigned tiny home as a way to work with the local authorities to see if their prototypes would pass local code. “I remember when I was still in the hospital having [my daughter] Aspen and not having anything to worry about except for having a child,” Candice Nelson told ABC News. “And I couldn’t imagine being there, trying to be happy about my child coming in, thinking about all the things I don’t have and how am I going to take care of this child?” “We literally said, ‘Well, I don’t know what I would do if that was us,’” she added. A 330-square-foot home had been sitting vacant in their driveway for weeks. They found that many buyers who wanted tiny homes preferred to customize them instead of buy predesigned ones, so the prototype likely wouldn't sell. They decided to contact ABC News on Twitter. “Would like to donate a 330 sqft tiny house to this family. Please let us know if you can help us do that,” Nelson Builders tweeted to ABC. After asking permission from the Weeks family, ABC News replied to Nelson Builders in a direct message on Twitter and provided William Weeks’ cellphone number. “At that moment, we didn’t know if it was going to happen, but it definitely brought back a lot of hope for us,” William Weeks recalled. The Nelsons set out to furnish the tiny house before driving the more than 1,000 miles from their home to Corpus Christi to deliver it. They said their church, restaurants in Durango and friends chipped in and donated a mattress and other household items. “It wasn’t an easy trip. We were on two-lane highways for most of it,” Steve Nelson said, laughing. “It was a journey.” When William Weeks heard that the Nelsons, whom he had never met, were on their way with the house, he said he felt a surge of hope. “At that point is when it really sank in for me,” he said. “And I was like, holy moly, it’s real!” On Sunday, Sept. 10 — more than two weeks after Hurricane Harvey made landfall — the Nelson family pulled the brand new tiny house into the Corpus Christi RV park that would soon become the Weeks family’s new home. “We felt good when we got there and we saw the family and their faces lit up at the house,” Candice Nelson said. “And the kids were so happy.” The exchange was brief: Both families said they remembered feeling overwhelmed by the moment. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” William Weeks said on the day. “It means more to us than we can say in words,” his wife said, her voice cracking. William Weeks said the tiny house gave them the ability to move on with their lives after Harvey. “It was a great feeling, from being basically at the bottom to where is our life going, to OK, now we have a game plan, now we can start getting everything lined out,” he said. For the Nelsons, it was a way to put their craft to work helping others. “We wish we had a fleet of tiny houses we could just give to people,” Candice Nelson said with a smile. “That would be nice. Maybe someday.” The tiny house donated to the Weeks family by Nelson Builders from Durango, Colorado. ‘It’s finally starting to feel like home’ Today, it’s as if the massive Category 4 storm was a lifetime ago. Annabella is enrolled at a local elementary school, where she said she loves the library and the playground. She is taking a speech therapy class, and her mom said the 5-year-old is making big strides. While Annabella is at school, Danielle Weeks stays home with Alizabeth and Loralynn. On the first floor of their tiny home, there’s a futon next to the door with a TV on the opposite wall. A few steps farther inside is a full kitchen with a stove and oven and a bathroom behind it. Above the kitchen and futon, there are two lofts on either side of the house, which the family uses as bedrooms. “Being a stay-at-home mom is my job, so I guess I have my office back,” Danielle Weeks said with a laugh. The Weeks family outside their new tiny home on October 31, 2017 in Corpus Christi, Texas. In December, the Weeks family put a little Christmas tree in the corner in preparation for their first holiday there. William Weeks said he decided to take some time off from work after the storm to help his wife and kids settle into their new life. He had been working in a town three hours away, and said he didn’t think it was feasible to continue that schedule during their transition. “I’m looking at a couple different options,” he said. He had worked as a project foreman before and said he figured the area would likely need his expertise once the cleanup period is over.

Danielle Weeks said she knew life was returning to normal when Annabella made a casual comment after school one day. “She came in and put her backpack down and said, ‘It’s finally starting to feel like home,’” Danielle Weeks said. “And that’s when I knew we would be OK.” Annabella even has her kindergarten dress with the little anchor back. Two months after landfall, Danielle Weeks held it up, and it looked brand new. “We put it through a washing machine twice, double soap on the second load,” William Weeks said. “It was a little challenge.” “I’m glad he saved it,” Danielle Weeks said with a smile. Danielle Weeks holds up Annabella's old first day of kindergarten dress after being thoroughly cleaned. It had been found amongst the wreckage of their destroyed home. As they reflected on the summer that changed their lives, Danielle and William Weeks said they believe Harvey brought them closer and made them stronger. “Our family definitely came out stronger,” Danielle Weeks said. “Me and Willy came out stronger as a couple. I came out stronger as a person.” “You never know what Mother Nature is going to throw at you,” William Weeks said. “It definitely showed there’s still great people in this world, that people still do care about other people,"" Danielle Weeks said.

Alejandro de la Garza,"Florida Gov. Rick Scott said Sunday that he will declare a state of emergency as the strengthening Tropical Storm Michael looks set to bear down on the state’s western coast. “Our state understands how serious tropical weather is and how devastating any hurricane or tropical storm can be,” Governor Scott tweeted. “As we continue to monitor this storm’s path toward Florida, it is critically important that our communities have every available resource to keep everyone safe.” With satellite data showing maximum sustained wind speeds of 40 mph, the National Hurricane Center upgraded what had formerly been called Tropical Depression 14 to tropical storm status early Sunday afternoon. The storm is expected to strengthen to hurricane status before making a predicted landfall in the western Florida Panhandle on Wednesday. Governor Scott has said that he plans to declare a state of emergency in counties in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend. The storm was reported to be about 90 miles south of Cozumel, Mexico, midday Sunday. A tropical storm warning has been declared for the provinces of Pinar del Rio and the Isle of Youth in Cuba as well as along the Mexican coast from Tulum to Cabo Catoche “If any Florida family doesn’t have an emergency preparedness plan, now is the time to act,” the governor said in a press release. “Floridians also know just how quickly the path of a storm can change and that’s why we all must be vigilant and get prepared today.”","Florida is preparing for Tropical Storm Michael, expected to make landfall on Wednesday",2018-10-07T19:04:34Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Florida Governor Rick Scott to Declare State of Emergency in Advance of Tropical Storm Michael,http://time.com/5418066/florida-rick-scott-state-of-emergency-tropical-storm-michael/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/rick-scott-hurricane.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,landfall,1

"USA TODAY, Kristin Lam, USA TODAY","Gov. Rick Scott warned of a 'monstrous storm' along Florida's coast and asked residents to heed evacuation orders for Hurricane Michael, which is expected to make landfall on Wednesday. (Oct. 8) AP USA TODAY (Photo: USA TODAY) Hurricane Michael is expected to make landfall somewhere on the Florida Panhandle by Wednesday afternoon, creating potentially life-threatening conditions from the Alabama-Florida state line all the way eastward to the Suwannee River. Whether Michael lands near Tallahassee or closer to Panama City Beach, Dennis Feltgen of the National Hurricane Center told USA TODAY that everybody in the hurricane warning and watch areas should be on alert. ""We don't want anybody to get hung up on, 'Well, is the storm going to go over this city or is it going over that city?' that's immaterial here,"" Feltgen said. ""You need to be looking at the overall impacts of the hurricane."" Around the skinny black line used on tracker maps, representing the hurricane's projected path, the ""cone of uncertainty"" shows the average track forecast error in the last five years. Feltgen said impacts, such as those from storm surge and inland flooding, extend outside of that cone. More: 'Potentially catastrophic' Hurricane Michael charges toward Florida Panhandle The accuracy of track forecasts has improved in the past 10 to 15 years to the point where the five-day forecast for Hurricane Florence in September was only off by two miles. ""Little wiggles"" or variations in a storm's track by 20 or 30 miles to the left or right, however, can change impacts, Feltgen said. They cannot be predicted far in advance. To determine the track forecast for advisories issued every six hours, experts at the hurricane center use computer-generated models to process data collected by reconnaissance aircraft. Jets such as the NOAA G-IV sample the atmosphere around and ahead of the hurricane. Experienced specialists consider which models work best for different situations and factors, such as intensity. Last Slide Next Slide Hurricanes can change paths because surrounding weather patterns steer them. For example, Hurricane Florence stalled when it made landfall because weather systems around it were in equilibrium. For Hurricane Michael, a distinct trough of low pressure in the mid- and upper-part of the atmosphere will push the storm, Feltgen said. ""Unlike Florence, Michael will be on the move,"" he said. ""This is not going to be a lingering storm. This trough of low pressure will actually help guide the storm from the Florida Panhandle, up through Georgia, up through the Carolinas, and then push it out into the Atlantic."" More: Evacuations ordered as monstrous Hurricane Michael approaches Florida More: Hurricane Florence leaves a trail of tragedy and lessons The Pensacola News Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported Monday that Michael was likely to make landfall somewhere between Pensacola in the far western Panhandle and Apalachicola, directly south of Tallahassee on the coast. Officials in Bay and Walton counties, both along the Panhandle, are among those that have issued mandatory evacuations. Hurricane Opal, in 1995, was the last major hurricane to hit the two counties. Not including tourists, 130,000 are ordered to evacuate starting at 6 a.m. Tuesday, Joby Smith, chief of Bay County's emergency management division, told USA TODAY. Two shelters for general and special needs populations will open at 10 a.m. If the storm makes landfall to the west, Bay County will face unprecedented storm surge concerns, particularly in bay system areas. If Michael comes through the east, severe weather will be the main issue. Either way, Smith said the county will be worried about power outages and delayed emergency services. The area of Panama City Beach, for example, is isolated by high-rise bridges that will close because of high winds. With about 20 miles of beach on the Gulf of Mexico, Smith said the county has a lot of exposure. Low-lying areas, heavily affected by flash floods and severely damaged by Hurricane Opal, are especially vulnerable. The emergency evacuation order begins at 7 a.m. Tuesday in nearby Walton County, covering low-lying zones as well as coastal and waterfront areas, Emergency Management spokesperson Louis Svehla told USA TODAY. At that time, a pet-friendly shelter for general and special needs populations will open. A storm surge of 5 to 9 feet is expected to effect the entire south county area, Svehla said, representing the county's primary concern. Its more densely populated coastline spans 26 miles and is a top tourist destination with high-value properties. The secondary concern is wind safety, especially in the rural majority of the county where power lines are above ground. Gusts could knock down trees and cripple utilities, Svehla said. Although Hurricane Michael may be the county's first major hurricane in 23 years, Svehla said emergency services monitors storms that come close every hurricane season. He remembered how Hurricane Irma was predicted to hit Walton County, but took an eastern turn at the last minute. ""Our procedures don't change,"" Svehla said. ""Whether it hits us or not, we're prepared when we see it coming and we plan as if it's going to hit us. So, this isn't anything that's new to us.""

Reuters Editorial,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production is returning to near normal levels three days after Hurricane Michael made landfall on the Florida Panhandle, data from an offshore regulator showed on Saturday, with oil output off 19 percent and natural gas production down less than 10 percent. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) also said in an midday update that only one evacuated production platform was still unoccupied, down from 89 platforms on Wednesday. It can take several days after a storm passes to inspect platforms for damages, fully return crews and restore production after wells are shut-in ahead of a storm. Michael entered the Gulf as a tropical storm and quickly spun into a major hurricane, producing rough seas and winds of up to 155 miles per hour (250 kph) when it made landfall near Panama City, Florida, on Wednesday. As of midday on Saturday, the storm had left at least 18 dead in four Southeast U.S. states and damages to communities in its path were estimated in the billions of dollars. It was one of the most powerful storms recorded in U.S. history. The Gulf production still offline on Saturday morning represented 330,394 barrels per day of oil production and 247 million cubic feet per day of natural gas output, BSEE reported from a survey of 17 oil and gas producers. In all, Michael cost Gulf producers about 3.27 million barrels of oil this week. Offshore production in federal waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico accounts for 17 percent of total U.S. crude output and 5 percent of national natural gas production, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. BSEE said its Saturday survey of producers showed that all drilling rigs and vessels that had been evacuated or moved to safer areas of the Gulf ahead of the storm were reoccupied and back at their drilling positions.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","It’s the summer of apocalypse weather with wildfires, heat waves, and drought. But it looks like we could be granted a reprieve from the fourth horseman of the weather apocalypse—hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration updated its hurricane forecast on Thursday, and hey, good news. Due to a burgeoning El Niño, it’s likely that the rest of Atlantic hurricane season will be quieter than normal. It only takes one hurricane to do damage, though, and the peak of hurricane season is still ahead, so we’re not out of the woods yet. The forecast calls for 4-7 hurricanes, of which up to two could become major ones with winds of Category 3 or greater strength. All told, NOAA is forecasting there will be 9-13 named storms. That includes tropical storms, hurricanes’ weaker sibling (though they can still dump copious amounts of rain). Overall, forecasters give this season 60 percent odds of being less active than usual, a huge uptick from the 25 percent forecast issued in May. Saharan dust has played a role in tamping down activity, as have cooler-than-normal waters in the part of the Atlantic where tropical storms and hurricanes tend to form. But the biggest reason forecasters think this year could be quiet is the creeping presence of an El Niño, which is characterized by warm waters in the eastern tropical Pacific. Those warm waters kickstart a series of changes in the atmosphere, including powerful upper level winds that cut across the Atlantic hurricane basin and tear storms apart or prevent them from spinning up at all. Some storm systems will inevitably defy the odds, though, which is why forecasters continue to urge anyone living near the coast to stay vigilant. “There are still more storms to come—the hurricane season is far from being over,” Gerry Bell, NOAA’s lead seasonal hurricane forecaster, said in a statement. This Atlantic hurricane season has been a bit of a weird one so far. It started a few days early when a subtropical storm (yet another flavor of hurricane-like weather) formed in the Gulf of Mexico. Said storm then turned tropical as it passed over land and basically made landfall again on the Great Lakes, all of which is extremely not normal. Three other storms have formed including tiny ass Hurricane Beryl, the first hurricane of the season. The lower odds of a season of horrors like last year are a welcome forecast if ever there was one even with the statistical peak of hurricane season still ahead and the official end months away.","It’s the summer of apocalypse weather with wildfires, heat waves, and drought.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Religious persecution has forced thousands of Rohingya people to flee their homes in Myanmar for Bangladesh over the past 11 months. Now the 900,000 people who settled in refugee camps near Cox’s Bazar are facing another threat: heavy rain and landslides as the monsoon season picks up. The monsoon has been dubbed one of the most important climate patterns in the world. The rains spread from southeast to northwest over the course of the summer, nourishing fields across South Asia that provide food for many of the 1.76 billion people who live there. But they also pose an existential threat to refugees. As the refugee camps swelled, the forests in and around them quickly vanished as people sought wood for housing and building fires to cook. Makeshift structures of bamboo and tarps sprung up. Ditches were also dug for sanitation. Now with the onset of monsoon season, the haphazard infrastructure and lack of ground cover has put people living in the camps in grave danger as the rains have picked up. “Last week there was a strong monsoon depression over North Bay of Bengal which cause heavy rains over Cox Bazar area,” Nachiketa Acharya, a climate scientist at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society, told Earther. The United Nations reported that more than 15 inches of rain fell between Sunday and Tuesday, the equivalent of what normally falls over 20 days in June. With no trees to slow the runoff, 37 landslides occurred that affected 11,000 people. The Guardian indicates at least three are dead following the rains. Aerial mapping done by the United Nations shows an estimated 200,000 refugees could be at risk of landslides and floods, and more than 41,000 of them are living in areas with a high risk of landslides. In addition to the physical dangers, waterborne diseases are a growing risk, particularly without adequate sanitation. Acharya said the forecast for the rest of the monsoon season indicates increased odds of more rainfall that normal. That increases the risk of landslides, which is why the United Nations is pushing ahead for what they’re referring to as “mid-term shelters” with concrete moorings built on flat ground that can withstand the heavy rains and some landslides. “We need government approval for mid-term shelters and in view of the current weather and urgency to quickly provide more shelters to relocate families most at risk of landslides, we are focussing [sic] on this right now,” Caroline Gluck, a senior public information officer with the United Nations High Commission on Refugees in Cox’s Bazar, told Earther. The agency has also been working to help get families upgraded shelter kits including tarps, wire, rope, and bamboo. These kits have been supplied to more than 185,000 households. While they offer a modicum more security against the rains, they’re no match for landslides or winds that could come if a tropical cyclone hits the camp—a distinct risk. According to data maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 63 tropical systems have passed within 100 nautical miles of Cox’s Bazar. The most recent to make a nearby landfall was a tropical depression that hit in October 2011. One of the biggest impediments to speeding the whole process up is money. Earlier this year, the United Nations requested $951 million to “meet the immediate needs of more than 880,000 refugees and over 330,000 Bangladeshis in communities affected by the crisis.” Of that $136.6 million would be used for shelters. To date, only 13 percent of that funding has been provided.","Religious persecution has forced thousands of Rohingya people to flee their homes in Myanmar for Bangladesh over the past 11 months.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Well that escalated quickly. Hurricane Aletta became the first tropical storm of the eastern Pacific hurricane season on Thursday, and by Friday morning it had spun up into a Category 4 monster. The storm might not be done ramping up, either. The meteorological marvel is thankfully not forecast to make landfall (though rip currents and swells are possible along Mexico’s west coast this weekend), which means we can safely gawk at its beastly nature. The storm’s rise has been a swift one. It became a tropical storm on Wednesday and puttered around throughout the day. But things changed in a big way on Thursday into Friday. At 3 p.m. local time on Thursday, the storm became the first hurricane of the eastern Pacific season as a Category 1 storm with 75 mph winds. The storm’s location—in the open ocean with no interference from land—and warm waters for fuel are what caused Aletta to blow up. By 9 a.m. local time on Friday, it had ballooned into a Category 4 storm with 140 mph winds. That 65 mph increase in less than 24 hours more than meets the criteria for rapid intensification, a meteorological term for when a storm’s windspeed increases at least 35 mph in a day. Even the National Hurricane Center (NHC) seems a bit agog at what happened with Aletta. “The remarkable intensification of Aletta has continued through this morning,” forecasters wrote in their most recent update about the storm. “The short-range intensity forecast is particularly difficult since there are no obvious reasons why Aletta should cease intensification.” The forecast calls for Aletta’s winds to pick up a little more speed to 145 mph before it hits rough steering winds that will tear it back down to a tropical storm by the end of the weekend. Aletta may be a beast, but the eastern Pacific is no stranger to explosively powerful storms. You may remember that this same region spawned Hurricane Patricia—the most intense hurricane ever recorded—back in 2015. That storm rapidly intensified, peaking with winds at a mind boggling 215 mph (well above the 155 mph Category 5 threshold). Rapid intensification was also a hot topic last year during Atlantic hurricane season. Four storms blew up in the Atlantic last year, including Maria. How climate change affects rapid intensification is an active area of research. Some studies indicate the most intense storms are becoming, well, more intense in parts of the Atlantic. Other findings suggest climate change could cause Atlantic hurricanes to rapidly intensify more often as they approach land. Eastern Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 and after three weeks of relative quiet, it appears to be waking up. Another storm is on the horizon. NHC has an eye on an area of clouds and thunderstorms currently sitting off the coast of Central America that has a 90 percent chance of organizing into a tropical system in the next 48 hours, which would be named Bud. Early signs indicate that the storm could pose more of a threat to land, potentially getting sucked into the Southwest.","Well that escalated quickly.

Back at PC Zone magazine, where I was born out of an egg, it was my job to take the raw copy submitted by our freelance writers, strip out most of the sexism and veiled threats against politicians, and produce a polished and well structured review that was legally fit for publication. One of the most commonly deleted and cliched introductions to any game about a war (which was almost every game back then) went as thus. War, huh? What is it good for? Well, this game for a start. If youve never read those words in that order before, send a thank you card to your nearest editor today.
I can still picture the freelancers wide-eyes and self-satisfied grin as they smashed the enter key, confident that they had just invented a cool and original way to begin a review about wars. Bam! Now theres an opening line, they would say, half laughing to themselves in disbelief that the very first thought that occured to them could be so brilliant, so perfect. Then they would lean back in their chair and run their hands through their hair like Christian Bale having just done a murder. I know this because I was that writer, once. Asking what war is good for and then saying its the game youre writing about is a rite of passage for any games journalist, like finding out that youre not allowed to use the words gameplay or visceral, even when youre talking about guts spilling out.
But that being said, war! Huh? How about that war? Its okay right? Everyone loves a bit of a war, with all of those war people charging into one another, bludgeoning each other to death in an unstoppable maelstrom of injury and violence. War is excellent, and Ill tell you what its good for actually. Totally Accurate Battle Simulator. Its a wonky physics-based pile-on simulator in which you lay down an army of units and set them off to do battle with the enemy in super short skirmishes. If your Twitter timeline is anything like mine, youll have already seen endless gifs of various units facing off against one another: archers versus spearmen, swordsmen versus flying Valkyries, a couple of vikings carrying a longboat on their shoulders versus a wooly mammoth. 
Its rock paper scissors with a few dozen more iterations, with units drawn from a set of categories from fantasy, history and beyond. Youre presented with a strategic aerial view of the battlefield, the enemy formation already in place on the right hand side of the screen, and tasked with placing units on the other half using the limited currency at your disposal. There are some expensive, superpowered fighters the actual Zeus, long-range catapults, and crow-flinging scarecrows are all pricey enough that often you cant use them and some low-level weaklings whose strength usually lies in their numbers. Will an army of 80 hobbits overpower a pair of stone mages? Can a single minotaur destroy a dozen archers who use snakes instead of arrows? Its Total War meets the childhood-slash-stoner argument of Who Would Win In a Fight Between.
Hit the start button and youll find out quickly enough, the physics engine clattering into life as your spawned army noodles its way across the arena like haunted marionettes, haphazardly swinging and slashing like theyre a bunch of Deus Ex: Infinity War era ragdolls. Its a mad circus of limbs. Corpses pile up, bodies are sent hurtling through the air, guys in wheelbarrows sprint over cliff edges, and its all set to pained screams that somebody has clearly recorded in their bedroom. At some stage in development it was decided that every soldier would have a pair of ridiculous googly eyes, and to be honest its that dumb little detail that makes the carnage so stupidly fun to watch unfold.
Battles are swift, and usually over in less than a minute. If your selection of fighters isnt up to the task, you can clear the board in a single click and try with an entirely different set of recruits, or tweak the setup youve already got, but in practice theres very little strategy to unpick here. Fights are over with so quickly that its fun to just experiment with the units at your disposal, laying down a thick cavalry of cheap squires or piling all of your currency into one lighting-bolt chucking demigod, just to see what happens.
The early access version of game feels barebones, but has the makings of a campaign, which for now comprises a series of head-to-head battles against enemy armies of different types and configurations. Sometimes theyll be bale-armoured farmers hiding in fields, or shielded mages spilling out of the mouth of a cave. Theres also a series of tutorial battles that introduce each of the factions in turn, from the prehistoric and medieval through to Roman and Viking units. And then theres a challenge mode, which is very similar to the other two except a little trickier, with some more cunning enemy unit placements to outwit. 
Youll finish most of the missions in a few hours, but progressing through them isnt the objective of the game. Totally Accurate Battle Simulator has the depth and longevity of a desk toy, but also the appeal of a desk toy, inviting you to fidget and experiment with its flailing silliness over and over again, and calling you back to it when youre bored of whatever else it is you do at your PC thats so important. Totally Accurate Battle Simulator is utterly pointless, but great, a futile waste of time that is still primally entertaining for anyone whos watching, just like war, or masturbation, or reruns of Friends.",Premature Evaluation is the weekly column in which Steve Hogarty explores the wilds of early access.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"In September, following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Congress approved $15 billion in relief aid. Lawmakers signed off on another $36.5 billion for storm and wildfires assistance in October, after weeks of criticism leveled against the Trump administration for its response to Maria in Puerto Rico. The $90 billion disaster relief package outlined on Wednesday also includes aid for communities affected by hurricanes or wildfires in California, Florida, Texas and the Virgin Islands. When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in 2005, Congress approved $10 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency four days later, and another $50 billion six days later. The federal government is still spending money on Katrina assistance, more than 12 years after the storm’s landfall. Before Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in nearly a century, the island was already grappling with insolvency. The government declared a form of bankruptcy last May, after years of borrowing money to pay for operating expenses after a painful recession that began in 2006. The relief package sets aside $4.8 billion for Medicaid in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, helping to avoid a looming shortfall that could have left some 600,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in Puerto Rico without health insurance by April. Puerto Rican leaders worried some of the people left uninsured would migrate to the mainland seeking coverage. Compared to the states, territories receive only a fraction of funding for entitlement programs. The Senate deal would waive the requirement for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to share in the cost of Medicaid for two years, placing the funding responsibility on the federal government instead. Louisiana received the same reprieve after Hurricane Katrina, but for only one year, said Representative Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting delegate in Congress. Lawmakers approved relief packages for 10 years after that storm, she noted. Puerto Rico is not that far removed yet from Hurricane Maria. “Receiving these funds is important, and that will demonstrate that Puerto Rico will use them wisely and with transparency,” she said. “That’s an important issue here: We can be a model for how to invest in infrastructure on the island.” Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló, said the $2 billion earmarked for power restoration in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could help his island harden its battered grid. While funds from the previous aid packages went to FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers, the latest relief package will give money directly to the Puerto Rican government. Twenty-eight percent of Puerto Ricans — more than 400,000 utility customers — still do not have power more than four months after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico. “With these resources, we can begin rebuilding our housing and energy future, putting Puerto Rico on a new path forward,” Mr. Rosselló said in a statement.

Alejandro de la Garza,"Hurricane Florence, once a Category 4 storm, was downgraded to Category 1 before it made landfall near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina early Friday morning. But experts say that despite the apparent demotion, Hurricane Florence still stands to be a destructive and deadly storm for those in its path. “Just because the wind speeds came down … please do not let your guard down,” Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Brock Long said at a press conference Thursday, during which he highlighted dangers like flooding from storm surge. “This is a very dangerous storm. Storm surge is why many of you have been placed under evacuation and we are asking citizens to please heed a warning. Your time is running out.” Indeed, Hurricane Florence’s rapid downgrade from a Category 4 to a Category 1 underscores what some say is a public safety issue with the way hurricanes are measured and discussed. Hurricanes are categorized using what’s called the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which takes only a single measurement into account: the speed of a hurricane’s sustained winds. A hurricane is considered Category 1 if it has sustained wind speeds of 74 miles per hour (mph) to 95 mph, Category 2 with speeds between 96 mph and 110 mph, and so on. But hurricanes like Florence bring dangers beyond high winds, most notably storm surge and flash flooding. “Florence is an excellent example of a storm that is a lower category than it was and yet is still extremely dangerous,” said Dr. Bill Lapenta, director of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction at the National Weather Service, in an interview Thursday. “It was a Category 4 [Wednesday] and since then it’s a Category 2, which simply means its sustained winds have decreased. But when you look at the magnitude of the dangers that have been predicted, that hasn’t changed.” In the case of Hurricane Florence, one specific shortfall with the Saffir-Simpson scale is quickly becoming apparent: While it measures the wind speeds a hurricane is producing, it doesn’t take into account the speed at which a hurricane itself is moving. Those are often vastly different figures — while hurricanes can produce wind speeds of up to 150 mph and more (the average speed of an Indianapolis 500 race car), the storms themselves tend to prod along at speeds as slow as 5 or 10 mph, especially as they begin to hit land. A hurricane’s speed can determine how dangerous they are, as slower storms can dump biblical amounts of rain and create other hazards in a more limited area over longer periods of time. That, in turn, increases the risk for those in a hurricane’s path. “As Florence approaches the southeast coast, it might be moving only 4 miles per hour, which is the speed I walk,” said Lapenta. “That results in people being exposed to hurricane-force winds much longer than they would otherwise have been, and that in turn effects inland flooding.” Other threats, like storm surge, aren’t measured or predicted by a given hurricane’s category either. Any shortcomings with the Saffir-Simpson scale can have life and death consequences. Hurricane categories have become a convenient shorthand for residents, officials and the media looking to understand and convey the threat a storm presents. But a hurricane’s category alone often fails to adequately communicate that threat. That means people may be making ill-informed decisions about whether to evacuate their homes or ride out a hurricane and risk their lives in the process. And when hurricanes get downgraded right before making landfall, some people may wrongly interpret that as a sign of a lessened threat. “We really have to think about the different types of ways of explaining the risks,” says Dr. Tricia Wachtendorf, a sociology professor and the associate director of the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware. Part of the solution, she says, lies in presenting residents with a more detailed, multifaceted picture of the storm that they are about to face. “Having a classification system or a cone of uncertainty is one approach, but that has to be balanced with other information as well,” she says. Many meteorologists, officials and others have taken that advice to heart, especially after devastating storms like Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Harvey, and Hurricane Maria. In the lead-up to Hurricane Florence, newscasters and political leaders pounded home the idea that, even if Hurricane Florence gets downgraded, it’s still expected to be a disastrous event. Meanwhile, the National Weather Service is working on other ways to communicate a hurricane’s threat. One product, for instance, aims to predict where flash flooding may occur up to three days in advance, Lapenta says. The task facing forecasters and officials will continue to be providing residents with enough, but not too much, information leading up to a hurricane. “Part of the challenge is [balancing] the simplicity of the information when you talk about a category — and that can be really useful as you’re trying to convey information that’s as simple as possible — with the nuances and details that might be provided.” said Dr. Wachtendorf. In the case of Hurricane Florence, the warnings have certainly been straightforward. “My message is clear,” said North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper at a press briefing Wednesday. “Disaster is at the doorstep and it’s coming in.” — With reporting from Jeffrey Kluger","Hurricane Florence was technically downgraded before it made landfall, but it's still a life-threatening hurricane.",2018-09-14T16:56:05Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Hurricane Florence Is Exposing Major Problems With How We Categorize Storms,http://time.com/5395912/hurricane-florence-category/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/hurricane-florence-scale.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,landfall,1
Alexander Kay,"Tropical Storm Gordon on Tuesday barreled toward central U.S. Gulf Coast, where it was expected to become a hurricane and bring high winds and heavy rain to the region, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. The storm was gaining strength and was expected to become a hurricane as it comes ashore late on Tuesday near the border between Louisiana and Mississippi, and drop as much as 8 inches (20 cm) of rain in some areas of the U.S. South still reeling from hurricanes a year ago. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency, saying 200 Louisiana National Guardsmen were being deployed, along with 63 high-water trucks, 39 boats, and 4 helicopters. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency warned of storm surges of between 3 and 5 feet (1 and 1.5 meters) and told South Mississippi residents to be prepared to evacuate. Gordon was generating winds of 65 miles per hour (105 km per hour) on Tuesday as it steamed west-northwest at 17 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. Gordon was located about 280 miles (450 km) east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River and was packing maximum sustained winds of 65 miles per hour (100kmh), the Miami-based weather forecaster said. By Monday afternoon the storm had passed over Florida's southern tip. There were no reports of any injuries or deaths or any damages to buildings, said Alberto Moscoso, a spokesman for the Florida Division of Emergency Management. Hurricane Hugo, 1989: 21 deaths Hurricane Hugo made landfall as a Category 4 storm in South Carolina. It caused 21 deaths in the US and resulted in $7.1 billion of damage. At the time, it was the costliest storm in US history.

The storm started over the Gulf of Mexico near Texas, then traveled east, causing floods like the one pictured here in Houston, Texas. Photo courtesy: NOAA Hurricane Irene, 2011: 56 deaths Hurricane Irene, the first storm to hit the US since Ike three years earlier, made landfall in North Carolina as a Category 1 storm. The storm eventually made its way up to New York City, bringing flooding -- like the kind pictured here in Puerto Rico -- and causing $7.3 billion in damage overall. Photo courtesy: AP Hurricane Floyd, 1999: 57 deaths Hurricane Floyd was a catastrophic storm because of the rain it brought along. The rain caused extreme flooding from North Carolina on up as the Category 2 storm traveled up the East Coast. Photo courtesy: NOAA Great Atlantic Hurricane, 1944: 64 deaths The Great Atlantic Hurricane of 1944 was also devastating to New England, with 64 deaths and more than $100 million in damage. The storm was a Category 3 as it sped up the coast, hitting the Carolinas, Rhode Island, and Long Island before downgrading to a Category 2 in Maine. Photo courtesy: NOAA Hurricane Agnes, 1972: 122 deaths Hurricane Agnes, as seen in this image made it all the way inland to Pennsylvania. Although it was only a Category 1 storm ( with winds from 74-95 mph ), it still caused 122 deaths and caused $2.1 billion in damage. Photo courtesy: NOAA Hurricane Ike, 2008: 195 deaths The third costliest storm in US history, with $29.5 billion in damage, occurred in September 2008. Starting off the west coast of Africa, Hurricane Ike made its way over the Caribbean and into the Gulf, making US landfall in Texas as a Category 2 storm. Photo courtesy: Reuters Hurricane Camille, 1969: 256 deaths Hurricane Camille formed in the Gulf of Mexico and hit Mississippi as a Category 5 storm. Camille caused more than 256 deaths and clocks in as the second most intense hurricane to hit the US. Photo courtesy: NOAA New England, 1938: 256 deaths Nicknamed "" Long Island Express,"" the storm hit Puerto Rico as a Category 5 storm before charging north and hitting Long Island, New York and Connecticut as a Category 3 hurricane. The storm was responsible for more than 256 deaths. Photo courtesy: NOAA Hurricane Sandy, 2012: 285 deaths With $71.4 billion in damage, Hurricane Sandy was the second costliest hurricane in US history. The Category 1 storm pummeled New York City, flooding the city's transportation systems and leaving thousands of homes destroyed. It's looking more and more like Hurricane Joaquin won't make landfall in the US and join the list of most horrific storms in US history. Photo courtesy: AP Hurricane Audrey, 1957: 416 deaths The U.S. started naming storms with women's names starting in 1953. Hurricane Audrey, the first storm of the 1957 hurricane season was the deadliest of the 1950s. It originated in the Gulf of Mexico, making landfall in Texas as a Category 4 storm. This image of the storm shows just how far hurricane imaging has come. Photo courtesy: NOAA Atlantic-Gulf, 1919: 600 to 900 deaths This Category 4 storm swept into the Gulf of Mexico right under Key West, Florida(pictured), landing as a Category 3 storm in Corpus Christi, Texas. Anywhere from 600 to 900 people died in that storm. Hurricane Katrina, 2005: 1,200 deaths Hurricane Katrina is arguably the most notorious storm of the 21st century. The storm made landfall as a Category 5 near Miami before striking Louisiana as a Category 3 storm. Katrina was the third deadliest, and costliest hurricane in U.S. history with more than 1,200 deaths and $108 billion in damage. Photo courtesy: Reuters San Felipe Okeechobee, 1928: 2,500 deaths This hurricane was the second deadliest in US history, with more than 2,500 deaths. The Category 4 storm made landfall in Palm Beach on September 10, 1928. Puerto Rico got hit hard as well, with winds at 144 mph. Photo courtesy: NOAA Galveston, Texas in 1900: 8,000 to 12,000 deaths The deadliest hurricane in US history happened at the turn of the 20th century. The Category 4 of 5 hurricane -- with winds anywhere from 130-156 mph -- made landfall in Galveston, Texas (pictured), then headed north through the Great Plains. Anywhere from 8,000 to 12,000 people died in the storm. Photo courtesy: Creative Commons New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has declared a state of emergency for her city, closing all non-essential government offices on Tuesday. Last year, powerful hurricanes walloped Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, causing thousands of deaths, hundreds of billions of dollars worth of damage, massive power outages and devastation to hundreds of thousands of structures. At the mouth of the Mississippi River, around the area of New Orleans, the storm could generate a surge of up to 4 feet(1.2 meters) and smaller surges could hit coastland along other parts of the Gulf Coast, the Miami-based hurricane center said. U.S. oil producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp on Monday evacuated workers and shut production at two offshore oil platforms, and other companies with production and refining operations along the Gulf Coast said they were securing facilities. The U.S. Coast Guard also warned that the ports of New Orleans as well as Gulfport and Pascagoula, Mississippi, may have to close within 48 hours when gale force winds from Gordon are expected to arrive.

Marcus Gilmer,"Hurricane Florence is slowly but surely moving toward landfall along the East Coast. While its winds have decreased, making the storm a Category 2, it's still an incredibly powerful and dangerous storm with extreme rains expected to fall over the course of the next few days in the Carolinas and Virginia as it slows near the coast. That slowdown could produce historic amounts of rain for that part of the country, if current forecasts hold. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Florence is growing: 5 things to know about the monster storm Meteorologist Ryan Maue of WeatherModels tweeted some projections on Thursday morning. Maue's models suggest that around 17 trillion gallons of rain will fall across North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia with some spots receiving as much as 30 inches of rain before Florence is finished. As Hurricane #Florence makes landfall — or tries to very slowly — the rainfall will add up quickly across the Carolinas but also Virginia... I'd bet on maximum totals &gt; 30"" in many counties... forecast totals from the adjacent states near landfall around 17 trillion gallons. pic.twitter.com/xcfio0u1fA — Ryan Maue | weathermodels.com (@RyanMaue) September 13, 2018 That is an astounding amount of rain, sure to lead to widespread flooding and billions of dollars in damage. ( Over 24 trillion gallons of rain fell on Texas and Louisiana thanks to Hurricane Harvey and we all saw what that did.) Maue uses multiple models, including data that's agreed upon by the National Hurricane Center, local National Weather Service offices, and the Weather Prediction Center, to come up with his forecasts. It could (hopefully!) be less or it could be (hopefully not!) more. Maue points to geography as a factor, saying that ""these storms have a tendency to really wring out the moisture when they come up against the [Appalachian] mountains."" The tropical cyclone-related rainfall records for the Southeast since 1950. 1870-1949 rain data do not reveal wetter storms for the Carolinas. As 40"" local amounts are possible from Florence, the rain forecast is beyond what has been previously seen/witnessed for the Carolinas. pic.twitter.com/BmVZQnZvhj — NWS WPC (@NWSWPC) September 12, 2018 It also won't help matters that a ridge will hold Florence in place, keeping the storm from moving very much for a few days. ""It's blocked right now to the north, to the west, and to the east right now,"" Maue said. ""So the only place it can really go is a little nudge south,"" until it can eventually go around the ridge and move north. The forecast amount of rain is hard to wrap your brain around. What does 17 trillion gallons look like? It would fill 26 million Olympic-size swimming pools (660,000 gallons each). That much water could fill up nearly 3.5 Great Salt Lakes. It's enough water to submerge around 81,500 square miles in a foot of water, which would cover the states of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Jersey. It's roughly 68 times the amount of water that was pumped out of New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. It's important to remember that these numbers are just predictions for now. We won't actually know how much rain falls on the U.S. from Florence until, well, it actually happens. Maue notes that the heaviest rain could reach inland all the way to Raleigh, which is about 150 miles from the North Carolina coast. The National Weather Service says local amounts in some areas could top 40 inches. There has been weather monitoring in the city of Wilmington, NC for nearly 150 years. The most recent NCEP WPC rainfall prediction for Hurricane #Florence would shatter the historical record for 7-day rainfall accumulation by more than a foot. pic.twitter.com/CsSrSfRMKE — Robert Rohde (@rarohde) September 13, 2018 Whatever the totals wind up being, Florence is sure to bring destructive winds, rain, and floods to the area, meaning a long clean-up and recovery to come.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Florida Governor Rick Scott warned state residents that ""this storm could kill you"" Powerful Hurricane Michael is set to make landfall in Florida later on Wednesday, forcing mass evacuations in the southern US state. A category three storm with winds near 120mph (193km/h), Michael is expected to strengthen further when it hits the Florida Panhandle or Florida Big Bend in the north-west, meteorologists warn. More than 370,000 people have been ordered to evacuate in Florida. Florida, Alabama and Georgia have declared states of emergency. At least 13 people have reportedly died in Central America due to the storm. What are the latest developments? In its bulletin, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) said: ""Strengthening is expected overnight and on Wednesday, and Michael is forecast to be near category four strength when it makes landfall."" The NHC warns that some regions of Florida may see storm surges of up to 12ft (4m). It said that at 00:00 GMT on Wednesday, the eye of the storm was about 255 miles south of Panama City, Florida. Michael is currently moving northwards at 12mph. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Residents put plywood up in Port St Joe, Florida ""Weakening is expected after landfall as Michael moves across the south-eastern United States,"" the NHC added. Florida Governor Rick Scott called Michael ""a monstrous storm"" and urged residents to listen to officials. ""Let me be clear - the storm surge that our coastal counties are facing is deadly,"" the governor tweeted. ""Do not ignore warning from local officials - this storm could kill you. We can rebuild your house, we cannot rebuild your life."" Despite the warnings, local officials believe a far fewer number of people have in fact moved away. Schools and state offices in the area are to remain shut this week. On Tuesday, Gov Scott said he activated 2,500 Florida National Guard troops in preparation for the storm. Heavy rains are forecast for the Carolinas, which were drenched by Hurricane Florence last month. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told residents: ""I know people are fatigued from Florence, but don't let this storm catch you with your guard down."" More than 300 miles of coastline are currently under threat, the National Weather Service has said. Forecasters in Alabama warned of possible tornados. President Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday: ""We are very well prepared for the incoming hurricane."" Image copyright AFP Residents face frightening ordeal By BBC's Gary ODonoghue in Florida Adrian Mahangos hopes he is one of the lucky ones. Sitting outside his home, reading a magazine, less than 100 yards from the water's edge in Wynnehaven, he knows Hurricane Michael is now due to make landfall 50 or 60 miles to his east. Mr Mahangos is not going anywhere. His house is 11ft above sea level, and if the 4ft-surge predicted for this part of the coast goes no higher, then he's confident his newly-built home will survive. Just an hour along the coast, it's different. The aptly named Lullwater Beach, just west of Panama City Beach, is quiet at the moment, but this whole stretch is looking a possible surge of up to 13ft. A man in the distance is gathering sand from the beach while it's still light, and pouring it into trash bags - making do with what's at hand to protect from the water. Local officials are warning that not nearly enough people have evacuated as they would wish. Florida is used to storms, but the Panhandle, with its low-lying coastal strip and scattered communities, hasn't seen anything this strong for more than a dozen years. Those that remain will be facing a frightening ordeal. Where has Hurricane Michael hit so far? The storm caused widespread destruction in Central America over the weekend, where at least 13 people have been reported dead. According to the Associated Press, six people were killed in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador. Images on social media showed evacuating families wading through water to get to safety. Image copyright EPA Image caption Western Cuba, including Havana, was struck by Hurricane Michael on Monday Parts of western Cuba, which was hit by the storm on Monday, were forecast to receive up to a foot of rain. Offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico have evacuated workers, halting nearly a fifth of daily production. Five drilling rigs have been moved out of the storm's path, according to the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged.

Associated Press,"MAZATLAN, Mexico — Authorities rushed to evacuate low-lying areas and set up shelters as an “extremely dangerous” Hurricane Willa with winds of 130 mph (215 kph) headed toward a Tuesday afternoon landfall along a stretch of Mexico’s Pacific coast dotted with high-rise resorts, surfing beaches and fishing villages. Farther south, meanwhile, Mexican officials reported late Monday that there had been 12 deaths related to heavy rains from Tropical Storm Vicente. Willa briefly reached Category 5 strength, then weakened a bit to Category 4. But the U.S. National Hurricane Center warned that it still was likely to bring “life-threatening storm surge, wind and rainfall” to parts of west-central and southwestern Mexico. Workers taped up windows in hotels and officials ordered schools closed in a low-lying region where towns sit amid farmland tucked between the sea and lagoons. A decree of “extraordinary emergency” was issued for 19 municipalities in Nayarit and Sinaloa states, the federal Interior Department announced. Officials said 7,000 to 8,000 people were being evacuated from low-lying areas, mostly in Sinaloa state. The hurricane was nearing the Islas Marias, a group of islands about 60 miles (96 kilometers) offshore that include a nature preserve and a federal prison. Forecasters said Willa would then blow ashore in late afternoon somewhere along a 140-mile (220-kilometer) stretch from the resort city of Mazatlan to San Blas. While was likely to weaken somewhat, forecasters said it still was expected to be a powerful Category 3 storm when it hits land. Enrique Moreno, mayor of Escuinapa, a municipality of about 60,000 people lying on Willa’s potential track, said officials were trying to evacuate everybody in the seaside village of Teacapan. He estimated 3,000 were affected but he expected some would try to stay. “The people don’t want to evacuate, but it’s for their security,” he said. About 60 miles (100 kilometers) up the coast in Mazatlan, with a metropolitan-area population of about 500,000, Mayor Jose Joel Boucieguez said officials prepared shelters and were closely monitoring low-lying areas. Mazatlan is a popular vacation spot and home to a large number of American and Canadian expatriates. Early Tuesday, Willa was centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) southwest of the Islas Marias and 175 miles (280 kilometers) south-southwest of Mazatlan. It was moving north at 5 mph (7 kph), but was forecast to make a turn to the northeast. Hurricane-force winds extended 35 miles (55 kilometers) from the storm’s core, and tropical storm-force winds were up to 125 miles (205 kilometers) out.

 Thousands of people are still awaiting rescue from flooded areas across in southern Africa
A week after the flooded Mozambican port of Beira was hit by Cyclone Idai, cases of cholera have been recorded, a humanitarian aid group said on Friday.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) warned of the risk of other outbreaks, already noting an increase in malaria.
The storm has so far killed 557 people across Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, but the death toll is expected to rise.
Idai made landfall near Beira with 177km/h (106 mph) winds on 14 March.
Aid workers are slowly delivering relief but conditions are said to be extremely difficult, with some areas completely inaccessible and a scarcity of helicopters.
Some 1.7 million people are said to be affected across southern Africa, with no electricity or running water in areas where homes have been swept away and roads destroyed by the floods.
""There is growing concern among aid groups on the ground of potential disease outbreaks,"" the IFRC statement said. ""Already, some cholera cases have been reported in Beira along with an increasing number of malaria infections among people trapped by the flooding.""
Cholera, which is endemic in Mozambique, is spread by water contaminated by sewage, and can kill within hours if left untreated.
""There's stagnant water, it's not draining, decomposing bodies, lack of good hygiene and sanitation,"" Henrietta Fore, the head of Unicef who is in Mozambique, told AFP news agency.
Media caption'It has become an inland sea'
""We are running out of time, it is at a critical point here,"" she said, warning that hygiene and safe drinking water were absolute priorities.
""The scale of this crisis is staggering,"" Elhadj As Sy, the head of the IFRC, said after seeing Beira, which was home to 500,000 people. 
""We can't forget that it is an intimate and human crisis. Tens of thousands of families have lost everything. Children have lost parents. Communities have lost schools and clinics.""
A spokesperson for the World Food Programme (WFP) said the aid effort was ""slow to start, [but]... is now accelerating, thankfully.""
""We are not yet where it needs to be,"" he told AFP.
The United Nations has released $20m (£15m) from its emergency fund, and on Friday its chief made a personal appeal for more international support.
Aid groups said Mozambique has borne the brunt of flooding from rivers that flow downstream from neighbouring countries. At least 65,000 people are sheltering in 100 temporary sites, many of which are in ""desperate conditions"", according to the UN.
Many people are said to have not yet received emergency rations, with some still clinging to rooftops and trees.","Cases are reported in the flooded port city of Beira, a week after it was hit by a deadly cyclone.",2019-03-22T20:03:47Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Cyclone Idai: Cholera cases reported in storm-hit Mozambique,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-47674253,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A2B6/production/_106145614_mediaitem106145613.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,landfall,1
Eric Berger,"Enlarge / Patrons enjoy beverages outside Buster's Beer &amp; Bait, one of the last bars in the area still open, as Hurricane Michael approaches the Florida panhandle, in Panama City Beach on Tuesday, Oct. 09. reader comments 0 Hurricane Michael continued to intensify during Tuesday night, bringing an unprecedentedly strong storm to the northwest Florida coast on Wednesday. This is a serious situation for the Florida Panhandle and downstream areas in southeastern Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas. As of the National Hurricane Center's 9am ET update, Michael had 145mph sustained winds, solidly in the range of a Category-4 major hurricane. Winds along the Florida coast were already rising above tropical storm strength at the time, all but closing the window for further evacuations as the storm nears shore and moves inland later today. Perhaps most concerning, Michael's central pressure continued to fall during the overnight hours, down to 933 millibars by Wednesday morning. This is an indication of the storm's organization, and with Michael's satellite appearance actually improving as the storm approaches land, some slight further intensification is possible today before landfall near Panama City. If Michael's central pressure falls further, to 930 millibars, it would rank among the 10 most intense hurricanes to make landfall in the US on record in terms of central pressure. Meteorologists are reacting to the rapidly intensifying storm with some measure of alarm. Mike Bettes, a meteorologist with The Weather Channel, noted on Twitter Wednesday morning that his crew was pulling out of Apalachicola, a small coastal community to the right of Michael's projected landfall that will likely bear the brunt of the storm's winds and surge. My crew here in Apalachicola has decided to leave. We feel confident in the building were staying in is strong but not confident that US 98 will be in tact and an escape route for us after the hurricane. Better safe than sorry. #Michael Mike Bettes (@mikebettes) October 10, 2018 A forecaster with the National Hurricane Center, Eric Blake, said that this was ""an exceptionally"" serious scenario, and that even long-time residents of the Florida Panhandle had never seen a storm like this. Exceptionally serious scenario unfolding this morning with #Michael as an intensifying category 4 #hurricane headed toward the coast - no one in that area has ever experienced a hurricane this strong there pic.twitter.com/TQfZBUAmAV Eric Blake (@EricBlake12) October 10, 2018 Blake also said he hoped that everyone had left the coast along the Florida Panhandle, as this was a ""near-worst case"" scenario for the region. Michael has not garnered as much attention as some storms in recent history, such as Florence, because it has intensified rapidly during the last two daysmuch more than forecast models were indicating even as of this weekend. This highlights the fact that our understanding of the physical processes of hurricane intensification, and our ability to depict them in computational modeling, remain far from perfect. Another factor with Michael is that the storm is not hitting the US East Coast or major population areas. The biggest city on the coast where it will make landfall, Panama City, has a population of less than 40,000. Further inland, Tallahassee has a population of less than 200,000. The devastation Michael will inflict on these communities over the next 24 hours will be extreme, regardless.","Michael described as a ""near-worst case"" scenario for the region.",2018-10-10T13:28:48Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","Michael now a Category 4 hurricane, poses extreme danger to Florida",https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/michael-now-a-category-4-hurricane-poses-extreme-danger-to-florida/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-1048673854-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,landfall,1

The remnants of Hurricane Leslie swept into the centre and north of the country overnight on Saturday. There have been no reports of deaths or injuries, but officials have warned people not to venture outdoors, and a number of flights have been cancelled. The storm, one of the most powerful to ever hit the country, is now heading for Spain. Wind speeds of up to 176km/h (109mph) were recorded after the storm struck the mainland. It is rare for an Atlantic hurricane to reach the Iberian Peninsula, and it is thought this could be the most powerful to hit Portugal since 1842. However, Hurricane Leslie, which formed on 23 September, was downgraded to a tropical storm before it made landfall. Portugal's civil protection chief Luis Belo Costa warned of possible flooding in coastal areas ahead of the storm's arrival.","The remnants of Hurricane Leslie left more than 15,000 homes without power after striking overnight.",2018-10-14T03:14:33Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Storm Leslie: Portugal hit by hurricane-force winds,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45853847,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/67C5/production/_103856562_aa8ad2cc-e15d-4c18-8620-77790ea21cc3.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,landfall,1
Mark Kaufman,"The tumultuous 2017 Atlantic hurricane season proved to be one of the most active years on record, with 17 named storms and six major hurricanes. But it can get quite a bit stormier than that. In a study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, researchers looked at hurricane seasons dating back to 1851 and found that it's quite unlikely any Atlantic hurricane season will surpass the 28 named storms and 15 hurricanes produced during the 2005 season, infamous for the deadly Hurricane Katrina that struck the Gulf Coast. SEE ALSO: A landmark climate change ruling could go up in smoke after Justice Kennedy retires ""To me, it makes sense that 2005 is about as many as you can get,"" Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University who had no role in the study, said in an interview. Using sophisticated weather models, the research team ran over 6,000 simulations of a wide range of weather conditions — such as temperature, winds, and air pressure — that our present climate can produce. They found that there's less than a 3.2 percent chance that any combination of conditions might result in more than 28 storms forming in any given year, which they took to mean 28 cyclones is pretty much the Atlantic Ocean's maximum storm potential. Hurricane Katrina makes landfall in 2005. Image: nasa This could be useful information for both Atlantic nations and the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences’ Risk Prediction Initiative, the natural catastrophe research group that funded the study. But, it's not really the number of storms that matters for people on the ground. ""At the end of the day, if you have 28 weak pieces of junk, no one cares,"" said Klotzbach. ""It's the Irmas people care about."" Last year, Hurricane Irma made landfall several times in the Caribbean, including leveling 95 percent of the structures on the island of Barbuda, before hitting Florida and causing severe flooding. Wind and water damage from the storm in the U.S. alone amounted to an estimated $50 billion, and, in total, Irma killed 47 people, though many more indirect deaths were reported. It could be a quiet storm year overall, said Klotzbach, but ""obviously all it takes is one or two high-profile storms to make the headlines and cause a lot of damage."" How about future storms in a changing climate? This study looked exclusively at what our present climate could produce in the Atlantic. Running sophisticated models on powerful computers has time and budget constraints, so the researchers restricted their research to the present. ""Of course, future climate is very important to consider,"" Sally Lavender, the study's lead author and researcher at Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's Division of Marine and Atmospheric Research, said over email. Yet, a changing climate doesn't necessarily mean more hurricanes, like it does more heat waves and wildfires. Massive Hurricane Irma passing the eastern end of Cuba on September 8, 2017. Image: nasa ""Based on work by others it is not at all clear if we could expect an increase in the numbers of tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic,"" said Lavender. Klotzbach agrees. ""Most models don’t show the number of storms increasing,"" said Klotzbach. ""In general, the number of storms is probably not going to change that much."" Still, future storms may carry more water, noted Klotzbach, or they may bring stronger winds, said Lavender. There's also strong evidence that storms are slowing down, which would mean considerably more flooding and destruction over the unlucky regions the storms stall over. Even so, Klotzbach emphasized that we might as well focus on preparing for what could happen today. In the 1940s, for example, five Category 4 and 5 storms (the highest rated storms) pummeled Florida over the course of six years. And with coastal development and massive population increases since then, we're not prepared to deal with that sort of storm onslaught, said Klotzbach. ""We’re not prepared for what we have now,"" he said. ""When Category 5's start hitting Florida again, it's going to be bad.""","The tumultuous 2017 Atlantic hurricane season proved to be one of the most active years on record, with 17 named storms and six major hurricanes.

Mark Kaufman,"Hurricane Michael has matured, developed an eye, and is gathering strength as it churns on a direct path towards the Florida Panhandle. National Hurricane Center scientists expect the storm to strike land on Wednesday as a major storm, with winds greater than 110 mph, making it at least a Category 3 hurricane. There's now almost nothing holding back the storm from further intensification as it approaches land, bringing not just destructive winds but perilous surges of ocean water into the Florida and Alabama coasts. ""Hurricane Michael is primed for additional strengthening prior to landfall because the key players in the atmosphere and ocean are all conducive for it,"" Brian McNoldy, a storm researcher at University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said over email. One of these key players is wind shear, which are winds that hit hurricanes at their sides and weaken, or sometimes kill, the tempests. Without these winds, there's little threatening Michael's stable, cyclone-like form. ""That helps the storm remain intact, upright, and symmetric,"" said McNoldy. By fall, these hurricane-threatening winds often pick up in the Gulf, Falko Judt, a research meteorologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said in an interview. But not this year. ""This is unusual,"" noted Judt. SEE ALSO: An appreciation of the persistently grim tweets from the Norway Ice Service A second influential factor is the warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes feed off of the bath-like temperatures of sea surface waters. Without these warm waters, they couldn't even form, nor sustain themselves. And in the Gulf right now, even as the waters begin to gradually cool as fall sets in, they're still plenty warm. ""It's always warm there,"" said Judt. Lastly, there are no masses of dry air in the lower or middle portions of the atmosphere where Hurricane Michael is headed, said McNoldy. A hurricane's thunderstorms need moisture to fuel their activity, but when storms suck up dry air, they threaten to ""wrap into the circulation and choke off the thunderstorm activity,"" said McNoldy. But Michael has mostly moist air ahead. Water levels will rise well in advance of the arrival of #Michael. It's essential that residents within the storm surge warning area finish preparations to protect life and property today. pic.twitter.com/0Xz3nNkAnr NHC_Surge (@NHC_Surge) October 9, 2018 The storm poses a particularly severe threat to the Florida coast places like Panama City and Apalachicola as well as inland Tallahassee, because the storm is not expected to weaken much as it approaches land. ""Usually they weaken before they hit land,"" said Judt. ""The models are predicting this will not weaken before landfall, which would be very unusual."" The question of why storms typically weaken as they approach land ""is still an open science question,"" noted Judt. Some scientists have proposed drier air from nearby land can temper the storms. But as of Tuesday, any such weakening isn't in the cards for Michael. If Michael follows its expected course, it will become just the fourth major hurricane to hit the Florida panhandle since 1950.","Hurricane Michael has matured, developed an eye, and is gathering strength as it churns on a direct path towards the Florida Panhandle.

Andrew Freedman,"The East Coast ""bomb cyclone"" on Thursday looks both beautiful and sinister from space. While scientists have been tracking storms using satellites in orbit for decades, they now have a brand new tool at their disposal: GOES-16, also called GOES-East. The brand new satellite — which wasn't available to scientists last winter — is one of the most powerful weather-watching tools in history, able to take snapshots of the storm every minute. The result? Some truly astonishing images. SEE ALSO: A 'bomb cyclone,' explained The storm, which is bringing blizzard conditions to areas from Virginia to Maine, along with hurricane-force wind gusts and damaging coastal flooding, looks like a classic non-tropical storm. It took on a comma shape, drawing in moisture all the way from the Bahamas, and dumping it into an Arctic air mass in place over the Mid-Atlantic and East Coast. Its minimum central air pressure, a key measure of its intensity, has been falling by double digits every few hours, greatly exceeding the criteria needed to fit the definition of a weather ""bomb."" Such a term refers to the meteorological term ""bombogenesis,"" which combines the words ""bomb"" and ""cyclogensis,"" and means a storm that intensifies by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. The current storm has already seen a 53 millibar drop in just 21 hours, placing it in the top 5 percent of rapidly intensifying non-tropical storm systems. Computer model projections show that the minimum central pressure could fall to 947 millibars, which would be comparable to Hurricane Sandy when that storm made landfall in 2012. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, this storm, while not tropical in nature, has a massive wind field, bringing 60-mile-per-hour winds to New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Carolinas at the same time. The center of the storm even developed an eye-like feature, clearly seen in this satellite image: Image: colorado state university/noaa Impressive GOES-16 high resolution infrared satellite imagery showing explosive cyclogenesis/rapid intensification with the hurricane force low pressure system in the W Atlantic from late last night into this morning. pic.twitter.com/h3lLrYcWL8 — NWS OPC (@NWSOPC) January 4, 2018 It's not a hurricane but it has an ""eye-like"" feature where warmer air is trapped, encircled, or ""secluded"" by a bent-back warm front.

Mark Kaufman,"While three hurricanes swirled in the Caribbean and Atlantic Oceans on September 6, 2017, the sun blasted off a powerful flare of energy, which soon smacked into Earth and severed radio communications across half the planet for hours. Just four days later, another solar flare — an intense burst of radiation from the sun — hit Earth and again disrupted communications, as major storms continued to churn toward land. This confluence of tempestuous weather both on Earth and in space was recently described by scientists in the journal Space Weather, the research led by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) researchers. SEE ALSO: A 12-mile, underground lake may have been found on Mars. What could live there? ""Space weather and Earth weather aligned to heighten an already tense situation in the Caribbean,” said NOAA's Rob Redmon in a statement. Fortunately, many governments no longer rely strictly on radio to communicate over long distances, though aviation and marine emergency services still employ high-frequency radio, which bounces radio waves across Earth's high atmosphere, allowing contact over long distances. “You can hear a solar flare on the air as it's taking place. It’s like hearing bacon fry in a pan, it just all of a sudden gets real staticky and then it’s like someone just turns the light completely off, you don't hear anything,"" Bobby Graves, a radio operator for Hurricane Watch Net which uses radio during hurricanes,"" said in a statement. When the radiation from strong solar flares smacks the Earth, it hits an energetic layer of the atmosphere called the ionosphere, causing it to absorb — and thus impair — long distance radio waves. ""And that's what happened this last year on two occasions,” noted Graves. “We had to wait ‘til the power of those solar flares weakened so that our signals could actually bounce back off the atmosphere. It was a helpless situation."" The sun released a powerful solar flare on November 4, 2003. Image: nasa The first of the two flares, on September 6, arrived during a remarkably bad time, as Hurricane Irma — a highest rated Category 5 storm — was in the process of leveling the island of Barbuda. The massive storm would later make landfall in Florida. NASA is still intensively studying the sun, to improve the space agency's understanding of when unpredictable events, like solar flares, might pose a harm to Earth. Worse yet are Corneal Mass Ejections, or CMEs, which are explosions of billions of tons of solar matter hurled into space. Events like these pose serious threats to our modern telecommunication and electrical grids — consequences far worse than temporary radio blackouts.

Jeremy Berke,"Hurricane Florence may be the strongest storm ever to make landfall north of Florida if predictions hold. The Category 4 storm is located 905 miles east of Cape Fear, North Carolina and has maximum wind speeds of 130 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. Only four Category 4 hurricanes have ever made landfall north of Florida since records were kept, according to The Weather Channel. All of those, however, made landfall south of where Florence is predicted to hit, and Florence's wind speeds are predicted to be higher than those four storms. Hurricane Hugo, the strongest hurricane ever to impact North Carolina, actually made landfall just north of Charleston, South Carolina in 1989 with 130 mph winds. If Hurricane Florence's predicted track holds, it will be the first Category 4 storm to make landfall directly on the North Carolina coast. Read More: Here's what Category 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 labels for hurricanes really mean The storm will also have stronger winds than Hugo did if Florence strengthens as predicted. The NHC warned on Tuesday that the storm may strengthen to Category 5, with wind speeds in excess of 157 mph, as it moves over a band of warmer water off of North Carolina's coast. Warmer ocean water makes hurricanes more intense because the storms are fed by evaporating water. With warmer ocean water, there's more energy available to power the hurricane, according to Nature. On Wednesday and Thursday, Florence is predicted to move across a band of water that's around 84 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 3 or 4 degrees higher than average for this time of year. Hurricanes typically need a minimum sea surface temperature of 79 degrees, according to The Weather Channel. The warming ocean temperatures are linked to climate change caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Hurricane Florence is predicted to be the size of the entire state of North Carolina when it makes landfall late Thursday night or early Friday morning. Read More: Here's a map of all the areas that could get hit The storm's 175-mile wide ""cone of probability"" suggests the storm will likely hit North Carolina's coast near Cape Fear, but storms fall outside the cone one-third of the time, according to The Weather Channel. Category 4 hurricanes are unusual this far north. Hurricanes need warm water to thrive — and the sea surface temperature of ocean water cools as you get further away from the tropics. The hurricane could inundate low-lying islands off the coast of North Carolina, like the Outer Banks and other barrier islands, according to the NHC. Heavy rain may extend as far inland as Charlotte, North Carolina's largest city, though the severity will depend on the storm's track, according to The Charlotte Observer.

Sinéad Baker,"Tropical Storm Gordon made landfall over the Alabama-Mississippi border on Tuesday night after claiming its first victim, a child who was crushed by a falling tree. The storm crossed from sea to land after dark, bringing strong winds and rain and leaving tens of thousands without power. The child was killed earlier in the storm's path, in Escambia County, on Florida's border with Alabama. According to the local sheriff's office the tree fell on a mobile home. The storm is expected to bring four to eight inches of rain along the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama and the Florida panhandle. Some areas could receive 12 inches of rain on Thursday, causing flash flooding, the National Weather Service warned. This is what it looked like as the storm's center approached land at 9 p.m. local time on Tuesday. Storm surge warnings and tropical storm warnings are in effect across many coastal locations. A storm surge warning means there is a danger of life-threatening conditions from water moving inland. Footage shared on Twitter by AccuWeather meteorologist Reed Timmer shows the heavy rains and winds: ""This is a life-threatening situation,"" the National Weather Service warned. ""Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions."" The water could rise as much as four feet (1.2 meters). A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning areas. The storm is bringing maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85mph). More than 27,000 homes and businesses were without power on Tuesday night, the Associated Press reported. Dr Rick Knabb, a hurricane expert for the National Weather Channel, warned of ""life-threatening winds"" and flooding.

 Pabuk was the region's worst storm in 30 years
Thousands of people in southern Thailand are emerging from shelter after the region's worst storm in 30 years passed into the Andaman Sea.
Storm Pabuk left Thailand at about midnight GMT on Friday after causing widespread flooding and blackouts. One fisherman died and one is missing.
The main tourist islands such as Koh Samui were spared the worst.
Flights and ferries are now resuming but tourists face delays due to a backlog of services.
The latest information on Tropical Storm Pabuk puts its peak wind speed at about 65km/h (40mph).
It passed over the coast of eastern Thailand near the island of Ko Phra Thong at 07:00 local time on Saturday (00:00 GMT), heading towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
It left behind a swathe of downed power cables and forced some 30,000 people into evacuation shelters.
Warnings of flash floods are still in force.
The fisherman died when his boat capsized early on Friday in southern Pattani province, with another crew member still missing.
There are unconfirmed reports a man also died when a tree hit his home in Nakhon Si Thammarat.
The main tourist islands of Koh Samui, Koh Phangan and Koh Tao were spared the full force of the winds and rain.
Koh Samui district chief Kittipop Roddon said: ""There were no casualties, there is some sunshine today and I'm confident some tourists will be able to leave.""
Koh Phangan district chief Krikkrai Songthanee said: ""It's all over. All 10,000 tourists are safe... I am relieved.""
Thousands of tourists had left before the storm it.

Airports and ferry services, closed during the storm, are reopening although some ""red flag"" bans on swimming were still in force.
Koh Samui, Nakhon Si Thammarat and Surat Thani airports were resuming operations, with some extra flights allocated but travellers could still face delays.
Pabuk made landfall on Friday afternoon in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, leaving about 200,000 people without electricity. Some 30,000 had not been reconnected by Saturday.
One resident of Talum Puk, Boonchuay Chuaysri, told Agence France-Presse: ""The roofs on some rooms in my house are gone. The house is filled with mud.""

Her family told BBC Tamil that she was trapped in the hut on 16 November when the cyclone made landfall. Some villagers said this was a ""wake up call"" as it was common practice to segregate menstruating girls. Cyclone Gaja is known to have killed at least 46 people in the coastal state. Menstruation is taboo in large parts of rural India. Women are traditionally believed to be impure during their periods. The family of the girl, S Vijayalakshmi, lives in a house next to the hut but they survived the storm. Her grandmother, S Visalakshi, said they couldn't rescue her as a coconut tree had fallen on the hut, which made it impossible to reach her. Image copyright Reuters Image caption The storm has uprooted thousands of trees She said Vijayalakshmi's parents had known that the storm was approaching but they couldn't keep her anywhere else since they lived in a coconut grove, far from the rest of the village, known as Anaikudi. ""I told them to take her to a different place. But within hours, the cyclone had struck and we couldn't move anywhere,"" she said. ""We are shattered,"" she told BBC Tamil's Pramila Krishnan. ""When we saw the tree, we lost hope. We waited for villagers to help us remove the tree and pull her out of the hut."" She added that they had rushed her to the hospital but doctors said that she had died hours ago and declared her dead on arrival.

Jenny Staletovich,"Get ready to batten down the hatches. Again. In a preseason forecast issued Thursday, Colorado State University’s Tropical Meteorology Project predicts the upcoming hurricane season that begins June 1 will again be busy, although not as bad as the brutal 2017 season. The forecast calls for seven hurricanes, three hurricanes at Cat 3 intensity or worse, and 14 named storms. Hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach, a protege of pioneering meteorologist William Gray, blamed warm waters in the western Atlantic and the mediocre odds for an El Niño in the Pacific for the uptick. “The odds of getting a real gangbusters El Niño that kills the season is slim,” he said. “We can’t rule anything out, but the odds are reduced.” This year’s forecast, the 35th in what has become a traditional season opener, relies on 29 years worth of observational data, although Klotzbach and fellow forecaster Michael Bell warn that no prediction is guaranteed. The forecast will be updated, and likely improve, in late May and again in August before the peak of the season kicks in. “It’s like trying to pick who’s going to win the NCAA tournament in the first round,” he said. “Your odds are a lot higher in the final four.” The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plans to issue its forecast for the season in late May, said National Hurricane Center spokesman Dennis Feltgen. If Colorado State’s forecast holds true, another busy season could draw a collective moan from South Florida and the Caribbean after a punishing 2017 season. The Atlantic churned up a record 10 hurricanes in a row last year, including Harvey, Irma and Maria, for a total of 17 named storms and six major hurricanes. On average, the Atlantic produces12 named storms and just three major hurricanes. The accumulated cyclone energy — which tallies the sheer force of a hurricane season by totaling the number, duration and strength of storms — was the seventh highest ever recorded and the worst since 2005, when Katrina and Wilma hammered the Gulf Coast and South Florida. While most of Florida has recovered, parts of the Keys where affordable housing is tight continue to struggle. As of March, Monroe County said nearly 200 families still lived in temporary FEMA trailers. To create the forecast, Klotzbach and Bell looked at past years with similar ocean and atmospheric conditions, including weak La Niña and El Niño patterns. Because ocean temperatures that can fuel hurricanes remain uncertain over the summer and fall, they looked at wide range of temperatures and came up with five comparable seasons. One of those, 1967, included lethal Hurricane Donna, a Cat 4 storm that killed more than 125 people as it wound through the Caribbean, including 13 in the Keys. The forecast also looked at the probability of landfall and put the odds of a Florida-East Coast landfall at 61 percent for a tropical storm, 54 percent for a hurricane and 39 percent for a major hurricane. Klotzbach said some conditions could still change to alter the forecast. If an El Niño blossoms in the Pacific on the heels of the fizzling La Niña, hurricane-smothering wind shear could increase in the Atlantic. It’s also not yet clear whether ocean temperatures will heat up enough over the summer to fuel more intense storms. But since activity in the Atlantic doesn’t typically pick up until August, he said, there’s plenty of time to improve the forecast. “People see June and July come around and not much happens. That’s normal. That happened last year,” he said. “If you had talked to me [in early August] I would have said so far it’s a benign season. Six weeks later it wasn’t benign anymore.”","How busy will hurricane season be in 2018? This forecast has good news and bad news Miami Herald Get ready to batten down the hatches. Again.

Ashley Collman,"Florida is bracing for yet another hurricane. On Sunday, Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in 26 counties ahead of Hurricane Michael's arrival. The storm is expected to strengthen to at least a Category 3 hurricane as it moves through the Gulf of Mexico today and tomorrow, and make landfall in Florida on Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. As of Monday morning at 11 a.m. ET, the hurricane was churning about 50 miles south the western tip of Cuba. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a hurricane warning for the Cuban province of Pinar del Rio, while a hurricane watch is in effect along the Florida coast, from the Alabama border to the Suwannee River. The storm is already bringing rain to the Florida Keys, and is expected to reach the state's Panhandle or Big Bend areas on Wednesday, the NHC said. Its maximum sustained wind speeds are around 75 mph, but that's likely to increase over the next two days. Hurricane Michael is expected to make landfall sometime on Wednesday or Thursday. National Hurricane Center Gov. Scott implored those living in northeast Florida to keep track of the storm and evacuate if necessary. Residents in that region have been told to stock up on enough water, food, and medicine to last three days. Michael is expected to bring heavy rain, strong winds, and life-threatening storm surge. The coastal area from Indian Pass to Crystal River — an hour and a half north of Tampa — is expected to see the highest storm surge, with 8 to 12 feet predicted. In the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend areas, residents could see 4 to 8 inches of rain, with a few areas getting up to 12 inches. That could lead to life-threatening flash floods, the NHC warned. In Cuba, hurricane conditions are expected spread across the western part of Pinar del Rio starting this afternoon.

It may have been downgraded, but Tropical Storm Rosa is still going to have a big impact on northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, reports USA Today. At one point, Rosa was classified as a Category 4 hurricane, but it is now listed as a Tropical Storm, and is expected to make its first landfall in Baja California — Mexico’s far western peninsula. The storm is expected to touch down on Monday night, with residents of Baja California already reporting heavy rainfall. Flood watches have been issued by the National Weather Service in the states of Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah. That puts more than 12 million people at risk of the flooding that the storm will bring, with a flood warning being issued for almost all of Arizona. Arizona will see the worst of the storm, where rain is expected to reach at least six inches in some areas. The National Hurricane Center warns that the floods will be life-threatening and could also trigger landslides in the path of the storm. Flash flooding is not unusual for Arizona, with a sudden flood turning a swimming hole into a virtual raging river in Payson last year, killing 10 people after heavy rain came through the area.

It is expected to make landfall Wednesday afternoon. Assuming it maintains this strength, Michael will be the first Category 4 hurricane to hit the Florida Panhandle since records began in 1851, according to the Washington Post. The time for evacuating along the coast has come and gone, Florida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted Wednesday morning. First responders will not be able to come out in the middle of the storm. If you chose to stay in an evacuation zone, you must SEEK REFUGE IMMEDIATELY. The storms winds increased to nearly 145 miles per hour, according to the National Hurricane Center, and forecasters have warned residents of dangerous flash floods and deadly storm surgesin some areas as high as 13 feet, which would inundate coastal homes and possibly even wash some away, according to the National Weather Service. Roads will likely become impassable, from downed trees, flooding, and debris. Forecasters expect widespread power outages in the region, and tornadoes could crop up across the Panhandle.

A satellite image released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows Florence still some distance away from the U.S. east coast. However, the National Hurricane Center says Hurricane Florence is on track to hit the area around North and South Carolina by Friday, and forecasters warned the storm could be “life threatening” by the time it strikes. The NOAA also released a “mesmerizing loop” showing Hurricane Florence from space. It said the storm, currently brewing above the Atlantic Ocean, had weakened to Category 1 strength, but is expected to strengthen into a Category 3 hurricane by the time it makes landfall on the U.S. mainland.

Jamie Ducharme,"Hurricane Michael is barreling toward Florida with a vengeance, and is expected to make history as the first Category 4 storm on record to make landfall over the Panhandle. The storm’s “unprecedented” strength has officials warning residents of dangerous, life-threatening conditions and storm surges up to 13 feet. Here’s what to know about Hurricane Michael, the storm’s path, when it’s supposed to make landfall and just how dangerous it’s expected to be. Here’s where Hurricane Michael’s path is headed As of Wednesday at 7 a.m. CDT, Hurricane Michael was about 90 miles southwest of Apalachicola and Panama City, Fla., and moving north at around 13 miles per hour, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Hurricane Michael is set to make landfall over the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday, the NHC predicts. After that, it’s set to reach Alabama and Georgia by early Thursday, continuing up toward the Carolinas and Virginia on Thursday and early Friday and weakening as it makes its way up the coast. By the weekend, the storm’s center should be back out over the Atlantic, the NHC says. Hurricane Michael expected to be “extremely dangerous” to the Florida Panhandle After being upgraded first to a Category 2, then a Category 3, storm on Tuesday, Hurricane Michael is predicted to be an “extremely dangerous” Category 4 hurricane when it makes landfall Wednesday, with winds reaching 145 miles per hour, according to the NHC. The National Weather Service (NWS) has no record of a Category 4 hurricane making landfall over the Florida Panhandle, leading it to warn residents that the storm is “an unprecedented event” that is “not comparable to anything we’ve seen before.” Hurricane Michael to bring dangerous storm surge A storm surge warning is currently in effect in Florida from the Okaloosa/Walton County line to Anclote River, as well as from Anclote River to Anna Maria Island, including Tampa Bay. For the next 36 hours, these areas face possibly “life-threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline,” the NHC says. Some areas could expect to see up to 13 feet of water. A hurricane warning is also in effect from the Alabama/Florida border to Florida’s Suwannee River, while tropical storm warnings have been issued as far north as North Carolina. What Florida officials are warning about Hurricane Michael Florida Gov. Rick Scott warned on Twitter that Hurricane Michael could be “deadly” and “catastrophic to the FL Panhandle,” and urged residents to take shelter. “I’m asking all Floridians to stay vigilant throughout tonight and tomorrow as we brace for Hurricane Michael to make landfall,” he tweeted early Wednesday morning. Sen. Marco Rubio, meanwhile, warned that the storm could bring a “storm surge that can’t be survived.” What areas are under mandatory evacuations from Hurricane Michael More than 375,000 Floridians were told to evacuate leading up to Hurricane Michael, the Associated Press reports. Mandatory evacuation orders were in effect for at least some people in Bay, Dixie, Franklin, Jackson, Levy, Okaloosa, Wakulla, Walton and Gulf counties, while voluntary or phased evacuation plans were in place for parts of Calhoun, Hernando, Jefferson, Leon, Liberty, Pasco, Santa Rosa, Taylor and Gadsen counties. Tolls were suspended in Northwest Florida as of Tuesday, to assist with travel and evacuation plans. Scott warned Wednesday morning, however, that “the time for evacuating along the coast has come and gone,” and that anyone who chose to remain in these high-risk evacuation zones should shelter in place. Emergency declarations have also been issued for 92 Georgia counties and the state of Alabama, prompting many in these states to evacuate. Airbnb is offering free shelter to evacuees in some parts of Florida, Georgia and Alabama. How Florida is preparing for Hurricane Michael In addition to evacuation plans, Scott requested and was granted a pre-landfall emergency declaration from President Donald Trump, according to a statement from his offie. The declaration frees up funding, resources and personnel to help Florida weather the storm. Scott on Monday also declared a state of emergency in 35 Florida counties. At least 32 shelters are in operation, according to the statement, and the state is supporting sheltering operations along the Panhandle. The Florida National Guard has also supplied 2,500 soldiers and airmen to assist with emergency response, along with local law enforcement operations. Environmental, medical and public health resources have also activated emergency preparedness plans. In preparation for the storm, airports including Tallahassee International Airport, Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport, Pensacola International Airport and Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport closed to commercial flights on Wednesday. A total of 237 U.S. flights had been cancelled as of Wednesday morning, according to FlightAware, with many clustered in the Florida area.","Hurricane Michael, a Category 4 storm, is heading toward the Florida Panhandle and is expected to make landfall Wednesday.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"Several news organizations, including The New York Times, conducted independent analyses and found that the number of deaths traceable to the storm was probably far higher than the official count of 64. The Times’s review, based on daily mortality data from Puerto Rico’s vital statistics bureau, found that 1,052 more people than usual had died across the island in the 42 days after Maria struck. The analysis compared daily figures for 2017 with an average of figures for the corresponding days in 2015 and 2016. Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism reached a similar estimate, that 1,065 more people than usual had died in September and October. CNN compiled figures from half the island’s funeral homes to report that funeral directors believed that 499 more deaths than the official count were tied to the hurricane. Methods for counting storm deaths vary by state and locality. In some places, officials include only direct deaths, such as people who drown in storm floodwaters. Puerto Rico’s method is not that restrictive; the medical examiner includes some deaths indirectly caused by a storm, such as suicides. The leading causes of death on the island in September were diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease, Puerto Rican government data show. But there was a sharp spike — by 50 percent — in the number of recorded deaths from sepsis, a complication of severe infection that can be tied to delayed medical care or poor living conditions. Mr. Rosselló had previously said that his government would look into questionably attributed deaths reported by the news media. On Monday he said he welcomed the outside reviews of the death toll, but he cautioned that the government could not adjust its official mortality count based on “statistical analysis.” “Every life is more than a number, and every death must have a name and vital information attached to it, as well as an accurate accounting of the facts related to their passing,” he said. Reviewing the circumstances surrounding each death will require interviewing family members and doctors who signed death certificates to find out if, for example, the heart attack listed as the cause might have been brought on by stress related to the hurricane or might have been fatal because an ambulance could not get through debris-blocked streets to help in time. For weeks after the storm, top leaders of Puerto Rico’s government insisted that its count of the dead was accurate and not significantly low. On Sept. 29, nine days after Maria made landfall, Héctor M. Pesquera, Puerto Rico’s public safety secretary, said he did not think the count would rise by much. Four days later, President Trump visited the island and remarked that the death toll — which officially stood at 16 at the time — was much lower than the 1,833 people who died in 2005 because of Hurricane Katrina. Mr. Pesquera has repeatedly said that Puerto Rico hewed to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s protocols for counting storm-related deaths, and has urged families to share information with the authorities about any deaths that may be linked to the storm. “We always expected that the number of hurricane-related deaths would increase as we received more factual information — not hearsay — and this review will ensure we are correctly counting everybody,” Mr. Rosselló said on Monday.

Sinéad Baker,"A map showing the approach of Hurricane Lane to Hawaii, the islands of which are partly obscured by the cloud formations. National Weather Service/Business Insider A category-5 hurricane with winds of up to 160mph (257 kmph) is barrelling towards Hawaii, prompting emergency services to issue urgent warnings for people to protect themselves. Authorities say devastating flooding could accompany Hurricane Lane making landfall, and have warned residents to prepare for potential evacuations. Hurricane Lane was updated to a category-5 storm — the strongest level that can form on planet — by the National Hurricane Center early Wednesday. In a statement, they said ""preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion."" Winds are expected to slow as the hurricane gets closer to the island, so may not be 160mph on land, though they still pose a risk. Official hurricane warnings have been issued for a number of islands including Hawaii's Big Island. Hurricane watches, a less serious category of warning, are in place for other islands. Flash flood warnings and high surf warnings are also in place. A hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected, and is issued 36 hours in advance to allow people to prepare. See the warnings issued by the National Weather Service as of 11 p.m. Tuesday (5 a.m. Wednesday EDT) here: Warnings in place across Hawaii's islands issued by the National Weather Service. National Weather Service A flash flood warning for the entire state is in place from Wednesday to Friday, according to the Department of Emergency Management. ""A Flash Flood Watch means that conditions may develop that lead to flash flooding. Flash flooding is a VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION,"" the department warned. The National Weather Service told citizens to prepare for possible emergency evacuations. ""Failure to adequately shelter may result in serious injury or loss of life,"" the service said. The warnings cautioned against heavy rains that could result in flooding even outside of designated zones, and warned that rods could become ""impassible."" ""The risk of flooding will only increase as hurricane Lane approaches, the National Weather Service tweeted on Tuesday, before the storm was upgraded to category 5. The storm is likely to make landfall on Hawaii's islands later this week according to the National Hurricane Center. Only four named storms have made landfall there, a series of small targets in a large ocean, since 1959, according to CNN. As of early Wednesday, the storm was south-southeast of Kailua-Kona, according to the center. It has become the second-ever category 5 storm to pass within 350 miles of the island, according to the National Weather Service in Honolulu. The only other category 5 storm to get this close was Hurricane John in 1994. After hitting the Big Island, the storm is expected to churn north over the islands of Maui, Lanai and Moloka'i, which are all under hurricane and flash flood watches, the Reuters news agency reported.","Hurricane Lane, which is approaching Hawaii, has been upgraded to a category-5 storm — the highest possible.

Adam Rogers,"It wasnt a whodunnit. Last years unprecedented rainfall and flooding in Houston were the proximate result of Hurricane Harvey, a massive storm born northeast of Venezuela and reborn in the Gulf of Mexico, where it rapidly intensified, made landfall over Houston, and then stayedparked, as it were, for five days. Harvey was, however, something of a why dunnit. Why did the storm drop more than four feet of rain on the city? Hurricane-climate-change-planet-on-fire, yes, stipulated. But new research suggests that the fault was not only in our meteorology, but ourselves. The citythe fact of its city-ness, of its raw Houstonosity, may well have made Harveys rainfall worse. And the implications for coastal cities in a Burning World are, at minimum, very wet. Hurricane Harveys hardly ever happen over Houston, one might sayin the late 20th century it wouldve been a 2,000-year storm. In 2017, Harvey was six times more likely. Climate change theory also predicts more rapidly intensifying hurricanes that move more slowly and drop more rainjust like you-know-who. This is thanks to humans burning carbon-based fuel and coughing the leftovers into the atmosphere. Very bad! Look at what you did! Bad! No more treats. Cities around the world are getting bigger, especially along the coasts. Just a shade more than one percent of the continental United States is city, but its where a vastly greater proportion of people live, and the land dedicated to cities is only going to expand. That land use has a disproportionate effect on climate and ecosystems. Paved ground is mostly impervious to water, an impermeable surface between earth and sky, which means water that falls on it as rain or snow has to run off and away, somehowcities are, in their deep souls, machines for moving fresh water in and used water out. Something like 35 percent of precipitated water turns into runoff in a city, versus 15 percent over unpaved land. Thats why flash floods are more likely in cities. Another consequence of city building is the so-called urban heat island effect. The air over cities is hotter than over not-cities, changing atmospheric circulation patterns. It seems like urban heat islands have even caused or worsened thunderstorms over cities, including a particularly bad cluster in Beijing in 2006. Still, though, Harvey was so extreme that it warrants more running of the numbers. There was nothing looking at how the urban area interacts with a tropical cyclone or a hurricanethe role of the city, not just from a hydrologic or meteorological perspective, but both, says Gabriele Villarini, a civil engineer at the University of Iowa. We said, what if we replaced the urban area of Houston with cropland? Using a system called the Weather Research and Forecasting model to simulate climate and its changes over a region (as opposed to models with lower resolution but wider geographic scope), thats actually possible. The WRF includes a parameter for land use; in a paper in Nature today, Villarinis team tweaks that knob between cropland and Houston, and runs Harvey again and again. More specifically, they ran the model with all of Harveys observed initial conditions, to see if their simulated cyber-Harvey acted like the real deal over a Houston modeled with low- and high-density residential areas along with denser commercial spaces. The digital storm broadly did what the real one did; it rained hard. Then Villarinis team razed the digital city and replaced it with sylvan cropland, and let Harvey unfold again. Total rainfall went down by almost two feet in some parts of town, or what wouldve been town. We were able to quantify the enhancement due to the urban areas. Then the question was, OK, why? Villarini says. What we found is that there is a role due to urban roughness. As the flow from the storm approaches the city, it becomes rougher, the buildings and overall footprint. That roughness, an increase in drag, grabs the storm from the sky, like a person in socks skidding across a hardwood floor suddenly meeting a shag carpet. Coupled with the urban heat island effect, that slowdown pushes the bottom of the boundary layerthe part of the atmosphere in contact with the groundupward. Updrafts increase. Airflow converged more upstream of the city, in this case Houstons east side. These are all ingredients for heavy precipitation, Villarini says. What you might then ask is, thats fine for a simulated city and simulated crops, but what exactly is it about a city thats increasing the roughness? Tall buildings or sprawly, low strip malls and housing developments? Nobodys sure. Its true that forested landtall treeshave an overall drag coefficient somewhere between city and farm. Buildings with different shapes, at different angles versus the oncoming wind, change a citys overall drag coefficient. Was it a special combination of Houston and Harvey? Was it about Houston? Was it about Harvey? Villarini says. I dont know how these results translate to other areas. It would also depend on where a storm made landfall and its intensity. Cities, then, affect their own weather in complicated ways. Last year, researchers correlated rainfall and air pollution across China for the last seven decades, and found that urban pollution particularly made for more rain. So the Villarini group's finding came as something of a validation to Xuemei Bai, an urban sustainability researcher at Australian National University who worked on that China study. ""This is an important study that uses a physical model to establish urbanization can exacerbate heavy rainfall,"" she says. ""The fact that this [new paper] is dealing with one of the most well-known flooding episodes really strengthens its communication power."" Its also a new way to think about cities and hurricanes, specifically. This is, as far as I know, a new result and, as the authors point out, has important implications for urban planning, says Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at MIT who specializes in hurricanes. Teasing those implications out will have to come next. Climate theory takes as fairly certain, now, that denser, taller cities emit less carbon than sprawling, flat ones. But what if they also exacerbate rainfall? Urban planners are already trying to account for sea level rise and the kind of flooding that happens when storm surges meet runoff in aging city sewer systems; Villarinis finding says that the literal shape of the city itself is a factor in the weather it encounters. Climate scientists are already mounting the evidence that human behavior has exacerbated hurricanes. In another article in the same issue of Nature, researchers used the same WRF model as Villarinis team to tease out the anthropogenic influence on a few big hurricanesthe degree to which the carbon we humans emitted made the storms worse. Hurricane season last year killed at least 251 peopleprobably more, but its hard to know because of the Puerto Rico undercountand caused $265 billion in damages. The question remains: Why? Why did it get so bad? The scientists took three iconic hurricanesKatrina, Irma, and Mariaand ran simulated versions of them against two sets of conditions: a pre-industrial, non-globally warmed climate (for comparison to what actually happened) and three post-globally warmed futures of varying severity. And as theory said it would, climate change increased all three storms rainfall, and the effect increased with future warming. The same thing happened with 12 other modeled hurricanes as well. We see the majority of the 15 events becoming stronger in terms of wind speed and producing substantial increases in rainfall, says Christina Patricola, an atmospheric scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Its not great news. That bad news does help solve the mysteries remaining. Scientists are pretty sure whos responsible for making hurricanes worseits you, me, and the governments and corporations around us. Theyre learning the why and the how, even if it might feel improbable that people will be able to reimagine a society to stave off the worst impacts of climate change. Theyll have to. As a great detective once said, when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remainshowever improbablemust be the truth.

Rod Nickel,"PANAMA CITY, Fla. (Reuters) - Hurricane Michael, the fiercest storm to hit Florida in 80 years and the third-most powerful ever to strike the U.S. mainland, battered the state’s Gulf coast with roof-shredding winds, raging surf and torrential rains before turning its diminishing fury on Georgia. Michael, whose rapid intensification as it churned north over the Gulf of Mexico caught many by surprise, made landfall on Wednesday afternoon near Mexico Beach, about 20 miles (32 km) southeast of Panama City in Florida’s Panhandle region, with top sustained winds reaching 155 miles per hour (249 kph). The storm came ashore as a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson wind scale, the biggest storm on record to strike the Florida Panhandle. Its sustained winds were just 2 mph (3.2 kph) shy of an extremely rare Category 5. The storm’s intensity waned steadily as it pushed inland and curled northeasterly into Georgia after dark. It was downgraded to a Category 1 storm, with top sustained winds diminishing to 75 miles per hour (120 kph), about nine hours after it made landfall. The governors of North and South Carolina urged residents to brace for more heavy rain and storm-force winds as Michael plows northward up the Atlantic seaboard. The Carolinas are still reeling from severe flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence less than a month ago. The National Hurricane Center said Michael would pass through the Carolinas as a tropical storm on Thursday, dumping as much as 8 inches of rain in some areas. Up to a foot (30 cm) of rain was forecast in Florida. Gadsden County sheriff’s spokeswoman Anglie Hightower said a “male subject” was killed by a tree toppling onto his house in Greensboro, Florida, near the state capital, Tallahassee, in the first report of a fatality from the hurricane. Severe flooding, heavily damaged buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines appeared widespread in coastal areas near the storm’s landfall. Television news footage during the day showed many homes submerged in floodwaters up to their roofs in Mexico Beach, where the fate of about 280 residents who authorities said defied evacuation orders was unknown. Numerous buildings in Panama City were demolished, partially collapsed or without roofs amid deserted streets littered with debris, twisted, fallen tree trunks and dangling wires. Authorities said the full extent of devastation would not be known until after daybreak on Thursday. In the meantime, curfews were imposed across much of the region. Bill Manning, a 63-year-old grocery clerk, fled his camper van in Panama City for safer quarters in a hotel only to see the electricity there go out. “My God, it’s scary. I didn’t expect all this,” he said. Without power, the city was plunged into darkness at nightfall and its flooded streets were mostly silent and devoid of people or traffic. By Wednesday night, more than 403,000 homes and businesses were without electricity in Florida, Georgia and Alabama, utility companies said. ‘ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE’ Twenty miles south of Mexico Beach, floodwaters were more than 7-1/2 feet (2.3 meters) deep near Apalachicola, a town of about 2,300 residents, hurricane center chief Ken Graham said. Wind damage was also evident. “There are so many downed power lines and trees that it’s almost impossible to get through the city,” Apalachicola Mayor Van Johnson said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said on Tuesday an estimated 500,000 Florida residents had been ordered or urged to seek higher ground before the storm in 20 counties spanning a 200-mile (320-km) stretch of shoreline. But Brad Kieserman of the American Red Cross said on Wednesday as many as 320,000 people on Florida’s Gulf Coast had disregarded evacuation notices. An estimated 6,000 evacuees took cover in emergency shelters, most of them in Florida, and that number was expected to swell to 20,000 across five states by week’s end, Kieserman said. Bo Patterson, the mayor of Port St. Joe, just south of Mexico Beach, rode out the storm in his house seven blocks from the beach, describing the scene outside as “very, very scary.” He was one of about 2,500 of the town’s 3,500 residents who ended up staying put, many of them caught off guard by the storm’s rapid escalation as it approached. “This happened so quickly,” he said. FEMA head Brock Long acknowledged that early evacuation efforts in the area were slow in comparison to how quickly the hurricane intensified. Michael grew from a tropical storm into a Category 4 hurricane over the course of about 40 hours. “Satellite images of Michael’s evolution on Tuesday night were, in a word, jaw-dropping,” wrote Bob Henson, a meteorologist with weather site Weather Underground. With a low barometric pressure recorded at 919 millibars, the measure of a hurricane’s force, Michael ranked as the third-strongest storm on record to make landfall in the continental United States. Only Hurricane Camille on the Mississippi Gulf Coast in 1969 and the so-called Labor Day hurricane of 1935 in the Florida Keys were more intense. President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for all of Florida, freeing up federal assistance to supplement state and local disaster responses. About 3,500 Florida National Guard troops were deployed to assist with evacuations and storm recovery, along with more than 1,000 search-and-rescue personnel, Governor Rick Scott said. The Pentagon said it had pre-positioned more than 2,200 active-duty military personnel, along with helicopters, high-water vehicles and swift-water boats for deployment as needed. Even before landfall, the hurricane disrupted energy operations in the Gulf, cutting crude oil production by more than 40 percent and natural gas output by nearly a third as offshore platforms were evacuated ahead of the storm’s arrival.

RICHARD FAUSSET,"‘We are bracing for a hard hit’ Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina said that the lanes of two major divided highways — Interstate 26 and U.S. 501 — would be reversed to make them one-way, carrying traffic only away from the coast for the mandatory evacuations starting at noon on Tuesday, and that two other routes might also be reversed if needed. Schools and state offices in the lower half of the state will be closed. “We know that this evacuation order I’m issuing is going to be inconvenient for some people,” the governor said. “We do not want to risk one South Carolina life in this hurricane.” In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper asked President Trump on Monday to declare a federal state of emergency for his state. In coastal Dare County, the local emergency management agency announced a mandatory evacuation for all residents and visitors on Hatteras Island, the long, slender barrier island off the North Carolina coast, with a similar order to go into effect Tuesday for the rest of the county. Schools in 17 counties were expected to be closed on Tuesday. “The forecast places North Carolina in the bull’s-eye of Hurricane Florence, and the storm is rapidly getting stronger,” Governor Cooper said. “When weather forecasters tell us ‘life-threatening,’ we know it’s serious. We are bracing for a hard hit.” A double threat, supercharged by climate change Hurricane Florence presents a double threat to the region, said J. Marshall Shepherd, a meteorologist and professor of geography at the University of Georgia. First, the coast faces high winds and storm surge from a powerful direct hit. But farther inland, he added, the probability of severe flooding is high if the storm stalls for several days once it makes landfall, as predicted. “The models are suggesting something very similar to what we saw with Harvey,” Professor Shepherd said, referring to last year’s catastrophic flooding in Houston and elsewhere. “This is another example of a one-two-punch storm,” he said. And although people generally prepare for coastal damage, they may underestimate the flooding threat. Graphic The storm strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane as it continued on a path toward North Carolina and South Carolina, where it could make landfall by the end of the week. “People have a hard time internalizing, preparing for something that’s outside their realm of experience,” he said. But Florence could bring conditions that people have not seen in their lifetimes. “It’s a dire situation that I believe is setting up,” he said. Climate change is leading to more destructive storms in a number of ways, Professor Shepherd noted. “When we have a storm like Florence, it’s certainly going to be shoving higher sea levels onto the coastline,” he said. Although he said he was wary of linking individual storms to climate change, he added that scientific research laid out in authoritative documents like the National Climate Assessment of 2015 state that a warming climate increases the likelihood of “rainier storms,” with an increased risk of flooding. Other scientific research suggests that Florence is part of the trend of storms affected by climate change. A 2014 study in the journal Nature shows a “poleward migration” of intense storms, and further research links climate change to a “wavier” jet stream, which could contribute to weakened steering currents, a phenomenon that kept Hurricane Harvey over Houston and could stall Florence over the Carolinas, as well. Schools and government offices closing Schools were scheduled to close Tuesday in large swaths of North and South Carolina, with many of them set to serve as shelters for people fleeing the hurricane. In South Carolina, Governor McMaster issued an executive order Monday closing all state offices and public schools, including state colleges, universities and technical colleges, in 26 counties threatened by Hurricane Florence. The closings would affect more than 430,000 students in kindergarten through high school, said Ryan Brown, a spokesman for the state education department. Schools on higher ground that have been designated as shelters will be serving food and staffed by the American Red Cross and other relief workers, he said. Although South Carolina schools are experienced at dealing with hurricanes, this one is expected to be the most challenging the state has seen in a long time, Mr. Brown said. “This is the strongest hurricane we’ve had since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. That was a direct hit to Charleston, Category 4.” In North Carolina, schools in 17 eastern counties were expected to close, said Graham H. Wilson, a spokesman for the state’s department of public instruction. Most of those closures were set to begin Tuesday, but some were scheduled for Wednesday, and the timing of others was still to be announced. “We do anticipate more closings, once the path and severity of the storm is more certain,” Mr. Wilson said. Shelves emptied; homes, pets and iconic cows secured People in the Carolinas shared photos on social media of long lines and empty shelves as they shopped for groceries, propane and other storm supplies.

Victoria Rodriguez,"Hurricane Michael was one of the most powerful hurricanes to hit the continental U.S. in almost 50 years, according to the Associated Press. The hurricane made landfall in Mexico Beach, Florida, as a Category 4 storm on Wednesday and then weakened as it moved through Georgia. Now designated a tropical storm, Michael is headed toward North and South Carolina, which were both recently devastated by Hurricane Florence. SEE ALSO: Photos show widespread destruction in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael Although the full scope of the damage is still being evaluated, preliminary reports have included power outages, uprooted trees, flooding, and demolished homes. At least six people have died as a result of the hurricane. CoreLogic, a financial data company, estimates insured storm losses could reach $4.5 billion. Recovery work has started in Florida, so if you'd like to help the survivors there and in Georgia, here's our list of ways you can provide support: 1. Donate to disaster-relief organizations. The nonprofit Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities, compiled a list of organizations providing general aid and relief, as well as food, shelter, medical care, and other necessities. If you want to ensure that your donation goes directly to Hurricane Michael relief, check first with the nonprofit about how they earmark financial gifts. Here are the organizations listed by Charity Navigator: GlobalGiving, International Relief Teams, International Medical Corps, Save the Children, Direct Relief, American Kidney Fund, DonorsChoose.org, World Help, American Red Cross, LeSea Global Feed the Hungry, SBP, Americares, Good360, World Hope International, First Book, Christian Relief Fund, World Vision, Matthew 25: Ministries, Heart to Heart International, Catholic Charities Diocese of St. Petersburg, Big Cat Rescue, Feeding the Gulf Coast, and Feeding Tampa Bay. Though not featured on Charity Navigator's list, Habitat for Humanity is taking donations to carry out their recovery plan following the storm. Portlight Inclusive Disaster Strategies, which receives donations, is working to assist people with disabilities, older adults, and other people with access and functional needs. 2. Help provide emergency supplies. Several of the above organizations are focused on meeting the urgent need for food, water, clothing, and shelter. World Vision, a Christian humanitarian organization, is delivering supplies, such as food, hygiene kits, clean water, blankets, diapers, and other personal care items to those affected and displaced by Hurricane Michael. You can donate here. Global Giving, an international crowdfunding community that supports local nonprofits, launched a Hurricane Michael relief fund to provide emergency supplies as well as long-term assistance. 3. Donate to GoFundMe campaigns. GoFundMe has created a general relief fund to raise $50,000. The funds will be managed by The Direct Impact Fund, an independent nonprofit that distributes funds to verified campaigns and aid organizations. GoFundMe has also created a hub for verified individual campaigns related to Michael. If you're looking for additional resources on how to assess nonprofits and their work providing relief aid, consider consulting Charity Navigator or other charity watchdogs, like GuideStar, Charity Watch, and BBB Wise Giving Alliance.","Hurricane Michael was one of the most powerful hurricanes to hit the continental U.S. in almost 50 years, according to the Associated Press.

ABC News,"It's been nearly six months since Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico, and while many communities are still struggling, one is celebrating a small victory. When Maria made landfall Sept. 20, a bridge connecting 60 familes to Utuado, a town of about 33,000 two hours southwest of San Juan, was washed away. On Tuesday, Gov. Ricardo Rossello was on hand to dedicate a new bridge near the site of the old one. ""Utuado was at one point considered ground zero after the most devastating, slowest and most impactful natural catastrophe in the modern history of Puerto Rico,"" Rosello said. When ABC News arrived in Utuado less than two weeks after the storm, residents had cobbled together a makeshift ladder to reach what was left of the bridge from the waterbed. Over the following weeks, a jerry-rigged shopping cart on a line became a lifeline for food and medicine. Rossello, joined by a resident who'd been left stranded, christened the new bridge with a bottle of champange and called it a symbol of ""the commitment and the resiliency of the people of Puerto Rico.”","It's been nearly six months since Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico, and while many communities are still struggling, one is celebrating a small victory.

Suzanne Barlyn,"(Reuters) - U.S. insurers are bracing for what could be $20 billion in losses as Hurricane Florence barrels toward the Carolinas and Virginia, bringing punishing rains and potentially deadly flooding. Hurricane Florence, on track to become the first Category 4 storm to make a direct hit on North Carolina in six decades, howled closer to shore on Wednesday, as schools and factories were being shuttered and authorities ordered more than 1 million people in the region to evacuate. Losses from Florence could be on par with those from two previous storms: Hurricane Hazel, which ravaged North Carolina in 1954, causing $15 billion in losses, and Hurricane Hugo in 1989, which caused $20 billion, according to a report from risk modeling firm RMS on Tuesday. “As we look back at previous events, although hurricanes making landfall in the Carolinas are rare, the losses through this triple-threat of storm surge, wind and inland flood, could also be significant,” RMS said in the report. The firm will have a better estimate for total insured losses after Florence makes landfall. The slow-moving storm could dump between 20 and 30 inches of rain in the Carolinas after making landfall, according to a report on Wednesday by risk modeler AIR Worldwide. More than 758,000 homes in the Carolinas and Virginia are at risk, according to risk assessment service CoreLogic. Liberty Mutual Insurance and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company write the most commercial property insurance coverage in North and South Carolina, according to a report on Wednesday by Moody’s, citing data from SNL Financial. Other top commercial property insurers in the region include The Travelers Companies, Chubb Ltd. and a U.S. subsidiary of Zurich Insurance Group, Moody’s said. The S&amp;P Composite 1500 Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Index fell 0.5 percent on Wednesday, with shares of insurers including Travelers Companies Inc, Allstate Corp, American International Group Inc and Chubb Ltd trading down less than one percent. “Stocks tend to fall in front of a storm because of uncertainty,” said Sandler O’Neill analyst Paul Newsome. They typically rebound once insurers and risk modelers get a clearer picture of actual losses and whether individual companies have enough capital in place to cover them, Newsome said.

(Photo: Mobile Regional Airport) Tropical Storm Gordon has forced the cancellation of several flights along the Gulf Coast, but it did not appear that the storm would create widespread cancellations after making landfall late Tuesday. In total, about a dozen flights were canceled Wednesday at airports that included Mobile, Alabama; Gulfport/Biloxi, Mississippi; and Pensacola, Florida. A similar number of flights faced disruptions Tuesday, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. Despite the modest cancellation tally, travelers to the region should be prepared for delays and lingering cancellations Wednesday. FLIGHT TRACKER : Is your flight on time? Most big airlines – including American, Delta, Southwest and United – had already waived change fees for airports in the storm’s path. The weather waivers allowed travelers to make changes – with some fine print – to try and avoid the storm. Details varied by carrier, but the policies generally allowed eligible customers to make one change without paying extra. Only flights on certain dates were covered by the waivers, with the details again varying by carrier. Those wishing to reschedule their flights also were given a window to do so; flights moved beyond an airline’s booking window typically would be exempt from change fees, though a new fare would apply.

Jeremy Berke,"Hurricane Lane, captured by a NOAA satellite. NOAA Hawaii may face a direct hit from a Category 5 hurricane later this week. The National Weather Service on Tuesday night said that Hurricane Lane had been upgraded to a Category 5 storm, meaning it has the potential to bring winds in excess of 157 miles-per-hour and cause severe damage to Hawaii's islands. ""Major Hurricane Lane is passing to the south-southeast of the Big Island tonight and is expected to begin a turn northwest toward the islands later today,"" The National Weather Service said. ""The center of Lane will track dangerously close to the islands Thursday through Saturday."" The National Weather Service issued a hurricane warning for the storm, which is the most severe alert level. A hurricane warning means a hazardous weather event is ""imminent or likely."" The weather service further warned that ""life-threatening impacts are likely"" as the hurricane makes its closest approach to Hawaii, and issued a hurricane watch for Oahu, Maui, and other Hawaiian islands as meteorologists closely track the storm. Beyond wind damage, the National Weather Service warns that powerful hurricanes like Lane can cause intense rain, tidal surges, flooding, and even localized tornadoes. Even if the center of the hurricane doesn't make landfall, rough surf, rain, and wind could still cause flooding and severe damage to communities in Hawaii. The probable path of Hurricane Lane. Central Pacific Hurricane Center Hawaii Governor David Ige issued an emergency proclamation on Saturday to ""provide relief for disaster damages, losses and suffering"" associated with the storm.

Hawaii residents have rushed to prepare for the oncoming hurricane, stocking up on non-perishable foods, bottled water, and life essentials like toilet paper, according to the Associated Press. Schools in Maui and Oahu will be closed starting Wednesday, and all non-essential government employees on those islands will be put on administrative leave, according to the AP. Hurricanes rarely make landfall in Hawaii as the central Pacific sees fewer storms than the Atlantic, and Hawaii is a ""small target"" in the Pacific Ocean, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller.

Sinéad Baker,"Japan is being pounded by the strongest typhoon to hit the nation in 25 years, which made landfall on Tuesday with so much force that it smashed a huge tanker ship into a bridge. Typhoon Jebi dragged the 292-foot-long (89m) Houunmaru from its anchored position at sea, and smashed it into a bridge near Osaka. Video recorded by state broadcaster NHK shows the Houunmaru being washed repeatedly into the damaged bridge, which links Osaka's Kansai Airport to the mainland: Jebi has hit Japan with gusts as strong as 130 mph, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It is the strongest typhoon to make landfall in Japan since 1993. Keita Sakai, a spokesman for the Japan Coast Guard, said that 11 people were on board the Houunmaru but that none had been hurt, according to CNN. The Houunmaru tanker was pushed by strong winds into the bridge connecting Kansai Airport to the mainland near Osaka.

TIME Staff,"Puerto Rico is slowly recovering from another major blackout caused by a tree falling on a main supply line during a power restoration project. The Washington Post reports that about 840,000 people were initially left without power, citing the island’s Electric Power Authority, which announced the disruption on Twitter. The company has since said most service should be resumed within a few hours. Crews were reportedly clearing land in Cayey, a town in the island’s southeast, when the tree fell onto a line supplying the capital San Juan and several surrounding communities. The mountainous area was hard-hit by outages caused by Hurricane Maria in September of last year. Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory home to more than three million U.S. citizens, suffered the biggest blackout in U.S. history after the devastating hurricane made landfall. The island’s power authority reported in March that about 100,000 people were still without service a full six months after the storm, according to CNN.","About 840,000 people were initially left without power",2018-04-13T06:39:20Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Puerto Rico Is Recovering From Another Blackout Caused by a Fallen Tree,http://time.com/5238935/puerto-rico-blackout-cayey-prepa/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gettyimages-866358444.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,landfall,1

After the crackdown on families began and federal courts were flooded with immigration cases, the number of people charged under federal drug trafficking laws dropped by 30 percent along the border, a USA TODAY review of court dockets and Justice Department records found Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorneys office in New Mexico said the drop in drug cases there ""is completely unrelated to the offices immigration enforcement efforts.""

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption The aftermath of Storm Tembin on Mindanao island Rescuers are searching for victims of a tropical storm in the southern Philippines, where nearly 200 people have died in mudslides and flash floods. Rescue teams have yet to reach some of the affected areas on Mindanao island. Many people are missing after Storm Tembin, with winds up to 80km/h (50mph), swept through the area. The towns of Tubod and Piagapo were badly hit, while the remote Dalama village was wiped out by flash floods. The storm is now moving west. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was saddened by the loss of life, adding that the UN was ready to help. There are fears the death toll will rise further. Tembin, known as Vinta in the Philippines, started lashing Mindanao on Friday, with a state of emergency declared in some areas including the Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur regions. Regional officials quoted by the Rappler website said there were 127 fatalities in Lanao del Norte, up to 50 in the Zamboanga peninsula and at least 18 in Lanao del Sur. Tubod police officer Gerry Parami told the AFP news agency that there had been at least 19 deaths in the town, which is in Lanao del Norte. Another official told AFP that at least 10 people had died in the town of Piagapo, 10km east of Tubod. A number of homes in the two towns were buried by boulders. Speaking about Dalama, he said ""the river rose and most of the homes were swept away. The village is no longer there"". Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The loss of communications is hampering rescue efforts The official added that volunteers were digging through mud to try to recover bodies in the village. ""We've sent rescuers but they're making little progress,"" Saripada Pacasum said. More deaths were reported in Bukidnon, Iligan and Misamis Occidental. Power cuts and the loss of communications have hampered rescue efforts. Andrew Morris, from the UN children's agency Unicef in Mindanao, said in some areas there were big risks of disease, particularly for children, and restoring clean water supplies would be a priority. ""Lanao del Sur province is the poorest in the Philippines, and in the past seven months there have been around 350,000 people displaced in that province because of fighting,"" he told the BBC, referring to battles between government forces and Islamist militants in Marawi. Meanwhile, Richard Gordon, of the Philippines Red Cross, told the BBC: ""We have already provided water and hot food. ""And we're going to be distributing non-food items - certainly blankets, mosquito nets and certainly hygiene kits for those who are in evacuation centres so that we can alleviate the suffering of many of the folks there.""

Associated Press,"(MIAMI) — The names of two hurricanes that caused widespread devastation from Florida to Virginia last year have been retired.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says Florence and Michael will be replaced with Francine and Milton. The new names will first appear during the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season.
Names are retired when hurricanes are so destructive that recycling them would be insensitive. Eighty-eight names have been dropped from the list for the Atlantic and Caribbean since storms were first named in 1953.
According to a NOAA statement Wednesday, Florence caused at least 51 deaths in September amid record flooding across the Carolinas and Virginia.
Michael made landfall in October with 155-mph (250-kph) winds. The hurricane was blamed for at least 45 deaths from Florida’s Panhandle through Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia.

Max Golembo,"Hurricane Florence, dubbed the ""storm of a lifetime"" by the National Weather Service, has slowed dramatically overnight Wednesday and may not officially make landfall until the weekend. While this may lessen wind speeds by landfall, it could increase rainfall totals to as much as 40 inches in North Carolina. Interested in Hurricane Florence? Add Hurricane Florence as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricane Florence news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Florence is a dangerous Category 4 hurricane Wednesday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph -- down from 140 mph overnight. Florence is located about 575 miles southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. The path, intensity and timing of the storm is likely to keep changing through the day Wednesday, but the latest 5 a.m. update shows Florence will no longer be close to Category 5 -- with winds of 145 mph -- through Thursday morning. Florence's path has it slowing and spinning just off the coast of North Carolina. It begins to slow down during the day Thursday and that’s when it will begin to encounter friction from land and weaken significantly. Winds may lessen, but because of that slowdown, rainfall totals will be even higher than previously forecast. The southeast coast of North Carolina could see as much as 40 inches of rain -- in line with the catastrophic flooding caused last year in the Houston area by Hurricane Harvey. Rainfall could be as much as 40 inches locally along the North Carolina coast. ""This will likely be the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast, and that's saying a lot given the impacts we've seen from Hurricanes Diana, Hugo, Fran, Bonnie, Floyd, and Matthew,"" the National Weather Service said. ""I can't emphasize enough the potential for unbelievable damage from wind, storm surge, and inland flooding with this storm."" As many as 1.7 million people have been ordered to evacuate across South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Many of those people were already on the road Tuesday. People drive over a drawbridge in Wrightsville Beach, N.C., as they evacuate the area in advance of Hurricane Florence, Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2018. ""If they say leave, leave,"" said Jennifer Forte, who was in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on Tuesday and headed toward Greenville. ""And my job is closed. I work for the government, they’ve closed. The school’s closed until Friday, so there’s no reason to stay, really."" North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper advised much the same in a press conference Tuesday, warning locations hit by high winds and floodwaters could be without power for ""several days."" Hurricane warnings, watches and tropical storm watches are now in place for the South Carolina and North Carolina coasts. ""We’ll be asking people to prepare their emergency kit,"" he said. ""Get food, water, if there are medications they may need. Pull together their important documents... make a plan for your pets. Also, understand that a lot of people are going to be without power probably for several days if not longer."" The federal government has made similar warnings, with FEMA Administrator Brock Long saying Florence could knock out power for ""weeks."" As millions head out of the area, resources like the Red Cross are preparing to deal with the disaster -- and possibly weeks of problems resulting from it. Brandon Alston carries a board to be placed over a window of the Casemate Museum on Fort Monroe, Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2018, in Hampton, Va. The staff is preparing for rising waters and other possible flooding due to Hurricane Florence. ""This is extremely serious,"" Major Ken Morris, with the Salvation Army’s Disaster Response Team, told ABC News. ""We’ve got a number of volunteers, actually we’ve got over 3 million volunteers across the nation that can help us. But we need our partners in mission. Folks have come through wonderfully in the past and again in non-affected areas. We’ve got canteens coming in. It’s like an accordion. As this thing increases, we increase our resources.""

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Michael strengthened to a Category 2 storm on Tuesday as it moved toward the Florida Panhandle, where residents were ordered to get out of harm’s way ahead of life-threatening waves, winds and rains. Tens of thousands of people were told to evacuate the coastal areas in nine counties as the storm approached with winds of 100 miles per hour (155 km per hour). Michael could grow to a Category 3 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale before it makes landfall on Wednesday, potentially the most powerful storm to strike the Panhandle in at least a decade. Florida Governor Rick Scott told ABC’s “Good Morning America” program on Tuesday that the effects of the storm would not be felt for another 12 hours and warned of the potential deadly impact of what could be a 12-foot (3.7-meter) coastal storm surge. Asked if there would be more evacuation orders, he said officials were monitoring the situation but that people in potentially affected areas should not take any chances against such a large storm surge. “No one’s going to survive,” such a wall of water, Scott said. “Don’t take a chance.” The storm was forecast to make landfall along a 150-mile (240-km) stretch of the Florida coast with Panama City at the center, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Residents along more than 300 miles of coastline, from the Alabama/Florida border to the Suwannee River in Florida, have been told to brace for hurricane conditions, forecasters said. As much as 1 foot (30 cm) of rain is also forecast across Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, the NHC reported. It warned that both could trigger deadly flooding, adding that residents within the hurricane warning zone should also “prepare for life-threatening winds.” Scott declared a state of emergency in 35 counties along the Panhandle and Florida’s Big Bend regions. About 1,250 National Guard soldiers were assisting and more than 4,000 troops were placed on standby. “We haven’t seen anything like this in the Panhandle for decades,” Scott told ABC, adding that water could come miles inland. State offices, schools and universities were closed through the end of the week in Panhandle counties. Lines at gasoline stations grew as people left. Those who stayed emptied grocery store shelves of water and other supplies. In neighboring Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey declared an emergency for the entire state on Monday, anticipating wind damage, heavy rains and power outages. Hurricane Michael would be the first major hurricane to hit the Panhandle since Hurricane Dennis in 2005, which made landfall near Pensacola, according to hurricane center data. Torrential downpours and flash flooding over the weekend caused 13 deaths in Central America after Michael formed off the coast of northern Honduras. After striking Florida, Michael is forecast to move up the East Coast on Wednesday and Thursday through the Carolinas, which are still recovering from Hurricane Florence. Energy companies halted nearly one-fifth of Gulf of Mexico oil production and evacuated personnel from 10 platforms on Monday. The Gulf of Mexico produces 17 percent of daily U.S. crude oil output and 5 percent of daily natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

We asked ”Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda to share his thoughts on why this is important. Read his story below, and donate now at g.co/supportPR. Puerto Rico is 35 by 100 miles—an archipelago with a main island and two adjacent island-municipalities, Culebra and Vieques. But this tiny paradise has made an outsized impression on the world stage...artists…musicians…major league shortstops…and five Miss Universes. A territory of the United States since 1898, Puerto Ricans, by birth, are U.S. citizens. Right now, there are more Puerto Ricans in the continental United States (over 4.5 million) than on the island, 3.3 million. It’s not surprising that when the island is in trouble, the diaspora says, “presente.” Puerto Rico is my second home. It’s where my parents were born. My mom lived there until she was a toddler, and my dad grew up there until he was about 18 and came to New York for graduate school. I had the incredible privilege and good fortune of having them send me to Puerto Rico every summer. My sister and I lived with my grandparents in Vega Alta, a humble town on the northern coast of the island. I used to work at my aunt’s school supply store on the frozen slushie machine. And Puerto Rico is where Hurricane Maria made landfall on September 20, 2017—the largest hurricane to hit the Caribbean in modern history. The devastation was widespread: most estimates put the damage costs at over $90 billion, the third most costly hurricane ever. In less than 48 hours, 80 percent of Puerto Rico’s agriculture was destroyed and 85 percent of above-ground telephone and internet cables were knocked out. After Maria made landfall, there was a terrible silence from the island that lasted for days. We looked for any news or pictures on social media. We texted over and over again, hoping our loved ones could find a way to get a message through. For me, it was five days until we heard from any family members; we found a picture of our uncle helping in a supply line in Vega Alta. Never before has a hurricane done this much damage to the island—to its already fragile power grid, to the way of life, to the land itself. I’ll never forget when we flew to Puerto Rico a month after Maria; seeing bare mountains for the first time was terrifying. Nature is already making a comeback—those islands that were brown in the wake of Maria are green again. But due to the unpreparedness for this crisis and the halting attempts to restore power, Puerto Ricans in many parts of the island are still struggling. Power is still not fully restored. And this year’s hurricane season has just begun. In the nine months since Hurricane Maria, people all over the world have opened their piggy banks and opened their hearts to help. Across the country, many have made their voices heard, demanding action from Congress. It has meant so much. Progress has been made, but there is still work to be done. Now I ask that you join us once again in supporting economic recovery efforts on the island. Google will be matching donations up to $2 million to the Hispanic Federation and Mercy Corps—two organizations that have been helping people on the ground throughout the relief effort. You can donate now at g.co/supportPR. I wake up every morning and I’m grateful that my family is from Puerto Rico.

That’s only half of it: Even if it lapses back to a Category 3, the storm is expected to slow down over the Carolina coast, dumping upwards of 25 inches of rain in parts of Eastern N.C through the weekend, beating the previous 24-inch record set by Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Florence is an example of the kind of storm we are likely to see more of as the planet heats up. Warmer-than-average water—surface temperatures in the Western Atlantic are currently at 84 degrees, 3-4 degrees higher than normal for this time of year—is lending it power, as increased evaporation fills the air with water vapor that acts like hurricane fuel. More broadly, according to the 2014 National Climate Assessment, the amount of rain falling in “very heavy events”—those at the top 1 percent of all rainstorms, often hurricanes like Florence—has risen by 27 percent in the Southeast between 1958 and 2013. It’s not completely novel. The coastal Carolinas were walloped by Hurricanes Hazel and Hugo, in 1954 and 1989 respectively. Floyd in 1999 prompted what was then the largest peacetime evacuation in U.S history, and its state-record rainfall was worse than it looks, because it came just days after Dennis dumped 8–10 inches across the Eastern Coastal Plain. That purple part has a chance to break the state’s all-time rain record. But there are two big differences between then and now: First, we’ve got a few more decades of global warming under our belts. Second, there’s been rapid population growth in the U.S. Sun Belt and in coastal counties in particular. North Carolina’s beloved coastline isn’t that well-populated relative to states to the north and south. As of 2008, less than 10 percent of the state’s population lived in a coastal county, compared to nearly 20 percent in South Carolina and nearly 40 percent in Virginia. Still, particularly in the southern half of the state around Wilmington—where the storm currently looks to hit worst—population growth has been rapid. That means there will be a lot of residents who won’t even remember Hurricane Hugo (when it hit 30 years ago, it was the costliest hurricane in U.S. history). North Carolina has a much stronger tradition of regulating coastal development than, say, Florida. Even so, reckoning with climate change impacts has been a more complicated story, notes Michael Orbach, a professor emeritus of marine science at Duke who has been involved in coastal planning in the state for decades. “The single biggest problem in planning with respect to sea level rise is all planning and zoning [in North Carolina] was based on sea level rise staying the same. That was true for 6,000 years, but now it’s not.” In 2011, North Carolina’s Coastal Resources Commission put out a dire forecast for sea level rise on the Outer Banks. But then real estate interests successfully convinced the Republican-led statehouse to discard those conclusions. “You can believe whatever you want about global warming,” said state Rep. Pat McElraft, a Republican and real estate agent who sponsored a 2012 law to put a four-year moratorium on state regulations accounting for sea level rise. “But when you go to make planning policies here for our residents and protecting their property values and insurance rates, it’s a very serious thing to us on the coast.” The moratorium expired in 2016. In the meantime, coastal towns undertook their own measures to prepare, passing freeboard laws that require new construction to rise above the FEMA “base flood elevation.” A 2015 report showed that local building standards had prompted a big chunk of the state’s coastal population to add two feet of freeboard. Still, some populous areas were just getting around to freeboard requirements this summer—such as Wilmington, which has grown from 55,000 people in 1990 to approximately 117,000 today. Preparing for the rain is another story. The towns of Eastern North Carolina, which are now projected to be just on the edge of Florence’s worst rainfall bands, are among the most vulnerable places in the United States to inland flooding. In 1999, Flooding from Floyd is thought to have caused a spike in gastrointestinal problems after the state’s proliferating hog farms contaminated neighbors and natural areas with manure-filled water. The state cracked down, for a while, but didn’t solve the problem. After Hurricane Matthew, neighbors were inundated with hog-water again. Steve Wing, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina, flatly told the Washington Post, “Storing vast quantities of fecal waste in flood plains is a serious and preventable public health threat.” That pattern—talk big and then forget about it—is typical of the state’s approach, argues Stan Riggs, a coastal marine geologist at East Carolina University in Greenville who has been advising local governments on flooding for half a century. After Floyd, for example, local governments passed new floodplain ordinances and the state drafted a new hydraulic model to account for changing land use. Riggs: “Everybody cries crocodile tears, says ‘We’re never going to let this happen again,’ but within a year after Floyd flooding in Greensville they were building student condominiums where there had been 10 feet of water just a year before. The economics take over and greed takes over.” Greenville grew by 53 percent between 1990 and 2015, though the state argues that changes in land use have been minimal. In the Carolinas, as along the Gulf Coast, growth has been characterized by a fast-and-loose approach to water management laws. Older developments sit in the floodplain; newer ones sprout unregulated or win exemptions from tax-hungry governments. South Carolina’s devastating 2015 flooding was characterized by the failure of little-regulated, privately-owned dams, some of which had been built to create artificial lakes for suburban homeowners. In coastal North Carolina, population density has more than doubled in the past 50 years as natural land has been transformed from villages, forests and wetlands to suburban sprawl. The ongoing loss of natural areas that would have once served to dampen the impact of both storm surge and stormwater will change the way those phenomena affect even houses that didn’t flood during, say, the rainstorms that ravaged the state in 1999. All told, 430,000 North Carolinians live in the 100-year-floodplain on and off the coast, including much of villages like Princeville, a historic black enclave that flooded during Floyd and again during Matthew. “These villages and the towns built their infrastructure after World War II, and now growth is taking place really fast in big rings around that. All the water runs into that old core and gets backed up,” says Riggs. “What you’re going to see starting tomorrow will be a lot like what you saw in Houston.”","On Wednesday morning, Hurricane Florence was spinning towards North Carolina as a Category 4 storm.

Jenny Gathright,"Alberto, which is moving north through the Gulf of Mexico at a rate of 15 miles per hour, is still categorized as a Subtropical Storm. But the National Hurricane Center said Sunday morning that ""it is gaining some more tropical characteristics."" According to an update from the National Hurricane Center, the center of the storm is predicted to reach the northern U.S. gulf coast as early as Sunday night, and once it makes landfall, it is expected to weaken to a tropical depression. The storm currently has maximum sustained winds of nearly 45 miles per hour. In its advisory issued at 8:00 a.m. ET Saturday, the National Hurricane Center maintained a storm surge watch along the U.S. gulf coast from Crystal River in western Florida to the Mississippi-Alabama border. The water could reach heights of 2 to 4 feet, with the deepest water expected along the immediate coast. A tropical storm warning is in effect for the Dry Tortugas off of Florida's gulf coast, which has already started to experience tropical storm conditions. The Tropical Storm warning extends to the area from Florida's Bonita Beach to the Mississippi-Alabama border. A tropical storm watch is in effect along the Mississippi-Alabama border to the mouth of the Pearl River in the Gulf of Mexico. The National Hurricane Center also warns of possibly life-threatening flash floods and mudslides in Cuba, where Alberto could bring an accumulation of 5 to 10 inches of rain and isolated storm totals of up to 20 inches of rain. On Saturday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for all 67 counties of Florida. In an update on preparedness efforts issued Saturday, Scott said the Florida National Guard has 5,500 guard members on call to help with storm-related emergencies. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey has also issued a state of emergency, effective 6:00 a.m. local time Sunday, for several counties in Alabama: Autauga, Baldwin, Barbour, Bibb, Bullock, Butler, Chambers, Chilton, Choctaw, Clarke, Coffee, Conecuh, Coosa, Covington, Crenshaw, Dale, Dallas, Elmore, Escambia, Geneva, Greene, Hale, Henry, Houston, Lee, Lowndes, Macon, Marengo, Mobile, Monroe, Montgomery, Perry, Pickens, Pike, Russell, Sumter, Tallapoosa, Tuscaloosa, Washington and Wilcox. Water, not wind, tends to be the deadliest factor in storms like Alberto, according to a 2014 study by Dr. Ed Rappaport of the National Weather Service. Rappaport found that during the 50-year period of 1963 to 2012, about half of all U.S. deaths from tropical cyclones were caused by storm surge. In addition, about 90 percent of the deaths happened in water-related incidents, most often drowning. The Atlantic hurricane season officially starts June 1 and ends Nov. 30. The NOAA's Climate Prediction Center's annual forecast says up to four hurricanes could form in the Atlantic this hurricane season, and that overall the intensity of this hurricane season will probably be near or above normal. According to NPR's Camila Domonoske, even an average hurricane season can be tremendously harmful, especially for places like the Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico, which were hit hard by the hurricanes Harvey and Maria last year. ""The seasonal outlook can't predict landfall areas, but the forecasters warn that even an average season involves 'quite a few hurricanes.' "" 'We know certain areas have been compromised from last year's storm, and that makes hurricane preparedness... even more important this year,' says Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane season forecaster at the Climate Prediction Center.""

Mark Kaufman,"While flying a drone over the completely flooded four-lane Interstate 40 on Monday, the North Carolina Highway Patrol spotted an unusual sight: A motorized boat leaving a large wake over the highway. The storm formerly known as Florence — which hit North Carolina as a Hurricane last Friday and then proceeded to drop historic rainfall over much of the state — has brought catastrophic and deadly flooding to inland cities and coastal communities alike. SEE ALSO: How flocks of birds got trapped inside the eye of Hurricane Florence Florence has demolished rainfall records. Previously, North Carolina's rainfall record from a storm was 24 inches, set by Hurricane Floyd nearly twenty years ago. On Monday, the National Weather Service reported that nearly 36 inches fell on Elizabethtown, North Carolina. At least 11 other areas also broke the old record. State Highway Patrol Sgt. Michael Baker said via phone that the drone operations will continue over the highway as the agency works to identify flooded and troubled areas. Baker was unsure, however, whether this particular boat was part of state reconnaissance efforts, or simply someone taking a bizarre boating trip down a U.S. highway. Aside from the boat on the freeway, the Highway Patrol drone also spotted completely submerged vehicles and vast swathes of brown water inundating land well beyond the highway. In cities well inland, like Fayetteville, North Carolina, the floodwaters are continuing to rise, even as the main remnants of the storm moved over the Mid-Atlantic states and into New England on Tuesday. A hurricane that makes landfall is never good, but even worse is a slow-moving storm. Atmospheric scientists found these tropical storms have slowed considerably since the 1950s, which gives the tempests ample time to flood major U.S. transportation arteries — and transform them into brown rivers.","While flying a drone over the completely flooded four-lane Interstate 40 on Monday, the North Carolina Highway Patrol spotted an unusual sight: A motorized boat leaving a large wake over the highway.

Paulina Dedaj,"After Tropical Storm Gordon drenched parts of South Florida on Monday, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for parts of the Gulf Coast -- where the storm is expected to roar ashore as soon as late Tuesday. Meteorologists have warned Gordon likely will strengthen into a hurricane by the time it reaches coastal Mississippi and Louisiana. Voluntary evacuation orders were issued on Monday for parts of Louisiana for residents in areas outside the levee protection system. Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Monday and said 200 National Guard troops will be deployed to southeastern Louisiana. The National Hurricane Center said at 8 p.m. ET that the storm was centered 95 miles west of Fort Myers, Florida. Maximum sustained winds were clocked at 60 mph. After making landfall, it is expected to charge inland over the lower Mississippi Valley on Wednesday. The hurricane warning was placed into effect for the area stretching from the mouth of the Pearl River in Mississippi to the Alabama-Florida border. As much as 8 inches of rain could fall in some parts of the Gulf states through late Thursday. The National Hurricane Center reported that the storm could unleash ""life-threatening"" storm surge to portions of the central Gulf Coast. A storm surge warning has been issued for the area stretching from Shell Beach, Louisiana, to Dauphin Island, Alabama. The warning means there is danger of life-threatening inundation. The region could see rising waters of 3 to 5 feet. ""The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves,"" the center said. Gordon is expected to dissipate by Saturday somewhere in the central U.S. After periods of heavy rainfall, flood advisories were in effect for parts of South Florida late Monday. Tropical Storm Gordon is the Atlantic basin’s seventh named storm of the year. Fox News’ Caleb Parke and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Michael strengthened to a Category 2 storm on Tuesday as it headed for the Florida Panhandle, where residents were ordered to get out of harm’s way ahead of life-threatening waves, winds and rains. Tens of thousands of people were told to evacuate the coastal areas in nine counties as the storm moved over the Gulf of Mexico, carrying winds of 100 miles per hour (155 km per hour) and disrupting oil production. Michael could grow to a Category 3 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale before it makes landfall on Wednesday, forecasters said, potentially the most powerful storm to strike the Panhandle in at least a decade. “Hurricane Michael is a monster storm and it keeps getting more dangerous. We’re 12 hours away from seeing impacts,” Florida Governor Rick Scott told a news conference on Tuesday. “The time to prepare is now.” He warned of potential deadly impacts from a storm surge that could be as much as 12 feet (3.7 meters) over normal sea water levels, and winds that could rise to 110 mph (177 kph). People in potentially affected areas should not take any chances against such a large storm surge, Scott said. “No one’s going to survive,” such a wall of water, he added. As Michael moved over open water, energy companies halted nearly one-fifth of Gulf of Mexico oil production and evacuated personnel from 10 platforms on Monday. The Gulf of Mexico produces 17 percent of daily U.S. crude oil output and 5 percent of daily natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The storm was forecast to make landfall somewhere over the Florida Panhandle or Florida Big Bend area on Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center forecast. The center warned residents along more than 300 miles (480 km) of coastline, from the Alabama/Florida border to the Suwannee River in Florida, to brace for hurricane conditions. As much as 1 foot (30 cm) of rain was also forecast across Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, the NHC said. CLOSURES AND LINES FOR GAS Scott declared a state of emergency in 35 counties along the Panhandle and Florida’s Big Bend regions. About 1,250 National Guard soldiers were assisting and more than 4,000 troops were placed on standby. State offices, schools and universities were closed through the end of the week in Panhandle counties. Lines at gasoline stations grew as people left. Those who stayed emptied grocery store shelves of water and other supplies. In neighboring Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey declared an emergency for the entire state on Monday, anticipating wind damage, heavy rains and power outages. Hurricane Michael would be the first major hurricane to hit the Panhandle since Hurricane Dennis in 2005, which made landfall near Pensacola, according to hurricane center data. Torrential downpours and flash flooding from Michael over the weekend caused 13 deaths in Central America. After striking Florida, Michael is forecast to move up the East Coast on Wednesday and Thursday through the Carolinas, which are still recovering from Hurricane Florence.

Martin Vassolo,"Subtropical storm Alberto, slowly strengthening as it draws closer to the Gulf Coast, set off new tropical storm warnings stretching just north of Naples up past the tip of Florida's Panhandle. Forecasters said Alberto was moving north near the eastern Gulf of Mexico at 15 mph and that the storm would approach the northern Gulf Coast by Sunday night or Monday. Tropical storm warnings now cover a broad swath of coastline stretching north from Bonita Beach on Florida's southwest coast to the Mississippi-Alabama Border. In its 11 a.m. advisory, the National Hurricane Center said the storm's maximum sustained winds were 50 mph, slightly faster than the 45 mph winds recorded at 8 a.m. Alberto is located northwest of Cuba and about 130 miles southwest of Tampa. But residents in the northern Gulf Coast will feel Alberto before they see the storm, forecasters say, adding that heavy rainfall and tropical storm conditions will likely reach the region by Sunday night. Those conditions will be felt along the warning zones on the west coast of Florida as well, according to the National Hurricane Center. In the Florida Keys and the rest of South Florida, Alberto is expected to drop an additional three to six inches, with isolated storm totals of 10 inches, on Sunday, the hurricane center said. Forecasters warn that the storm could bring heavy rain and a risk of flooding and flash flooding to western Cuba, the Keys and South Florida through Sunday. Miami-Dade County, expected to be spared from the worst of the storm, is forecast to face heavy rain in squalls, brief gusty winds no stronger than 40 mph and hazardous marine conditions, according to the National Weather Service in Miami. Parts of Miami-Dade were under thunderstorm advisories early Sunday. A brief tornado warning was issued for parts of Dade County until 8:45 a.m. Sunday. The warning included Kendall, Palmetto Bay and Pinecrest, according to the National Weather Service. Among other potential impacts the region may see are flooding in vulnerable areas, isolated power outages caused by downed trees, waterspouts possible across all waters and rip currents at the beach. The Florida Panhandle into eastern Alabama and western Georgia are forecast to see four to eight inches of rain Sunday, with isolated storm totals of 12 inches. A storm surge watch is in effect from Crystal River, a coastal city in Citrus County, north toward the Mississippi-Alabama border. A tropical storm warning for Dry Tortugas has been discontinued, as has the tropical storm watch along the north-central Gulf Coast. Gradual strengthening is forecast until the storm reaches the northern Gulf Coast, at which point meteorologists expect it to weaken and become a tropical depression by Monday night or Tuesday, according to the hurricane center.

ABC News,"No tarps, no cots, and less than 200 blue roofs. That is what the Federal Emergency Management Administration’s (FEMA)'s warehouse in Puerto Rico looked like as Hurricane Maria made landfall in Sept. 2017. The vital supplies had been siphoned off elsewhere when Hurricane Irma had slammed into the U.S. Virgin Islands, prompting need for assistance. In its after-action report, FEMA’s leadership admits that it “could have better anticipated that the severity of hurricane s Irma and Maria would cause long-term, significant damage” to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. An aerial view shows the flooded neighbourhood of Juana Matos in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Catano, Puerto Rico, Sept. 22, 2017. FEMA pointed out that Puerto Rico’s government has not yet achieved a level of preparedness commensurate with much of the U.S. mainland. In the first 72 hours after Maria’s landfall, FEMA had “little information” about the status of the island’s infrastructure. week after the storm, FEMA still lacked key information, including vital details like the status of more than half of the island’s water treatment facilities and nearly half of the island's hospitals. Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on the morning of Sept, 20, 2017, plunging the island into complete darkness, causing $100 billion in damage and claimed the lives of countless people. In the wake of Hurricane Irma, FEMA moved more than 80% of its inventory from the Caribbean Distribution Center warehouse in Puerto Rico to the Port of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. That left the only FEMA warehouse in Puerto Rico with zero cots, zero tarps, less than 98,000 meals and less than 70,000 liters of water -- all as Hurricane Maria barreled towards the island. In a letter attached to the report, FEMA Administrator Brock Long wrote that “the hurricanes also showed that governments need to be better prepared with their own supplies, to have pre-positioned contracts with enforcement mechanisms, and to be ready for the financial implications of a disaster."" The agency report cites the island’s geographic distance from mainland U.S. as well as its fiscal pressures for its lack of critical infrastructure management and decreased funding for emergency management. The report also pins blame on an agency they say “entered the hurricane season with a force strength less than its target, resulting in staffing shortages across the incidents.” The agency needed over a thousand more people personnel to hit a target set for the fiscal year. FEMA defines its force strength as its workforce that has completed the administrative requirements for deployment. In the aftermath of Maria, FEMA’s Logistics Supply Chain Management System records that tracked much needed food and water supplies in real time lagged because of a lack of trained personnel on the ground. Less than a fifth of the trained staff were in Texas and Florida responding to other hurricanes. In a little over a month, the federal agency responded to three major hurricanes – Harvey, Irma, and Maria – which did a combined $265 billion in damage. Maria represents FEMA’s longest sustained air mission of food and water delivery to date. FEMA also acknowledges that the agency's reliance on cellular and broadband communications fell remarkably short of facilitating vital communications between rescuers and survivors during some of the most consequential early days of the storm for Puerto Rico. Among a number of such issues, some of the satellite phones that were sent to Puerto Rico did not work, and many that received those phones did not know how to use them. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement that “With every response or recovery effort, we take with us lessons learned that help build a nation-wide culture of preparedness and shape the way FEMA and the emergency management community respond to and recover from future disasters.” The Puerto Rico Governor’s Office tells ABC News they are still reviewing the report. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, a critic of the federal government’s response to the storm said in a statement to ABC News,“The report proves what was evident to all in Puerto Rico."" ""FEMA was unprepared and they lacked a sense of urgency, which resulted in neglect, which in turn resulted in the loss of lives,"" she said. ""It is quite troubling that they were not able to adapt their operating procedures to our reality and, from what the report says-they did not even learn from their past mistakes.” Cruz is also seeking the appointment of independent commission to “ensure those responsible are held accountable and ensure future mistakes like this do not happen again.“","No tarps, no cots, and less than 200 blue roofs.
