Caitlin Harrington,"Rich Lee had armor implanted in his shins in 2016. Soft until struck, the polymer­foam tubes could withstand the full force of a baseball bat swing. The procedure seemed promising—until his stitches burst, prompting him to rip out the tubes. It hurt like hell, but it won’t stop him from his next trial. Lee is part of a loosely con­nected group of biohackers—garage geneticists, chemists, and grinders (those who modify their own bodies)—who are stretching the capabilities of DIY augmentation. When humans optimize into something out of a sci-fi flick, you can thank these reckless pioneers for blazing our enhanced future. Good Vibrations Lee, CEO of Cyborgasmics, is developing the Lovetron 9000, an implantable vibrator that rests on a man’s pubic bone. The swipe of a magnet activates continuous pulsation, resulting in a mutually pleasurable buzz. The questionable sex device can even sync up to music. Senstronauts Artist Moon Ribas feels real-time earthquakes through foot-implanted sensors that receive seismic data via an app. She envisions a future of creative consciousness: “Imagine going to a bar, and instead of asking, ‘Where are you from?’ people ask, ‘What sense do you have?’ ” Pharma’s Robin Hood As spokesperson of the DIY medicine collective Four Thieves Vinegar, Mixæl Laufer created cheaper versions of drugs like the EpiPen. Last year, he used off-the-shelf parts to build the Apothecary Microlab, a chemical reactor, and released instructions to concoct drugs at home. DIY DNA Josiah Zayner recently achieved a breakthrough in open source genetics: a plasmid that lets tinkerers insert any organism’s gene into human cells. In October, Zayner claimed to edit his own DNA, using Crispr to modify a muscle-growth gene. No Hulk-esque side effects yet. Vital Signs In 2013, Tim Cannon had a friend slice open his arm to implant a biometric sensor called the Circadia. It monitored his temperature, beaming the data to his tablet via Bluetooth. Now he’s developing a new model that will deliver metrics like pulse oximetry and blood glucose. Glow, Dog, Glow Mississippi dog breeder David Ishee is attempting to genetically engineer bioluminescent pooches by infusing his pet mastiff’s sperm with modified genes that “glow.” By altering canine genes, Ishee hopes to eliminate common disorders in problem-­plagued purebreds.

Aimée Lutkin,"On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by an earthquake of 7.5-magnitude, followed by a 20 foot tsunami. More than 1,200 deaths have been confirmed, and the city of Palu needs help. There are a number of ways to donate, but according to the New York Times, money is a much more immediate way to help rather than canned goods, water, or clothes. Its very easy for those items to be misplaced. NPR reports that the scale of the disaster was at first difficult to determine, because communications were knocked out. The U.N. is now estimating that 1.6 million have been or will be affected in the coming recovery. The NYT and NPR suggest ed a number of organizations you can send money to who have people on the ground (to make sure it gets where it needs to go). GlobalGiving This group focuses on local organizations and currently have a goal of $1 million to help people in Sulawesi. They focus on emergency supplies first, then long-term recovery assistance. CARE CARE is also focusing on immediate needs north of Palu and towards the center of the cityespecially clean drink water, sanitation and shelter.Their county director in Indonesia, Helen Vanwel, told NPR that its a difficult project, because access is limited. A landslide has blocked the main road into Palu, flights are restricted into the airport, there is a destruction of major seaports and a general lack of communication, she said. Indonesian Red Cross According to the group, theyve mobilized 70 tons of supplies, including baby kits, mattresses and tents as well as water trucks and 15 ambulances. They say they have 179 staffers in the area already. Humanity &amp; Inclusion This organization has been in Indonesia since 2005. The theme continues to be working on immediate relief, especially medical care and psychosocial support. Save the Children There are Save the Children volunteers in Palu who are trying to establish temporary shelters from ropes and tarps, and also clearing away areas for children to safely play, because kids continue to need some normalcy and freedom when their worlds are turned upside down. UNICEF This group is also working on clean water by bringing in a mobile water treatment facility. Theyve also been working with local authorities to find the families of children who were separated from them during the disaster. The Jakarta Post also shared a few groups that are much more local, and shared a message from the National Disaster Mitigation Agency saying things like fuel (diesel fuel and gasoline), drinking water, medical personnel, medicines and field hospitals, tents, tarps, blankets, stretchers, water tanks, food, lamps, generator sets, emergency kitchens, body bags, shrouds and baby food were all needed. They also boosted the Indonesian Red Cross as an option for immediate relief. Aksi Cepat Tanggap (ACT Indonesia) ACT Indonesia as been around since 2005 as well, and are extremely transparent with their money. You can also follow them on Twitter at @ACTforHumanity to stay up to date on how things are changing on the ground.","On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by an earthquake of 7.5-magnitude, followed by a 20 foot tsunami.

Aimée Lutkin,"California began using an earthquake warning system this summer that notifies citizens of seismic shifts coming to their area. In theory, that should give you a little time to prepare for the earth moving. Heres what to do with those extra seconds. And it may be only a matter of seconds, according to the L.A. Times. The speed with which people receive that phone buzz relates to how close they are to the quakes epicenter. However, that could make all the difference, since you have a little time to get out of the way of potential falling objects, for instance. This is what you should do: While Driving Pull over! That might be easy, but its also advised that you avoid bridges, overpasses, signs, and power lines. Thats a taller order out on the highway, and maybe something to think about on your daily commute. Where would you pull over? Once youve stopped, set your parking brake and wait until the shaking stops. While Walking Around This is also an issue of finding a spot to stand away from things like power lines, walls, buildings, or other things that could drop on top of you. Remember, falling debris could also come from the side. The more open space there is around you, the better. Drop to the ground, cover your head, and hold on. While In Bed Unless youre under a skylight or something else likely to break on top of you, stay in your bed. Turn on your stomach and cover your head and neck with a pillow for protection from falling ceiling pieces. While At The Beach The danger on a beach is a possible tsunami. Dont take a chance just because theres been no warningget out of there. After the quake ends, walk inland or to high ground immediately. California offers tsunami maps to show which beaches are vulnerable to the big waves. If you cant get away, go into a concrete or steel-frame building. A tsunami can easily wipe out a wood-frame house. While At The Theater If youre at The Greek, for instance, you will want to get down in front of your seat and cover your head and neck. Be careful while exiting after the quake, as debris could still fall from above. While Out With Kids If youre holding an infant, press them against your chest, drop to the ground and cover them with your body like a cage. With mobile kids, the best position to take is on the ground on all fours, because that protects most of your vital organs. instruct them to drop down and take cover, if its available. If not, and youre inside, a corner of the room away from exterior walls and windows is the best place to hunker down. Do Not Run, Do Not Stand In A Doorway A lot of people get hurt while running during an earthquake. The warning system will hopefully give people a moment to do their running, but once the shaking starts, you should stop. Even if you make it to an exit, theres often a lot of debris around doorways. Old adobe houses that are unreinforced are safest in the doorway, but thats about it for most structures. In fact, standing in a doorway can be more dangerous, because that door will slam right on you during the quake. Its time to put that common misconception about earthquake safety to bed.","California began using an earthquake warning system this summer that notifies citizens of seismic shifts coming to their area.

Alessandra Potenza,"Last night, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck southeast of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska, prompting a tsunami warning that forced people to flee to higher grounds in the middle of the night. Fortunately, the tsunami waves were less than a foot high, and the advisories were canceled a little after 4AM local time. So why was Alaska so lucky? Powerful quakes that happen out at sea are known to cause destructive tsunamis. In 2011, a magnitude 9 earthquake in northeastern Japan triggered waves as high as 126 feet, killing nearly 20,000 people. In 2004, a similarly strong quake off the coast of Indonesia caused a tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people. Alaska also has a history of strong earthquakes: in 1964, the state experienced the most powerful quake ever recorded in the US, a 9.2 magnitude tremor followed by a tsunami that killed over 100 people. “Alaska is no stranger to these kinds of quakes,” says Don Blakeman, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey (USGS). “Alaska is no stranger to these kinds of quakes.” Earthquakes occur because the Earth’s crust is divided into plates. These plates can move smoothly against each other or become stuck. When they become stuck, they build up strain over time, until one day, the plates unstick, releasing energy that causes an earthquake. Just south of Alaska, the Pacific plate is sliding underneath the North American plate, an area called the subduction zone. That’s why the state is highly seismic, Blakeman tells The Verge. Last night’s earthquake generated because of all the strain building up on the subduction zone, but it did not occur exactly on a fault where the Pacific Ocean seafloor is sliding under the North American plate, Blakeman says. Instead, the quake occurred a little farther out, in a place where the fault is moving horizontally. This type of quake, called a strike-slip earthquake, is less likely to trigger large tsunamis, and this is probably why Alaska only saw waves of less than a foot, according to Blakeman. When earthquakes happen on the subduction zone itself, where one plate is pushing down while the other is going up, then high waves form. “To get a tsunami, you have to have substantial vertical movement on the seabed,” Blakeman says. Those types of earthquakes were responsible for the massive tsunamis in Japan and Indonesia. Aftershocks in Alaska could continue for weeks or months, Blakeman says. If the quakes generate from the same zone as last night, then large tsunamis should not be expected. But because the state sits by the Pacific-North America plate boundary, it’s normal that new earthquakes will happen in the future. When and where, exactly? That’s impossible to say. Earthquakes are so complicated that scientists aren’t able to predict them — at least not yet. “Since we can’t predict them, all we can do is be prepared,” Blakeman says.","Last night, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck southeast of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska.",2018-01-23T16:15:13Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",A powerful earthquake in Alaska didn’t trigger a big tsunami — here’s why,https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16922914/alaska-earthquake-tsunami-pacific-north-america-plate-boundary,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQqh3BMKCmEiuTLq3ign4Cnb9ag=/0x97:704x466/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10082687/earthquake.png,the-verge,The Verge,earthquake,1

Previously, the system has only been available to a limited group of beta testers, and had seen some satisfactory results in 2018. The app significantly expands access to the system. Warnings are only issued when the magnitude of the quake is 5.0 or larger and when they will be felt in the Los Angeles area. The notification is fairly intense, but that may be what you need to read to get moving:
EARTHQUAKE, EARTHQUAKE, EXPECT STRONG SHAKING. DROP, COVER, AND HOLD ON. PROTECT YOURSELF NOW!
The app was originally developed with the intention of expanding to the entire West coast, but the federal budget for creating the sensor network was eliminated. However, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has announced plans to expand again after the alert system is tested at the regional level, according to the Curbed Los Angeles. The app was made possible in LA through a partnership with the city, the Annenberg Foundation, and AT&amp;T.
In addition to providing a warning, the app also offers checklists for an earthquake survival kit, and what else you can do to prepareor recover. The app doesnt need to be open to send you a notification, but it does track your movements. It basically has to in order to know if youre in a danger zone. If youre able to take advantage of this service, you should. 
And if youre in an area that could use it, demand it: 20 seconds of warning might be exactly what you need. Contact local representatives; the implementation in Los Angeles couldnt have happened without the support of LA Mayor Eric Garcetti. The Los Angeles Times also reports that Early Warnings Lab, which also works with the USGS, is hoping to release their version of a similar app called QuakeAlert to serve statewide. You can register with them to become a potential beta tester. The more people who are interested, the more likely it is that systems like these will be completed.","Getting an immediate warning on your phone that an earthquake is about to begin is now an option in the Los Angeles County area with the new ShakeAlertLA app. Finally, a use for my phone.

Jamie Rigg,"An attempt at a working replica (Science &amp; Society Picture Library via Getty) Zhang Heng's invention was initially met with skepticism. His views on certain topics made him unpopular with some of his peers, and worse yet, his seismoscope was unproven. But as the story goes, several years later, a ball finally dropped. This in and of itself wasn't evidence it worked, of course -- no earthquake had been felt in the capital -- but days later a messenger arrived to report of a serious earthquake that originated hundreds of miles away, off to the west of Luoyang in the direction the now empty dragon mouth faced. Zhang Heng called his seismoscope Houfeng Didong Yi, meaning an ""instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth."" While many people of his time believed earthquakes had spiritual catalysts, he and a collection of other scholars were of the opinion the events were caused by winds and changes in air pressure -- bearing in mind this was way, way before the seed of plate tectonic theory sprouted in the early 20th century. In the centuries after Zhang Heng's death, other Chinese intellectuals were said have created successor seismoscopes of his design. Since nothing tangible survived the passage of time, however, historians of our era have struggled to reconcile these centuries-old accounts with a working replica of Zhang's device. Some even speculated it never existed. While the ornate nature of the seismoscope was well described, the exact mechanisms driving it weren't. Attempts to reinvent it in the 19th and 20th centuries proved unsuccessful. It remained unclear, for example, how an ancient pendulum design could be sensitive enough to detect earthquakes hundreds of miles away. Furthermore, how could the movement trigger just one mechanism and spare the others? In 2005, a group of seismologists and archaeologists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced they had created a proven, functioning replica. In their version, the pendulum itself doesn't interact with any levers; instead, it's suspended above another ball perched atop a thin pedestal. When the pendulum swings, it nudges that central ball down one of eight channels, where it hits a trigger system that animates the external dragon mouth. We don't know this is exactly how Zhang's model worked, of course, but it shows that only a minor reinterpretation of how the seismoscope is described in historical texts can lead to the creation of a sensitive, direction-aware device. Even though Zhang's device is nearly two millennia old, the working principle behind it is still commonly used today. A popular form of modern seismograph uses exactly the same properties of inertia, whereby a static base and hanging pendulum move independently of each other when the ground shakes. Only nowadays the pendulum is a magnet, and the induced current its swinging produces in the conductive base is the record. Converting the fluctuations into a digital signal allows such seismographs to document tremor intensity, their timespan, etc. Zhang's invention noted the simple occurrence of an earthquake, hence the name seismoscope.","Modern seismographs are extremely sensitive pieces of equipment. By recording the slightest movements of laser light or magnets, these devices can detect the smallest of rumbles even when we can't sense them.

Vince Beiser,"The night before the mission, Kenji Matsuzaki could not sleep. For more than a year, Matsuzaki and a team of engineers had been developing their little robot—a bread-loaf-sized, red and white machine equipped with five propellers, a transparent dome, front and rear video cameras, and an array of lights and sensors. Nicknamed Little Sunfish, it was engineered to operate ­underwater, in total darkness, amid intense radiation. And after three months of testing, training, and fine-tuning, it was deemed ready to fulfill its mission: to find and photograph the melted-down radioactive fuel that had gone missing inside the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. More than six years had passed since an earthquake and tsunami hammered northeastern Japan and reduced the Fukushima facility to radioactive ruin. In all that time, no one had been able to locate the hundreds of tons of fuel inside the three reactors that had suffered core meltdowns. The uranium fuel had overheated, turned into lava, and burned through its steel container. That much was known. What happened after that was the big question. Did all the fuel flow out of the reactors, or was some still inside? Did it pile up in a heap, spread out in a puddle, spatter on the walls? Without knowing the answers to those questions, it was nearly impossible to devise a plan to get rid of it. And getting rid of it is imperative. Every day, as much as 165 tons of groundwater seeps into the reactors, becoming contaminated with radiation. And there’s always the possibility that another earthquake or some other disaster could rupture the reactors again, sending radiation spilling out into the air, sea, or both. Human beings couldn’t go into the heart of Fukushima’s reactors to find the missing fuel, though—at least not without absorbing a lethal dose of radiation. The job would have to be done by robots. But no robot had ever carried out such a mission before. Many had already tried and failed. Debris tripped them up. Yard-thick concrete walls threatened to block their wireless signals. Radiation fouled up their microprocessors and camera components. And so it fell to Matsuzaki, a shy-eyed, 41-year-old senior scientist with Toshiba’s nuclear technology branch, to help build a machine that wouldn’t end up as another one of the robot corpses already littering the reactors. Just getting the Sunfish and its support gear into position inside the enormous concrete building that housed one of the crippled reactors took two days. Four separate teams took turns setting up the control panel, cable drum, and other equipment the robot would need to function. Even in full protective bodysuits, each group of workers could spend only a few minutes inside the structure, working by the light of portable electric lamps amid a thicket of machinery, pipes, and catwalks. When one team absorbed its maximum permitted daily dose of radiation, it was replaced by another group. Matsuzaki himself made two forays inside to put the final touches on the Sunfish, sweating inside his face mask and bodysuit in the summer heat, his nerves jumping each time his portable monitor dinged to indicate he’d received another increment of his allowable radiation dose. The plan was for the Sunfish to spend three days mapping the debris and searching for signs of the missing fuel. Matsuzaki would monitor its progress from a control room about 500 yards away. He would be joined by a half-dozen top officials from his employer, Toshiba, and Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), the mammoth utility that owns the plant. His success—or failure—would be broadcast daily around the world. Beyond the immediate danger, cleaning up Fukushima remains critical to repairing the image of Japan’s energy industry. In the wake of the disaster, Japan shut down every one of its dozens of nuclear plants, which had provided some 27 percent of the nation’s power. To cover the loss, it had to massively increase imports of expensive fossil fuels. A few nuclear plants have since been permitted to restart, following years of safety upgrades, but Fukushima cost the industry much of its public support. Polls consistently show that a majority of the public opposes nuclear power. Two of Japan’s former prime ministers, including the one in office at the time of the disaster, have flipped from supporting nuclear plants to calling for their elimination. The disaster also dealt a severe blow to the global nuclear industry, which had been gaining favor even among some environmentalists as a carbon-free alternative to fossil fuels. In the aftermath of the meltdown, Germany announced it would phase out nuclear power altogether, Vietnam dropped plans to build reactors, and the whole industry was thrown on the defensive. Every proposed new reactor now has to answer the question: How do we know this won’t be another Fukushima? Small wonder that in the nights leading up to the mission, Matsuzaki was feeling the pressure. “I’ve been having nightmares about failing,” he confessed to his boss, Akira Tsuyuki. “Me too,” Tsuyuki said. Late at night on July 18, 2017, the mission start time just a few hours away, Matsuzaki lay awake, wondering whether his team’s technology would be any match for Fukushima. The earthquake on March 11, 2011, was the biggest ever recorded in Japanese history, a 9.0 monster that devastated northeastern Japan and triggered a series of tsunamis that slammed into the coast, killing nearly 16,000 people. The tsunamis also knocked out power to the Fukushima Daiichi plant, shutting down the pumps needed to keep cooling water circulating in the reactor cores. Over the next several days, as Tepco engineers worked by flashlight to regain control, the fuel in three of the plant’s six reactors—Units 1, 2, and 3—melted down. Gases unleashed by the damage exploded, sending plumes of radioactive particles like iodine, cesium, and plutonium into the atmosphere. The government ordered everyone within a 12-mile radius to evacuate, with about 165,000 people eventually displaced. Government officials originally estimated it would take about 40 years and $50 billion to clean up the plant, decontaminate the surrounding area, and compensate the disaster’s victims. In December 2016, they more than tripled that estimate to $188 billion. “We have never experienced a disaster as big as Fukushima,” Hiroshige Seko, the head of Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, told reporters at the time, according to Bloomberg. “With our limited knowledge, it was very difficult to make the previous forecast.” The Fukushima cleanup is a project far bigger and more complex than those of even the world’s worst previous nuclear catastrophes. Chernobyl was literally covered up: The Soviets simply encased the whole thing in concrete and steel. Three Mile Island was tiny by comparison. Only a single reactor melted down, and none of its fuel escaped. “Fukushima is orders of magnitude more difficult,” says Lake Barrett, an American who oversaw the cleanup of Three Mile Island and who signed on as a consultant to Tepco and the Japanese government in 2013. The Hot Zone Following the meltdown, nearly 165,000 people had to evacuate the area surrounding the Fukushima plant to avoid radioactive exposure. Today, even after extensive cleanup efforts, 50,000 people still can’t go home. In the first chaotic weeks after the meltdown, with radiation levels far too intense for anyone to work inside the reactors, Tepco scrambled to deploy robots to assess and contain the damage. Tractor-treaded bots from iRobot, drones from Honeywell, and a prototype disaster-­response mech from Tohoku University scouted the rubble-­strewn facility and tried to measure the intensity of the radiation. A remote-­controlled concrete pumping truck was adapted so that its extendable spout could pour water into the reactors, cooling and stabilizing the overheated chambers. In the months and years that followed, Fukushima became both a market and a proving ground for ever-advancing robot technologies designed to operate in hazardous conditions. Remote-controlled front-end loaders, backhoes, and other heavy equipment were put to work breaking up radioactive debris and loading it onto remote-controlled dump trucks. A four-legged walking robot investigated the reactor buildings. Robots with 3-D scanners were sent in to gather imagery and map radiation levels. Swimming robots inspected pools where spent fuel rods were stored, taking pictures. But none of these robots were capable of penetrating the innermost areas of the reactors. In August 2013, the Japanese government assembled a consortium of public utilities and private companies, including Mitsubishi, Hitachi, and Toshiba, to create robots specifically for the most challenging environments. Dubbed the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning, it has developed some 20 machines that have been deployed onsite. Their ranks include a snakelike bot that crawled through a tiny accessway into Unit 1, then bent itself into a more stable U-shape to explore inside. Then there was the Scorpion, a tank-tread-driven machine with a camera mounted on an elevating “tail” that was sent into Unit 2. The Japanese government is bankrolling a $100 million, state-of-the-art R&amp;D center near the nuclear plant where robot operators train on digital models of the reactors in a giant 3-D Holo Stage and on life-size physical mock-ups. A robot undergoes testing at the government’s new $100 million R&amp;D center near the nuclear plant. But even with the massive government investment, many of the new robots still couldn’t hack it inside the reactors. The camera on one of them, sent to clear a path for the Scorpion, was shut down by radiation; the Scorpion itself got tripped up by fallen debris. The first version of the snakelike bot got stuck; the second did better but failed to find any melted fuel. “It’s very difficult to design a robot to operate in an unknown environment,” says Hajime Asama, a professor at the University of Tokyo who was one of the first roboticists the government turned to for help. “Until we send the bot in, we don’t know what the conditions are. And after it’s sent, we can’t change it.” Kenji Matsuzaki has worked in Toshiba’s nuclear technology branch for more than 10 years, and by May 2016, when he was assigned to the team developing a robot to explore inside Unit 3 of Fukushima, he was familiar with the plant’s basic architecture. All six of its reactors are boiling-water reactors, a type designed in the late 1960s and early 1970s and found all over the world, including in the United States. They generate electricity by circulating water through their infernally hot cores, converting it to steam that is used to turn turbine generators. Each reactor has three containers set one inside another like Russian nesting dolls. The smallest container, a steel capsule about the length of a tennis court, is called the reactor pressure vessel. That’s where the nuclear fission reaction takes place, powered by fuel composed of uranium dioxide baked into ceramic pellets. This capsule is enclosed inside a primary containment vessel, a concrete and steel structure shaped like a massive light bulb, designed to capture any radiation that might accidentally escape. The containment vessel in turn is housed inside the reactor building, a concrete and metal rectangle that offers only minimal protection from radiation. Technicians in protective gear can work for short periods inside the reactor building, but they can’t enter the far more radioactive containment vessel, which is where they were likely to find at least some of the missing fuel. Building a robot that could get inside and maneuver around the containment vessel presented several unique challenges. First, the containment vessel was only practically accessible through a 5.5-inch circular maintenance opening about 8 feet above the floor of the reactor building, so the robot would have to be small. Second, because the containment vessel had been pumped full of water to cool it down, the robot would have to be able to swim. Third, since the water and thick walls would defeat wireless signals, this small, swimming robot would need to be powerful enough to move under­water while dragging as much as 65 yards of electric cable behind it. It took months of research, experimentation, and testing in Toshiba’s labs and in an enormous simulation tank at the government-run Port and Airport Research Institute to balance all these capabilities inside the little machine. Matsuzaki’s team had to try different configurations of propellers, cameras, and sensors, boost the power of the propeller motors, develop a new type of coating to make the cable move more smoothly, and ensure the whole package could withstand a blistering level of radiation. Simulation facility at the Naraha Remote Technology Development Center. At midnight on July 19, the day the Sunfish was scheduled to make its first foray into the reactor, Matsuzaki’s alarm went off in his hotel room. He and his team were staying in Iwaki, the closest habitable city with a hotel, about an hour south of the plant. Starting their day in the dark of night was the only way to have enough time to drive to the plant, suit up in protective gear, and hold a last round of meetings before their start time. That would give them about eight hours; by noon it would be too hot inside the reactor building for the technicians monitoring the robot to do their jobs. At about 4:30 am, a group of Toshiba techs in full protective gear darted into the reactor building. They fast-walked to the outer wall of the containment vessel and climbed a step ladder up to the opening where the Sunfish and its equipment had been pre-positioned. They unsealed the valve over the opening, then pushed in a heavy guiding pipe, with the Sunfish at its tip, all the way through to the other side. Slowly and carefully, they angled the pipe until the bot slid into the water below. Inside, it was completely dark. On their monitors in the control room, Matsuzaki’s team, connected to the Sunfish’s controls via the electric cable, could see only a narrow swath cut through the turbid water by the Sunfish’s lights. Seated at a long table, one technician “drove” the Sunfish with a videogame-­type controller. Another reeled its cable in and out, keeping it taut so it wouldn’t get tangled as the bot swam this way and that. A third did his best to estimate the machine’s position using a 3-D software model of the containment vessel. Matsuzaki oversaw them all, trying to forget about the platoon of corporate officials watching over his shoulder. The Sunfish had to be able to swim (right), fit into the small opening of the containment vessel (top left), and withstand challenges that crippled an earlier robot, the Scorpion (bottom left). The first day, the Sunfish spent most of its time reconnoitering. The damage inside the containment vessel was worse than expected. Unidentifiable clumps of pebble-sized debris and pieces of half-destroyed equipment littered the floor. But there was no sign of the fuel, and after eight hours of searching, the team pulled the Sunfish back to the surface. They gave it a rest the next day while they discussed their findings and strategized their next steps. The following morning, they sent the Sunfish back into the water. The team drove it slowly and carefully, but time after time, the bot’s powerful propellers would stir up a blinding cloud of sediment, forcing them to wait until the water cleared again. After several hours of maneuvering, and with the noon deadline looming, Matsuzaki was growing nervous. Then, something startling appeared on the monitors. “What is that?” said Matsuzaki. Everyone began talking at once and pointing to what they saw on the screens: murky glimpses of what appeared to be stalactites of something dripping like candle wax from the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel. They’d found the first signs of the missing fuel. They maneuvered the Sunfish around the area, documenting as much as possible, before pulling the bot out. When Matsuzaki declared the mission complete, the control room burst into applause. Kenji Matsuzaki, the lead scientist behind Little Sunfish. By now, much of Fukushima Daiichi itself, an expansive complex covering some 860 acres, is a lot safer than you’d expect. Most areas have been decontaminated to the point where full bodysuits are no longer required. The 5,000-plus workers tasked with cleaning the place up have cut down hundreds of the cherry trees that used to enliven the grounds, torn up and paved over once-grassy open areas, and scrubbed down buildings. They have covered the seafloor just off the coast with clay to seal in cesium that seeped into the mud after the disaster. Using an enormous, purpose-built fuel-handling machine, they have removed the hundreds of spent uranium fuel rods from Unit 4, a reactor that was damaged by an explosion but did not melt down. Still, when I visited the site last December with Lake Barrett, Tepco’s American consultant, we had to put on gloves, safety glasses, surgical masks, three pairs of socks, and plastic booties over our shoes, as well as a personal radiation detector, before being allowed inside the facility. At 72, Barrett is tall, fit, and astonishingly energetic. I first met him at the Narita airport outside Tokyo, where he bounced right off a 20-hour trip from his home in Florida, joined me in a car without stopping for so much as a cup of coffee, and talked cheerily for the entire two-hour drive to Fukushima prefecture. When Barrett heard the first news reports about the disaster, he “didn’t think much of it,” he says. “There’s always so much hype around these things.” Then he saw the picture of Unit 1 exploding. “I said, ‘Holy shit. I know exactly what that was.’ I knew they were in deep doo-doo.” When the call came to help out, he didn’t hesitate. “It’s personal for me,” he says. “Japan was the only country that helped us at Three Mile Island. We owe Japan.” Inside the Fukushima plant, each of these blue towers holds 100 personal radiation detectors. From atop a small hill, once covered with grass and now encased in concrete, Barrett and I survey the trio of hulking buildings outlined against the blues of the winter sky and the Pacific Ocean behind them. Remotely operated orange-and-white cranes lean over them like reverent metal giraffes. These are the reactor buildings: the intractable core of the disaster zone, the radioactive redoubts the robots must penetrate. Each poses a unique challenge. The amount and type of damage inflicted on each is different, as is the depth of the water flooding their bases. Of course, at the heart of each is a mess of melted fuel, presumed to have flowed in different ways to different places. Less than half a mile from these three reactors sits Unit 5, one of the three other reactors that had been shut down for regular maintenance when the tsunami hit. Since it escaped largely unscathed and is nearly identical to the damaged reactors, Tepco engineers use it to plan robot missions. Inside is a baffling maze of machines, ducts, cables, and catwalks. “You can see how hard it is to run the robots around in here,” Barrett says. We navigate our way through the building to the containment vessel. “That’s just like where the Sunfish went in,” he says, pointing up to an unassuming circular opening in the wall of the vessel. We enter the containment vessel and make our way through a narrow doorway into a chamber below the reactor pressure vessel. Control rod assemblies stud the reactor vessel’s underside; we have to crouch to avoid bumping our heads on them. Pointing out key areas and components, Barrett walks me through the current theories on what happened to the fuel in each of the meltdown units. “No one knows if the lava made a nice neat vertical pile or whether it flowed sideways,” he says. “Hot molten fuel could have fallen into the water and caused a steam explosion that would have blown it everywhere.” In Unit 3, at least, thanks to the Sunfish, Tepco is relatively certain about a few things. The pictures it took show that the control-rod mechanisms at the bottom of the reactor vessel disintegrated. Molten fuel mixed with melted metal dripped down through the openings they left behind, presumably creating the stalactites seen in the videos. The lava-like mixture burned through both the steel grate beneath the reactor pressure vessel and a refrigerator-sized machine used to insert the control rods, and some of it dripped down to the floor of the containment vessel. There also appear to be chunks of fuel on the vessel’s walls. Inside Unit 3 Each reactor is made up of three containers, one set inside another, that hold critical equipment. 1. Reactor Building: A large concrete and steel structure that acts as the last line of defense to keep radiation from escaping into the outside world. 2. Primary Containment Vessel: An airtight enclosure made of steel and concrete. 3. Reactor Pressure Vessel: A thick steel container that holds the uranium fuel, which powers the nuclear reactor. 4. Control-Rod Drive: A mechanical system that uses thin rods to speed up or slow down a nuclear fission reaction. The rods work by absorbing the stray neutrons that trigger a chain reaction. 5. Pedestal: A circular concrete structure that holds up the reactor. From inside, workers can access the control-rod drive. That still leaves an awful lot unknown. At the end of the day, “how much did we learn from the Sunfish mission?” Barrett asks. “It was a step, not a leap. We’re getting closer and closer, but we have a long, long way to go.” Tepco is continuing its efforts to scout the inside of the reactors. In January, a robotic probe using a remote­-controlled camera mounted on a long pole spotted for the first time what appears to be melted fuel inside Unit 2. There may be another Sunfish mission, though it won’t be the same robot that found the fuel in Unit 3. Despite emerging from the reactor undamaged, it had still absorbed a dangerous amount of radio­activity. Tepco engineers sealed it in a steel cask and interred it with other radioactive waste on the plant site. Limited and uncertain as the Sunfish’s findings are, they have helped move the ball forward. Engineers have now begun thinking about how to build the next generation of robots that will have to carry out the most complicated undertaking of all: removing the melted fuel. Their first challenge will be enabling the bots to reach their target. “These are cramped spaces filled with huge pieces of equipment that weigh many tons. You have to cut them up in pieces and pull them out,” Barrett says. One idea currently in favor is to build a massive 20-foot robot arm that would enter the reactor building on rails, reach into the reactor pressure vessel, and scoop up the fuel. Another is to send in a bot the size of a small refrigerator on tractor treads, equipped with cutting and gripping tools to wrangle debris. A second robot would lift the detritus into containers, seal it, and put it on a conveyor belt to the outside. Either system will take years to develop. Either or both might fail. Tepco has pegged 2021 as the target year to begin removing fuel debris. How long might the entire Fukushima cleanup take? “Good question. Nobody knows. No one in human history has experience with this,” says Naoaki Okuzumi, a senior manager with the decommissioning institute. “The government says 30 to 40 years. I think that is optimistic.” While the robots’ work inside Fukushima Dai­ichi drags on, human beings who once lived near the plant are waiting to go home. The national government has decontaminated several towns and urged residents to return. At the time of my visit in December, though, roughly 130 square miles of land was still off-limits, including the better part of a town called Okuma, perched in the hills a few miles from the plant. Yoshihiro Takada, a former resident who now works with the local government agency in charge of rebuilding, agreed to show me around. Takada spent almost his entire life in Okuma and had to escape with his wife, child, and parents when the disaster hit. They’ve relocated to another town 65 miles away. I met up with Takada in a parking lot just outside the exclusion zone, where we put on full-body Tyvek suits, face masks, gloves, socks, and booties over our shoes to protect us from the particles of cesium and strontium. Inhaling even a dust speck of one of those isotopes can be dangerous. That’s part of what makes radiation so terrifying : You can’t feel it, see it, or smell it. It can kill you without you ever knowing you encountered it. A few miles from the Fukushima plant, in the town of Okuma, visitors must wear full-body Tyvek suits, face masks, gloves, socks, and booties when walking along the abandoned streets. The desolation of the exclusion zone, in the town of Okuma. There was no one in the train station, the barbershop, the restaurants, or the stores. The modest houses and apartment buildings on the residential streets were all empty. The only sound I heard as we walked down the middle of the deserted main street was the chirping of clueless birds who didn’t realize they’d chosen to nest in a radioactive hot zone. “I remember this place—their pizza was so good,” Takada says, gesturing at a shuttered restaurant as we walk through town. Several shop windows have been smashed by wild boar that have come down from the hills to ransack the deserted town for food. Cars sit in driveways half-hidden by overgrown weeds. Takada only occasionally checks in on his own house. “Rats are running all over it inside. There are droppings and garbage all over,” he says. The area around Fukushima is mostly scenic farmland fringed with thickly wooded hills. But drive along practically any road and you pass fields filled with rows and rows of boulder-sized, black polypropylene bags. They are filled with contaminated earth; as part of the cleanup, a layer of topsoil is being scraped up from gardens, schoolyards, and fields all across the region. Roughly 20 million of the bags are scattered around the prefecture. Many of them will eventually be moved to the outskirts of Fukushima Daiichi itself for indefinite storage, along with an ever-growing array of tanks holding the radioactive water Tepco continues to pump out of the reactors. Ultimately, there is no technology that can simply fix what happened at Fukushima. The only certainty is that it will be a slow, incremental, frustrating process that may not even be completed in Kenji Matsuzaki’s lifetime. For now, all the scientists, engineers, and their allies can do is keep the radioactivity under control, track down its source, and try to capture it. But first, they need to create the robots to do it. Radioactive waste at the Tomioka contaminated waste facility. It will be buried for 200 years.

Tom McKay,"A “strong magnitude 7.1 earthquake” struck the southern coast of Peru on Sunday morning, leaving at least one dead, several missing, and dozens injured, CNBC reported. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake struck roughly 22.4 miles (36 kilometers) offshore centered about 25 miles (40 km) into the Pacific Ocean from the town of Acari. CNBC reported that local officials said one man was killed by a rock in Yauca. Beyond that, there were some indications that the damage may not be as grim as originally reported. Per the BBC, Health Minister Abel Salinas disputed reports that 17 miners had gone missing inside a collapsed shaft. Reports of another death in Bella Union were also disputed by local officials. Per CNN, the National Civil Defense Institute reported at least 65 additional injuries “in the cities of Arequipa, Ica and Ayacucho.” The casualty count is likely to rise as emergency personnel continue to look through rubble. Though the U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center warned that a wall of water could come crashing onto the shoreline, fortunately no such tsunami actually occurred and the center later advised that the threat had passed. Earthquakes of magnitude 7 and higher are considered major events with the possibility of serious damage or casualties; only an estimated 20 or so occur each year. A magnitude 8.0 quake in 2007 off the central coast of Peru was estimated to have killed well over 500 people and destroyed tens of thousands of buildings. Earthquakes are fairly common in Peru due to its proximity to massive fault lines, as the Christian Science Monitor noted in 2013: Peru is located on the “Ring of Fire,” the belt of earthquakes and volcanoes surrounding the Pacific Ocean. All along its western coast, the South American plate is colliding with the Nazca plate, forcing the heavier ocean crust down into the Earth’s mantle. The collision of the plates is like a slow-motion car wreck. They’re colliding at only 3 inches per year, but that’s enough to cause frequent earthquakes—and build the Andes Mountains. The tectonically active region along the coast of South America, known to geologists as the South American arc, is more than 4,000 miles long, from just below the southern tip of Chile to just off the coast of Panama. Despite the high risk throughout Peru, though, the situation with regards to preparation for seismic events (particularly in construction and building standards) is not so good. A 2012 review found the capital city of Lima, with a population of over nine million, could suffer tens of thousands dead and hundreds of thousands injured if an 8.0 magnitude earthquake hits there.

Mary Beth Griggs,"Shaking from the large earthquake that shuddered through Anchorage, Alaska last week was strong enough to turn smooth asphalt roads into broken, jagged depressions of rubble. But within just a few days, crews managed to repair the worst of the damage, unsnarling traffic in Alaska’s largest city. Anchorage has a population of nearly 300,000 people spread across more than 1,900 square miles — an area larger than the state of Rhode Island. That space is threaded by roads, asphalt lifelines of the population. When the magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck last week, some of the most visceral images showed roads that had broken apart. But within days, many of these same cracked highways had been smoothed back into ribbons of pavement by crews working around the clock. “We have more quakes than any other state in the Union.” The rapid response to damage in Anchorage shows how investing time and money into preparations for these kinds of large, infrastructure-hobbling events can pay off in the long-run, even when there’s no way to tell when or where disaster may strike. “We have more quakes than any other state in the Union,” says Shannon McCarthy, a spokesperson with the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities. As a result, Alaska takes its earthquake preparation very seriously. The largest earthquake ever recorded in the country shook Anchorage to its core in 1964, causing a deadly tsunami and leaving in its wake damaged buildings, buckled roads, and a legacy that inspired years of earthquake preparation and policies. Strong building codes put in place post-1964 helped make the area more secure than other earthquake-prone areas, like Seattle. Extraordinary that we had 0 casualties in this earthquake & only a few injuries. The resilience of Alaskans & our buildings is a testament to lessons learned from the '64 quake & speaks to our level of preparedness. Repair crews are hard at work but we still have a ways to go. pic.twitter.com/i5PvvkAtYT — Sen. Lisa Murkowski (@lisamurkowski) December 5, 2018 The 50th anniversary of the 1964 quake took place just four years ago, and officials took the opportunity to update their earthquake plans, hold drills, and generally prepare for when a quake would hit in the future. “I think that really helped,” McCarthy said. Over the past six months, a less ground-shaking development also helped prepare the teams on the ground for that moment. In March, a truck slammed into a bridge on the only major road connecting Anchorage to one of its suburbs, shutting down the throughway for days. In the months after the collision, the Department of Transportation went through and updated its recovery plans in the event of another damaging incident. All that preparation readied Alaska residents to spring into action as soon as the shaking from the initial quake subsided. Bridge inspectors based in Alaska’s capital, Juneau, packed and got on a plane that night. Arriving before midnight, they immediately started checking on the 243 bridges that had been impacted by the shaking. After checking in on damaged homes and offices, government employees and contractors within the quake zone also got to work, readying themselves to do a job that wouldn’t be easy during this time of year. Working 24/7, they cleared away the broken asphalt, saving it to be melted down at a later date. Then, crews with heavy equipment began digging out water-saturated sediments that slipped or sunk during the quake. They trucked in or gathered fresh material and compacted it, creating a sturdy earthwork base. Atop that, they placed large rocks, finer gravel, and finally, asphalt. “Our asphalt plants were all shut down for the winter,” McCarthy says. Thick and tarry, asphalt needs to be heated up from a solid form before it can be spread out in a thick layer to make a road. But Alaska in late fall is bitterly cold, and frozen asphalt can take a week or longer to melt into a sticky, pliable material. Soon after the earthquake struck, owners of asphalt plants switched on their heaters. “We were fortunate that they did that.” McCarthy says. “By the time we’d finished the earthworks, the asphalt plants were ready to go.” Frozen asphalt can take a week or longer to melt into a sticky, pliable material According to McCarthy, it was one of the first times that paving had ever occurred in winter. Snow was moving in to the area quickly, but the still-warm asphalt stayed clear just long enough for the crews to paint temporary lines on the roads. They couldn’t use the paint typically used on Alaska roads, an epoxy filled with glass beads and grit that prevents cars from skidding. It’s made to withstand the brutal wear and tear Alaskans put on their roads during the colder months, when layers of sand and tires wrapped in chains keep cars on the road, but would swiftly wear other paints down into oblivion. Unlike the asphalt, applying this paint has to wait for summer, when the weather is more amenable than it is now. The crews worked through some days of heavy, wet snow, high winds of 65 miles per hour. And the weather wasn’t the only natural element being a pain — the ground shook with near constant aftershocks. In addition to inducing seasickness in several Alaskans, the shaking also carved crescent-shaped bites out of some of the roadways, or shook the ground so hard that the soil under the freshly paved roads settled, forcing a do-over. Alaska DOT &PF Repaired road near Mirror Lake. The earthquake hit on Friday morning at 8:29AM local time. By the next Wednesday at 4AM, all eight major transportation corridors that had been severely damaged by the quake had re-opened. Dozens of others are still awaiting repair, and officials are asking selfie-takers to stay away from their still-cracked surfaces, no matter how visually appealing they might be. Similar situations play out in other places of the world, especially at bottlenecks where a web of roads narrows down to a precious few lanes. Japan can fix an intersection-eating sinkhole in less than a week. California, which has seen far more dramatic earthquake-induced road damage, has comparable plans in place. As impressive as the completed sections are, this is still just a temporary fix. While most roads in Alaska have to be built to last for 20 years, these are only meant to carry people through the summer. When warmer weather returns, the asphalt plants will spark to burbling life again, and the crews will return to the same once-shattered spots to build more permanent roads. “we’re particularly vulnerable if there is a break in the line” Roads are important threads of human civilization around the world, but they are especially entwined in Alaskan life, where wilderness is only sparsely dotted with towns, and there are fewer detours available to re-direct traffic. “Alaska is different from many states in that in many cases we usually only have one road in and one road out. That’s true with Anchorage. We have one road to the north and one road to the south, so we’re particularly vulnerable if there is a break in the line,” McCarthy says. In this case, breaks in the line were swiftly repaired, mirroring quake recovery in other areas of the city. Supply lines stayed intact, utilities were swiftly restored, damage was minimal, and, most importantly, there were no fatalities. In some ways, the minimal damage and recovery offer a beacon of hope to communities facing down other natural hazards, whether that’s hurricanes, fires, floods, rising sea levels, or more earthquakes. Preparation makes a difference. “In terms of a disaster, I think it says more about who we are than what we suffered,” Anchorage Mayor Ethan Berkowitz said Saturday at a press briefing, according to the AP. “People pulled together. We followed the plans that were in place. We looked after one another. And when people around the country and around the world look at this, they’re going to say, ‘We want to do things in the Anchorage way because Anchorage did this right,’” Berkowitz said.","Shaking from the large earthquake that shuddered through Anchorage, Alaska last week was strong enough to turn smooth asphalt roads into broken, jagged depressions of rubble.

Alessandra Potenza,"The popular myth that strong earthquakes happen during certain Moon phases has no basis in science, according to new research. Susan Hough, a scientist at the US Geological Survey, pored over 400 years of data from over 200 earthquakes of magnitude eight or larger. She looked at the day the earthquakes occurred, and what phases the Moon was in. And she found no link between the ground shaking and the position of the Earth and the Moon in the sky, according to a study published this week in Seismological Research Letters. 400 years of data from over 200 large earthquakes Previous research has shown that tides — which are influenced by the Moon — can nudge faults to unleash earthquakes. “But if you read those papers, you’ll see that the authors are very careful,” Hough said in a statement. “They never claim that the data can be used for prediction, because the modulation is always very small.” Earthquakes occur because the Earth’s crust is divided into plates. These plates can move smoothly against each other, or become stuck. When they become stuck, they build up strain over time, until one day, the plates unstick, releasing energy that causes an earthquake. Scientists have been trying to predict earthquakes throughout history, but to this day, it’s proven impossible. And that has given rise to several popular beliefs, such as how animal behavior can predict earthquakes. However, anecdotal evidence of weasels and snakes acting weird before the ground starts shaking hasn’t been backed up by science yet ( though some researchers are looking into this.) “Of course, humans are pattern-seeking animals so after the fact we think, oh yeah my dog was behaving weirdly or I noticed, you know, animals got really quiet,” Ned Field, a research geophysicist at the USGS told The Verge last year. “We always remember things after the earthquake, but those could just be random things and nothing has really turned out to be consistently reliable in terms of predicting earthquakes.” Now, Hough is saying that the phase of the Moon also can’t predict a strong earthquake. In her analysis, Hough didn’t find any kind of pattern that was statistically significant. Her paper reports her findings quite firmly: The headline reads, “Do Large (Magnitude ≥8) Global Earthquakes Occur on Preferred Days of the Calendar Year or Lunar Cycle?” And the abstract simply says, “No.” So, take her word for it — although Hough isn’t very hopeful. “Sooner or later there is going to be another big earthquake on a full Moon, and the lore will pop back up,” she said. “The hope is that this will give people a solid study to point to.”","“Sooner or later there is going to be another big earthquake on a full Moon, and the lore will pop back up.”",2018-01-20T14:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}","No, the Moon can’t help you predict the next earthquake",https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/20/16910510/moon-phases-earthquake-prediction-usgs,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PeJO3V7vIQYOcaFZgZv_ygkEnMc=/0x371:5184x3085/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10064655/900548830.jpg.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,earthquake,1

Matanuska Electric Association, another utility, said about 17,000 of its customers were without power. The temperature in Anchorage was in the upper 20s, with a 40 percent chance of snow after noon, according to a National Weather Service forecast. According to the U.S.G.S., earthquakes are common in the area, with 14 tremors of similar or worse magnitude occurring within about 100 miles of Anchorage in the last century.

David Murphy,"Wireless networking is kind of like an emergency kit for your car (or earthquake-prone California home). You dont really think much about it when its there, but youre going to notice its missing when you need it. Also, you want to make sure its set up to give you the best possible experience.
And thats exactly what Im tackling in this weeks Tech 911 advice column: figuring out a simple, but important aspect of your home wifi setup so your devices can connect at their best speeds.
Ill let reader Danny explain:
Is there an optimal way to allocate QUANTITY of devices to either the 2.4G or 5G WiFi band at home? I understand the range/speed considerations, but assuming all devices are dual band compatible, is it better to have 10 stationary devices near the router on 5G and 2 mobile devices on 2.4G or should they be allocated more evenly (ie. 6 on each) or based on bandwidth needs (ie. echo dots and thermostats on 2.4G and Nest cams/streaming devices on 5G) rather than parsing by stationary vs mobile devices?
For those who arent as well-versed in the ways of wifi, allow me take a moment to explain whats going on. Most modern routersif they arent terribleoperate on two bands: 2.4GHz and 5GHz. In practical terms, that means your router probably asks you to create an SSID and password two different wireless networks when you initially set it up. (Some routers allow you to use one SSID/password for both, and its then up to your devices to decide whether they connect to either 5GHz or 2.4GHz.)
I recommend you go the route of having a separate SSID for each band, so you can then allocate your devices based on your needs. Heres why:
Connect to a wifi network on the 2.4GHz band, and youll probably have better rangeyoull be able to watch videos, read websites, and do whatever else on your devices from as far away as possible. Connect to a wifi network on the 5GHz band, and youll give up some of this range for speed. Its the only way youll get the best possible speeds for wireless-ac devices you own (when paired with a wifi router of similar capabilities), and the band is generally less congested when youre connecting wireless-n devices (which can also run at faster speeds than on a 2.4GHz connection, depending on their capabilities and how far away they are from your router).
Got it? In other words. 2.4GHz is for range, 5.0GHz is for speeda very simplified way to look at it, but a decent rule of thumb to go by.
Now, to address the root of your question, Id consider the bandwidth needs of your devices above all else. For example, youll probably be fine to connect your smart thermostat and your smart speakers to your 2.4GHz band, as I doubt they need to pass very much data back and forth. Your smart TV? Same deal, unless youre doing a lot of streaming (e.g. Netflix). Then, Id probably go 5GHz to avoid interference and maximize speedassuming your TV is close enough to your router for that to matter.
A tablet you keep in a room thats fairly far away from your router? You might need to go 2.4GHz to get the best connection. (As I type this, Im sitting on a 2.4GHz network with my wireless-ac laptop, which annoys me, but I get absolutely nothing to work with if I connect to this houses 5GHz network. Im just too far away from the router for that to help.)
Your Nest camera? You can probably get away with 2.4GHz, since its just streaming a 1080p video. (That likely eats up around 5Mbps, which is pretty negligible.) Your laptop? 5GHz all the way, unless you find that youre unable to get a good connection at a distance. Same with your wireless-ac smartphone (if you have one).
While this advice might sound backwards, Id use 2.4GHz for your devices that wouldnt benefit from a super-speedy connection, and Id save 5GHz for the devices where speed is a priority.
There are two reasons why you wouldnt just dump everything on 5GHz, which feels like it would make logical sensebeing the band that allows you to tap into faster speeds. First, theres the aforementioned range issue. Second, the more devices you connect to one of a routers wifi networks, the slower it might go. Thats not because youve simply connected a bunch of devices, since they wont impact anything if they arent actively transmitting a lot of data. If you have 20 devices connected to 5GHz, however, and a number of them are actively eating up your connection, that could result in slower speeds for everything else.
Or, as Google puts it:
Whenever a device connects to your Wi-Fi network, it has to fight with other devices for bandwidth (internet speed). A TV streaming Netflix, a laptop downloading, an Xbox Live gaming session they all want the fastest connection. But theres only so much bandwidth to go around. Your bandwidth is stretched thin, resulting in a slower connection.
And heres Netgears take:
However, since the routers wireless channel is shared between all the wireless clients, adding clients will inevitably result in slower network access for all clients. This will be particularly noticeable if some of the clients are using a lot of wireless bandwidth, for example by watching a video or doing a torrent download. Therefore, the maximum number of wireless clients that will operate satisfactorily while connected to the same router will vary depending on what the devices are used for. It will also vary depending on how much wireless congestion or interference are present in the location where the router is installed.
I suspect this isnt as large of an issue when youre using a wireless-ac router, since youll have a lot more bandwidth on a typical AC1200+ router (at least 1.3Gbps) than a typical N300 or N600 wireless-n router (a maximum of 300Mbps on each band, but typically only 150Mbps on your 2.4GHz band). A number of connected, data-hungry wireless-ac devices will slow down service for all, but the effects on your much-slower wireless-n devices shouldnt be that obvioussince theyre already slower to begin with.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","A magnitude 7.0 earthquake shook Anchorage and the surrounding area on Friday morning. The shaking also triggered a wave of tsunami warnings along the Alaska coast with more likely around the Pacific. The strongest of a series of quakes struck just after 8:30 a.m. local time about 8 miles north of Anchorage. Numerous strong aftershocks continue to jolt the region, with Alaskas Earthquake Center tweeting that many more are expected. In the immediate aftermath, reports on social media indicated there are power outages, collapsed overpasses, fires, and sinkholes, though as with all disasters, its worth waiting to hear more official information. The earthquake also triggered a tsunami warning for Cook Inlet and the Southern Kenai Peninsula. For other US and Canadian Pacific coasts in North America, the level of tsunami danger is being evaluated, the U.S. Tsunami Warning System said in a bulletin. The warning has caused widespread gridlock as Alaskans fled the coast while navigating roads that have reportedly been damaged by the shaking. Alaska is no stranger to earthquakes, with its southeastern coastline sitting on the edge of the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. The state recorded the strongest earthquake in North American history in 1964. That magnitude 9.2 earthquake caused widespread damage and unleashed tsunami waves across the Pacific, including one that reached an astounding 200 feet in height as it funneled. This quake wasnt nearly as strong so any tsunami is unlikely to reach that level, but this is still a dangerous situation and should be monitored closely if you live anywhere across the Pacific.

David Riggs,"I first got a glimpse of technologys potential back in 2010. As a pediatrician at Miami Childrens Health System, I flew to Haiti in the aftermath of the devastating 2010 earthquake to help treat children. Many suffered trauma, but I found myself caring for little ones with chronic conditions, as well. Along with my stethoscope, my computer and smartphone quickly became essential tools in my medical bag, as I sent emails and images to colleagues in Miami for consultations.
Back home, I became acutely aware of how we lagged behind in using technology in pediatric settings. Im a doctor to the iGeneration. I have patients as young as two who seem instinctively adept at manipulating an iPad, yet their school remains largely stuck in a sepia-tone world.
Theres no excuse. The 2009 HITECH Act brought electronic health records to hospitals and doctors’ practices and the 2010 Affordable Care Act jumpstarted innovation across the healthcare spectrum. Funding in digital health startups continues at a record-breaking pace, with venture capitalists investing $8.1 billion last year, according to Rock Health. The money targeted healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies and consumers. By comparison, only a tiny fraction — just under $60 million — went to pediatric-related technology in 2018. Young companies and their backers have largely overlooked what I consider the front line of health: our public schools.
Yet legislation on that front should help, as well. Poor health is one of the leading causes of school absenteeism, and the latter is linked to low academic performance. To hold schools accountable, most states have selected absenteeism as a measure of performance under the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015. That can translate into millions of dollars in reduced state funding for school districts, which should motivate officials to address the reason one in six students misses class repeatedly.
Our children spend an average of 14 percent of their time in school from kindergarten through 12th grade. Any public school parent knows the drill: fill out the same paper forms at the beginning of each year authorizing the school nurse to administer medications with the approval of the childs pediatrician. Vaccinations, of course, need to be up to date. The nurse, who typically oversees multiple schools, gets overwhelmed trying to screen children who suffer from serious chronic illnesses, such as asthma, diabetes and seizures, from a pool of hundreds of students.
Technology is advancing in everyday life, but schools are being left behind because health programs still rank at the bottom of budget priorities.
Inevitably, some fall through the cracks. More than six million children under the age of 18 suffer from asthma; it is the third leading cause of hospitalization among children under 15 and a major reason for school absenteeism. Ive had children with asthma under my care where the school nurse is unaware of their condition. Those who suffer acute attacks are on oral steroids and need their medications more frequently — a situation schools often dont properly monitor. As a result, some students end up in the intensive care unit requiring more aggressive therapy. Its very frustrating for pediatricians, and devastating for families.
That is a prime example of why we need technology in schools. Lack of data-sharing among schools, pediatricians and families is especially exacerbated, because charts are often paper-based or locked in the schools system. An electronic medical record can facilitate quicker access to information for monitoring and care coordination. It could prevent potential tragedies, absenteeism and unnecessary costs.
Telehealth can also play a role. Students, especially from low-income households, often dont have a pediatrician, and so the school becomes by default their clinic. In my former role as medical director of telehealth Florida at Nemours Childrens Health System, we were encouraged by the results of an analysis we did on 1,000 telehealth visits. Sixty-seven percent of parents said they would have taken their child to an emergency room, urgent care center or retail clinic if they didnt have access to remote consultation. This was outside of the school setting, but the study points to an opportunity for deployment in schools.
Technology is advancing in everyday life, but schools are being left behind because health programs still rank at the bottom of budget priorities. The American Academy of Pediatrics has for years advocated for a full-time nurse on campus, but thats not always the reality. As the father of a four-year-old boy whos prone to seizures, I worry.
Schools need to realize theyre not only in the business of education, theyre also in the healthcare business. The two go hand in hand.","I flew to Haiti in the aftermath of the devastating 2010 earthquake to help treat children.

THOMAS FULLER and MATT STEVENS,"“The problem is that the public in general and building owners in particular really think that when they get a building to code they are going to get a building that is going to perform fine in an earthquake,” said Mary Comerio, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and a proponent for stronger earthquake protections. “The message to the public is that existing buildings are going to be damaged. That’s built into the calculations,” Professor Comerio said. “They are designed to help you get out of the building but you may not be able to go back in.” A debate over the longstanding “life safety” philosophy of the building code — meaning that it is designed to protect your life but not much more — was central to discussions at the conference. A bill in Sacramento that could potentially strengthen the code to a “functional recovery” standard is moving through committees in the State Legislature. But proponents of more resilient buildings and infrastructure like water, gas lines, the power grid and cellphone systems say more can be done even within the existing code. Maryann Phipps, a structural engineer who gave the keynote address to conference participants on Thursday, urged engineers to explain to their clients that by spending an additional one or two percent a building is more likely to be usable after an earthquake.","Friday: Communicating earthquake safety, a leap in online privacy, Norman Pearlstine speaks, and finally, a tribute to The Capital Gazette.",2018-06-29T13:05:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Making Earthquake Safety More Intelligible,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/us/california-today-earthquake-safety.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/28/us/28earthquakes-01/28earthquakes-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,earthquake,1
JONATHAN WOLFE,"There were no reports of earthquake-related damage, injuries, or other issues in New York City, according to Nancy Silvestri, press secretary for the city’s Emergency Management Department. Small earthquakes are felt in New York City every few years, said Jana Pursley, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, though more damaging earthquakes only strike the Northeast’s urban corridor, which includes New York City, about twice a century. The last two severe earthquakes in New York City, she added, took place in 1737 and 1884, before the magnitudes of earthquakes were even measured. The last time an earthquake of any note shook the city was in 2011, when a quake centered in Virginia sent thousands of New Yorkers in Midtown Manhattan scrambling into the streets. Evan Jackson, 30, remembers panicking during the 2011 quake, when he evacuated his office building in Downtown Brooklyn and looked up at the tall buildings. “I thought, ‘I should probably get back into the building’” to avoid any falling debris, he said. Mr. Jackson said he was “loafing” in bed yesterday when he felt it shake and saw his blinds and mirror move. “It was pretty light,” he said, unfazed. “This time, I didn’t even get off the bed.” Did you feel yesterday’s earthquake?

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"A powerful earthquake struck Taiwan today, causing damage and a partially collapsed hotel building, sources report.

No tsunami warnings have been issued. The English-language Taiwan News and the BBC report that a number of buildings have collapsed in Hualien City, including a roof of a hotel. There are no reports of injuries yet. Residents as far away as Taipei (around 120 kilometers (75 miles) north) could feel tremors. This is the second powerful earthquake in the area in just a few days. A magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck in nearly the same spot on Sunday (Monday Taiwan time). Taiwan’s location on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire means they’re no stranger to tremors. Many of the country’s buildings are built to withstand some shaking. With a quake of this size there’s always the potential for aftershocks. “We haven’t seen any large enough here to record yet,” John Bellini from the USGS told Gizmodo. “But don’t have the local instrumentation they would have. I wouldn’t be surprised for there to be a number of aftershocks in the next couple of days.” This story is developing. We will update the post when we know more.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"More than 90 people have been killed and hundreds injured by an earthquake which hit the Indonesian island of Lombok on Sunday. Many in Lombok's main city of Mataram were sent running from their homes and onto the streets as the 7.0-magnitude earthquake hit the island. The extent of the damage became clear on Monday, with houses, mosques and schools among the thousands of buildings destroyed. Many residents fled their homes, some carrying along the belongings they were able to salvage. Some worshippers might still be trapped inside collapsed mosques, the head of North Lombok district told AFP. Patients were tended to in makeshift wards set up under tents after hospital buildings were also damaged. The quake was also felt in the nearby resort island of Bali, where makeshift emergency tents were also set up to treat patients. On Gili Air, one of three islands that make up the Gili islands off the north-west coast of Lombok, crowds of tourists wait as they prepare to be evacuated. About 1,000 foreign and domestic tourists have already been evacuated in boats from the Gili islands, according to a spokesman. There were long lines at Lombok's airport, which is still operating, as tourists scrambled to leave. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the seismically active Ring of Fire.

Mark Kaufman,"At 3:00 a.m., when everyone was sleeping, a violent earthquake struck 65 miles from Turkey's capital in August 1999. The 7.6-magnitude quake collapsed entire apartment buildings on top of unsuspecting people, killing at least 20,000. Known as the Izmit quake, in 2011 scientists said they found convincing evidence of a precursor to the tragic temblor: A series of often small, unnoticeable quakes — known as foreshocks — occurred in the same area for around 44 minutes before the major quake struck. This, the scientists argued, was evidence of something unique happening before the massive earthquake. And if this foreshock activity could somehow be reliably detected, perhaps we could predict future earthquakes with plenty of notice for people in any given area — an ability that has completely eluded scientists. SEE ALSO: Can Your iPhone Double as a Cutting-Edge Earthquake Detector? But seven years later, earthquake researchers have put a damper on this optimism. In a study published Monday in Nature Geoscience, scientists found that these series of small quakes were not a unique sign of a looming earthquake, but instead a domino-effect of tremors that happened to have ultimately triggered a far bigger one. ""They’re knocking down the idea that something happens before earthquakes,"" Duncan Agnew, a geophysicist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, said in an interview. Foreshocks are earthquakes, emphasizes Angew, but they only earn the title “foreshock” when they happen before a big one. A leveled apartment building in Istanbul in November 1999. Image: Anja Niedringhaus/EPA/REX/Shutterstock “They are something you can only see in retrospect,” Angew, who had no role in the study, said. “There’s absolutely no way to tell them apart otherwise. That’s like trying to predict the weather, except you can’t see anything.” ""For decades, people have been thinking about how we can distinguish foreshocks from ordinary earthquakes,"" William Ellsworth, a Stanford University geologist and lead author of the study, said in an interview. ""They [2011 researchers] made this rather bold suggestion that the foreshocks were different — we just came up with the opposite result."" By analyzing additional measurements from the 1999 quake, Ellsworth and coauthor Fatih Bulut, a geologist at Turkey's Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute, found that a series of foreshocks before the quake did not all happen in one place, as previously suggested. Instead, “we found that none of them were at the same spot,” said Ellsworth, adding that more than two dozen imperceptible quakes “popped off all over the place.” From this, the study's authors conclude that nothing special was happening, but a “cascade-like” effect of small earthquakes rippled around the area, until one happened to have triggered massive underground movement — and, ultimately, a tragedy. The fault comparison between the infamous San Andreas fault in California, and the fault in Turkey. Image: USGS However, perhaps there's something else still happening before earthquakes that geologists haven’t yet discovered, or been able to measure. “It’s possible there are clues out there that we don’t know yet,” John Vidale, Director of the Southern California Earthquake Center who had no role in the study,” said in an interview. “We don’t know what we don’t know.” Or, there could be no clues at all — no true, precursor of a coming quake. “It may not be there — that’s the thing we don’t know,” said Ellsworth. But even so, we do have a solid grasp of areas that are earthquake prone, and when a region is overdue for a large quake. Digging into the ground along fault lines — cracks in the Earths’ crust where pressure builds and eventually slips — gives scientists a good understanding of how often big quakes have happened in the past, and whether or not we’re due for another one. “If it’s been a long time since the last one, the odds are somewhat higher now,” said Vidale. Though, “somewhat” is the key word here. Geologists know we can’t predict quakes, but are well aware they can hit at any time — sometimes with small foreshocks, and sometimes without. “If it happens in the next 20 minutes I won’t be surprised,” said Angew, of the next big rupture of the San Andreas fault in California. “If it doesn’t happen in my lifetime, I won’t be surprised.” A boy stands in front of his destroyed home in Adapazari, Turkey, in 1999. Image: Kerim Oekten/EPA/REX/Shutterstock In the end, while earthquake prediction is a much-desired ability, perhaps it doesn’t matter as much as we think it does. “It really doesn’t matter when they happen if we’re prepared,” said Ellsworth. “We’ll get through them.” For those that live in quake country, this means heeding the advice of the U.S. Geologic Survey. And on a larger scale, it also means building structures that are safe during earthquakes. In the case of Turkey two decades ago, many buildings simply weren’t built to withstand a big quake. “Turkey has very good building codes,” said Ellsworth. “The problem is buildings were not being built to the code.” “Earthquakes don’t kill people, buildings kill people,” he added. Scientists will still keep searching for the elusive clues that might foreshadow a looming quake, perhaps giving people 10 or 20 minutes to prepare. Today, the best we have are early warning systems, like that being tested in California and in use in Mexico City. These don’t predict earthquakes, but can give people perhaps 30 seconds notice that a big quake has happened, and that seismic waves will soon hit their area. For now, preparation isn’t just the smart option — it remains the only option. There’s much that isn’t known about what happens before earthquakes, and that isn’t likely to change soon. “What we want to know about is buried under miles of solid rock,” said Ellsworth.","At 3:00 a.m., when everyone was sleeping, a violent earthquake struck 65 miles from Turkey's capital in August 1999.

"Robin George Andrews on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Indonesia is reeling from a series of geologically-triggered disasters. While it was still assessing the fallout from Augusts deadly Lombok earthquake, a major earthquake on September 28 triggered a tsunami that slammed into Central Sulawesi. According to the latest UN reports, this disaster robbed at least 2,010 people of their lives, with 700 still reported missing. The tragedy in Sulawesi may be falling out of the news cycle, but the recovery efforts there are now in full swing. For emergency responders, the hard work of getting supplies, shelter, healthcare and education to those in need is just beginning. It hasnt been easy. The population is in shock, to be quite frank, Susan Mangicaro, the Indonesia response management team leader at International Medical Corps, told Earther. The quake, tsunami and associated landslides in late September destroyed or severely damaged 67,000 homes, leaving 330,000 people without proper shelters. Marc Vergara, chief of communications for UNICEF, said that entire neighborhoods in Central Sulawesi have simply vanished, literally erased from the map. Tens of thousands of displaced people are being packed into temporary emergency shelters where limited aid can be administered. State officials with Indonesias national disaster management authority (BNPB) and the military are leading the recovery efforts. Right now, those officials are still working out what type of aid needs prioritizing and who might be best placed to help hand it out. Meanwhile, international NGOs and local partners that have received permission to work alongside the BNPB are working round the clock to fill in the gaps and do what they can. Maya Kroitoru, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee s director of operations for disaster relief and development, told Earther that upon arrival in Sulawesi in the days following the tsunami, the scene was desperate and grim. The population is in shock. She described how people lacking food and water plundered aid trucks, how the bodies of the dead were still scattered along the road, and how her team of aid workers waited in line for seven hours to enter the city of Palu where the full force of the tsunami struck. She described the city as paralyzed. Several weeks later, getting help to the afflicted sites is still proving immensely difficult. The airport at Palu was extensively damaged, and roads leading to the city are covered in mudslides. Journeys that should take 8-10 hours are taking 20-25 instead, according to Mangicaro. The dire situation has been exacerbated by heavy disruption to the regions already sub-standard infrastructure. Water and sewerage systems have been knocked out completely in tsunami-hit Palu and Donggala. In plenty of regions, electricity is down and cell phone communications are been extremely limited. The main priorities for all actors on the ground is to prevent further emergencies from happening, Daniel von Rège, the Doctors Without Borders country director for Indonesia, told Earther. Here were talking about mainly reducing the spread of diseases linked to lack of clean water for drinking, washing and cooking. Electrical generators, water purification kits, health servicesboth mental and physicaland the management of vector-borne diseases are at the top of the list. Vergara said that food is now somewhat less of a problem that it was in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, although various aid agencies have said that there are still reports of communities being cut off from basic supplies. UNICEF is working with the Ministry of Education to get kids back to school as quickly as possibleno easy feat after 2,700 schools were damaged. The plan is to set up temporary tent classrooms while training teachers to cater to the children who need their education to continue. Education is a tool for recovery, Vergara said, adding that restoring a sense of normalcy is important. This is difficult for many reasons, including the fact that many residents are now afraid of being so close to the sea. The ocean isnt all they have to fear. During disasters like these, crime rates also rise, exacerbated by the willful spread of hoaxes and misinformation. According to a study by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, gender-based violence can rise following natural disasters, too. And a high number of children have been separated from their families, placing them at risk of sexual exploitation, violence and trafficking. So far, working alongside the Ministry of Social Affairs, UNICEF has helped to identify 61 such children, and three have been reunited with their parents. Sadly, many are feared to have been orphaned. As is always the case, these disasters didnt affect everyone equally. It is the very vulnerable and poor who are most in danger when these disasters strike, Kroitoru said. People fear being forgotten once the cameras are gone. Plenty of NGOs hire local staff, as they know the affected population, language, customs and culture best. Sadly, some of those local aid workers have been swept up in the disaster too. Mangicaro of International Medical Corps said that one of their in-country aid workers homes was destroyed by the tsunami, but that he and his family were physically unharmed. Immediately after the disaster struck, he began an on-site assessment, even though he had to sleep outside. Its not clear how long recovery will take. Lessons can be drawn from the past disasterslike the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which killed 230,000 people across 14 countriesbut only to a certain extent. No two disasters are exactly alike. Despite the unknowns, first responders do know that certain things must always be done after a disaster strikes. Building resilience is vital. Training, education and assisting the local population is the best way you can help out, Mangicaro explained. Indeed, although theres a debate as to what extent Indonesias current early warning system may have failed and contributed to the crisis, seismologists have stressed that plays second fiddle to public awareness of natural hazards. Effective safety advice, tailored to the regions specific geology and society, needs to be properly disseminated through community-driven initiatives. Long term, infrastructural reconstruction and restoration will also be vital. In an ideal world, earthquake-proof building codes would be applied and reinforced, and tsunami barriers would be set up in vulnerable areas. This, however, depends entirely on resource availability and the governments willingness to act, both of which are lacking at present in Indonesia. Kroitoru explained that its critical for everyone to understand that the emergency does not end when the headlines recede. People fear being forgotten once the cameras are gone, Vergara said. Practical help is required for communities in Sulawesi, but they also value dignity and emotional support too.","Indonesia is reeling from a series of geologically-triggered disasters.

KIRK JOHNSON,"Don Bee, a substitute teacher, said he came to school on the first day back just to be a steady presence. What theyve asked me to do is go around and see if teachers need a hand with anything and if someone needs reassurance, Mr. Bee said, as he sat by the front door of an elementary school on Monday morning. Mr. Bee, who retired from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, said he was walking his grandson, Tristan Travers, 6, to school when the earthquake hit. They both went down on all fours, unable to stand as the ground heaved. Tristan was brave, his grandfather said, at least until his mother arrived to get him. Then the tears came. Dawn Wilcox, who teaches second grade, said the quake and its many aftershocks were an essential topic for a conversation on the first day back about science and personal memory. Ms. Wilcox, who grew up in Anchorage, survived a 9.2-magnitude earthquake that shattered southern Alaska in 1964, when she was in third grade. It has been described as the second biggest earthquake in modern world history. I know their anxiety, and how it feels to be a child, and really not knowing when the next earthquake is going to hit, Ms. Wilcox said. The earth is a restless place, she told the children, and earthquakes, especially here in Alaska, are part of that story. This is what planet earth does, she said later. This kind of relieves some anxiety. Before the reopening of schools, officials had raced to be sure that the buildings were not only structurally sound, but also secure in other ways. Emergency radios had to be checked for damage and battery power. Video cameras were recalibrated and realigned. One step will be skipped.

Mark Kaufman,"What's up in earthquake country?
A compelling new report authored by two U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) researchers found that three powerful California faults have been strangely almost impossibly quiet for the last 100 years. Digging into the soil around these faults, Glenn Biasi and Kate Scharer found that big, earth-rupturing earthquakes have been a regular occurrence in the temblor-prone land over the last 1000 years.  
That's what makes the last 100 years so unusual.
""We should not see gaps of 100 years,"" Biasi said.
This study, published in Seismological Research Letters, is valuable to consider, not just for what it says about the region's past, but what it could mean for California's shaky future. Here are the big takeaways.
1. Expect the next century to be...busier 
While scientists cannot predict earthquakes, records of past temblors (preserved by transformation and changes in the ground) give researchers like Biasi a coherent understanding of how faults generally behave. Three of California's most important faults the San Andreas, San Jacinto, and Hayward carry most of the Golden State's load as they separate the massive Pacific plate from the great North American plate. These colossal slabs of Earth's crust are incessantly pushing and sliding against one another. 
At some point, something has to give. 
""The next century has to be busier than the last one.""
In the years between 1800 and 1918, there was a lot of give, with eight big, ground-rupturing quakes preserved in the geologic record. The most famous of these temblors, the infamous 1906 San Francisco quake, dramatically thrust the ground forward some 20 feet.
Now, after years of quietude, the pressure is building along these faults.
""It's reasonable that if theres a long quiescence we would expect a higher rate for the next 100 years,"" said John Vidale, a seismologist and director of the Southern California Earthquake Center.

It's unknown just how many more big quakes (of magnitude 6.5 or higher) might occur this century. But it's unwise to ignore the averages of past quaking activity. There's been three or four per century. So after the recent century of quiet, there may be a bit more action.
""The next century has to be busier than the last one,"" said Biasi. ""Our studies suggest that those probabilities are somewhat higher."" 
2. But we're not on the verge of an earthquake storm
Although it only takes one terrible quake to traumatize a region, the lack of big quakes over the last 100 years doesn't mean there's a looming flurry of violent temblors. 
""Were not on the verge of some earthquake storm in the next couple years,"" said Vidale. When faults have been quiet for some time, the risk for movement on a fault or section of a fault might double, at most, he explained. But it's not as if everything is now ready to blow. 
Southern California's many faults, with the dominant San Andreas fault.

""It's not that [the odds of a quake] skyrocket,"" said Vidale. ""The danger might be doubled but not everything is overdue. It's not 10-months pregnant.""
SEE ALSO: The West accepts its drought-ridden future, slashes water use
A still unknown circumstance hiding beneath the ground may be responsible for quiet along California's weighty faults, noted Biasi. The exceptional odds of such a quiet 100-year-period happening which came out to the extremely low odds of just 0.3 percent according to their models isn't some rare, statistical accident, emphasized Biasi. There may be some geologic events, or organization, transpiring below ground and slowing or suspending California's big faults. ""It's more likely there's some organizing influence at work,"" he said, noting that the busy quake activity in the preceding century may have changed or trigged something, like a freeway accident causing a pileup, but the road ahead is unusually (and temporarily) empty. 
""It may be that the organization [NR: what does he mean by organization?] is due to a flurry of activity from 1800 to 1918,"" Biasi said. 
3. The critical message
It's likely that Californians will see more quakes in the next century. To David Jackson, a California seismologist who has researched earthquake rates, that means that Californians need to remain prepared regardless of projected earthquake rates.
""We always need to be concerned about earthquakes,"" said Jackson.
He has some advice.
""Every time you hear the word 'earthquake' take a step to improve your resiliency,"" Jackson said. ""Do something.""
""Do something.""
Jackson himself, a renowned geologist, admits he still hasn't done all he can do to prepare for a quake. He recommends hopping online to the USGS, Southern California Earthquake Center, or The Great California ShakeOut, and learn how to prepare.
A major quake can rupture the pipes carrying water to your community. Do you have enough water a gallon a day per person to survive? Should you run outside during a quake (NO!)? Do you have a radio should cell towers go down? How do you shut off your leaking gas line? The violent shaking stopped now what do you do?

It's going to happen. ""A nice sharp jolt under the city could wreak havoc,"" said Vidale. 
But this inevitability might be easy to forget, after it's been relatively quiet. 
""People forget how expensive and disruptive an earthquake would be,"" said Vidale. This includes, critically, the government, who maintains or oversees roads, infrastructure, and building standards. ""The implication is were probably a bit complacent. The next 100 years might be a bit more exciting than average.""
4. The earthquake case is still open
This latest study underscores the point that it's been quiet in quake country and that's likely to change. But both Jackson and Vidale emphasize that the past century might not be as quiet as it appears. 
For one, there have been dramatic quakes along lesser faults, like the deadly 1994 Northridge, 1989 Loma Prieta (which stopped a World Series game), and 1971 Sylmar quakes. ""If you look at all the quakes that have happened, there's not a hiatus, said Vidale. The USGS's Biasi certainly isn't saying there's been a total quake drought just a drought of big quakes along the major faults. 
But Jackson, who five years ago posed a question about California's temblor hiatus in the talk ""Did Someone Forget to Pay the Earthquake Bill?,"" is skeptical that all the past quakes identified in this study by observing notable displacements in the ground were actually caused by earthquakes. His implication is if there were less quakes in past, perhaps the recent dearth of quakes wouldn't be so exceptional.

Until around 1900, humanity didn't have a means of scientifically measuring earthquakes, so our quake record is based upon observing clues of movement in the ground, a science called paleoseismology. Many of these fissures and breaks in the earth are almost certainly evidence of quakes. But other ground alterations might have come from other natural events, said Jackson. (These include things like major debris flows and erosion.)  
""Theyre pretty confident that every one of those displacements they see are the result of an earthquake,"" said Jackson. ""I dont quite accept that."" (Though, it should be noted that Biasi and Scharer addressed this in their paper: The deformation of the land around faults is often different than land alterations elsewhere.)
""It sheared my grandfather's house off the ground.""
But the past earthquake rates, said Jackson, still aren't the critical point. 
""Whether or not the story is true isn't as important as a reminder that earthquakes are happening,"" he said. 
Indeed, they are even if it's been temporarily calm along the big geologic players. But they'll hit again. Sometimes at 6:01 a.m., when you're tucked in bed, in calm, idyllic, California.  
The early morning 1971 Sylmar quake hit Biasi hard. ""It dumped all the dishes out of our house. It sheared my grandfather's house off the ground,"" he said.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Researchers used a grainy photograph of a toppled train combined with an eyewitness account to analyze the deadly earthquake that struck San Francisco over 110 years ago.
In 1906, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck San Francisco, destroying much of the city and killing as many as 3,000 people, making it one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. But it also gave birth to modern American earthquake science. Now, researchers are trying to understand the quake using cutting-edge techniquesand some old documents.
Its important to understand how these larger quakes occurred so we can build safer buildings, explained Swetha Veeraraghavan, postdoctoral research associate in structural computational science at Idaho National Laboratory. I think these types of eyewitness accounts really help with this. Thats why I found the problem really cool.
Scientists have tried analyzing old images and eyewitness data before in order to better understand the 1906 quake. Newer earthquake simulations based on more data and better computational power inspired the researchers to take another look at this famous image of a steam locomotive sitting on its side, taken shortly after the quake. They also examined a conductors description of the incident. The 1907 account reads:
At Point Reyes Station at the head of Tomales Bay the 5:15 train for San Francisco was just ready. The conductor had just swung himself on when the train gave a great lurch to the east, followed by another to the west, which threw the whole train on its side. The astonished conductor dropped off as it went over, and at the sight of the falling chimneys and breaking windows of the station, he understood that it was the Temblor. The fireman turned to jump from the engine to the west when the return shock came. He then leaped to the east and borrowing a Kodak he took a picture of the train here presented.
This might sound like meager information with which to reconstruct an earthquake, but it provides more data than you might think. The quake must have been powerful enough to cause the rocking and the tipping of the train. The team simplified the trains measurements into a long rectangular prism, and simplified the quake to an up-and-down wave motion of the ground. They then used equations devised to describe a rocking rectangular block in response to ground motion to calculate how big the wave must have been in order to tip the train.
Their analysis revealed that the minimum acceleration of the ground required to overturn the train would have been 4 meters per second squared (a little less than half the acceleration of something falling to the Earth in a vacuum), while the minimum velocity would have been 0.5 meters per second, or around 1.6 feet per second.
On top of their analysis of the train tipping, the researchers were able to estimate the location of the earthquakes hypocenterthe area where it actually occurred in the Earth below the epicenter on the surfacebased on the trains location and behavior. While previous models have suggested three locations for a hypocenter, this result reveals that only a hypocenter to the south of Point Reyes, California, would recreate the eastward, then westward tipping of the train, according to the paper published in Seismological Research Letters. This leaves a hypocenter offshore from San Francisco or near the California city of San Juan Bautista, confirming previous estimates.
The paper comes with uncertaintiesfor example, the researchers didnt know how much the train weighed, and are using a simplified model to understand what went on. 
Still, it confirms a body of research recreating this important quake. And it shows more generally that even in the absence of data, context clues, eyewitness accounts, and photographs can prove important for understanding earthquakes. Veeraraghavan said: People have even used tombstones or statues that toppled over to estimate the ground motion.",Researchers used a grainy photograph of a toppled train combined with an eyewitness account to analyze the deadly earthquake that struck San Francisco over 110 years ago.

He is attracted to her, he says, but maybe he is pursuing her out of weakness: his inability to get through life alone. “Time’s Journey” is a response to the Fukushima disaster, and the striking sensory evocation that begins the performance (lights by Amith Chandrashaker, sound by Mikaal Sulaiman, set by Anna Kiraly, all excellent) ensures that we make the connection.

This is part of what makes “Time’s Journey” — the third work by Mr. Ogawa that Dan Rothenberg has directed for the Play Company — feel very different from the most recent of those collaborations, “ The Sonic Life of a Giant Tortoise,” in 2014. So does the casting. The actors in “Time’s Journey,” all based in New York, were born in Japan. “Time’s Journey” is more than a reflection on a single catastrophe, though.

AZAM AHMED,"Sophisticated spying technology sold to the Mexican government for the purpose of tracking terrorists and criminal networks has instead been deployed against dozens of journalists, academics, human rights lawyers and anti-corruption advocates, a potential violation of Mexican law. But when Mrs. Peschard and others called for a simple briefing on the issue, she said she was voted down by every representative of the government agencies. One of the representatives voting on whether to discuss the hacking scandal was Arely Gomez, the attorney general in office when the government was using the surveillance technology. “I would say there is in fact coordination on the committee,” Mrs. Peschard said with a dry laugh. “It’s them against me.” In a statement, Mr. Peña Nieto’s office acknowledged that any “illegal intervention of communications” is widely viewed as a pressing issue. But, it said, Mexican law does not treat spying as a “corruption crime,” so government representatives had argued that it should not be handled within the new system. Mrs. Peschard and other commission members say they have tried, unsuccessfully, to check on other cases that have raised troubling questions for the Mexican public. Last December, the United States Department of Justice announced that Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction behemoth accused of paying nearly $800 million in bribes to government officials across Latin America, had given about $10.5 million in “corrupt payments” to Mexican officials to win public contracts. The department said $6 million of that money had gone to a single “high-level official of a Mexican state-owned” company. Court documents in Brazil contend that Emilio Lozoya, the former head of Mexico’s state-owned oil company and a close ally of the president, received bribes directly from Odebrecht. Mr. Lozoya helped to run Mr. Peña Nieto’s 2012 presidential campaign. Deepening the intrigue, the government fired a Mexican prosecutor who had been looking into the use of illicit money in the president’s campaign — just days after the prosecutor said that Mr. Lozoya had secretly pressured him to be cleared of any wrongdoing. Mrs. Peschard and other commission members said they repeatedly asked for briefings on the matter. The government denied that any such request had been made. But in separate interviews, several commission members cited letters they had sent to the attorney general’s office requesting an update on the case. Each time, they said, they were told there could be no briefing because an investigation was underway, prompting them to wonder how they could do their jobs if sharing information about investigations was prohibited. After consistently being blocked, Mrs. Peschard and the others decided on another approach. When local news reports revealed that nearly $200 million had been embezzled through the nation’s public universities, the commission sent requests to 99 government departments, asking for the information directly. Only one government agency has responded so far. In another instance, the commission tried to establish a single account to disburse money for earthquake victims — to ensure that the funds could be rigorously accounted for. Once again, it was told to stand down. Since the commission is not technically part of the government, the president’s office says, it cannot coordinate government resources. For many Mexicans, the new anti-corruption system — and particularly the power of citizens to coordinate it — showed that the government, when pushed hard enough, might finally combat the impunity that defines much of life in Mexico. But many civil society leaders, including some who helped engineer the creation of the anti-corruption system, say they have fallen prey to a familiar trick: The government creates a panel to address a major issue, only to starve it of resources, inhibit its progress or ignore it. Photo Juan Pardinas, a chief architect of the anti-corruption system, says now that it is “basically broken.” Credit Brett Gundlock/Bloomberg “The Mexican government feeds us placebos and we believe they will cure us,” said Juan Pardinas, the president of the Mexico Institute for Competitiveness and one of the chief architects of the anti-corruption system. “I drank the Kool-Aid and I passed the jar to a lot of people, believing it was a path to change.” Mr. Pardinas has been one of the most prominent public voices fighting corruption, its corrosive effect on democratic institutions, and the lives it sometimes claims. He ultimately became a target of the spying technology purchased by the Mexican government to surveil criminals and terrorists. “I killed myself for three years to achieve this, and it’s basically broken,” he said of the anti-corruption effort. “Well, maybe the system isn’t broken. It’s actually working perfectly to allow impunity.” The anti-corruption drive is still missing its independent prosecutor, arguably the most important person in the entire operation. The selection has been frozen in the legislature, which was already up in arms over the president’s contentious choice for attorney general: Raúl Cervantes, a close ally of Mr. Peña Nieto and the main lawyer for his party during the 2012 campaign. After a long battle in Congress — and news articles about properties and a Ferrari owned by Mr. Cervantes, registered outside of the capital to avoid higher taxes — his name was withdrawn. Beyond that, many Mexican states have still not enacted the mandatory systems meant to duplicate the federal anti-corruption effort on a local level. One of the commission members, Mr. Perez de Acha, says he has sued the states that have not set up their anti-corruption systems, which were supposed to be in place by July 19. He has also sued the Senate to force the appointment of the 18 anti-corruption judges. “We can’t sit with our arms crossed,” he said. “We have constitutional legitimacy.” Other commission members agreed. “I’m not going to give up,” said one of them, Mariclaire Acosta. “There is no quick fix here.” A version of this article appears in print on December 2, 2017, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: ‘A Bad Joke’: Corruption Battle Stalls in Mexico, Watchdogs Say.

A senior government source in Haiti confirmed to the BBC that an investigation will now be launched into foreign aid agencies operating there. What is the charity accused of? One of the UK's biggest charities, Oxfam, was the subject of a report in the Times newspaper last week.

Media caption Former Oxfam employee Widza Bryant: ""I was told by many locals there were... sexual relations"" Oxfam were in the country offering relief following a devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people in 2010. The charity has since confirmed sexual misconduct occurred, and that several staff members were dismissed or resigned after the internal investigation, but denies any cover-up. It has been accused by a UK charity watchdog, which has launched an inquiry, of failing to disclose the full details. Oxfam's deputy chief executive Penny Lawrence has resigned over the handling of the scandal, and the UK government has threatened to cut funding to the charity's projects. How has Haiti reacted? Posting on his Twitter account (in French) Haitian President Jovenel Moise spoke out about the scandal for the first time on Monday.

Adam Rosenberg,"Right on the heels of Thursday's volcano eruption in Hawaii, a pair of earthquakes struck the state as residents contended with ongoing evacuations and noxious gas in the air. The first, a 5.4-magnitude quake according to the United States Geological Survey, occurred at around 11:30 a.m. local time near the southern coast of Hawaii's Big Island, just south of Kilauea volcano. A second, 6.9-magnitude quake followed roughly an hour later. SEE ALSO: 3D Image of Sierra Negra Could Help Us Understand Volcanoes According to the USGS, the latter one was the state's strongest since a 7.1-magnitude quake that hit in ""almost exactly the same location"" in 1975. Lighter earthquakes continued into Saturday morning as a result of ongoing volcanic activity. You can keep track of them yourself right here. In a notice posted on Friday afternoon, the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency had little to say about the tremors. The biggest threat continues to be the high levels of sulfur dioxide found in the evacuation area, released as volcanic activity causes fissures to open in the ground. That could change, however. ""The [evacuated areas around Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens Subdivision] continues to be unstable with multiple volcanic eruptions happening,"" the notice reads.

Josh Ocampo,"If youre tired of AirBnB, heres another option: Buy your own vacation home. One man (with a major real estate problem) is offering up his furnished Italian villa in a raffle with an entry fee of 50 euros (thats $66 USD), no strings attached.
What do you have to look forward to in your future mansion? Three bedrooms in a small village of Carapelle Calvisio, Italy, two hours from Rome, a garden with grapevines, and views of the surrounding countryside and national park (its like living in Call Me By Your Name, but not as sexy).
Altogether, its supposedly valued at 250,000 euros ($282,000 USD). But apparently, the seller in question is struggling to sell the home, despite all its Italian glory.
We have tried to sell the house via the usual means, using knowledgeable local and international agents, but the market has been quiet and, despite some expensive advertising, there have been no serious takers, the seller, Jamie Abbott, wrote on the contests website. The house was even featured on the BBCs Escape to the Continent (season 1, episode 8), but the couple chose somewhere else in the end. As such, weve decided to run this competition so one lucky winner will get the keys to this gorgeous house in Italy.
Few things are more frustrating than a canceled flight, particularly in the U.S. You can be strung
Read more Read
As such, Abbott will need just under 6,000 entrants to meet the value of the home, which explains why hes selling just 6,000 tickets to prospective entrants (according to Insider, hes already sold 3,000, so hes well on his way).
And if you lose, well, theres a second and third place prize, too! The first runner-up will receive some 10,000 euros or $11,300 and third place will receive a fantastic hamper filled with local food and wine, which is not money.
Still looking for a chance to win? Visit the contests website, fill out an entry form with your credit card information, and youre in. Youre also free to purchase more than one ticket if you want to up your chances (though one seems plenty, given the entry fee). The contest closes on September 30, 2019, with a winner being announced soon after.
And if the contest sounds too good to be true, dont forget about taxes and upkeep costs (which the seller estimates are roughly 1000 euros or $1,110 annually). Its also far from any major international airport, so take extra travel costs into account, too. 
And according to the contests website, the home is located in an earthquake-ridden part of central Italyand is only made of stone, so theres that to consider. [...] There is always the danger of an earthquake, but the house has been reinforced and sustained no damage in the recent earthquakes, the seller wrote. It is built directly on the natural rock which is a massive advantage as the house will move with the ground.
So take into account earthquake insurance costs, too, just to be safe.","If you’re tired of AirBnB, here’s another option: Buy your own vacation home.

The government is scrambling to get aid to the worst-hit area in the mountainous province of Kermanshah, where hundreds of homes were destroyed. More than 400 people were killed and about 7,000 injured when the quake hit near the Iran-Iraq border on Sunday. Iran has declared Tuesday a national day of mourning. President Hassan Rouhani is due to visit the region. Iranian officials said 413 people had died in the country. In the more sparsely populated areas across the border in Iraq, officials said nine people had died and several hundred were injured. Iranian state TV said thousands of survivors were spending another night in makeshift camps or in the open. Many whose homes were still intact were frightened of returning because of dozens of aftershocks. ""It is a very cold night... we need help. We need everything. The authorities should speed up their help,"" said one homeless young woman in Sarpol-e-Zahab, where most of the victims died. One aid agency said 70,000 people needed shelter and the UN said it was ""ready to assist if required"".

Adventure playgrounds arrived in Japan in the 1970s as a way of advocating for greater risk and free-play in the over-scheduled and regulation-restricted lives of urban children, according to Japans Metropolis Magazine. Setagaya Play Park was created by playwork volunteers after the Kobe earthquake in 1995. That was a bleak time for Japansome adults fought against the park and criticized the fact that kids were playing earthquake on the playground so soon after the disaster. But experts began to realize that pretend play was good for kids, especially after tragedy. Pediatric doctors began advocating play to help kids release stress and prevent PTSD. Today, there are several adventure playgrounds all over the countrycommunity members are invited to donate tools and scrap materials to the park so kids can create fortresses, pirate ships or whatever else they can imagine.
There are a growing number of adventure playgrounds in the U.S., too, from Berkeley to New York to Nebraska. Check one out if you can.

THOMAS ERDBRINK,"Iranian officials put the epicenter of the quake inside Iran, near the border town of Ezgeleh. The region is a patchwork of farms and is home to many Kurds, a large ethnic minority in Iran. Initial reports from the Kurdish region of Iraq indicated less damage and fewer deaths on that side of the border. In Sulaimaniya, the second-largest city in Iraq’s Kurdish region, residents described feeling heavy tremors but said there was no notable building damage. Residents in the oil-rich town of Kirkuk, some 50 miles to the west, reported similar damage. The earthquake was felt as far as the Mediterranean coast of Israel. Shiite pilgrims in the Iraqi city of Kerbala, for the annual religious commemoration of Arba’een, posted videos of people gathering on the streets after the earthquake occurred. Iran lies on dozens of fault lines and is prone to quakes. In 2012, a double earthquake in the north of the country killed 300 people. When ordinary Iranians learned of the government’s lackluster relief efforts, some started organizing aid groups themselves. In 2003, more than 20,000 people were killed and an ancient citadel was destroyed in the southern city of Bam. After that quake, the United States, which does not maintain normal diplomatic relations with Iran, sent several planeloads of aid.

THOMAS FULLER and INYOUNG KANG,"Residents of Atlanta, Dallas or New York may be thousands of miles from areas at most risk for earthquakes. But they are exposed, Mr. Lehmann argues, because Fannie and Freddie would most likely need a bailout of taxpayer money after a big earthquake. Only 13 percent of California homeowners have earthquake insurance, raising questions on whether earthquake insurance should be mandatory for mortgage holders. In a response to questions, a spokeswoman for Fannie Mae emailed a statement that said while Fannie encourages borrowers to obtain earthquake insurance, it is “unaffordable for many.” In the Bay Area, earthquake insurance for a home that would cost around $500,000 to rebuild has an annual premium of about $3,000 per year with a 5 percent deductible, according to the California Earthquake Authority. Mr. Lehmann says that he recognizes the high cost of insurance but that the government should study ways to make it more affordable — and to lower the risk to a national mortgage system still recovering from the financial crisis a decade ago.","Tuesday: Protecting U.S. taxpayers from the next big one, aiming for 100 percent renewable energy by 2045, and a high school photo delights N.F.L. fans.",2018-09-11T12:33:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Who Owns the Risk for Earthquakes?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/us/california-today-earthquake-insurance.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/11/us/11caltoday_quake/11caltoday_quake-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,earthquake,1

George Dvorsky,"On September 19, 2017, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico, killing nearly 370 people. But something good has come from this tragic event: The quake damaged an ancient pyramid, revealing a previously unknown Aztec temple underneath. While checking for structural damage inflicted by the 2017 earthquake, archaeologists with Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) made a remarkable discovery: a temple located about six feet (two meters) below the top of the Teopanzolco pyramid, a structure the Aztecs dedicated to Tláloc, the Aztec rain god. It was not uncommon for ancient cultures to build upon older structures, but in this case, the archaeologists had no idea a temple was located within. While performing their survey, the INAH archaeologists noticed that some stones on the top of the pyramid were loose. The hidden temple revealed itself as the scientists were searching for firmer terrain. The newly discovered temple measures about 20 feet by 13 feet (6m x 4m), and it dates back to the Middle Postclassic period, sometime between 1150 to 1200 AD. The temple was built by the Tlahuica culture, one of several Aztec peoples living in central Mexico shortly before and during the time of the Spanish conquest, which started in 1521. The temple and the Teopanzolco pyramid built upon it, which dates back to about 1300 AD, are located in Morelos state, about 43 miles (70 km) south of Mexico City. The newly discovered temple is quite possibly the oldest evidence of human occupation at the Morelos site—an important finding that represents a very early stage of the Aztec period. “Despite what the earthquake meant, we have to be grateful that this natural phenomenon revealed this important structure, which changes the dating of this archaeological site,” said Isabel Campos Goenaga, director of the INAH Morelos Center, at a press conference held earlier this week. The walls of the temple were found next to the remains of a stuccoed column that once supported a roof. Intense humidity has obliterated most of the stucco walls, but the archaeologists managed to salvage some fragments for study. The INAH archaeologists say it likely represents the first constructive phase of the Teopanzolco pyramid, predating the famous Templo Mayor, which dates back to the Late Postclassic period (1200 to 1521 AD). “The internal temple that we found in that sense is the oldest at the pyramid of Teopanzolco,” explained INAH archaeologist Barbara Koniecza. “We have already detected two construction stages, and where we stand is considered to be built in the oldest phase before the second phase of the Templo Mayor.” Sadly, the 7.1 magnitude quake damaged the Teopanzolco pyramid, along with two temples. The floor of both shrines have sunk, and are now deformed, making the structures potentially unstable. More work is needed to assess the damage and to devise potential restoration strategies. Until then, the site, which has been closed to the public since last September, will remain off limits to tourists.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Zimbabweans want a ""happy new Zimbabwe"" - and the long-time ruling party Zanu-PF is anxious to assure them it can be the one to deliver it It's been a dramatic, inspiring, earthquake of a week in Zimbabwe. But if you're looking for evidence to show that what really happened was a ruthless reshuffle within the governing party, Zanu-PF, rather than any grander transformation in politics or society, it is worth having a chat with the local MP for Harare East. I met the Honourable Terence Mukupe in the garden of the Miekles Hotel in the city centre, as his new party boss, Emmerson Mnangagwa, was poised to return to the country, and a fellow Harare MP was busy being dragged off, in tears, by plain-clothed security agents in the hotel lobby. ""That's a signal to the public that we really mean business,"" said Mr Mukupe, drily, of his Zanu-PF colleague, Shadreck Mashayamombe - reportedly a former aide to Grace Mugabe. ""There are going to be over 500 high-profile people that are going to face the music, be taken to court, and that's what Zimbabweans want to see. No sacred cows,"" he continued. Mr Mukupe, who says he worked for 10 years as an investment banker on Wall Street before winning his seat in parliament two years ago, is part of an ambitious younger generation of Zanu-PF MPs who have been at the heart of the internal power struggles that led to last week's military ""intervention."" Although he briefly sided with the G40 group linked to Grace Mugabe, he quickly and - as it soon proved - presciently switched to endorse her bitter rival Mr Mnangagwa. Media caption How news of Robert Mugabe's resignation was greeted across Zimbabwe Now Mr Mukupe foresees a Zanu-PF revival, with technocrats - like himself perhaps - brought in to the cabinet to fix the economy, and next year's national elections already a foregone conclusion. ""There's so much chaos within the opposition. Everyone is clear that Zanu-PF is going to win the election. It will be a landslide. So let's have change within Zanu-PF,"" he said. He mentioned Rwanda as an example to follow. ""People want to see technocrats. It should become a meritocracy."" Image caption ""We have a cancer in this society,"" Mr Mukupe told the BBC But what's most striking, to an outsider, about someone like Mr Mukupe is his skill in disassociating himself from the disastrous failings of Zanu-PF and President Mugabe, and the repression and misrule that damaged the lives of so many millions of Zimbabweans. He readily admits there was ""violence perpetrated against opposition members and corrupt activities"", but insists that the blame lay squarely with President Mugabe. It's an argument that suits the party well these days, as it purges itself of ""cliques"" and ""cabals"". ""We have a cancer in this society. Our politics was about cults. Everyone was afraid of President Mugabe. Don't make it appear as if it's just the ordinary people, or people in opposition. ""Even people within Zanu-PF were afraid. He was the beginning and end of everything - he could hire you, fire you, imprison you, do all sorts of things to you. Not everyone could stand up and fight the beast,"" said Mr Mukupe. Media caption Mugabe: From war hero to resignation ""We should never have given him the sort of powers we gave him,"" he conceded, but insisted that no-one, including the opposition, had ""clean hands.

THOMAS FULLER and MATT STEVENS,"All of this would seem to be good news for California — more people insured presumably means a steadier recovery after an earthquake. Yet the increase came with unintended consequences. For reasons related to the way the earthquake authority is capitalized, the sharp increase in customers means the authority has to buy more reinsurance — the insurance that insurance companies buy for themselves to spread risk. This means the authority will be forced to raise rates around 2 to 4 percent annually, according to Mr. Pomeroy.

Shannon Connellan,"A magnitude 7.5 earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the Indonesian island region of Sulawesi on Friday. The natural disasters claimed at least 1,234 lives, according to the death toll reported on Tuesday. Officials fear the toll will continue to rise. Most of these deaths have occurred in the coastal city of Palu, with many victims still to be located within the ruins. Mass burials have begun in the area, and thousands are now homeless across the region, sheltering in some 200 displacement sites. SEE ALSO: An Indonesian tsunami's devastation captured in new, horrifying video We don't know the full breadth of the impact of the disaster just yet. As Reuters reports, more remote areas have been out of contact for over three days, though rescuers are finally reaching those locations. Thousands of homes have collapsed in the Sulawesi region, along with hospitals, hotels, and shopping centers. Image: Carl Court/Getty Images Indonesian President Joko Widodo has requested ""urgent"" international aid, and the global community is identifying different ways to assist Indonesia during the disaster. The hardest hit cities, Palu and the coastal city Donggala, are the most in need. According to Charity Navigator, officials are reporting that supplies like food, water, and medicine are running low, shelter is scarce for thousands of displaced people, and some of the affected areas are proving hard to reach. Clearing a path to reach victims and deliver aid is a priority. BBC reports that aid agencies have been struggling to access affected areas due to damage at Palu's main airport, roads cut off by landslides, and power is out across much of the region. So, how can you personally help? Here's our list of ways you can support survivors, which will be updated to reflect the ultimate scale of the earthquake and tsunami's devastation: 1. Donate to reputable nonprofits and charities. Charity Navigator has published a list of highly-rated organisations that are focused on delivering general aid and relief, medical services and hygiene kits, as well as food, water, toilets, and basic shelter. Here are the organisations listed as working on tsunami recovery for Indonesia: Heart to Heart International, World Vision, Direct Relief, Project HOPE, Water Mission, GlobalGiving, Save the Children, International Medical Corps, Helping Hand for Relief and Development, and World Help. Though not featured on Charity Navigator's list, Indonesian Red Cross Society (or Palang Merah Indonesia), Red Cross Australia, UNICEF, Oxfam, and CARE Australia, are organisations already on the ground or preparing to help victims. Indonesian Red Cross (or PMI) rescue workers use a tracked vehicle to move through an area destroyed by the tsunami in Palu. Image: Carl Court/Getty Images Doctors Without Borders has also deployed a local team to Central Sulawesi. The team includes medical, logistics, and water and sanitation specialists. 2. Consider ways to help the most vulnerable communities. Natural disasters affect people in different ways, but the most vulnerable communities are often overlooked in the aftermath. Humanity and Inclusion, a U.S.-based not-for-profit that promotes disability rights, is taking donations for basic aid and rehabilitation care for tsunami survivors with serious injuries and disabilities. Thousands of people have been left homeless from the tsunami, in addition to locals who were already experiencing homelessness. Consider donating to local, national, or international organisations that are trying to address the immediate crisis of homelessness. Oxfam, for example, is working with local Indonesian partners to deliver essential aid like emergency shelters, soap and sanitary items, water containers, tarps, and toilets. Some of the most vulnerable survivors of a natural disaster are the youngest among us. Consider supporting nonprofit groups that serve children. Save the Children is on the ground in Sulawesi, providing medical care, emotional support, and child-friendly spaces in shelters with diapers and cribs. 3. Keep checking in after the headlines have faded The fallout after a natural disaster is immense, but it eventually stops making headlines. Once the media coverage has ebbed, those affected by the disaster still have to piece together their lives. Keep checking in with your chosen charity to see how things are progressing, and check situation updates from the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance (AHA Center). Finally, if you need guidance on deciding which cause to support amongst so many worthy aid and recovery efforts, consult Charity Navigator's tips for how to give in a crisis. Strategies include giving money instead of material items and making long-term donations.","A magnitude 7.5 earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the Indonesian island region of Sulawesi on Friday.

THOMAS FULLER,"The building code is usually looking to make sure you survive the earthquake, Naomi Kelly, the San Francisco city administrator, said in an interview on Thursday. We want to go a step further and make sure you can go back into the building. The report calculated that buildings constructed to the current code could suffer damage that could take two to six months to fix. In a city filled with tech companies that rely on uninterrupted connections to the outside world, officials fear that many companies would pull up stakes after a large earthquake. San Francisco is surrounded by active faults, including the San Andreas, which is capable of producing a catastrophic 8-magnitude earthquake, and the Hayward fault along the eastern shores of the San Francisco Bay, which is capable of around a 7-magnitude earthquake, also very powerful. The report, which defines tall buildings as 240 feet and higher, also expresses concern about existing buildings in the city and suggests steps to check their safety. As part of the effort, the city created a public database of the 155 tallest buildings and included details on how they were constructed. Many steel-frame buildings in the city are known to have a construction flaw made evident by the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Theres never been a systematic reassessment of those buildings, said Gregory G. Deierlein, a Stanford University professor and a co-author of the report. Some buildings may have suffered structural damage in San Franciscos 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake that has not yet been inspected, Professor Deierlein said.","Struggling to explain construction flaws in two high-profile new buildings, city officials are calling for stricter seismic building regulations.",2018-10-04T23:10:35Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","As a San Francisco Skyscraper Leans, a Call for Stricter Building Codes",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/us/san-francisco-building-codes-earthquakes.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/05/us/05sfbuildings/05sfbuildings-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,earthquake,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Indonesia quake looter: ""We need to eat"" Volunteers have begun burying victims of Indonesia's deadly earthquake and tsunami in a mass grave. The disaster devastated swathes of Sulawesi island and has left at least 844 people dead. Four days after the natural disaster hit, some remote areas have yet to be contacted. A lack of heavy lifting equipment is hampering rescuers' attempts to reach people who remain alive in the ruins of collapsed buildings. ""Communication is limited, heavy machinery is limited... it's not enough for the numbers of buildings that collapsed,"" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. Dozens of people are feared to be underneath the rubble of one hotel alone, the Roa-Roa in the devastated coastal resort of Palu. Yenni Suryani, of Catholic Relief Services, said aid agencies were struggling to get staff into affected areas as the main airport at Palu was damaged, landslides had cut road links and ""power is out almost everywhere"". Some survivors have been looting shops for food, water and fuel, telling reporters they have run out of supplies. Reuters news agency reports that police are escorting aid convoys to prevent supplies being stolen. President Joko Widodo has welcomed offers of international help. On a visit to the region, the president urged a ""day and night"" effort to rescue survivors. Meanwhile, government officials say some 1,200 inmates escaped from three prisons in the region as the quake struck.

Trucks arrived with bodies wrapped in orange, yellow and black bags. They were dragged into the grave and motorised diggers poured earth on top. But many people are still looking for missing loved ones. Adi told AFP he was hugging his wife by the beach in Palu when the tsunami struck, and has not seen her since.

Patients and corpses side by side By Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Palu Lying on a stretcher in the dark outside the Mamboro health clinic in Palu is a five-year-old girl with a broken leg. She was found alone, Doctor Sasono tells me. ""We don't know where her family is and she doesn't remember where they live."" His clinic has no power and is running out of medical supplies. A few metres from her stretcher bed are rows of bodies in bags. The smell of decomposition fills the air. Dr Sasono says they will be buried in mass graves to stop the spread of diseases: ""They are starting to smell. We want to wait for relatives to pick them up, but we can't wait any longer."" Rows of rubble lie all along the shoreline where vibrant fishing villages once stood. People's possessions lie smashed together, with cars and boats tossed around by the massive waves. Amid the rubble are tents where families are sleeping out in the open. Why was the tsunami so destructive? The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday, setting off a tsunami. The earthquake was powerful but shallow and with more lateral than vertical movement, not typically the kind of tremor that sets off tsunamis. A sophisticated tsunami warning system was put in place across the whole Pacific region after the 2004 disaster, which killed nearly a quarter of a million people. A tsunami warning was issued after the earthquake hit on Friday, but many people in Palu did not receive alerts because of power cuts caused by the tremor. There were also no sirens located along the coast. Videos show people screaming as waves 6m (20ft) high power over the beach - where a festival was being set-up - sweeping up everything in their path. Indonesia, one of the world's most disaster-prone countries, lies on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" where tectonic plates collide and many of the world's volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.

THOMAS FULLER,"With the median price of a home in California now above $500,000, estimates of the potential uncovered losses in an earthquake run into the hundreds of billions of dollars. Economists say a large earthquake could have serious repercussions for local California banks. And with one-fifth of America’s $10 trillion in mortgage debt held in California, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the government mortgage finance giants that guarantee much of America’s mortgage debt, are also exposed to the risk, economists say. Those who have lived through major earthquakes recount how damaging they can be, even to ordinary wood-structure homes, which are considered among the safest. Art Polan and his wife were still sleeping when the Northridge earthquake struck their two-story home in 1994. Bookshelves crashed to the floor, and the china in the kitchen spilled out of closets. “The house was totaled,” Mr. Polan said. The insurance payout he received was not enough to rebuild the house, so with the help of a federal loan, he moved and built elsewhere. Cindy Watter remembers the Napa earthquake of 2014 sounding like “a runaway train full of howling beasts was outside my back door.” Her two-story Victorian home, built in 1895, had relatively light damage, but her neighbors were not as lucky. One house burned to the ground because of a gas fire. “Lots of people around here took a real financial hit and couldn’t afford to fix up their houses, so they sold them and moved away,” Ms. Watter said. “I still have earthquake insurance because, well, you never know.” Insurance is not a panacea, experts say. Even if every building in California were insured, a large earthquake could nonetheless have a devastating impact on the economy.","Experts warn that California property, both commercial and residential, is vastly underinsured. “What are we going to do when no one has insurance and everyone has damage?”",2018-08-31T18:40:07Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","In Quake-Prone California, Alarm at Scant Insurance Coverage",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/us/california-earthquake-insurance.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/30/us/00quakeinsurance-01/00quakeinsurance-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,earthquake,1
ALEXANDRA YOON-HENDRICKS and MATT STEVENS,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The earthquake that struck eastern Los Angeles County on Tuesday caused little damage, but it was a reminder of the seismic volatility in the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains. Forty-seven years ago, a much more powerful earthquake struck Sylmar — about an hour’s drive from the epicenter of Tuesday’s earthquake — killing 65 people and severely damaging four hospital campuses. The consequences of that disaster are still being felt. A law passed in 1973 that ordered hospitals to strengthen their most vulnerable buildings has had unintended consequences across the state. To Nancy Skinner, a state senator in the East Bay, the seismic safety law has been used as an excuse for a vital acute-care hospital, the Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, to shut down services at its Berkeley location. The hospital cites financial difficulty in funding the mandated retrofit, whose deadline has been pushed back several times and is now 2020. (There is also a 2030 deadline for buildings to be able to not only withstand an earthquake, but also remain operational.) Officials with Sutter Health, the hospital system that runs the Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, has reassured locals that services will remain intact and that the center will relocate several miles south to Oakland. But Ms. Skinner said the move — which will result in some ambulances and patients having to use one of the most congested highways in America — would have an “extreme” impact on her constituency. The hospital controversy underscores a recurring problem in California: Residents want safer buildings, but they fear the more immediate consequences of costly renovations.","Thursday: The effects of a 1973 law that are still being felt, new policies on campus sexual misconduct, and a special escort to kindergarten.",2018-08-30T12:57:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: The Costs of Making Buildings Safer,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/us/california-today-earthquake-retrofit-hospitals.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/30/briefing/30calitoday-bates/30calitoday-bates-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,earthquake,1
Jodi Brak,"Update 11:30 a.m. March 3:
According to an expert in geoscience, the earthquake which caused a stir in the Shuswap on Saturday, March 2 is not likely to result in aftershocks.
Taimi Mulder, an Earthquake Seismologist working for the Geological Survey of Canada which is a part of Natural Resources Canada, said aftershocks are not generally observed following a quake of this size.
“You can never rule anything out, Mother Nature has her own rules,” Mulder said.
According to Mulder, the earthquake was detected by multiple monitoring stations, the nearest of which was in Lillooet. She said the station in Penticton out of operation for maintenance.
Read More: Magnitude 4.5 earthquake reported off Vancouver Island
Mudler, based at the Pacific Geoscience Centre in Sidney B.C., said the Juan De Fuca Plate, located off the west coast of Southern B.C. and the Northwestern United states, is slowly subducting or sliding beneath the North American Plate. She said the subduction creates stress in the North American Plate and small inland earthquakes sometimes result as the plate readjusts itself.
According to Shuswap Emergency Program spokesperson Tracy Hughes the emergency program was monitoring the situation after the tremor was fel on March 2.
“Members of the Salmon Arm fire department investigated, but there were no reports of damage or injuries. This meant there was no need for us to launch any further activation of emergency services,” Hughes said.
Mulder said although Saturday night’s earthquake was not powerful enough to cause damage it is a good opportunity to review preparedness for natural disasters. In a serious earthquake people should seek shelter beneath a piece of furniture and hold on tight. Other precautions people can take include securing large shelving units to walls, storing heavy objects on bottom shelves and avoiding placing heavy wall hangings above beds.
Update 7:40 a.m. March 3:
According to Earthquakes Canada, on of their monitoring stations detected an earthquake four kilometres Northeast of Salmon Arm at 8:39 p.m. Saturday night.
The monitoring equipment picked up a 2.2 magnitude earthquake originating a kilometre below the earth’s surface. According to Earthquakes Canada’s website, no damage was reported and none would be expected from a quake of this size.
Original Story:
At approximately 8:45 p.m. on March 2, something shook homes from Sicamous to Tappen and alarmed residents, though no confirmation has yet to come in as to what exactly happened.
Initial conversations on the scanner said an explosion was reported at 16 Avenue NE in Salmon Arm; fire and ambulance crews responded but found nothing at the scene. Social media indicated multiple calls were made to RCMP, who reported nothing conclusive, and CP Rail dispatchers were reported contacting train crews to see if anything could be reported.
Dispatchers updated over the scanner at approximately 8:15 p.m. updating that ground shaking was felt in many areas.
At approximately 10 p.m., Shuswap Emergency Program stated there have been widespread reports of the explosion but nothing has yet been found.
“Officials are still investigating the situation, but at this time, 9:50 p.m. on Saturday, March 2, there has been nothing found. Currently, our emergency management has not been activated. We will report back as soon as we know more information,” states the SEP Facebook page.
SEP also says Sicamous Fire Department is reporting no indication of any unusual activity or emergency within their boundaries.

While social media conversations suggested a small earthquake may have occurred, the Seismogram in Lillooet reported no activity at the time of the shake.
The suggested cause of the event that shook homes in the area are various on social media, from a sonic boom resulting from a low-flying jet plane to a possible meteor. A post in the Vernon Rant and Rave Facebook page reports seeing a large shooting star or possible meteor at the approximate time the shaking was felt.
As of yet, none of this has been confirmed by authorities however, and no injuries or property damage has been reported.

Andrew Freedman,"A magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck about 170 miles southeast of Kodiak, Alaska early Tuesday morning, sending residents of the picturesque island fleeing to higher ground to avoid tsunami waves. The quake also prompted tsunami alerts along the West Coast of the U.S. and Hawaii, but those were canceled after data showed damaging waves were not expected. Since the first quake hit there have been several aftershocks, some of which have been strong earthquakes themselves, with a magnitude of up to 5.3 on the Richter Scale. Reports indicated water fluctuating by up to 1 foot in a channel that feeds into Kodiak Harbor, but no large, damaging waves.

CHRIS STANFORD,"Hercule Poirot was fictional, but an obituary for Agatha Christie’s famous Belgian detective nevertheless appeared on the front page of The Times on this day in 1975. Poirot, fastidious and impeccably dressed, made his debut in 1920 in “The Mysterious Affair at Styles” and appeared in more than 30 of Christie’s novels. The actor David Suchet had a long-running role as Hercule Poirot on TV. Credit Acorn TV But “at the end of his life, he was arthritic and had a bad heart,” according to the obituary, which ran the month before Poirot’s final appearance, in “Curtain.” “Curtain” was published in 1975, but Christie wrote the book during World War II as a gift for her daughter should she not survive the bombings in London. It was locked away — alongside a final mystery for her other famous sleuth, Miss Jane Marple — for more than 30 years. Christie died in 1976, and received her own front-page obit in The Times, sharing the headline with Poirot. With a prolific output and global appeal, she remains at the top of Unesco’s list of the world’s most translated authors. “There’s a deep psychological level to Christie’s work,” Mark Aldridge, the author of “Agatha Christie on Screen,” said in an interview last year. “You can watch a film of her work purely for the plot, but you can also watch it for insights into the characters and the human conditions.”",A magnitude 7.0 earthquake on the Indonesian island of Lombok on Sunday destroyed thousands of buildings and left dozens of people dead.

THOMAS FULLER and INYOUNG KANG,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Heres the sign-up.) The turnout was thin in Berkeley on Thursday for ShakeOut, an earthquake drill that has expanded to seismic-prone areas across the globe. Its the 10th anniversary of the drill, which was conceived as a way to remind California residents of the dangers of earthquakes and to remind them to drop to the floor, cover their head and neck, and crawl under a desk when they feel the shaking start. Forrest Lanning, the earthquake program manager in California for FEMA, warned the handful of reporters in attendance at the Berkeley event that many Californians will be on their own after an earthquake hits. FEMA is not going to be able to come in and save everybody, he said. Mr. Lanning, an engineer who lived for four years in New Zealand when that country was rebuilding after the series of earthquakes in Christchurch, said one of the biggest problems California will face after an earthquake is housing. In a state already suffering a homeless and housing crisis, a large earthquake could force hundreds of thousands of people out of their dwellings. Mr. Lanning said there were no good answers about how California will handle earthquake homelessness.","Inside an earthquake simulator trailer in Berkeley, municipal employees and others experienced the shaking of a magnitude 7.0 quake that pushed some of them off the seats they’d been sitting on.",2018-10-19T12:57:55Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: What an Earthquake Could Do to the State’s Housing Crisis,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/us/california-today-earthquake-drill.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/19/us/19californiatoday-1/19californiatoday-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,earthquake,1

Kirsten Korosec,"Uber is taking a page out of the federal government’s disaster response handbook. The ride-hailing company is centralizing how it responds to disasters, whether it’s flooding in North Carolina, a mass shooting in Las Vegas or an earthquake in Mexico City. Now, instead of taking a local-first (and sometimes reactionary) approach, the company’s global security center will monitor and coordinate responses 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The company, which announced the change in a blog post this week, has become part of the urban landscape. People use the Uber app to commute to work, attend concerts and other events, rent bikes (and eventually scooters) and even have food delivered. People have become increasingly reliant on the service, a responsibility that requires more than an app that connects drivers and riders. The GSC, as Uber calls it, monitors and flags issues that may affect its business and the communities in which it operates. From here, the GSC staff, which includes former military and security experts who speak a dozen different languages, coordinate with local Uber staff and city, county or state officials. The GSC is the entity that will make decisions on when to suspend service in an area or whether to cap surge pricing. The GSC might also lend support to local authorities, depending on their needs. This procedural change is another illustration of CEO Dara Khosrowshahis efforts to rehabilitate the company and its reputation. It also telegraphs the company’s push to work more closely with cities. In April, Khosrowshahi announced a series of new products to its app, including a deal with instant car-booking service Getaround to launch a product called UberRENT and a partnership with Masabi that lets users pay and book tickets for public transit in the Uber app. Uber also launched Movement in 2017, a tool that provides cities with traffic data.","Uber is taking a page out of the federal government’s disaster response handbook.

Dell Cameron,"More than 100 emergency sirens blanket the City of San Francisco, ready to warn locals in the event of a flood, a fire, an earthquake, or terrorism. And while true emergencies are few and far between, everyone in the Bay Area knows the siren’s racket, even if they’ve trained their ears to tune it out. Redolent of an wartime air raid, the sirens wail precisely at noon each Tuesday, rising and falling, eerily and slowly. “This is a test,” a voice follows. “This is a test of the outdoor warning system. This is only a test.” And thus concludes the Tuesday midday siren tradition. What the residents don’t know is that their siren has long been vulnerable to attack. Triggering the sound for malicious or mischievous purposes isn’t stupid-easy, but for a person educated in radio-frequency security, who has $30 to blow at an electronics store, there’s virtually nothing to stop them from bathing the city in obnoxious tones for hours on end. Worst still, the same vulnerability might very well affect similar emergency systems in countless other cities, universities, and public utilities installations (read: nuclear power plants). Two years ago, a software engineer—originally from Australia—moved to San Francisco from South Bay and noticed the sirens everywhere he went. Perched atop poles, and often intentionally positioned so as not to “adversely affect residents by blocking their views,” most people wouldn’t give it a second thought. But the engineer, Balint Seeber, just happens to be obsessed with electromagnetic radiation—in particular, the range of frequencies most of us simply refer to as “radio.” Examining the sirens, installed by a company called Acoustic Technology, Inc, or ATI Systems, Seeber, the director of vulnerability research at Bastille Networks, deduced that all were triggered by RF (radio frequency). And of course they are. It would be incredibly inefficient to do it any other way. Why on earth would the city run miles and miles of electric cable to over a 100 points in the city when sweet, wireless radio is so cheap and easy to use? “Before customers panic too much, please understand that this is not a trivially easy thing that just anyone can do.” With access to a specially licensed frequency, there’s virtually nothing to impede the signal sent once a week by the city’s emergency management department. What’s more, test signals, not intended to trigger the sirens, can be sent just as easily, ensuring that the system is on standby for when it is needed most. It’s nearly foolproof. Nearly. It’s not clear what possessed him to do it, but on one Tuesday, shortly before noon, Seeber connected a radio transceiver to his laptop and prepared to scan the airwaves for the siren system’s signal. As it blared, he searched the spectrum broadly, scanning for any activity that matched the siren’s call. Eventually, he hit pay dirt. ATI’s proprietary digital radio protocol, unfortunately, did not benefit from any security measures that would be useful in defending against malicious triggering, he found. “I was expecting some type of encryption might’ve been applied that would have yielded packets with random-looking data,” Seeber told Gizmodo. That wasn’t the case. “These particular activation packets, as they call them, have the same structure every week,” he said. “So it became quickly very apparent that you could forge these packets. It’s not as simple as a replay attack,” he said, meaning you can’t just record the sound and re-emit it. “There’s a little more complexity to them. But not much more.” What would it take then to actually trigger the sirens? Someone with an electrical engineering degree would be ideal. The most complex bit, of course, is finding someone to code the software needed to demodulate, replicate, and transmit the necessary RF signal. San Francisco’s sirens are activated by a manned central controller strategically placed within the city. When an emergency calls, the controller transmits digital activation packets to a repeater, which, according to Seebe, is located in Twin Peaks, the city’s second highest summit and geographical center. The repeater, having receiving the packets, in turn transmits the packets over a licensed frequency to the sirens, each of which contains a modem for demodulating the packets. Anyone who may intercept them, purposefully or by accident, will likely only hear what sounds like seemingly random tones firing in short bursts—a binary code unchanging week to week and the key to the siren’s annoying song. A person who understands this technology as Seeber does should be able to decipher the flow of ones and zeros and, if they’re an asshole, wake up the entire city. (Oh, and they need that $30 radio, too.) These signals can be scrambled, randomized, or in other words, encrypted, to stave off this type of malicious attacks. But according to Bastille, a firm that specializes in analyzing RF-based attacks—for banks, tech companies, as well as the government—many companies believe that merely developing their own radio protocol is security enough. Having confidence that you’re secure simply because no one knows what the hell you’re doing is sometime called “security through obscurity.” Picture a safe with a locking mechanism that no one has ever seen—does that make it unbreakable? As Seeber deftly demonstrated, the obscurity trick doesn’t always work so well. “What we find in our work in general is that in IoT and critical infrastructure and industrial control systems, a lot of companies decide that they’re going to implement a proprietary RF protocol—a radio frequency protocol—to communicate, and they may or may not add security to that,” Bastille’s chief revenue officer, Ivan O’Sullivan, told Gizmodo. Seeber’s research, which was conducted passively—meaning, he never actually attempted to trigger the alarms himself—demonstrated that ATI had not attempted to encrypt its activation sequence, likely because it assumed anyone who happened to find it would have no idea what it was for. “I do see now various forms of new packets that do look more random. And that makes me optimistic.” According to its website, ATI has a host of featured clients one might recognize, among them One World Trade Center and West Point Academy. But it’s unclear which systems at which locations are similarly affected by the vulnerability. Bastille was, however, able to test Seeber’s discovery at one other location. The problem, it seems, is not San Francisco’s alone. “[Seeber] went to the Midwest and proved it at a second location,” O’Sullivan said. “We know of at least two confirmed locations, and that’s what we’ve done so far, but we haven’t been able to travel to each of the locations.” The second location, Seeber informed Gizmodo, was in Sedgwick County, Kansas. Authorities there, he said, confirmed to Bastille that they’d been working with ATI to fix their problems as well. “What we want now is to make sure that ATI’s other customers are made aware of the vulnerability, communicate with ATI, and work with them to take—and, if necessary, customize—the patch and get it out there,” added O’Sullivan said. In a public statement Tuesday, ATI did not contest with Bastille’s findings. It did, however, urged its customers not to panic... too much. “Bastille Networks, a company that offers visibility into known and unknown mobile, wireless and IoT devices within an enterprise’s corporate airspace, reported that by monitoring one of our systems for months, they have largely deduced the command format of our packets,” ATI wrote, adding: “This is likely true.” It continued: “However, we wish to point out these are technically sophisticated people who have devoted significant time and effort to this task. Before customers panic too much, please understand that this is not a trivially easy thing that just anyone can do. Spoofing our current protocol is still several orders of magnitude harder than spoofing a DTMF-based siren system.” (DTMF tones, such as those used on old landlines telephones, have been used in the past to activate emergency systems.) ATI confirmed that indeed it was issuing a patch to further safeguard its systems, at least ones not already protected from the vulnerability, which Seeber has named “ Siren Jack.” The sirens deployed by ATI on military bases, for instance, already use encrypted signals. The military’s equipment is considerably more expensive, however, and not every local government will be able to justify the expense, ATI said. Thanks to Bastille, a patch created by ATI against Siren Jack is now currently being tested, and the company plan to roll it out soon. Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as it sounds. The sirens, ATI said, “are not mass market consumer items connected to the internet where you simply download a patch.” San Francisco, at least, may be able to rest easy. Changes have been apparent, says Seeber, who continues to monitor ATI’s protocols from his home with his laptop and Amazon-bought radio. “I do see now various forms of new packets that do look more random,” he says. “And that makes me optimistic.”","More than 100 emergency sirens blanket the City of San Francisco, ready to warn locals in the event of a flood, a fire, an earthquake, or terrorism.

Mary Halton,"On January 16th 2018, a bright flash lit up the sky over Michigan, accompanied by a loud boom. Caught on dash cams and home surveillance systems, the meteor briefly turned night to day as it streaked to the ground at almost 36,000 miles per hour, causing a blast wave equivalent to a minor earthquake. By the next morning, local people were out searching the frozen winter landscape for pieces of fallen material. Then the professionals had arrived— meteorite hunters. Meteor in Chelyabinsk, Russia, 2013. Much as it did when a similar meteor lit up the sky over Chelyabinsk, Russia in 2013, the Michigan fireball caused a minor gold rush to the site, as people hunted for signs of the fresh meteorite. Originating as asteroids, and in rare cases even fragments ejected from other planets in our solar system, meteorites are pieces of rock and metal that survive the fiery journey through our atmosphere. Falling into three broad categories—stony, iron or stony-iron—meteorites are complex. Burnished by their descent to Earth, many have a fusion crust; a darker outer layer that can appear unusually smooth and differentiates them from terrestrial rocks. Those with a high iron content can have a unique fluid-like surface appearance. Tiny circular grains called chondrules are found in some meteorites; fragments of the early solar system that never coalesced into planets. Despite an estimated 100 tons of this material falling to Earth each day from space, much of it arrives as dust. Any larger pieces, even just a few millimeters across, can be worth their weight in gold. Or much more. Yet meteorites have not always been this valued. While other precious materials like gold and diamonds have been highly prized for millennia, until the late 19th century there were only a handful of accounts of witnessed falls, and scientists were skeptical that rocks could rain from the sky. With its potential for global travel and remote locations, there has recently been a certain Indiana Jones quality attached to the profession of meteorite hunting. One of the world’s most high profile hunters, Michael Farmer has given accounts of being arrested, beaten and almost killed in his quest for specimens in countries around the world. But when the British Museum first opened in the 18th century, exhibiting such objects would have been a matter of ridicule. By 1890, it had amassed a significant collection. Now housed in the Natural History Museum, the meteorites had been purchased and donated from all over the world. In a 19th century guide to the museum’s collection, sources are shown to be eclectic, with many meteorites turning up when fields were plowed, and one in what is now the state of Virginia even being used as an anvil. Many of the stones were used by Native American peoples like the Comanchees for years before being removed by white settlers. Some as sources of iron, others as valued objects. Today, irons like the Sikhote-Alin meteorite, which fell in Russia in 1947, appear for sale the world over, often fashioned into jewelry. With an estimated 70 tons of material surviving that particular impact, the supply is unlikely to dry up anytime soon, and is likely to be encountered by the casual meteorite owner. But rarer specimens aren’t going to appear on Etsy. Instead, they pass through the hands of a select group of people. In the community of those serious about meteorites, if you aren’t studying them for a living, you are likely to be a hunter, a dealer or a collector. So how much will a meteorite set you back in 2018? “The vast majority trade in the one to ten dollar per gram range,” collector Paul Swartz told Gizmodo, “[But] I’ve purchased them for less than three cents a gram.” Swartz began his collection after seeing an iron meteorite for sale on eBay. Having started small, he now owns some pieces of the rarest finds on Earth. A 1911 fall near El Nakhla El Bahariya in Egypt yielded what is known as the Nakhla meteorite, believed to be from Mars. Such a rare class is incredibly valuable—Paul’s piece cost $3,000 per gram. At the time of writing, gold is a comparatively meagre $42.18 per gram. Once they make their way into the market, most meteorites change hands in online sales—through a dealer’s website, or sometimes via eBay. But if you’re going to spend thousands of dollars on a lump of rock or metal you likely haven’t set eyes on in person, you definitely want to know its provenance. Each meteorite distributed for purchase is supposed to come with a record of its classification, and its trail of ownership. To obtain this, dealers must have their specimens classified by a geologist and included in the Meteoritical Bulletin —the definitive index for verified meteorites. This requires a donation of 20% or 20 grams (whichever is smaller) of finds to the classifying scientist. With the scientific and market value ultimately closely aligned, such symbiosis makes sense, leaving researchers with a sample to distribute for study and the dealer with enough still to sell. With a meteorite’s category and potentially its origin in hand, dealers can determine a price, and whether they’ve been lucky enough to acquire an unusual specimen. But prices do remain, as UK dealer Martin Goff points out, highly variable. People, he explains, may want particular meteorite types for their collections, and scientists might wish to study materials of a certain origin. Then there’s size. Individuals—meteorites that are sold intact as found—are more valuable than slices or broken off fragments. As a result of the trust necessary in these expensive exchanges, meteorite hunters have always been a fairly tight-knit community. But in recent years the market has opened up, Goff told Gizmodo. Currently a dealer based in England, he now works most frequently with meteorite hunters in countries like Mauritania, Egypt and Libya. Facebook has enabled those who have found fresh falls to reach out directly to dealers, rather than selling them on through an extensive chain of people-who-know-people. With dealers often based in Europe and North America, nomadic peoples tend to be the first link in this chain—making the least money from an object that increases in value as it makes its way to wealthier markets. Mustapha Oulkouch, who began meteorite hunting as a hobby after quitting hotel work in 2006, sold his first meteorite ten years ago. These days, he said he makes his living looking for meteorites in the Moroccan desert. However it is not, he said, a lot of money, though it does allow him the life he wants. There’s an art to meteorite hunting, and he has learned to recognise the distinctive crust of meteorites on sight, but sometimes he wanders the desert with a metal detector or a magnet searching out rarer iron-rich falls. Communities of hunters like Oulkouch in and around the Sahara have been finding increasing numbers of specimens in recent years, with a group in Morocco joining forces to form the Moroccan Association for Meteorite Professionals and Amateurs. Its goals are to facilitate collaboration with international dealers and collectors, and to promote meteorite science within Morocco itself. More movements like this might aid the democratization of the meteorite business, and see more of the balance (and money) shift to the countries where finds are being made. Sharing a fraught legal area with the likes of oil and gold, ownership of a meteorite depends very much on whose land it falls on. Or, in some cases, who can escort it quickly enough from the premises without the relevant authorities noticing. A court case was famously fought over the Williamette meteorite in Oregon, when farmer Ellis Hughes attempted to move it onto his property, after finding it on land belonging to the Oregon Iron and Steel Company. No parties in court represented the Clackamas people, who had originally inhabited the area and to whom the meteorite, called Tomanowos, was important. While fireballs like Michigan and Chelyabinsk provide an obvious pointer, and historic falls like Arizona’s Meteor Crater can still yield new finds, the majority of material that reaches Earth is lost simply because it falls unwitnessed into the ocean, or among leaves and vegetation. If a meteorite falls in the forest, and no one is there to hear it... it’s likely to stay there for a very long time. Consequently, the two best places for finds are in the desert and on the ice, where they show up against the landscape and are less likely to be covered over by seasonal growth. This makes one place, the perfect combination of both, an ideal meteorite hunting ground—Antarctica. Thanks to treaty guidelines, scientific research takes priority. Dr. Katherine Joy has previously been on an expedition to find meteorites on the continent, and will shortly be taking part in a new search for iron meteorites which may be buried in the ice. Despite having access to samples of all meteorites submitted for classification, scientific study can suffer from a lack of information about a meteorite’s collection conditions. Dr. Joy points out that, for research purposes, there are advantages to using Antarctic meteorites. “We understand their provenance very well. They have very carefully recorded collecting conditions and we know that they’ve been collected using Antarctic export treaties and they’ve been curated well to prevent contamination.” Yet with scientific expeditions to recover meteorites funded and regulated at a national level, she recognises the value of having a wide global network of amateur and professional meteorite hunters. The relationship between the scientific and professional/amateur meteorite community is a careful and an interdependent one. Scientists depend on dealers for specimens that they lack the resources to find themselves, and dealers are reliant on rigorous verification of their specimens. As with any high value items, fake specimens are a problem. Scientists have gone so far as to create catalogs of meteorite imposters they’ve been sent, and careful guides are written to try and prevent unwitting first time buyers from purchasing fakes. While seasoned collectors like Swartz can safely navigate eBay, it is home to fake listings that can look convincing. For scientists and collectors alike, meteorites are a lifelong commitment. While there are concerns about private collections keeping rare specimens from the public, Dr. Joy said that there are some countries who hold scientific collections that even she, as a researcher, wouldn’t know how to access. Martin Goff hopes to inspire young people who may be interested in STEM by displaying his meteorites at shows around the UK. But nothing beats laying your hands on a new meteorite for the first time. “That’s why I still do it—it does send a bit of a shiver down your spine.” If you’re thinking about purchasing a meteorite, check that the seller is IMCA registered, and that the meteorite has been classified.

https://www.facebook.com/jlachenbach,"Yes, that was an earthquake. It wasn’t much of one. People conceivably have sneezed harder than the violence produced by Thursday afternoon’s earthquake. But it was unusual, centered in the normally quiescent state of Delaware, and it could be felt as far as the nation’s capital and its Virginia suburbs. The tremor occurred at 4:47 p.m., centered about 6 miles northeast of Dover, Del., and about 5 miles deep. The U.S. Geological Survey gave varying estimates of the earthquake’s magnitude, at one point rating it as high as a 5.1 but later downgrading it to a 4.1 — a modest event that did not appear to cause any damage, much less fatalities. The Delaware Emergency Management Agency told the Dover Post that there were no reports of damage or injuries. Geophysicist Dale Grant of the USGS said an earthquake in Delaware is “exceptionally rare.” The earthquake was felt across a broad swath of the Washington-New York corridor, and into the Hudson River Valley and parts of Connecticut and Long Island, according to the USGS “Did You Feel It?” page. Almost everywhere, the shaking was reported by residents to be either “weak” or “light.” In comments posted to The Post’s Capital Weather Gang blog, people in and around Washington reported rattling windows or the sense that a big truck had just passed down the street. A reader in Hyattsville wrote, “ My toddler and I looked at each other like ‘what was that?!?’ House shuddered for about a second, 3 shakes. At first I thought the mailman had thrown a big package onto our porch (nope). Then I thought maybe a tree branch had fallen in our backyard (nope). The street was quiet, so not construction or a big truck or a low plane flying overhead. I correctly deduced it must have been an earthquake!” [ Magnitude 4.1 earthquake near Dover, Del., rattles Mid-Atlantic ] Closer to the epicenter, the earthquake was more dramatic. A reader in downtown Dover wrote, “ felt house shake violently….thought it was a gas explosion.” The magnitude scale is logarithmic, and a 5.0 magnitude event is 10 times more powerful than 4.0. The Aug. 23, 2011, earthquake centered near Mineral, Va., which damaged the Washington Monument and the National Cathedral, had an estimated magnitude of 5.8, and was one of the three strongest quakes east of the Rocky Mountains in the last century. There is no known fault associated with this earthquake. The hazard maps produced by the USGS do not show Delaware having a significant seismic hazard. Those maps may have to be revised as a result of Thursday’s tremor. There has been debate, sometimes quite acrimonious, within the scientific community about the usefulness of hazard maps, because earthquakes often happen in places of no known seismic hazard, or the ground shakes with greater intensity than had been imagined. The East Coast has a limited history of major earthquakes, but experts say that citizens should not assume they are free of seismic hazard. Charleston, S.C., was hit by a devastating earthquake in 1886 that killed 110 people. Indeed, New York City is considered highly vulnerable over the long term because so many masonry structures lack the kind of reinforced steel that is required in places with more of a known earthquake risk.

Steve Dent,"Nissan has been testing the idea of used Leaf batteries for awhile with its Tesla Powerwall-like xStorage program. The idea of using the batteries in an off-grid streetlight, however, is new and appears to be just the start of Nissan's new push into grid and off-grid storage. Much like its alliance-mate Renault, Mercedes and others, Nissan also has a grand plan to use batteries from old and destroyed EVs in several ways. One is for residential homes and buildings that use solar or wind energy, storing energy and releasing it at night or if the power goes out. Another is to use the batteries for ""smart booths"" that could power cellphones and other devices. Finally, Nissan unveiled a whimsical scheme, ""a park converting the bursting energy of children into electricity while they play. Children's energy during the day keeps the park bright and safe at nighttime."" Much like Renault's "" Smart Island,"" Nissan's Light Reborn project is more a small-scale test and way to market its green credentials. Namie, Japan, is a particularly poignant location for a test, as the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant lost power during an earthquake and tsunami, causing a partial meltdown of the core. So far, only Tesla has truly made a big push into the consumer market with its Powerwall batteries and solar panels. By the time 2020 rolls around, however, and large companies like VW release mainstream EVs, the idea of recycling car batteries for the grid will be a lot more feasible -- and necessary.","Nissan is using old Leaf batteries in a very meta way: To power streetlights that will make roads safer for vehicles and pedestrians.

"Robin George Andrews on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","In 2011, a colossal tsunami set off by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake slammed into the eastern shores of Japan. Not long afterwards, some of the 1.5 million tons of floating debris created by the waves, from buoys and boats to entire fishing docks, began washing up along Americas northwest Pacific coast. As revealed by a recent study, dozens of species of algaeglobally abundant, as well as those found in Asia and across the northern Pacificsnuck along on this debris and turned up in Oregon and Washington. Spending several years collecting, classifying and observing these tiny beasties, researchers found that most of them were opportunists that had arrived in an environment not dissimilar from their starting points. Had they been given the chance, a full-scale invasion of this brave new world might have taken place. Algae might not sound like much of a danger, but dont forget that these little critters can disrupt entire regions when they get out of hand. Just look offshore from Floridas gulf coast, where a red tide bloom has slaughtered wildlife and devastated the tourist industry. Its even become a hot button issue for voters there in this weeks midterm elections. Thats why this (fortunately averted) incursion matters. Writing in the journal Phycologia, the researchers suggested that if it werent for an extensive and prompt clean-up operation, many of the invaders were likely to have quickly colonized their landing sites. Although its been previously acknowledged that species can ride buoyant debris thousands of miles across the ocean, a 2017 study on the Japanese tsunami was one of the first to document it happening in real time over such a huge scale. It revealed that nearly 300 larger species, from crabs and sea stars to sponges and fish, turned up alive in North America and Hawaii. This new study proves to be an equally eye-opening companion piece. Lead author Gayle Hansen, a marine phycologist at Oregon State University (OSU), explained that the first piece of biota-carrying debris found was the Agate Beach dock, which turned up in June 2012, just over a year after the tsunami occurred. Immediately starting to gather specimens, they ultimately captured 42 pieces of debris between 2012 and 2016 as they washed up in the Pacific Northwest. The debris were found to contain a staggering 84 different species and varieties of algae and cyanobacteria. We did not expect debris to arrive with hitch-hiking biota as we did not think the Japanese species would survive the cross-Pacific journey, she told Earther. Of these, 83 percent were reproductive and dropping spores on examination, while all were capable of becoming fertile. Although many were short-lived, they often had a high colonization potential. Some species had been seen in the Pacific Northwest before, but others were alien, and several were known to be incredibly effective at invading new territory. All things considered, Gaylealong with colleagues at Kobe Universityconcluded that 49 percent of the species that arrived represented an invasion threat to the region. This invasion may have been cancelled, but Hansen referred to numerous earlier examples that hint at what may have transpired. A classic example can be found in Hawaiis Caulerpa taxifolia algae: after having been accidentally introduced to the Mediterranean by an aquarium, it colonized large swaths of the shallow subtidal area, outcompeting the local seagrass. The fish, not willing to eat the toxin-producing invader, experienced a precipitous decline in their populations. John Chapman, a fisheries expert at OSU not involved in the new workand an author of last years tsunami rafting studytold Earther that the environmental threats from introduced algae are very likely underappreciated. Chapman noted that the vast majority of algae are small, which makes them difficult to identify or even detect. This study also found that the smaller species proved to be the longer-term survivors, and were more likely to succeed in invading. This is all problematic, as these critters are likely to be influencing ecosystems in ways that arent yet recognized. And tsunamis are just one part of the problem. Chapman noted that hurricanes, floods, mudslides and pure human messiness all generate floating debris, which is building wider bridges between continents that an enormous diversity of organisms are riding. This article has been updated to clarify that 83 percent of algae varieties the researchers examined were actively reproductive, while all were capable of becoming fertile.","In 2011, a colossal tsunami set off by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake slammed into the eastern shores of Japan.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","Alaska is now beginning to survey the damage of powerful back-to-back earthquakes that struck the area around Anchorage on Friday, an event that resulted in significant damage to buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. Speaking with reporters following the quake, Alaska Governor Bill Walker said that resulting disruption and needed repairs could last quite some time. A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck around 8:29 a.m. local time followed by ensuing, smaller earthquakes. Citing United States Geological Survey research geophysicist Gavin Hayes, CNN reported Saturday that a magnitude-5.2 aftershock about 11 p.m. Friday was the second-biggest event since a magnitude-5.7 temblor hit minutes after the main quake. Despite earthquakes being common in the area, Fridays event was still significant. Videos shared on social media captured widespread damage across Anchorage and the surrounding area. One video shared by climatologist Brian Brettschneider on Twitter captured drone footage of cracks in ice at Anchorages Waldron Lake. According to Brettschneider, the ice was 8 inches thick. Nat Herz, a reporter for Alaska Public Media, told NPR that he was sitting at a coffee shop in Anchorage when he just felt like sort of a rumble or a buzz. But then things kind of got louder, and things started really shaking and shaking hard. And people were kind of looking around, he told NPR. And then I think, you know, someone went for the door, and everyone else went for the door. And, you know, everyone kind of hurried outside. And kind of once things settled down, everyone went back in. At least two highways were closed down following the earthquake, with local CBS affiliate KTVA reporting that areas Glenn Highway endured significant damage that included a massive sinkhole. Power losses also reportedly affected tens of thousands of people following the initial earthquake. Governor Walker said in a phone interview Friday that theres a possibility that some infrastructure damage could take weeks or months to repair, especially given the winter season. Walker also said he spoke with President Donald Trump, after which call KTVA reported the Federal Emergency Management Agency approved assistance for the area. Its going to be a disruption for quite some time, Walker said. Weve been on the phone with the White House a number of times today [and] took a call from President Trump. They talked about their desire to help us, and we appreciate that very much. According to Alaska Public Media, schools in the area are expected to be closed until at least Wednesday of next week.","Alaska is now beginning to survey the damage of powerful back-to-back earthquakes that struck the area around Anchorage on Friday, an event that resulted in significant damage to buildings, roads, and other infrastructure.

"Matt Rivers, Jo Shelley and Ben Westcott, CNN","(CNN) Desperation is growing in the stricken Indonesian city of Palu, as residents faced a fifth day without adequate supplies of food and clean drinking water, amid a sharp rise in the official death toll following Friday's devastating earthquake and tsunami. Indonesia's national disaster agency said the number of people killed in the disaster had risen to 1,234 on Tuesday. The toll is expected to continue to climb in the coming days as bodies continue to be retrieved from under the rubble. The situation for those left alive has grown increasingly dire, as families scramble to get even the most basic of goods. On Tuesday, motorists lined up for hours around the block in the blazing sun, standing among the ruins and debris, in the hope of obtaining a small amount of gas. At the last available gas pump in town, large group of men crowd around a single overworked attendant. In his hand is a wad of cash nearly too big to grip. Money though is of little use when their is nothing left to buy. Roads to Palu -- a city of 350,000 people -- remain blocked and aid has been slow to trickle in. Indonesian vessels carrying food and water has still yet to arrive. Indonesian military have been patrolling the streets in Palu over the past 24 hours to crack down looting by desperate survivors, searching for limited supplies and goods. An official from the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent described the situation on the ground as ""nightmarish."" Bodies of victims remain unburied on the side of the roads. In a public cemetery on the outskirts of the city, workers are digging a mass grave the size of a football pitch to try to bury as many bodies as quickly as possible before disease begins to spread. Almost 200 bodies are in this pit alone, with more still being added every hour. A few ID cards lie on the ground next to the pit, but not all bodies have been identified before they were laid to rest. Amid the long wait for supplies and aid, the desperate search continues for survivors with reports of more than 700 houses buried under a mudslide in a nearby town, which still remain unexplored. 'I need to get the kids out of here' An estimated 2.4 million people have been affected by the disaster, according to Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. He said Tuesday that 799 were injured, and more than 61,000 people have been displaced. In total, Sutopo said 66,000 homes had been destroyed so far. Desperate to leave the scene of the disaster and escape the treat of looting, thousands of locals were queuing at Palu airport with children and belongings in the hope of a way out. ""People are trying to get stuff from my house so I needed to get the kids out of here... they're trying to rob us,"" one local woman told CNN Monday as she waited in line at the airport. While some residents are battling to escape the surrounding area, international aid organizations and Indonesian military are trying their hardest to reach as much of the region as possible. Palates of supplies are en route to the affected area courtesy of the organization like the Red Cross, who sent seven tons of logistical supplies from Jakarta on Tuesday. Countries from around the world have begun to announce aid packages for Indonesia as well. Australia, one of the country's closest neighbors, said it had already provided $500,000 of support immediately through the Indonesian Red Cross. ""Australia has some expertise and has resources in particular areas we can deploy, and we are looking to see how we can best fit the need,"" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Tuesday. The United States announced it had released $100,000 in initial disaster assistance on Monday, according to a state department spokesman. But on the ground, there's little evidence so far of the pledged aid with shipments expected to arrive in the days ahead.","Desperation is growing in the stricken Indonesian city of Palu, as residents faced a fifth day without adequate supplies of food and clean drinking water, amid a sharp rise in the official death toll following Friday's devastating earthquake and tsunami.",2018-10-02T08:09:11Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","More than 1,200 were killed in Indonesia quake and tsunami",https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/02/asia/indonesia-palu-tsunami-earthquake-intl/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181002151513-03-palu-tuesday-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,earthquake,1
Associated Press,"LOS ANGELES - A magnitude 5.3 earthquake struck Thursday under the ocean off Southern California and was felt widely along the mainland coast, but there were no reports of damage except to a chimney on one of the Channel Islands. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake occurred at 12:29 p.m. in the Channel Islands region, about 38 miles (61 kilometers) southwest of the mainland city of Ventura. Some bricks fell from a chimney at an 1860s ranch on Santa Cruz Island, but no one was hurt, said Yvonne Menard, spokeswoman for Channel Islands National Park. The quake's epicenter was 17 miles (27 kilometers) from Santa Cruz Island, which is largely unpopulated but does have some staff and is visited by campers. Authorities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties did not report any immediate damage. The Los Angeles Fire Department said it went into ""earthquake mode"" and firefighters from all 106 of its firehouses began surveys of their territories, including bridges, dams, large buildings and power lines. ""We currently have no reports of damage or injuries,"" spokeswoman Margaret Stewart said. Scientists at the California Institute of Technology's seismology laboratory in Pasadena said the earthquake warning system under development for the West Coast gave about 10 seconds of warning before shaking arrived. Earthquakes of such size usually occur about once a year in Southern California, although the most recent one was in 2014, according to veteran seismologist Lucy Jones, recently retired from the USGS. The 96-square-mile (248-square-kilometer) Santa Cruz Island is the largest in the chain of eight Channel Islands, five of which are in the national park. Most of Santa Cruz Island, including the historic ranch, is owned by The Nature Conservancy, which cooperatively manages the island with the Park Service.","CBS News Los Angeles earthquake: Magnitude 5.3 quake strikes off California ABC15 Arizona LOS ANGELES - A magnitude 5.3 earthquake struck Thursday under the ocean off Southern California and was felt widely along the mainland coast, but there were no reports …",2018-04-06T03:09:32Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Abc15.com'}",Los Angeles earthquake: Magnitude 5.3 quake strikes off California - ABC15 Arizona,https://www.abc15.com/news/national/los-angeles-earthquake-magnitude-53-quake-strikes-off-california,https://mediaassets.abc15.com//photo/2011/09/19/earthquake_20110919135506_900_675.JPG,,Abc15.com,earthquake,1
Jennifer Brett,"The magnitude 4.4 earthquake that shook many metro Atlantans awake on Wednesday morning felt more powerful than a quake of the same strength would have on the west coast. “Eastern United States earthquakes travel farther. It’s because we have really strong rock beneath us,” explained Andrew Newman, a professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. “A magnitude 3 here radiates a lot farther, and shakes like a magnitude 4 in California.” » MORE: The earthquake struck two miles from a nuclear plant How common are earthquakes in Georgia? The temblor emanated from east Tennessee, where it was the strongest on record, at about 4:15 a.m. While it took many by surprise (and, naturally, began trending on social media), the event wasn’t out of the ordinary, Newman said. “These little events are kind of nice, kind of a wake up call,” he said. “We don’t necessarily live in an ‘earthquake zone,’ but our earthquake risk is not zero.” No place is entirely free of such activity, he added, although certainly the west coast is far more commonly considered quake country. “Our topography is a lot older,” he said. “The Appalachian Mountains used to look like the Himalayas.” Millions of years of erosion has whittled down the eastern U.S. mountain chain, while on the other side of the country, “the topography is active and dynamic,” Newman said. The powerful 1886 earthquake that struck Charleston is the most significant seismic event in modern history in this region. It caused at least 60 deaths and more than $5 million in damage. Thousands of buildings, including Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church, were leveled. Here’s an exhaustively researched, 200+ page government report about it. The powerful quake, estimated to have been a high-6 magnitude event, was felt in Atlanta and throughout the southeast. It was front-page news in the Atlanta Constitution for days. It’s possible that other such events have been felt in this region, but records don’t exist to reflect it. “It’s really because we haven’t been around long enough,” is how Newman put it. As with hurricanes, measured in category 1-5 strength levels, earthquake strength grows exponentially from one magnitude to another. Experiencing a magnitude 3 event in our region isn’t at all unusual, but more powerful quakes happen with far less frequency. “The unfortunate thing is we never know when a magnitude 7 is going to strike,” Newman said. He didn’t actually realize metro Atlanta had experienced an earthquake until he read about it. “I woke up but I wake up pretty frequently at that time,” he said, figuring the shaking might have roused him but that he didn’t realize it at the time. “I looked at the clock and went back to sleep.”","NEW DETAILS: Why Atlanta felt an earthquake that struck in Tennessee Atlanta Journal Constitution Two earthquakes shake eastern Tennessee; felt in Atlanta WPTV West Palm Beach Earthquake, magnitude 4.4, rattles Tennessee, Georgia Fox News Magnitude 4.4 Earthq…",2018-12-12T16:15:49Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Ajc.com'}",NEW DETAILS: Why Atlanta felt an earthquake that struck in Tennessee - Atlanta Journal Constitution,https://www.ajc.com/news/why-atlanta-felt-earthquake-that-struck-tennessee/pLFA3va5UjMlWRwitvB1TO/,https://www.ajc.com/rf/image_large/Wires/w2/Local_Wsbtv/2018/12/12/Images/887604283_Earthquake1_1525031547819_11515855_ver1.0_640_360_1544609512612_13972815_ver1.0_640_360.jpg,,Ajc.com,earthquake,1
Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"It’s not often that science can answer questions with an easy “yes” or “no.” Usually it’s more of an “evidence suggests” or “this correlation proposes” sort of situation, even if the public’s understanding is generally a little less nuanced. So USGS Seismologist Susan Hough found the right question: “Do large (magnitude ≥ 8) global earthquakes occur on preferred days of the calendar year or lunar cycle?” And her abstract, published recently in Seismological Research Letters, reflected it: This wasn’t the first time an earthquake-related research question was answered with a single word. Another paper from 1974 posed a similar question, basically, do earthquakes occur randomly in time, and answered it “yes.” In this case, the evidence suggests something similar: Earthquakes don’t occur on preferred days of the year, solar or lunar. “That was the point of the exercise, in fact: to boil lunar/tidal triggering down to the questions that most people think about,” Hough told Gizmodo in an email. “Once it was clear there is no evidence for a significant correlation, the abstract wrote itself =)” The work itself is more nuanced than a simple yes or no, though. Hough isn’t really disproving a relationship between the moon, tides, and large earthquakes. She references some rigorous studies that have, in fact, shown a link between the moon and powerful quakes with specific faults or different datasets. Instead, she’s looking to do something more useful for the general public—assuage concerns that the moon phase is something you should worry about when it comes to earthquakes (as we ourselves may have once suggested). So she analyzed the global earthquake catalog from the 1600s until now, recording the day and lunar phase of large magnitude quakes to see whether there were clusters of earthquakes around certain dates or phases. There weren’t. The work isn’t cut and dry itself, and still leaves a possibility that large earthquake rates “fluctuate systematically but weakly with the lunar date.” It’s just that there isn’t enough earthquake data to show a link. “What we really need to do is wait 4,000 years and redo the exercise. Short of that, there are more sophisticated statistical tests that one could do, but in the end, the catalog is the catalog, and clever statistics are not going to overcome that limitation.” Hough’s abstract isn’t the first one-liner. There’s been one regarding faster-than-light neutrinos (which don’t exist, as far as we can tell), a completely empty abstract for a 1974 paper on writer’s block, and Gardner and Knopoff’s 1974 paper I cited earlier. Lots of people are talking about these papers now on social media. So science can come with yes-or-no answers—but this requires asking the right question. Perhaps there’s some link between the tides and large quakes, but there is definitely not a correlation between any calendar dates and large earthquakes today based solely on the past 400 years of data, given the right constraints. On final reflection, Hough told Gizmodo that when science intersects with public concern, it can lead to a disconnect. “Scientists nowadays are asking complex questions and often getting complex answers,” she wrote. “The papers I referenced were careful to say that tidal modulation is subtle, and of no practical use for prediction. But I think we need to do a better job of explaining science, focusing squarely on things people care about.” [ SRL via Alexandra Witze’s Twitter ]","It’s not often that science can answer questions with an easy “yes” or “no.” Usually it’s more of an “evidence suggests” or “this correlation proposes” sort of situation, even if the public’s understanding is generally a little less nuanced.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Indonesian island of Sulawesi has become a natural disaster zone. After a tsunami battered the island late last week, leaving at least 1,350 dead, a volcano has now erupted. Earlier this week, scientists forecast that Soputan, an active stratovolcano on the northeastern tip of the island, was showing signs of activity. On Wednesday, it sent an ash cloud towering nearly 20,000 feet above its summit. By night, lava was trickling down Soputans flanks. The volcano continues to be on a Level III alert, which is a watch and take precautions kind of alert, but not an evacuations are imminent one. Soputan has erupted a dozen times since 2000, so this isnt wholly a surprise. But it coming right after an earthquake that triggered a tsunami has people wondering if the geological phenomena are intertwined. The short answer: We dont know, but it seems unlikely. It could be that this earthquake triggered the eruption, but the direct correlation has yet to be seen, Kasbani, the head of Indonesias Vulcanology and Geology Disaster Mitigation agency who goes by only one name, said according to NBC News. Denison University volcanologist Erik Klemetti threw even more cold water on the speculation. Soputan had already been restless for months before the earthquake and the volcano is hundreds of kilometers away from the epicenter of the earthquake, he said in an email to Earther. So, I invoke correlation =/= causation on this front. Indonesia is just that geologically active. Indeed, Indonesia is one of the most volcanically active nations in the world. The islands that make up the nation are home to dozens of active volcanoes owing to its proximity the edge of tectonic plates. That can allow magma to seep up from deep in the Earth to the surface more readily. This isnt the first eruption weve seen in Indonesia recently. In February, Mount Sinabung in Sumatra popped off, sending an extremely ominous-looking ash cloud towering over the countryside. Last November, Mount Agung on Bali did its thing, too. Of course, having regular eruptions is one thing. Having one follow a tsunami that already has people on edge is quite another.","The Indonesian island of Sulawesi has become a natural disaster zone.

A century after she beame the first woman elected to the House of Commons, her portrait went on display there. It will be up until early October, to commemorate the anniversary of the acts of Parliament that allowed some women to vote and hold office. Despite her historic election, Countess Markievicz never took her seat, in keeping with the abstentionist policy of her party, Ireland’s Sinn Fein, which refused to swear an oath of allegiance to the king. Before she was elected, she had taken up the cause of women’s rights, labor and Irish nationalism. Her participation in the 1916 Easter Rising, an armed rebellion against British rule, led to a death sentence that was commuted because she was a woman.

Mark Kaufman,"A cluster of earthquakes hit Oklahoma over the past few days, unsettling thousands of the state's residents. As of 11 a.m. ET Monday the U.S. Geological Survey says that 2,274 people reported feeling a 4.3 magnitude quake Sunday night. There have been at least 16 noticeable earthquakes (above 2.5 in magnitude) observed by the Geologic Survey since Friday, April 6. While nerve-rattling, the quakes are normal for the area — at least since 2009. That's when the problematic quakes began, Jeremy Boak, Director of the Oklahoma Geological Survey, said in an interview. SEE ALSO: Hey, how about we helicopter grizzly bears into this remote National Park? ""It's not out of the ordinary,"" said Boak. ""In the frame of what’s been going on, it’s normal."" Oklahoma's dramatic rise in quakes has been stoked by oil and gas extraction activity in the region. This quake activity — associated with the ""fracking revolution"" that has also propelled historically high U.S. oil exports — comes in two forms. The first is fracking itself, an oil extraction process more formally known as ""hydraulic fracking."" Broadly, this means injecting millions of gallons of water, sand, and a small percentage of chemicals into a deeply-drilled hole. This breaks apart rocks to release oil deposits, sometimes creating earthquakes. But most Oklahoma quakes aren't caused by fracking itself, but by a secondary process called ""wastewater injection."" After water is used to fracture apart rocks thousands of feet below, it comes back up as ""wastewater,"" and is usually injected back into the ground nearby (the mixture has to go somewhere). Water is extremely heavy, so, this can put pressure on deep-lying faults. And if enough pressure is applied to these cracks in the Earth's crust, they'll rupture and move, causing sizeable quakes. While a U.S. Geologic Survey spokesperson said it's too early to officially confirm the cause of the northwestern Oklahoma earthquake burst, Boak said it's almost certainly due to wastewater injection. That's the common cause of quakes in this part of northwestern Oklahoma, and generally, has been the prevailing story for years. Earthquakes of 3.0 magnitude or higher measured in Oklahoma as of July 2017. Image: U.S. Geologic survey But, overall, earthquakes have been on the decline in Oklahoma since the especially rattling years of 2014, 2015, and 2016. The year 2015 saw nearly 900 quakes of 3.0 or higher in Oklahoma (around 2.5 or above is noticeable to most people). For perspective, before 2009, Oklahoma usually recorded one or two quakes of 3.0 magnitude or higher each year. By 2015, earthquake activity peaked for a time at around 4 and a half quakes each day, Boak previously said. But this year, Boak expects around 200 noticeable quakes to occur in Oklahoma. This recent cluster of quakes, then, is ""part of the continuing pattern which in general is declining,"" he said. There are two major reasons for the decline, said Boak. One is the falling price of oil. This means that oil and gas extraction isn't quite as lucrative as it once was a few years ago (it's a famously boom and bust industry). Accordingly, there's a bit less fracking activity. Oklahoma resident Lisa Griggs believes cracks in her home have been caused by Oklahoma's manmade earthquakes. Image: The Washington Post/Getty Images The second reason is mandatory state requirements that oil and gas companies find ways to reduce quaking. The rattled citizens of Oklahoma made quite clear to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which regulates the gas industry, that the quakes must stop — or at least be limited. ""We needed to shut this down and it actually appears to have worked,"" said Boak. Oil and gas companies accomplish this reduction in a variety of ways, which includes stopping wastewater injections when seismic activity begins. As for Boak, he has still yet to feel one of Oklahoma's big quakes — even though he studies them. He's too far south of most the activity, in the quieter confines of Norman, Oklahoma. ""I’ve never had the privilege of feeling one of the Oklahoma earthquakes,"" he said.","A cluster of earthquakes hit Oklahoma over the past few days, unsettling thousands of the state's residents.

"Ray Sanchez, Madeline Holcombe and Eliott C. McLaughlin, CNN","(CNN) More than 1,000 aftershocks of magnitude 1.5 or greater have shaken Alaska since Friday's big quak e knocked out power, ripped open roads and splintered buildings in Anchorage, US Geological Survey geophysicist Randy Baldwin said Sunday. The majority were of a magnitude of 2.5 or weaker, meaning they weren't likely felt. But more than 350 of the aftershocks were higher than 2.5, according to USGS data. Still, local officials said life was returning to normal after Friday's magnitude 7 earthquake, even as 4 to 8 inches of snow was expected Sunday. ""This is the second-largest earthquake we've had since 1964, which was a very significant earthquake,"" Anchorage Mayor Ethan Berkowitz told reporters Saturday, referring to the 9.2 quake that was the most powerful recorded in US history. ""In terms of a disaster, I think it says more about who we are than what we suffered,"" Berkowitz said. ""I would characterize this as a demonstration that Anchorage is prepared for these kind of emergencies."" Alaskans resilient to damage No fatalities or serious injuries were reported, officials said. In Alaska's largest city -- with a population of about 300,000 -- airports, hospitals, emergency services and most businesses were operating. ""The power is up. The heat is on. The communication lines are opening,"" said Anchorage Municipal Manager Bill Falsey. Most of the aftershocks have not rattled Alaskans. But 12 as of Sunday morning more powerful than 4.5 struck near Anchorage and Big Lake, the USGS says. A 5.2 aftershock about 11 p.m. Friday was the second-biggest since a 5.7 temblor hit minutes after the main quake, said Gavin Hayes, a research geophysicist with the USGS. ""That would have given people a shake and probably a bit of a scare given what they went through yesterday,"" he told CNN. The 7.0 earthquake sent residents scurrying for cover when it hit about 8:30 a.m. Friday. The quake was centered 10 miles northeast of Anchorage. ""The most striking thing about this event was that it was so close to Anchorage,"" Hayes said. ""That's why it has caused the damage that we're seeing."" The earthquake was not unusual for the region and probably wouldn't have received much attention had it not struck so close to town, he said. Roads buckled under passing cars and products tumbled from shelves. In court, panicked attorneys scurried under tables as a room rocked from side to side. ""It was very loud when it came,"" Berkowitz said Friday. ""It was very clear that this was something bigger than what we normally experience. We live in earthquake country... but this was a big one."" Palmer resident Kristin Dossett described the initial jolt as ""absolutely terrifying."" It was the biggest quake she has felt in her 37 years in a region where temblors are common, Dossett said. One aftershock moved her piano a foot and half from the wall. ""It just didn't stop. It kept going and got louder and louder, and things just fell everywhere everything off my dressers, off my bookcases, my kitchen cupboard. Just broken glass everywhere."" Philip Peterson was in a multistory building in downtown Anchorage as the structure swayed and coffee mugs fell from tables and tiles from the ceiling. ""I just jumped under my desk and had to ride it out,"" Peterson said. Authorities don't have firm figures on damage yet, though the Anchorage Police Department reported ""major infrastructure damage"" around the city. Helicopters and drones were assessing infrastructure across the region. There were no reports of missing people, authorities saidala. Alaska Regional Hospital and Providence Alaska Medical Center suffered damage but were able to keep emergency rooms open. The Anchorage School District canceled classes Monday and Tuesday to assess damage. Gov. Bill Walker has issued a disaster declaration. The 7.0 earthquake was felt up to 400 miles away, said state seismologist Michael West. He called it the most significant earthquake in Anchorage since 1964. CNN's Sheena Jones, Amanda Watts, Dakin Andone, Shawn Nottingham, Chuck Johnston, Keith Allen and Matthew Hilk contributed to this report.","More than 1,000 aftershocks of magnitude 1.5 or greater have shaken Alaska since Friday's big quake knocked out power, ripped open roads and splintered buildings in Anchorage, US Geological Survey geophysicist Randy Baldwin said Sunday.",2018-12-02T15:11:44Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","More than 1,000 aftershocks rock region after big quake in Alaska",https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/02/us/alaska-earthquake/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181130204949-11-alaska-earthquake-1130-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,earthquake,1
JOSE A. DEL REAL,"The whole house was shaking, you could see the floor rolling up and down, Anders Olmstead said. Different rooms in my house were going in different angles. I was pretty scared. Ive lived here my whole life. We kind of laugh off earthquakes in Alaska because youve been through so many, hundreds some of them you sleep through. Mr. Olmstead, 32, said the earthquake had knocked over his toddler daughter. He grabbed her and sheltered in place with her. He said he could hear the joints of his house snapping and things falling all around him. His house ended up being fine, he said. We got very lucky. Professor Yang said the damage around the city was definitely less than I would expect based on the intensity of the earthquake. He said the relative depth of the temblor, which struck nearly 30 miles below ground, helped mitigate its power. The citys main utilities were all up and running on Saturday, said Bill Falsey, the Anchorage municipal manager. But Mr. Falsey warned that repair work to the Glenn Highway, a major thruway in the region, could take a long time to complete. Mayor Ethan Berkowitz of Anchorage told city residents on Saturday morning that were in full recovery mode and on the road to returning to normal. Many businesses downtown remained closed, some marked with caution tape, awaiting safety inspectors to assess any structural damage. But in many shops, store managers were already taking stock of inventory. Families were cleaning up their homes, and building owners were meeting with engineers. Schools, according to officials, would remain closed until Tuesday. Still the shock had not quite warn off. Throughout the day, at coffee shops, at gas stations and on Facebook, residents continued to swap stories of confusion and alarm.","Life slowly returned to normal in the Alaskan city, where preparation and rigorous building codes may have saved it from more devastating losses.",2018-12-02T00:20:21Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Anchorage Earthquake Was Terrifying.

HENRY FOUNTAIN,"The tsunami that killed hundreds of people on Sumatra and Java in Indonesia late Saturday is a reminder that such destructive waves are not always caused by earthquakes.
This disaster, which struck without warning and killed at least 222 people and injured more than 800 others, appeared to have been caused by volcanic activity.
No earthquakes were recorded before the tsunami struck, the Indonesian authorities said. But there had been an eruption on the volcanic island of Anak Krakatau about half an hour before, they said, one of a series of eruptions there in recent weeks.
Tsunamis are created when large amounts of water in the ocean, a bay or even a lake are quickly displaced. In an earthquake, that displacement can occur when the ground moves as a fault breaks.
This was the mechanism by which a 9.1 magnitude earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, off Aceh Province in northern Indonesia, spawned large waves that traveled across the Indian Ocean and killed 250,000 people.
Many other tsunamis have also followed earthquakes, including those in September that devastated the city of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi after a 7.5 magnitude quake.
Volcanic activity creates tsunamis differently. One possibility is an explosive eruption, or general weakening of the flanks of a volcano by hot magma passing through it. Either way, part of the volcano perhaps, in the case of Anak Krakatau, a part that is underwater can collapse, creating a landslide that displaces water.
Another possible mechanism is the collapse of a magma chamber below the volcano as it empties during an eruption.
Volcano-related tsunamis are not uncommon. An eruption in 1792 in Japan created waves that were several hundred feet high. Landslides during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington spawned large waves in a lake nearby.
Perhaps the most famous volcanic disaster in history, the 1883 eruption of Krakatau, also called Krakatoa, triggered tsunamis that killed tens of thousands of people. (Anak Krakatau island was built up in place of Krakatau, which was obliterated in the 1883 event.)
Landslides hitting water can sometimes create huge waves. The largest wave ever recorded was caused by a landslide into Lituya Bay, in southeast Alaska, in July 1958. It followed an earthquake, not an eruption, but created a wave that wiped vegetation off the hillside on the opposite side of the bay.
A United States Geological Survey geologist, measuring the scouring marks, determined that the height of the wave had been more than 1,700 feet.","No earthquakes were recorded before the tsunami struck, the Indonesian authorities said.

Daniel Kolitz,"Earth might be looking a little worse for wear, after the last four-hundred years of reckless wide-scale resource extraction, but to its credit it hasn’t collapsed entirely. Despite our best efforts, it continues to gamely welcome our rapidly expanding population, barring the occasional earthquake. Whether the planet might be a little better off with fewer of us is a different question, a freighted one. We are not advocating for reducing the population. We like the population. We wish it well. What we are curious about, in this week’s Giz Asks, is what the planet’s population size would be in an ideal world. Have we blown past that number, or can we pack a few billion more in here before the whole thing falls apart? The economists, geographers, conservationists and population experts we spoke to were, with some exceptions, a bit more optimistic about the Earth’s capacity than you might expect—we might’ve blown past the “ideal” number some time ago, but if we can just stop or at least spend less time trying to murder the planet, we might have a while yet, in this place. Joe Bish Director of Issue Advocacy, Population Media Center (PMC) Just arriving at an educated guess at ideal human population oversimplifies the puzzle: because while population size sets the scale of human impact, it is not the sole determinant of the human relationship with Earth. Unlike other animals whose impact is generally limited by their appetites, humans have discretionary environmental impacts far and above our basic biological needs. This behavior is often lumped under the umbrella-phrase of “consumption”, but really includes an enormous number of resource extraction, production and consumptive decisions that occur around the clock, at a worldwide scale of 7.5+ billion people. Given all of the factors that go into humanity’s interactions with the natural world, we won’t assert that there is a magic number to which we should hue. Rather, we would choose to improve the dynamics that lead to a mind-boggling net addition 1.5 million people per week—9,000 more people each hour, and every hour, which the Earth must support. These factors include a lack of gender equality, poor or non-existent reproductive health services, lack of family planning information and services, and catastrophic lack of girls’ education in many parts of the world. No honestly informed person will dispute that biodiversity is already suffering horribly and in danger of systemic collapse. Improving the health, rights, and education of people already on the planet—and thereby working to slow down and stop population growth—is something we fully support for the health of every plant and animal species on the planet. Including our own. Carissa Véliz Research Fellow at the Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, University of Oxford Bent Flyvbjerg Professor at Säid Business School, University of Oxford From an anthropocentric perspective, to calculate the Earth’s ideal population size, one would first need to establish an ideal benchmark for what we think is a good life, and calculate the resources it takes to sustain that lifestyle. As a first approximation, let’s take the French lifestyle as a benchmark. According to the Global Footprint Network’s calculator, if all of humanity were to live like the French, we would need about 2.5 Earths to sustain that lifestyle. Any lifestyle that cannot be universalized to the rest of humanity cannot be just. Every newborn should be able to enjoy their fair share of the world’s resources. Thus, to ensure the ideal population size so that everyone could enjoy a comparable way of life, taking the French lifestyle as our benchmark, we would need to reduce the world population to about 3 billion people (4.6 billion less than today’s population). If, instead, we chose the lifestyle of people in the USA as the benchmark, then the world population would need to be reduced to 1.9 billion. It is unclear, however, that the American lifestyle is any better than the French, in terms of well-being. On the contrary: it looks like Europeans are faring better than Americans. In other words, it seems that Americans are less efficient in living well ecologically. What this shows is that comparable or superior levels of wellbeing may be achieved spending less resources. Presumably, however, there will be a minimum ecological footprint (resource expenditure) to achieve a level of wellbeing we could consider ideal. Apart from reducing the world’s population, there is a second way to bring about a situation in which all human beings could enjoy an equal share of the world’s resources: if we wanted to keep the world’s human inhabitants at the current 7.6 billion, then we would need to reduce our ecological footprints, and live like people in India, by either adopting a similar lifestyle or developing more ecological methods of sustaining our ways of life. As a species humans have come late—maybe too late—to the realization that the Earth’s ideal population size depends on lifestyle and ecological footprint, and that all three need to be managed wisely to avoid environmental Armageddon. That should not keep us from trying to get the balance right between population size and ecological footprint, needless to say. If we do this, we may just be lucky enough to avoid the fate of becoming the species that, from an ecological perspective, made its “ideal” population size zero. Bruce Newbold, PhD Professor of Geography at McMaster University and author of Population Geography: Tools and Issues. As the Earth’s population has grown, there has been a long-running debate and commentary on what the Earth’s optimal population size should be. Starting with Thomas Malthus in the 18th century, who wrote that population growth far outpaced the growth of the food supply, academics and commentators have debated whether the Earth can continue to support a growing population. In fact, Malthus was concerned that the world’s population—less than 1 billion at the time—was already too large. Despite such dire predictions, we have found new ways to feed and support its population. More than likely, we have already surpassed some optimal population size or threshold. The question, however, is bedeviled by other related questions. Should all of the world’s population have the same access in terms of quality and quantity to food? Should there be a more equitable standard of living? Will everyone have equal access to resources and equal opportunities? This is certainly not the case now, but determining the answers to these questions will determine how we answer whether there is an optimal population size. Erle C. Ellis Professor, Geography &amp; Environmental Systems, University of Maryland The question, “how many people can Earth support?” has been asked and answered many times. Antoni van Leeuwenhoek computed 13.4 billion in 1679. Cesare Marchetti proposed 10^12 (1,000 billion) in 1979. In 1994, Paul Ehrlich stated that “the present population of 5.5 billion... has clearly exceeded the capacity of Earth to sustain it.” Now, more than 7 billion people live on Earth and are generally better fed, healthier, and living longer than at any time in human history. Rates of population growth peaked in the 1970s as the result of the “demographic transition”, as more urbanized, better educated populations tend to have smaller families. Populations will most likely peak in 2100 at about 11 billion. Yet per capita human demands for food, water, energy and other environmental resources continue to grow, as wealthier populations make greater demands on Earth’s resources. The question of how many people Earth can support will continue to fascinate. But the most important question, to paraphrase demographer Joel Cohen, is “how do we humans want to live on planet Earth?” Do we want to transform the entire planet into engineered ecosystems designed to support only human beings- to live in towers, eating vat meat powered by massive nuclear energy systems? If so, 1012 [1,000 billion people] might actually be possible. If it were somehow possible to go back to living as hunter-gatherers, perhaps only a few 10’s of millions, or in pre-industrial agrarian societies, maybe a few billion could live on this planet. But these are just fantasies at this point in history. The real question for the Anthropocene is how to move our societies towards creating and sustaining thriving societies that sustain both healthy, happy people and a healthy non-human nature, leaving plenty of room for wild creatures to live and thrive in habitats free of human interference. Though no small change in direction would be needed, such a planet is achievable now, and can be even with 11 billion people. Human societies have emerged as a global force of nature. If, and only if, our societies make better futures their goal, and cooperate together in achieving this, will we create and sustain the societies and nonhuman natures that we and future generations will desire to live in. Paul R. Ehrlich Bing Professor of Population Studies and President of Center for Conservation Biology, Stanford University. Fellow, National Academy of Sciences and Royal Society; Crafoord Prize Laureate Our research group has concluded two decades ago that with foreseeable technologies an “optimum” population might be 1.5 to 2 billion people. The idea was that would be enough people to have big cities for those who like fine restaurants and opera, and few enough people to permit lots of wildlands for hunters and hermits. Overall, we thought that number might be long-term sustainable. Scientists have learned a lot more in the past decades about things like toxification of the planet, climate disruption, nuclear war, and so on that makes those numbers seem optimistic as the population races past 7.5 billion, economists still fail to realize that growth is the disease, not the cure for human problems, and the most powerful nation in the world is now governed by moronic thugs—working in any way they can to speed the coming collapse. John Hawks Vilas-Borghesi Distinguished Achievement Professor of Anthropology at the University of Wisconsin—Madison From an anthropological point of view, there really is no ideal population size. If we look at the world 20,000 years ago, our best estimates suggest fewer than 10 million people lived in the whole world at that time. For every one of those people 20,000 years ago, there are 1000 people today. The Earth 20,000 years ago could not support 7 billion people with Paleolithic lifeways. People invented new ways to get more food from the same space. People invented new ways to live in spaces where they couldn’t live before, and spread into every corner of the planet. All those changes were culture — without our culture, the world’s population today would be totally unsustainable. Now the question is whether we can continue to adapt our culture to accommodate larger populations. We didn’t always manage this. During most of the last 2 million years, there were several human species. The fact that they all survived for hundreds of thousands of years suggests that no one of them was pushing against the others very hard. Each of them must have been limited by resources, and probably their populations crashed when resources became limited. It’s only during the past hundred thousand years that our own species, Homo sapiens, started to grow in population size, and that may have been tied to cultural innovations in hunting or social organization. So today we’re still living the consequences of those changes 100,000 years ago, and we haven’t stopped yet. David Lam Director, Institute for Social Research, Professor of Economics, and Research Professor, Population Studies Center, University of Michigan For centuries people have tried to calculate some version of the Earth’s ideal population size, or to calculate the “carrying capacity” of the world. Like most economists, I have never been a big fan of the question itself or the ways in which it is answered. One reason for skepticism about both the question and the answers is that we are constantly developing technologies that drastically change our ability to turn resources into the things we consume. When the world reached 3 billion people in 1960 and was growing at over 2% per year (doubling in less than 40 years), there was widespread fear that we would have mass starvation in the following decades. We did not. World food production today is 3.5 times greater than it was in 1960, a 50% increase in food per person. Even in Africa, where population growth has been the fastest, food production per person is 14% higher today than in 1961. The proportion of the population in poverty has declined in every developing region in recent decades. Very few people would have predicted that the world could support 7 billion people at a higher standard of living in every region of the world than was the case with 3 billion people in 1960. So trying to estimate the ideal size or the maximum sustainable population from our current vantage point is unlikely to be a fruitful exercise. The world is projected to add another 4 billion people by 2100, with population probably leveling off soon after that at 11 or 12 billion people. Rapid fertility decline has caused population growth rates to decline everywhere. Africa will be the only region with positive population growth by around 2050, and even Africa’s population growth will probably be at low levels by 2100. Given the world’s ability to absorb the extra 4 billion people that were added between 1960 and 2011, with rising standards of living all over the world, I am optimistic that the world can add another 4 billion between 2011 and 2100, with standards of living continuing to improve. One of many caveats to this is that we must solve the problem of climate change, a challenge that cannot be minimized. But assuming that we do come up with solutions to climate change, a reasonable forecast is that world population will stabilize at about 12 billion people in a bit over 100 years, say in 2125. The demographic projections, tricky as they are, are much easier than economic projections. But given past experience, my forecast is that living standards in 2125 will be at least as high as they are today, and they will be sustainable over time. All of this leads me to conclude that 12 billion people sounds like a good number for the world. If 12 billion people is where the world is headed, and if those 12 billion are likely to have a reasonable and sustainable standard of living, I can’t think of an ethical or philosophical reason for thinking that the ideal population is anything less than 12 billion.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The 7.5-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit the eastern Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday is confirmed to have killed hundreds of people, the New York Times reported on Saturday, with at least 405 confirmed deaths in the city of Palu and the toll likely to rise much higher as search-and-rescue teams continue to arrive. Hundreds more are injured. The Times reported that the disaster leveled large swathes of the city in addition to nearby coastal communities, with thousands of structures destroyed. The precise number of dead may be difficult to determine, the paper added, as there were workers and security personnel present as preparations were underway for a beachside festival with dances and other performances, as well a high likelihood the tsunami pulled many people back into the ocean: The twin disasters a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, and the swirling wall of water it unleashed killed at least 405 people in Palu and destroyed thousands of buildings there, including a shopping mall, a hotel, seaside restaurants and several mosques. We have found corpses from the earthquake as well as bodies swept up by the tsunami, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, said in a television interview. Indonesian officials were preparing for a sharp rise in the death toll because search-and-rescue teams had yet to reach populous coastal settlements near Palu. Vice President Jusuf Kalla of Indonesia told a local news website that thousands may have died, with an unknown number washed out to sea. Kalla added that when the infamous Indian Ocean tsunami struck Aceh in northern Sumatra in 2004, a death toll initially indicated at 40 people eventually rose to over over 130,000 (estimates suggest at least 230,000 people died as a result of the disaster in total across 14 countries). Palu, a city of 300,000, may have also been particularly hard struck because emergency alert systems that could have warned of the tsunami were rendered useless by collapsing cell towers during the earthquake, the Times wrote. Indonesias meteorological and physics agency also lifted its own tsunami advisory little more than half an hour after the earthquake struck, though it has not yet been determined whether the waves were already hitting the coast by the time it chose to do so. The Washington Post reported that the nations emergency officials are investigating why many members of the public did not seem to have been properly alerted about the risk of the wave: Indonesian officials also may face another reckoning over why the tsunami alerts were pulled even as a disaster was roaring ashore, raising questions about the level of monitoring and post-quake analysis in a nation along some of the worlds most active fault lines. People were still going about their activities on the beach and did not immediately run, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesias National Disaster Management Agency, who said that hundreds were gathered in Palu for a beach party. The number of deaths, he said, will continue to rise as the search continues. The emergency response is being hindered by damaged or destroyed roads, ports, and communications lines, the Post added, as well as the number of personnel still deployed to the island of Lombok following another devastating 6.9-magnitude earthquake that killed over 450 in August. A 21-year-old air traffic controller at a regional airport, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, stayed at his post as other personnel evacuated, ensuring the takeoff of Batik Air Flight 6231. According to the Post, the plane had hundreds on board; the air traffic controller jumped from the tower to his death as its roof collapsed, while the pilot (identified by the Times as Ricosetta Mafella) posted a short video of the oncoming wave to Instagram. Thank God there is a voice (Holy Spirit i believe) telling me to depart early, he wrote. Im rushing the boarding process. Late by 30 second i would not have flown. Though Indonesia is in the Ring of Firea roughly 25,000-mile chain of volcanoes and other tectonic hot spots that stretches across the Pacific Ocean and plays host to 90 percent of the worlds earthquakes National Geographic reported that the tsunami was unexpected at this quake. It was recorded as the result of a strike-slip fault, during which tectonic plates grind against each other horizontally rather than vertically. Vertical displacement is more likely to cause a tsunami than horizontal movement of a fault. According to National Geographic, University of Oxford geophysicist Baptiste Gombert said that the regions geology is incredibly complex but initial signs are that landslides either above or below the water line played a role. Its also possible the waves were amplified by the shape of the bay as the tsunami forced water into the restricted space. Indonesias central statistics agency estimates that around 2.4 million people could be impacted by the disaster, according to the Times.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"After an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia on Friday left more than 800 people dead, a spokesperson for the nations board of national disaster affairs revealed that a critical part of its warning and detection system hasnt been working for years. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), said a network of 22 early-detection buoys havent been operational since 2012, Australias ABC News reported. The buoys, which communicate with seafloor sensors, are supposed to send tsunami warnings to the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics, but are now ineffective due to vandalism and a lack of funding, according to the report. The tide gauges are operating, but they are limited in providing any advance warning, Louise Comfort, a disaster management expert, told the Associated Press. None of the 22 buoys are functioning. In the Sulawesi incident, BMKG (the meteorology and geophysics agency) canceled the tsunami warning too soon, because it did not have data from Palu. This is the data the tsunami detection system could provide. BMKG reportedly sent out a tsunami warning on Friday evening after the earthquake, but lifted it 34 minutes later. Efforts to create better advance tsunami warning systems started after 230,00 people died in a 2004 tsunami, with a majority of those deaths occurring in Indonesia. The buoys were among those effortsGermany and the U.S. reportedly provided 12 of them. However, an earthquake that hit an Indonesian island in 2016 revealed that none of the buoys were working. The buoys have been stalled in a prototype phase for years, reportedly failing to receive the funding needed because of budget cuts and a failure for agencies to agree on project decisions. The buoys reportedly cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each on top of the funding needed to maintain their operations. Now we have no buoys in Indonesia, Iyan Turyana, an ocean engineer at BPPT, Indonesias Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology, told Phys.org in an article published in January 2017.

,"At a Glance The 7.3 quake was the largest to strike Venezuela since 1900. Buildings were evacuated Caracas, the capital city, The earthquake, felt throughout the Caribbean, happened at a considerable depth, which limited damage. A powerful earthquake shook eastern Venezuela on Tuesday afternoon, forcing residents in the captial city of Caracas to evacuate buildings to flee homes. The 7.3 quake – the largest to strike Venezuela since 1900, according to the U.S. Geological Survey – was felt throughout the Caribbean. But at a depth of some 76 miles (123 kilometers) it appeared to have caused only limited damage even near its epicenter a few miles off the sparsely populated Cariaco peninsula stretching into the eastern Caribbean. A similar-sized quake in the same area left dozens dead in 1997. Seismologist Lucy Jones, a research associate with the California Institute of Technology, said the earthquake’s considerable depth likely prevented a tragedy. “Shaking does die off at a distance,” she said, adding that the depth of the quake means there are likely to be fewer aftershocks. The quake was felt as far away as Colombia’s capital of Bogata. In Cumana, the biggest city near the quake’s center, supermarket shelves came crashing down. At a shopping center, a woman caught in the panic of people rushing out of the building fell on an escalator and injured herself. In Caracas, concrete fell from an unfinished office building. The quake also caused damage in Trinidad, which reported strong shaking. Power outages were reported across Trinidad, too. People ran into the street and gasped as large glass panes at one supermarket shattered and falling concrete smashed several cars. The quake also cracked walls and thousands of goods fell off supermarket shelves. No injuries or deaths were immediately reported. The earthquake also was felt in Guyana, Barbados and Grenada.","The Weather Channel Strong Quake Rocks Venezuela But Causes Little Damage. Why?

Rachel Becker,"The worst disaster in California’s history wasn’t an earthquake, or a fire, or a drought — it was a flood that killed thousands, wiped out mines and ranches, and submerged the state capital, Sacramento. For 43 days, starting in December 1861, California was inundated. Today, hardly anyone thinks about the floodwaters that turned California’s Central Valley into a vast lake — but it will happen again. “It’s not a question of if, but when,” writes seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones in her new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters H ave Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them). That’s why it’s key for us to know about the disasters in our history, so that we’re not doomed to repeat them on what will certainly be a much larger scale. After all, more than 100 times as many people now live in California as did during that deluge, Jones writes. “What’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities.” While natural hazards are inevitable, the destruction they wreak is not, Jones says in an interview with The Verge. “We can make choices about how we handle that — but we have to think ahead,” she says. Working at the US Geological Survey, Jones led a team of scientists who investigated the potential catastrophes in California’s future. One of them was a flood, and the team discovered that our existing flood control strategies would be no match for a deluge nearly the size of the one that started in 1861: The disaster would cause more devastation than an earthquake on the infamous San Andreas fault. After 33 years at the USGS, Jones retired and opened the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society, which aims to boost community resilience using science. In her book, she lays out catastrophic disasters in human history from the volcanic eruption that destroyed Pompeii to Hurricane Katrina to the Tohoku quake in Japan in 2011. She tells both the scientific story of how disasters unfolded, and the human story of the communities they struck. “We have to think ahead.” Her goal is to teach readers about disasters by drawing them in with narratives, and to address the ways human nature can make it harder to prepare for the future. Most of us assume a big disaster is going to be similar to smaller ones we’ve experienced, which can make us overconfident in our ability to deal with catastrophes — something experts call “normalization bias.” Our tendency to focus on more immediate threats can also come at the expense of preparing for more distant ones — which makes sense, Jones says: “If you worry about the 100-year flood and not about the wolf that’s about to eat your children, your DNA does not get passed down.” She draws on her experience as a scientist, and as a communicator who helped the public make sense of the destruction in the aftermath of earthquakes. The Verge spoke with Jones about natural hazards, risk assessment, and the disaster that haunts her. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. I grew up in California, and only learned about the 1861-1862 flood last year. How do you keep the memory of such a major disaster fresh, and make sure that people don’t forget that this could happen again? Photo by Helen Berger Dr. Lucy Jones It’s very difficult to do. In a natural world, if we hadn’t built all of our flood control systems, we would have smaller floods much more often. When you have the smaller ones, at least you know that flooding is a risk. But you do tend to believe that the risk is what you’ve already dealt with. So, paradoxically, the flood managers who were fully aware of the 1861 flood seemed more willing to say, ‘We’ve got it covered. That isn’t really going to happen again.” And, like with earthquakes, I find that the people were actually part of a response to Northridge, [ a quake that hit part of the Los Angeles area in 1994 ], are much more overconfident about their abilities to handle the really big one, because they feel like they dealt with the really big one. And that that wasn’t the really big one doesn’t get through. Hundreds of years ago, we didn’t have the information to be able to think ahead. Now we have more information, and yet we still struggle with the emotional aspect of it, because it doesn’t seem real to us. And that, right there, is the challenge of natural disasters. We know what they’re going to do, we know how to build to avoid the damage, but everything about human nature keeps us from looking forward [for] that really long-term planning. So it requires much more rational, logical thought, and reasoned discourse. So how do we now wrestle with the human inability to think ahead and also to remember the past? “Around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before.” Because of globalization and improved telecommunications, we now have a situation where a flood or a big disaster somewhere else in the world is something we can experience in real time. One of the most striking examples of that was the Tohoku earthquake in northern Japan [in 2011]. I’m sitting in my living room in California, and I can turn on the TV and watch in real time the tsunami wave. And we see the people fleeing from it, from the air. We don’t have enough to save them at this point, but we watch them in real time suffer through this. Now, around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before, I would say. Fifteen years ago, it was rare to find a person who knew what a tsunami was. But between the Indian Ocean event [in 2004], and Japan [in 2011], and the really direct, emotional experience with the power of telecommunications, we have a really different understanding and experience of it. And that is allowing us to overcome that normalization bias, and it’s part of the reason that we’ve been able to [make progress] here in Southern California [with] getting people to take the risk seriously and doing something about it. For us, it isn’t about tsunamis, it’s mostly about earthquakes. The book is divided by chapter into case studies of different disasters through history — which one kept you up at night? Which one haunted you? The 1927 Mississippi flood — the greatest flood disaster in American history. Mississippi is a huge river system that drains the majority of American states. A huge rainfall starting in the fall of 1926 through winter and spring led to failures of the levees protecting the land around the Mississippi river. And 27,000 square miles were flooded and over 1 million people were flooded out of their homes. Over 600,000 people were living in refugee camps. “What really haunted me... was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens.” But what really haunted me about it — and made it by far the most difficult chapter to research and write — was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens. What happened to African American victims of the flood was appalling, and just the inhumanity of how they were treated. The Kanto earthquake, which was only four years before that was also — in Japan — an equally horrible turning on neighbors. And it was recognizing that part of the human experience is the need to find a reason why it was the victim’s fault, to blame the victim: “Because if it was the victim’s fault, then I can protect myself by not making those same mistakes.” It’s a subconscious response to fear: “I don’t want that to be able to happen to me.” So you find reasons that it’s the victim’s fault. And at the worst level, you then punish the victim of the situation. So when you ask what haunted me, I’m an Earth scientist. So the physical part of it was all what I understood and expected going in. What haunted me, and inspired, was sometimes the horribleness of human response, and sometimes the real inspiration of human response. And you see both in those stories. The book talks about the disconnect between the language scientists use and the language the public use s to talk about disasters. Scientists have their wind speeds for hurricanes, magnitude for earthquake, probability for flood — then the public asks, “Was it The Big One?” How do we bridge that gap — and do we need to? “I just see people talking past each other so much.” The stuff I put in this book — none of it is really hard to understand. A high schooler could easily read the book and understand it, maybe even somebody younger. And yet we don’t teach it. And therefore, the public doesn’t have a context within which to be getting the information or having the discussion. So we need better education in science, which does not mean learning a bunch of facts — the other part is to understand how to think about science, the fundamentals of science as a process for learning what’s really true. We don’t teach that. But then we also need to help the scientists understand that people are looking for a mix: they want the science, but they also want the human side of it. And we need to help the scientists do a better job of being to answer the human questions. I just see people talking past each other so much. You write about how being a seismologist gives you an unusual perspective on time and that a forecast that a disaster will happen “‘sometime in the next millennium’ sounds not like an evasion, but like a threat.” How has this perspective shaped your own relationship with risk? Are you resigned to it, or have you bought every kind of disaster insurance there is? “The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but chances of it in my lifetime?” The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but the chances of it in my lifetime? Well, the San Andreas is probably going to have [an earthquake] in my lifetime, but the fault I live near probably isn’t. So yes, it’s a possibility, but I just have to keep it balanced because it’s a relatively low possibility compared to other things. People assume that where I live must be a place that’s really safe from earthquakes, but we moved to a community with really good schools sitting right on top of a significant fault. We were basically gambling that an earthquake wouldn’t happen before the kids got out of high school, and it worked. Climate change is going to make meteorological disasters more frequent and more devastating, right? What do we need to do to make sure that we’re prepared? It’s going to be very difficult. People do not sufficiently understand what we are doing to ourselves with this. We need to do everything we can to stop adding carbon to the atmosphere and reduce what’s already there if it’s at all possible. Because more heat in the atmosphere doesn’t just mean it’s warmer and ‘oh I guess I can handle that.’ That means more energy to drive storms, and they are going to be getting worse. “That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger.” So first off, we’ve got to admit it. We can’t talk about nuisance flooding, because high tide is bringing it into your house, without thinking about what that means when the hurricane comes through. One of the big issues in America is that we have a pretty strong tradition of individual land rights: nobody gets to tell you what to do with your own land. We are really struggling as a society to be able to make those big scale decisions. We need to be changing our attitudes about community, how much we share, to accept that we’re dependent on the decisions of others. We don’t like to do that as Americans either, we so prize our independence. So we philosophically oppose that, but that doesn’t change what’s going to happen. That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger. If there were one thing you wanted your reader to take home about this book, what is it? You have choices. That hazards are inevitable and the disaster is not. We as a society have choices, both what we do individually, but also a choice to work together. The thing that came out of it for me is that what’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities, and we can change that if we can work together as a community.","In the new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters have Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them),  seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones tells both the scientific story of disasters, and the human story of the communities they struck.",2018-05-26T13:00:02Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",The hardest part of preparing for disasters is overcoming human nature,https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/26/17321100/the-big-ones-natural-disasters-lucy-jones-earthquakes-hurricanes-volcanoes-floods,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MoH9Pj5-jHrX7PK8KOR706Ssf7I=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10780201/mdoying_180504_2512_0002.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,earthquake,1

Johnny Lieu,"After the shock of an earthquake, aftershocks can wreak serious havoc too. These subsequent quakes can last for weeks and months, and while scientists have developed models to try to detect their size and timing, figuring out where these aftershocks will hit is more difficult. In a study published in Nature by a team from Google and Harvard, deep learning was utilized to help predict where these aftershocks hit. SEE ALSO: Amid record-high STD rates, 'super gonorrhea' could be coming to a town near you The researchers trained a neural network on more than 131,000 mainshock–aftershock pairs, then selected unrelated 30,000 pairs for a test. In their test, they found that the artificial intelligence system was more reliable at detecting the locations of aftershocks than a widely-used model for predictions, known as the Coulomb failure stress change. The network also came up with an effective prediction metric that hadn't been popular in earthquake science, but rather in metallurgy, or the study of metals. ""There are three things you want to know about earthquakes — you want to know when they are going to occur, how big they're going to be and where they're going to be,"" Brendan Meade, Harvard's Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences, told ScienceDaily. ""Prior to this work we had empirical laws for when they would occur and how big they were going to be, and now we're working the third leg, where they might occur."" Meade came up with the idea of using artificially intelligent neural networks on aftershocks a few years ago. His next step is to try to predict the magnitude of earthquakes with the help of AI. ""I'm very excited for the potential for machine learning going forward with these kind of problems — it's a very important problem to go after,"" Phoebe DeVries, a co-author of the study, told ScienceDaily. ""Aftershock forecasting in particular is a challenge that's well-suited to machine learning because there are so many physical phenomena that could influence aftershock behavior and machine learning is extremely good at teasing out those relationships. I think we've really just scratched the surface of what could be done with aftershock forecasting... and that's really exciting."" While the system is still imprecise, and thus a long way off from being used officially, it's certainly a promising start.","After the shock of an earthquake, aftershocks can wreak serious havoc too.

Associated Press,"By MARI YAMAGUCHI and KEN MORITSUGU TOKYO (AP) — Residents in western Japan were cleaning up debris Monday evening after a powerful earthquake hit the area around Osaka, the country’s second-largest city, killing four people and injuring hundreds while knocking over walls and setting off fires. The magnitude 6.1 earthquake that struck the area early Monday damaged buildings and left many homes without water or gas. The quake also grounded flights in and out of Osaka and paralyzed traffic and commuter trains most of the day. By evening, bullet trains and some local trains had resumed operation, and stations were swollen with commuters trying to get home, many of them waiting in long lines. An exodus of commuters who chose to walk home filled sidewalks and bridges. Some commuters took refuge in nearby shelters instead of going home. NHK public television showed dozens of men wearing ties and carrying briefcases sitting on gym mats at a junior high school gymnasium in Ibaraki city, where some families also gathered. Takatsuki city confirmed another victim late Monday, as the death toll rose to four. City officials didn’t have details of the victim, but NHK and Kyodo News reported that an 81-year-old woman was found dead underneath a wardrobe that fell on her at her home in Takatsuki. Also in Takatsuki, a concrete wall at an elementary school fell onto the street, killing 9-year-old Rina Miyake as she walked to the school. NHK showed the collapsed upper half of the high wall, which was painted cheerfully with flowers, trees and blue sky and surrounded the school swimming pool. Mayor Takeshi Hamada apologized over her death because of the wall’s collapse. The city acknowledged that the wall did not meet building safety codes. The structure was old and made of concrete blocks — a known risk in earthquakes. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga ordered the Education Ministry to conduct nationwide safety checks of concrete block structures at public schools. More than 1,000 schools were closed in Osaka and nearby prefectures, Kyodo News reported. Wall cracks and other minor damage were found at several schools. A man in his 80s died in the collapse of a concrete wall in Osaka city. An 85-year-old man in nearby Ibaraki died after a bookcase fell on top of him at home, according to the disaster management agency. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said 307 people were treated for injuries at hospitals. Most of the injured were in Osaka. Osaka officials did not give details, but the injuries reported in Kyoto and three other neighboring prefectures were all minor. The quake struck shortly before 8 a.m. north of Osaka at a depth of about 13 kilometers (8 miles), the Japan Meteorological Agency said. The strongest shaking was north of Osaka, but the quake rattled large parts of western Japan, including Kyoto, the agency said. Dozens of domestic flights in and out of Osaka were grounded, while train and subway service in the Osaka area, including bullet trains, was suspended to check for damage. Passengers exited trains on the tracks between stations. Some subway service resumed in the afternoon, but stations remained crowded with passengers waiting for trains to restart, many of them sitting on the floor. Long lines of people waited to board bullet trains as they resumed operation. Some manufacturers, including automakers Daihatsu Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co., electronics makers Panasonic and Sharp Corp., and confectioners Ezaki Glico Co. and Meiji Co., temporarily stopped production lines at their factories in the region for safety checks, news reports said. The quake knocked over walls, broke windows and set off scattered building fires. It toppled furniture in homes and goods onto shop floors. It also cracked roads and broke water pipes, leaving homes without water. Many homes and buildings, including a major hospital, were temporarily without power, though electricity was restored at most places by midafternoon. Due to damage to underground gas lines, 110,000 homes in Takatsuki and Ibaraki cities were without gas, and repairs are expected to take as long as two weeks, according to Osaka Gas Co. More building damage was found in the afternoon as disaster and relief workers inspected and cleaned up the affected areas. Roofs and roof tiles at homes and at least one temple fell to the ground in Osaka. At a shrine in Kyoto, stone lanterns broke and collapsed to the ground. Defense troops joined rescue and relief operations in parts of Osaka, along with special vehicles to deliver clean drinking water. Residents cleaned up debris at home and stores throughout the day. Meteorological agency officials warned of strong aftershocks in the area, urging residents to stay away from damaged structures. The earthquake reminded many of the magnitude 7.3 Kobe quake in 1995 that killed more than 6,000 people in the region. Monday’s quake also followed a series of smaller quakes near Tokyo in recent weeks. Japan’s northern prefectures are still recovering from a magnitude 9.0 quake and tsunami in 2011 that killed more than 18,000. “It was not as bad as the Kobe quake,” said Jun Kawanami, a 30-year-old lawyer in Osaka.

Issie Lapowsky,"At least one person was killed and four others wounded following a shooting at YouTube's headquarters Tuesday afternoon. Four victims were being transported to local hospitals, though the extent of their injuries was unknown. San Bruno police say one woman was found with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and is believed to be the shooter. In a press conference Tuesday afternoon, San Bruno Police Chief Ed Barberini said police arrived at YouTube’s headquarters at 12:48 pm PT and found employees already fleeing the building. They encountered one victim outside the building, one near the entrance and two more at an adjacent businesses. San Francisco General Hospital spokesperson Brent Andrew told a local ABC affiliate that the hospital is treating a 36-year-old male in critical condition, a 32-year-old female in serious condition, and a 27-year-old female in fair condition. Reports of the shooting appeared on Twitter shortly before 1pm. The San Bruno Police Department urged people to stay away from YouTube's address at 901 Cherry Ave. Several YouTube employees also took to Twitter to recount what they had seen and heard. According to one account, workers barricaded themselves inside their office space. Another product manager described a rumbling coming from the floor that felt like an earthquake and saw blood in the hallway. Live footage showed police storming the building and YouTube employees filing out of the building with their hands up. Misinformation spread wildly on social media in the immediate aftermath of the shooting when reports of the shooter's identity were still unclear. The shooter was alternately described by some media as a 30-year-old white woman and by other eyewitness accounts as a man in full body armor.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Early this morning, NOAA’s National Tsunami Warning Center issued tsunami warnings for the south coast of Alaska and British Columbia, after a powerful, magnitude 7.9 earthquake rocked the Gulf of Alaska. Tsunami watches were issued for California, Oregon, and Washington State. A few hours later, all watches and warnings had been canceled, leading many Twitter users still-half asleep at their computers to wonder: Why is it so damn hard to predict a tsunami’s strength ahead of time? The reason has to do with the fact that the ocean is very large, and our earthquake and tsunami monitoring infrastructure is relatively limited. As geophysicist Mika McKinnon explained to Earther, a tsunami did arrive, and we predicted its timing pretty damn well. The thing that was—and always is—difficult to predict is the tsunami’s size. “It’s easy to predict when a tsunami will arrive, it is very difficult to predict how big it is going to be,” McKinnon said. “There is a tsunami right now, it just happens to be under a foot tall.” To understand why, it’s useful to start at the source of the event. Tsunamis are essentially massive ripples, emanating out from an area where water was displaced. Think throwing a stone in a pond, only now, the stone is a meteorite the size of a bus, or an undersea volcanic eruption. Or, in this case, a large earthquake. All of these events displace water, creating ripples. Trouble is, it’s very difficult to tell how much water. “How can you tell how the displacement of water was distributed?” McKinnon said. “You’re not going to be able to measure it in the open ocean, where the distance above background is a few inches over a few kilometers. You have to wait for the wave to come to shore and shoal,” the process by which tsunami waves bunch up on shore, the crest-to-crest distance becoming shorter as the height of the wave grows taller. That said, tsunami forecasters aren’t entirely in the dark. McKinnon explained that after an earthquake occurs, the event is thrown into a tsunami modeling system, which gives “a good estimate on travel time.” To determine if a tsunami wave is going to propagate widely, forecasters then turn to the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) network, a series of ocean buoys maintained by NOAA that detect the pressure of waves from a passing tsunami. “People regularly die at this stage in a tsunami.” A series of graphics tweeted out by the National Weather Service Tsunami Alert Center this morning show the location of those DART buoys relative to the recent quake, and predicted arrival times for the tsunami wave. Looking at the prediction maps tweeted out over the last few hours, you can see that arrival times don’t change very much—again, the speed of a tsunami, which depends largely on the depth of the ocean, is something we’re quite good at predicting: The final piece of the puzzle for understanding a tsunami event is tide gauges (those orange dots on the Tsunami Alert maps), which measure ocean surface displacement near the shore. It isn’t until we have that tide gauge data—plus any human observations—that we can really say how big the tsunami event is going to be. Tsunamis look different from the normal ebb and flow of the tide. As the National Weather Service explains, when they come ashore they move like a “fast-rising flood or a wall of water.” Another tell is if the water drains away suddenly, exposing the ocean floor and appearing like a very low tide. Powerful tsunamis that cause large changes to the water level can lead to flooding over a mile inland, according to the NWS. Sometimes, as was the case this morning, we get lucky and tsunami events are minor. But it’s important to note that even if a tsunami generates little flooding, it can still be deadly. Monster waves or no, tsunamis carry a lot of energy. Plus, the first wave isn’t necessarily the largest one, and depending on the bathymetry of the shoreline, waves can pile up and become bigger in certain locations. (Bays can funnel water in, causing waves to interfere constructively and get taller.) That’s where human reports are very useful, but in the case of this morning’s tsunami, such reports were few and far between. Fact of the matter is, there just aren’t that many people living on the south coast of Alaska. Given the complexity of the situation, McKinnon said it’s a good idea to stay out of the water for a few hours after a tsunami warning is lifted. “People regularly die at this stage in a tsunami,” McKinnon said. “They get in the water because it looks like a normal surf, and there are really intense currents and they die.”","Early this morning, NOAA’s National Tsunami Warning Center issued tsunami warnings for the south coast of Alaska and British Columbia, after a powerful, magnitude 7.9 earthquake rocked the Gulf of Alaska.

,"At a Glance At least 1,234 people were killed on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake. Officials fear the death toll will continue to jump, with several coastal towns still cut off. The quake also triggered a tsunami, according to Indonesia's geophysics agency. At a press conference, Indonesian officials announced Tuesday that the death toll had increased to 1,234 from a devastating earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi, and about 800 others were severely injured. Rescue officials worried that the extent of the disaster could escalate even further with several large coastal towns still isolated because of damaged roads and downed communication lines. The country's disaster agency said nearly all of the victims were from the devastated city of Palu on Sulawesi. ""The death toll is believed to increase further since many bodies were still under the wreckage, while many have not been reached,"" said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. A mass burial for more than 500 bodies was held Sunday for health and religious reasons; the majority of Palu's inhabitants are Muslim. Late Monday night, there was some good news: crews were able to rescue a 38-year-old man trapped for three days under the rubble of a collapsed building in Palu. The survivor, identified as Sapri Nusin, was conscious as he was seen on Indonesian TV being rescued. Hundreds are still waiting to be evacuated from Palu as concerns about food and fuel shortages mount. ""We feel like we are stepchildren here because all the help is going to Palu,"" said Mohamad Taufik, 38, from the town of Donggala, who said five of his relatives are still missing. ""There are many young children here who are hungry and sick, but there is no milk or medicine."" Along the coast, the tsunami, which reportedly reached as high as 6 meters (nearly 20 feet) in some places, shattered buildings, uprooted concrete and thrust houses and boats tens of meters inland. Nugroho said more people remain trapped in Sigi and Balaroa, meaning the toll is likely to rise. More aid was being distributed, he added, but ""we still need more time to take care of all the problems.""

Rescuers try to pull 15-year old earthquake victim Nurul Istikharah from her damaged house Sunday, Sept. 30, 2018, in Palu, Indonesia. (AP Photo/Arimacs Wilander) A special aircraft carrying more than 3,000 gallons of fuel had arrived and trucks with food were on the way with police escorts to guard against looters. Nugroho said many gas stations were inoperable either because of quake damage or from people stealing fuel. Desperation was visible in Palu. Signs propped along roads read ""We Need Food"" and ""We Need Support,"" while children begged for cash in the streets and long lines of cars snarled traffic as people waited for gas. Teams were searching for trapped survivors under destroyed homes and buildings, including a collapsed eight-story hotel in Palu, but they needed more heavy equipment to clear the rubble. Nearly 62,000 people have been displaced from their homes, Nugroho said. Many people were believed trapped under shattered houses in the Palu neighbourhood of Balaroa, where the earthquake caused the ground to heave up and down violently. ""I and about 50 other people in Balaroa were able to save ourselves by riding on a mound of soil which was getting higher and higher,"" resident Siti Hajat told MetroTV, adding that her house was destroyed. Nugroho said generators, heavy equipment and tents are among the most-needed aid items. The countries that offered assistance include the United States and China, he said. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Tuesday that his government has given $360,000 to help victims and is in talks with Indonesian authorities about the second round of aid. The initial funds are to go to the Indonesian Red Cross for the most obvious emergency aid needs, such as tarpaulins. The coastline at Palu was strewn with rubble and a few brightly coloured cargo containers poking out of the water. Buildings near the water were ruined shells. The arches of a large yellow bridge rested in the water and eerie drone video showed a Ferris wheel, untouched, on a beach scraped bare by the waves. Indonesia is frequently struck by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. A powerful quake on the island of Lombok killed 505 people in August, and two moderate quakes near an eastern island on Tuesday reportedly damaged a bridge. The vast archipelago is home to 260 million people on more than 17,000 islands that stretch a distance similar to that between New York and London. Roads and infrastructure are poor in many areas, making access difficult in the best of conditions.","The Weather Channel A Desperate Search for Survivors as the Earthquake, Tsunami Claims 1234 Lives in Indonesia The Weather Channel At least 1,234 people were killed on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.

Scott K. Johnson,"Enlarge / Map of shaking intensity around the epicenter of the September 8, 2017 magnitude 8.2 earthquake. reader comments 2 September 2017 saw a pair of weird earthquakes in Mexico. A magnitude 8.2 on September 8 just offshore the state of Chiapas was followed by a magnitude 7.1 on September 19this time much closer to Mexico City, causing considerable destruction there. While the two earthquakes were not connected, they were the same type of earthquake, which is unusual in the region. Mexicos western coast is a tectonic plate boundary, where the Pacific plate collides with and dives beneath the continent. That means that earthquakes along that boundary are typically the result of compressive force that squeezes rock to slide up the plane of the fault. Both September earthquakes were the result of stretching, however, which is almost as much of a head-scratcher as finding that part of your cars engine was pulled apart during a head-on crash. The explanation here is that as the oceanic plate disappears beneath the continent, it sinks downward into the mantle. First of all, the bending of the plate downward causes stretching, just as the skin over your elbow has to stretch. Second, the sinking plate pulls downward as it hangs from the part of the plate that is still up at the surfaceanother stretching force. Occasional earthquakes within this bending, sinking plate can reflect that stretching. A new study led by the University of Oregons Diego Malgar found something even weirder, though. Counter to what we thought possible, the fault seems to have broken clean through the entire tectonic plate. The tectonic plate boundary known as a subduction zone, where an oceanic plate dives down beneath another plate. The shaking recorded at seismometers can be used to pinpoint the location of an earthquake, but more detail can be extracted if you have things like GPS sensors in the area detecting ground movement. Seismologists can model the process backward from the measured surface movement and figure out how the fault moved underground. Thats what Malgar and his colleagues did here, producing estimates of the portion of the fault plane that slipped and how much it moved. The results show that a 150km-long section of the fault slipped three meters or so. Vertically, the portion of the fault that slipped starts at the top of the oceanic plateabout 15km below the Earths surfaceand continues all the way down to a depth of about 80km, which is roughly the bottom of the plate. The movement started at a spot about 46km down and spread outward along the plane of the fault from there. The equations for the physics of all this tell us that the fault movement should have been restricted to the upper half of the oceanic plate. This is partly because hotter temperatures at greater depths make the rock less brittle and partly because the inside of the bend in the plate should be feeling squeezing rather than stretching. Look around to make sure no ones watching, and then stare at your elbow. As you bend it, the skin stretches around the outside of your elbow, but relaxes on the inside as your forearm and bicep come together. Similarly, faults moving because theyre being pulled apart on the outside of the bend should be clamped together on the inside of the bend. So why did this earthquake break the rules? The researchers say a couple additional factors must be at play. First, seawater percolating down into the cracks that formed as the oceanic plate first bent to head beneath the continent could have cooled the rock and reacted with minerals, making the rock more brittle than it would be otherwise. And second, the sinking portion of the oceanic plate must be pulling downward pretty hard. Lets not pull on your wrist hard enough to stretch your elbow joint, but doing so would counteract the squeezing on the inside of your elbow as it bends. Explaining this little puzzle has practical implications. Not only do these earthquakes produce dangerous shaking, but if they occur close enough to the point on the seafloor where the two plates meet, they can push up seawater and create a tsunami wave. Understanding Mexicos hazards requires understanding what these oddball earthquakes are capable of. Since the plates there seem to break rules followed by plate boundaries elsewhere around the world, the local rules need to be better understood. Protecting people during earthquakes is all about minimizing surprises, so while they are always interesting, we want to limit the earthquakes that make you go ""Huh."" Nature Geoscience, 2018.

According to USGS, the earthquake originated 20 km (12.5 miles) southwest of Sarpol-e Zahab, in the Kermanshah Province of Iran close to the Iraq border. Sunday's earthquake struck near Sarpol-e Zahab in Irans Kermanshah province, located close to the Iran-Iraq border. Business Insider/Google Maps The quake struck at a shallow depth of 10 km (6.2 miles) at around 8:00 p.m. local time. Shallow earthquakes can often cause more broad damage. Tremors were felt as far away as the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. Hundreds of people have been reported injured in the quake. According to the Associated Press, over 500 people were injured. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported 387 injured, most of them minor. All schools and universities in the region were closed on Monday, IRNA said. Roads were temporarily closed and electricity was affected by the quake but they appeared to be back in order by Sunday evening. Dozens of rescue teams were dispatched to the area, authorities said. Several army units were also called in to assist in rescue efforts. Iran sits along major fault lines and experiences earthquakes on a near daily basis. The location of Sunday's quake, Sarpol-e Zahab, was hit with a major 7.3 earthquake last year that killed more than 600 people and left thousands injured and homeless.

Don Sweeney,"A light earthquake shook Southern California early Thursday, marking the latest in a burst of seismic and volcanic activity along the Ring of Fire. The 4.0-magnitude quake took place just after 2 a.m. about 31 miles southeast of Anaheim, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It follows a 6.2-magnitude quake in Japan on Wednesday and a 7.9-magnitude quake in Alaska on Tuesday that prompted a quickly canceled tsunami warning for the West Coast. Significant earthquakes in Indonesia and Chile also have been reported this week. In addition, volcanic eruptions in the Philippines, Indonesia, Bali and Japan continue to spew ash and lava, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people. The eruption Tuesday of Mount Kusatsu-Shirane in Japan killed a soldier and injured more than a dozen people, including several at a nearby ski resort. The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction on Tuesday tweeted a warning that the Ring of Fire was “active.” What is the Ring of Fire? The Ring of Fire refers to a sprawling, horseshoe-shaped geological disaster zone in the Pacific, according to ABC News. The ring stretches 25,000 miles from New Zealand through Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan to Alaska, Canada and the West Coast down to South America. It contains 452 volcanoes and several tectonic plates in the earth’s crust. Fitting together like a puzzle, the tectonic plates constantly shift and collide, producing earthquakes. Scientists say the recent series of quakes and volcanic eruptions are merely business as usual for the Ring of Fire. “It just so happens that these events are occurring at the same time in different parts of the region,” Chris Elders, a geology expert from Curtin University in Australia, told the BBC. “There’s not necessarily a relationship between them.” Janine Krippner, a New Zealand volcanologist based in the United States, reminded people that “It’s not referred to as the ‘ring of fire’ because it sits there doing nothing.” Krippner told the BBC that while satellite imagery and the internet have made people around the world more aware of eruptions and seismic activity, that doesn’t mean they’ve actually become more common.","Washington Times Another quake rattles the West Coast.

"Sarah Rahal, Mark Hicks","Amherstburg is east of Grosse Ile. (Photo: USGS) A small earthquake rattled parts of Ontario and southeast Michigan on Thursday night and sent startled residents outside and online looking for answers. A magnitude 3.6 quake originated near Amherstburg, Ontario, just across the Detroit River, about 15.5 miles south of Detroit, according to the United States Geological Survey, and was felt at least 40 miles away in parts of Downriver and Dearborn. After the rumbles radiated across the region, those who felt it posted reaction on social media and websites, some saying they thought it was lightning, an explosion or a crash on an interstate. “It was so weird &amp; scary!” one user wrote on Twitter. “I heard a boom noise and then 3 seconds later I felt a tremor beneath my feet.” The temblor occurred about 8 p.m., said Ian Lee, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “They’re relatively rare, but it’s not the first time there’s been an earthquake in the area,” Lee said. The last earthquake that struck Michigan — not counting the 2.0 quake that followed a meteor strike in Metro Detroit in January — was a 4.0 in Galesburg, near Kalamazoo on May 2, 2015, he said. The USGS considers 3-3.9 a minor earthquake, “felt quite noticeably by persons indoors, especially on upper floors of buildings,” according to its website. “Many people do not recognize it as an earthquake. Standing motor cars may rock slightly. Vibrations similar to the passing of a truck.” Soon after the first trembling began, comments on CSEM-EMSC, an independent scientific organization and provider of real-time earthquake warnings, flooded the site. “It was loud like thunder that kept rumbling not a lot of shaking just vibrating,” said a post from Amherstburg. “Very loud, dogs freaked. Lasted maybe 30 seconds total,” said another post. Remarks from Woodhaven said residents felt the quake in their homes. Residents from Trenton reported shaking for 30 seconds. “I’ve been in a few Earthquakes from the Michigan fault line,” another post said. “This one felt different. We could hear it coming, before we felt it, which I don’t ever remember hearing before. Wife actually commented: “What’s that noise?”... then we felt the tremor go through the house.” The relative rarity of a quake alarmed many area residents. One user likened the shaking to feeling “like someone hit the store with a truck.” Another wondered if the rumbles came from the Fermi 2 nuclear power plant in southeast Michigan. “The epicenter was a few KM from our house,” the user tweeted. “Very sharp and loud initial Bang. Followed by a minute or two of low booms and rumbles. Thought Fermi 2 blew up.” The Monroe County plant is run by DTE Energy Co. The facility was not affected by the temblor, said Je’well Pearson, a utility spokeswoman. “It’s all quiet over here.” Thursday’s heaving was the second uncommon disturbance to ripple through southeast Michigan in 2018. The meteor hit Earth around 8:10 p.m. Jan. 16, sparking a 2.0 magnitude earthquake in the Detroit area, the USGS reported. Meteorite hunters soon went on a spree to find pieces of the fireball. srahal@detroitnews.com Read or Share this story: https://detne.ws/2vw7OT6","The Detroit News Magnitude 3.6 earthquake hits near Windsor The Detroit News A magnitude 3.6 earthquake rattled parts of Ontario and Downriver in Michigan on Thursday night, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

But despite the massive earthquake, there were no fatalities, no widespread injuries, and no buildings that collapsed.

Steve Dent,"The image above depicts a LiDAR relative elevation model (REM), showing current and previous channels carved out by the Sauk River in Washington State's Skagit and Snohomish counties. In the regular satellite image below, however, only the active, vegetation-free channels are clearly visible -- a striking display of what the technique can reveal. ""REMs are extremely useful in discerning where river channels have migrated in the past by vividly displaying fluvial features such as meander scars, terraces, and oxbow lakes,"" explains Washington State geologist Daniel E. Coe in a PDF. ""This type of information is very informative in channel migration and flood studies, as well as a host of other engineering and habitat assessments."" Carried on special aircraft, LiDAR produces visible-light laser beams. While much of it bounces off of trees and vegetation, enough make it through to the ground. By examining the raw data to see which beams travel the farthest, scientists can ""edit out"" trees, vegetation and man-made structures. That reveals hidden seismic faults, glacial landforms, landslides, lava flows and other features that are invisible on a regular satellite photo. Used in this way, the images also become a fantastic educational tool. Understanding things like drumlins, moraines and kettles can be pretty tough, but seeing a landform stripped to the bare ground brings the concepts to life. Suddenly, it becomes much easier to visualize how glaciers, lava flow (above), tsunamis and other natural phenomena have scarred (and will scar) our planet's surface over time. Considering that they're made by scientific instruments, the LiDAR images also happen to be beautiful (seriously, check them out ). You could even say that like other types of art, they strip away the surface to show things we may not want to see. A great example is the Toe Jam Hill fault scarp (part of the Seattle fault zone), first revealed by a LiDAR scan in the '90s. Subsequent trenching showed that it was the site of a single large earthquake 1,100 years ago, part of the great Seattle subduction quake at around 900 AD. That seismic event has become a part of the oral history and legend of Coast Salish Native Americans in the region, and is an ongoing concern to folks in Washington's Puget Sound area. LiDAR has become an important tool in confirming ancient stories, while helping us learn about future ones -- hopefully before they happen.","LiDAR is having a moment right now helping self-driving cars and robots not hit things, but don't forget about what else it can do.

,"At a Glance A powerful earthquake has left three dead in Osaka, Japan, on Monday. The quake knocked over concrete walls and ignited scattered building fires. Dozens of domestic flights in and out of Osaka were grounded, while train and subway services were suspended. At least three people are dead and more than 300 have been injured after a strong earthquake knocked over walls and ignited scattered fires around metropolitan Osaka in Western Japan on Monday. A falling concrete wall at a school killed a 9-year-old girl during the 5.3 magnitude quake. The other two fatalities were both men in their 80s. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said 214 people were treated for injuries at hospitals. Most of the injured were in Osaka – Japan’s No. 2 city bustling with businesses. Osaka officials did not give details, but the injuries reported in Kyoto and three other neighboring prefectures were all minor. The Osaka prefectural government’s disaster management department confirmed the girl’s death and the death of an older man. The third victim died in the nearby city of Ibaraki. (MORE: Major Flash Flooding in Upper Michigan, Northern Wisconsin, Northern Minnesota ) A falling concrete wall knocked down Rina Miyake as she walked by at her elementary school in Takatsuki. NHK public television aired footage showing the collapsed upper half of the high wall, which was cheerfully painted with trees, flowers and blue sky and surrounded the school swimming pool. Takatsuki Mayor Takeshi Hamada apologized over her death because of the wall’s collapse. The structure was old and made of concrete blocks – a known risk in earthquakes. A man in his 80s died in the collapse of a concrete wall in Osaka city. An 84-year-old man in nearby Ibaraki died after a bookshelf fell on top of him at home, according to city officials. Many homes and buildings, including a major hospital, were temporarily without power, though electricity was restored at most places by midafternoon. The earthquake struck around 8 a.m. north of Osaka at a depth of about 9 miles, the United States Geological Survey said. The strongest shaking was north of Osaka, but the quake rattled large parts of western Japan, including Kyoto. The quake knocked over walls, broke windows and set off scattered building fires. It toppled bookshelves in homes and scattered goods on shop floors. It also cracked roads and broke water pipes, leaving homes without water. The morning commute was disrupted, as dozens of domestic flights in and out of Osaka were grounded, while train and subway service in the Osaka area including the bullet train were suspended to check for damage. Passengers were seen exiting trains on the tracks between stations. Some subway services started to resume in the afternoon. The earthquake reminded many in Japan of the magnitude 7.3 Hanshin-Kobe quake in 1995 that killed more than 6,000 in the region. Monday’s quake also followed a series of smaller quakes near Tokyo in recent weeks. A 30-year-old lawyer Jun Kawasaki said the quake reminded him of the Kobe quake 23 years ago, and started packing up immediately to run away. “It was not as bad as the Kobe quake,” he told the Associated Press from Osaka. His girlfriend ducked down under the table. Elevators in his office building were out of operation. “I used the stairs but I was out of breath by the time I arrived at my office on the 20th floor.”","The Weather Channel Japan Earthquake Kills 3, Injures More Than 300 The Weather Channel Dozens of domestic flights in and out of Osaka were grounded, while train and subway services were suspended.

Communication blackouts and blocked roads are hampering rescue efforts as Papua New Guinea works to get a better grasp of the damage wrought by a massive earthquake amid fears of its economic impact. Melvin Levongo/AFP/Getty Images Days after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the interior of Papua New Guinea, the death toll is continuing to rise as rescue workers strive to reach isolated communities despite blocked and damaged roads. Officials said that at least 31 people were killed by the quake and subsequent landslides, more than double the initial reports, and that the toll is expected to rise further, Reuters reported on Thursday. The wire service continued: ""Remote hamlets closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake in the Southern Highlands were buried, killing 13 people, said James Justin, a research officer at the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy in Port Moresby in an email, citing a two-way radio call from a mission station in the region. ""Most of the other confirmed fatalities were in or around the provincial capital of Mendi and the town of Tari 40 km (25 miles) from the epicenter, where aftershocks continue to be felt and people afraid their homes may yet collapse have been sleeping in their yards. "" 'Tari is completely shut down,' Mark Mendai, head of the district's Development Authority told Reuters by phone."" As NPR previously reported, the quake was followed by a number of aftershocks and landslides, and damage to phone lines made it difficult to immediately assess the scale of the disaster. Now blocked roads and cracked runways are continuing to hamper efforts to bring aid to affected communities. Damage to a road near Mendi in Papua New Guinea's highlands region, is shown on Feb. 27. Melvin Levongo/AFP/Getty Images ""Rescuers are still trying to reach some of the hardest-hit areas in the rugged and mountainous highland region of the Pacific nation,"" Michael Sullivan reported for NPR on Wednesday. There are concerns about the earthquake's economic impact as well as the human toll. Oil and gas production has been halted at several facilities, and work at coffee plantations and a gold mine has also been interrupted, The Associated Press reports. On Wednesday, the AP spoke to Southern Highlands Governor William Powi, who described the situation in dire terms: "" 'We are looking at massive, catastrophic havoc and destruction,' Powi said.... "" 'There are people who are traumatized, people in terrible devastation who have never felt this kind of destruction before,' Powi said. 'It has really brought a lot of fear into people's lives.... "" 'We need massive assistance... We need food, infrastructure maintenance, and to bring comfort to our people who are homeless and displaced.'

Noah Feit,"With the possibility of a winter storm bringing chilly temperatures and more severe weather to South Carolina this week, one state agency is warning residents to prepare. A worst-case scenario is being presented by the S.C. Emergency Management Division. It is urging people to get ready for this storm, and more that could follow this winter by stocking up on supplies that could be needed should snow or ice line the roads. Two popular items mentioned before any storm hits were not on the SCEMDs list milk and bread. In fact, it said skip both. Bread and milk shouldnt be on your list, SCEMD posted on Facebook. One person commented on the post that French Toast Season is upon us, because of the hysteria of people emptying store shelves of bread and milk that has become a punchline before many significant weather events. In spite of the jokes, the SCEMD has a real list of items to stockpile at home and work in case of a winter storm. It includes: A flashlight and extra batteries Battery-powered NOAA weather radio and portable radio to receive emergency information. These may be your only links to the outside Extra food and water. High-energy food, such as dried fruit or candy, and food requiring no cooking or refrigeration is best Extra medicine and baby items First-aid supplies Heating fuel. Fuel carriers may not reach you for days after a severe winter storm Emergency heating source, such as a fireplace, wood stove, space heater, etc. Learn to use properly to prevent a fire, and be sure to have proper ventilation Fire extinguisher and smoke detector. Test your units regularly to ensure they are working properly The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had a similar list, but some key items it included were cell phone, portable charger, and extra batteries in addition to extra blankets, sleeping bags, and warm winter coats. These could all prove critical if the storm causes a loss of heat, power, telephone service, the SCEMD reported. The potential for bad weather in S.C. is most likely on Saturday and Sunday. In Columbia, the forecast calls for temperatures in the low 40s to high 30s with an 80 to 90 percent chance of precipitation Saturday, followed by colder temperatures but slightly less chance of precipitation Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. Snow is not expected in the Midlands. The forecast is similar in Greenville and across the Upstate, while Charleston and the Lowcounty are predicted to have heavy precipitation but higher temperatures over the weekend, the NWS reported. Nothing can stop the storm from coming, and that means social media will be littered with posts making fun of the rush for milk and bread.","The State Stocking up on bread and milk before the storm?

,"At a Glance A 7.5 magnitude earthquake occurred Friday evening local time on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The quake triggered a tsunami, according to Indonesia's geophysics agency. A 6.1 magnitude foreshock struck earlier in the day, killing at least one person. A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi Friday evening just hours after a powerful, deadly foreshock, apparently triggered a tsunami that hit the coast minutes later. The main tremor struck at 6:02 p.m. local time Friday evening (6:02 a.m. EDT) about 35 miles northeast of Donggala, Indonesia a town of about 300,000 according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Shortly after, a tsunami warning was issued by Indonesia's geophysics agency, then lifted. It's believed the tsunami, confirmed by local agencies to be up to 10 feet tall, struck Donggala and Palu, a coastal town of about 330,000 after the alert was cancelled. Hary Tirto Djatmiko, a spokesman for the agency, confirmed to the Associated Press that a tsunami occurred and more information would be released once it was gathered. ""Based on historical data and tsunami modelling, this earthquake is not capable of generating a tsunami affecting the Indian Ocean region,"" said the Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysical Agency of Indonesia. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency, told a local TV station that houses were carried away by the tsunami and families were missing, but darkness hindered the search Friday night. ""The situation is chaotic, people are running on the streets and buildings collapsed. There is a ship washed ashore,"" Dwikorita Karnawati, head of Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency, told BBC.com. There were at least 10 foreshocks and aftershocks recorded at magnitude 5 or stronger on Friday. The main quake was relatively shallow in preliminary observations just 6.2 miles deep, according to the USGS. Earlier Friday, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake killed one person, injured several others and damaged dozens of homes, according to the AP. ""It happened while we still have difficulties in collecting data from nine villages affected by the first quake,"" an official with Akris, the local disaster agency, told the AP. ""People ran out in panic."" The tremors came a month after a large earthquake killed as many as 500 on the island of Lombok, southwest of Sulawesi.

,"At a Glance A powerful 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck Indonesia Sunday evening local time. At least 82 people have been killed, the Associated Press reported. The earthquake was centered in a similar spot as a deadly quake one week ago. A powerful earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok on Sunday, killing at least 82 people and shaking neighboring Bali, one week after another quake on Lombok killed more than a dozen. The latest quake, which triggered a brief tsunami warning, damaged buildings as far away as Denpasar on Bali, including a department store and the airport terminal, where ceiling panels were shaken loose, authorities said. Video showed screaming people running in panic from houses in a Bali neighborhood and vehicles rocking. On Lombok, soldiers and other rescuers carried injured people on stretchers and carpets to an evacuation center. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said the death toll had risen 82 with hundreds others were injured. Earlier officials said at least 39 people had died. A total of 65 of the deaths were in North Lombok district, nine in West Lombok district, four in the provincial capital Mataram and two each in Central Lombok and East Lombok districts, Nugroho said. Thousands of houses were damaged, and most of the dead victims were hit by collapsed houses, Nugroho said. The quake, recorded at magnitude 6.9 by the U.S. Geological Survey, struck at 6:46 p.m. Sunday evening local time in the northern part of Lombok. Strong aftershocks ranging from 5.4- to 4.3-magnitude followed the main quake, the USGS said. ""I was watching TV when I felt a big shake,"" said Harian, a Lombok woman who uses one name. ""The lamp was shaking, and people were shouting 'Get out.' I ran out into the dark because the power cut off."" A tsunami warning was lifted after waves just 6 inches high were recorded in three villages, said Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency. The quake was felt strongly across Lombok and Bali and had damaged houses on both islands, Nugroho said. Frightened people poured out of their homes to move to higher ground, particularly in North Lombok and Mataram, the capital of West Nusa Tenggara province, said Iwan Asmara, a Lombok disaster official. Indonesian soldiers tend to a woman injured in the earthquake at a makeshift hospital in Lombok, Indonesia, Sunday, Aug. 5, 2018. A strong earthquake struck Indonesia's popular tourist island of Lombok on Sunday, triggering a tsunami warning, one week after another quake in the same area killed more than a dozen people. (AP Photo) The Bali and Lombok airports continued operating Sunday night, according to the director general of civil aviation. There had been a half-hour evacuation at the Lombok airport following the quake because the electricity went off. TV showed crying women consoling each other outside Lombok's airport. The island was already reeling from a magnitude 6.4 quake on July 29, which killed 16 people. Like Bali, Lombok is known for pristine beaches and mountains. Hotels and other buildings in both locations are not allowed to exceed the height of coconut trees. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. In December 2004, a massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries.

Rosie Perper,"Three people have died and four more have been injured following a strong earthquake off the cost of Indonesia's popular holiday destinations of Java and Bali islands on Thursday. According ot the US Geological Survey, the magnitude 6.0 quake's epicenter was about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north-east of Sumberanyar on nearby Java island. The quake occured at a depth of 5.5 miles (9 kilometers), and a tsunami warning has not been issued. Disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said that victims were crushed by collapsed buildings while they were asleep. He added that the damage from the quake was minor. Bali is currently hosting the 2018 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group. Over 19,000 delegates and guests are present, including Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim. Tremors were felt on the holiday island of Bali in the capital city of Denpasar. People on the island were reported to have briefly panicked and fled their homes. The country is still reeling just two weeks after a devastating magnitude-7.5 earthquake and subsequent tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi last week. Nearly 2,000 people were killed in the disaster, as rescue workers had to dig through mud, rubble, and debris for dead bodies using their bare hands. Around 5,000 people were thought to still be missing. The region has been hit by a string of several major earthquakes this year. In August, several major earthquakes on the island of Lombok, just east of Bali, caused widespread damage and killed hundreds of people. Indonesia is situated in the Ring of Fire, an area in the basin of the Pacific Ocean where many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. Earthquakes often rock the island nation, and it has some of the most active volcanoes in the area.","Three people have died and four more have been injured following a strong earthquake off the cost of Indonesia's popular holiday destinations of Java and Bali islands on Thursday.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - A magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck near the northernmost tip of Haiti late on Saturday, injuring a number of people and causing some damage to buildings including an auditorium that collapsed, authorities and media reported. The quake struck about 12.3 miles (20 kms), west-northwest of the port of Port-de-Paix, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said. Local media reported at least one death. The quake was one of the strongest to hit Haiti since a 7.0 magnitude quake struck near the capital Port-au-Prince in 2010, killing thousands of people in the impoverished Caribbean country. In a post on Twitter, Haiti’s President Jovenel Moise urged people to remain calm after the civil protection agency said the quake caused injuries and panic in northern towns. Le Nouvelliste newspaper said one person died when an auditorium collapsed in the town of Gros Morne, and that detainees were released from a police holding cell that was damaged. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. The tremor damaged the facade of a church in the town of Plaisance and a house next door collapsed, Frantz Duval, a journalist with Le Nouvelliste, said on Twitter. Initial reports on social media said Saturday’s quake was felt in Port-au-Prince but had not caused major damage there.

Reuters Editorial,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A coal-fired power plant supplying half of Japan’s northern Hokkaido island was damaged in a powerful earthquake that struck earlier on Thursday, the country’s industry ministry said. Hokkaido Electric Power ( 9509.T ), the plant’s operator, said earlier it shut down all its remaining fossil fueled plants in the immediate aftermath of the quake, leaving all of its 2.95 million customers without power. The 350 megawatt (MW) capacity No.1 unit and the 600 MW No.2 unit at the Tomato-Atsuma plant operated by Hokkaido Electric Power ( 9509.T ) have been damaged, the ministry said, without specifying the nature of the damage.

James Martin,"Water leaking from the damaged reactors has to be stored on site at Fukushima Daiichi. 
The fuel rods in the three damaged radioactive units need to be continuously cooled with fresh water, but Tepco must collect and store the leaking (and now contaminated) water.
In the eight years since the accident, that has meant Tepco has collected more than 1.1 million tons of leaking, contaminated water.
Where does it all go? There are currently 900 huge silos on site and counting. Tepco estimates it has enough space in the 37.7-million-square-foot facility to house an additional 270,000 tons of water, which means it will run out space to store any more water sometime in 2020.

Jeremy Berke,"San Francisco is undergoing a skyscraper building boom, but the city's building stock — including skyscrapers — is at serious risk in a major earthquake. There's a 76% chance that the San Francisco Bay Area could experience a devastating 7.2 magnitude earthquake within the next 30 years, according to some reports. The earthquake that caused the fire that leveled much of the city in 1906 was measured at a magnitude of 7.9. In downtown San Francisco, where most of the new skyscrapers are clustered, a 7.2 magnitude quake cou ld leave nearly 30% of apartments or office spaces in the neighborhood completely unusable. That's almost one in three residences. The city is located directly above a group of major, active fault lines, including the San Andreas and Hayward faults. Residents of the Bay Area are used to small tremors and shakes, but a large magnitude earthquake could be disastrous — and the recent skyscraper boom is making the situation even more dangerous. According to a New York Times investigation, the area under San Francisco's downtown — near the notorious Millennium Tower, which has sunk 17 inches and tilted 14 inches since it was completed in 2008 — has a high risk of ""liquefaction,"" or acting like quicksand, in the event of a major earthquake. But that hasn't stopped construction in the area. The Salesforce Tower, which opened earlier this year in downtown San Francisco, is the tallest building west of the Mississippi River, and there more than a dozen buildings over 240 feet tall that are planned, The Times reports. San Francisco's building code does not accurately account for the risks of the city's underlying geology. Buildings must be designed to have a 90% chance of avoiding total collapse in the event of an earthquake, according to the Times. That means that ten percent of buildings in one of the most densely populated areas of the US could collapse in the event of a major earthquake. Photographs showing examples of types of damage to lifelines and infrastructure expected to occur along the Hayward Fault in the San Francisco Bay region, California, in an earthquake like the magnitude-7 mainshock modeled in the HayWired Scenario. USGS/Public Domain The risk is magnified not only for people in a tall skyscraper but for the area around it when a building collapse causes an avalanche of debris. While the state of California has strict measures to protect schools and hospitals from collapsing in the event of an earthquake, skyscrapers don't. A five-story building has the same requirements as a 50-story building. ""I don't understand why that's acceptable,"" Lucy Jones, a former geologist at the USGS told The New York Times. ""Enough buildings will be so badly damaged that people are going to find it too hard to live in L.A. or San Francisco."" San Francisco is justifiably building many of these skyscrapers in an attempt to alleviate pressure on housing costs in the city, as well as to provide office space for the city's omnipresent tech industry. But experts say building engineers aren't doing enough to prepare for high-magnitude quakes. ""It's kind of like getting in a new airplane that's only been designed on paper but nobody has ever flown in it,"" Thomas H. Heaton, the director of the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, told The Times. Beyond earthquakes, the Bay Area is a geologic nightmare for a number of other reasons. Sea level rise is threatening to wipe out some of the city's most valuable real estate, and more frequent storms can compound the risk of flooding in the city. On top of that, the city, which is built over layers of unstable mud, clay, and landfill, is actually sinking into the Pacific Ocean in a process geologists call "" subsidence.""","San Francisco is undergoing a building boom. But the city is at serious risk for a major earthquake. And the building codes for skyscrapers aren't strong enough, according to experts. The next big quake in the Bay Area could be disastrous.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media captionBuildings were flattened by the force of the tsunami
Coastal residents near Indonesia's Anak Krakatau volcano have been warned to keep away from beaches amid fears it could trigger a new tsunami.
On Saturday, giant waves crashed into coastal towns on the islands of Sumatra and Java, killing at least 222 people and injuring 843.
It is thought that volcanic activity set off undersea landslides which in turn generated the killer waves.
Anak Krakatau was erupting again on Sunday, spewing ash and smoke.
Video shot from a charter plane captured the magnitude of the event in the Sunda Strait, between Sumatra and Java.
President Joko Widodo has expressed his sorrow for the victims and urged people to be patient.
Rescue efforts are being hampered by blocked roads but heavy lifting equipment is being transported to badly hit areas to help search for victims.
What warning was given?
The head of the National Disaster Management Agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, held a news conference on Java.
""Recommendations from [the] Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency are that people should not carry out activities on the beach and stay away from the coast for a while,"" he said.

""The potential for a fresh tsunami is still possible because the volcanic eruption of Anak Krakatau continues to occur, potentially triggering tsunami.""
Anak Krakatau, which formed in 1927 after the Krakatoa volcano eruption, has seen increased activity in recent months with people asked to avoid the area around its crater. 
On Friday it erupted for two minutes and 12 seconds, creating an ash cloud that rose 400 metres above the mountain. 
Why was Saturday's tsunami so deadly?
It struck at 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT) during a local holiday, with few of the warning signals that might have come had it been generated by an earthquake.
Seawater did not recede as in an earthquake tsunami and experts say that even if there had been warning buoys near the volcano, there would have been minimal alert time.
However, officials say a warning siren did go off in some areas, Reuters news agency reports.

 Band Seventeen were performing on stage when the tsunami hit
The waves destroyed hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees in several popular tourist destinations including the Tanjung Lesung beach resort, west Java.
Footage shared on social media showed a large wave crashing into a tent in the resort, in which popular Indonesian rock band Seventeen was performing. 
Members of the band were seen being swept away as the wave destroyed the stage.
Officials say more than 160 people were killed in Java's Pandeglang tourist district.
On Sumatra, 48 were reported dead in South Lampung, and deaths were also reported in Serang district and Tanggamus.
So far, no foreign nationals have been reported dead, officials say.
What caused the tsunami?
By Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent
It is well known that volcanoes have the capacity to generate large waves. The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large volume of water. 
Except, unlike in a classic earthquake-driven tsunami in which the seafloor will thrust up or down, it seems an eruption event set in motion some kind of slide. 
It is not clear at this stage whether part of the flank of the volcano has collapsed with material entering the sea and pushing water ahead of it, or if movement on the flank has triggered a rapid slump in sediment under the water surface. 
The latter at this stage appears to be the emerging consensus, but the effect is the same - the water column is disturbed and waves propagate outwards. 
How common are tsunamis in Indonesia?
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 Some residents in the Pandeglang region ran to a local mosque after the tsunami hit
Indonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.
In September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu.
On 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia.
However, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity like this are less frequent.
Krakatoa (Krakatau in Indonesian)
Image copyrightOystein Lund Andersen
In August 1883, Krakatoa underwent one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history:
Massive tsunamis with waves of up to 41m killed more than 30,000 people
Thousands more were killed by hot ash
The eruptions were equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945
The eruptions were heard thousands of kilometres away
World temperatures dropped by more than 1C the following year
The volcanic island virtually disappeared

The solution was to slant the entire western-facing façade and create a built-in slanted bookshelf whose shelves also function as a ladder. The slant allowed family members of all ages to climb up and reach books, but also keeps the books from falling should an earthquake ever shake the home.

Phoebe DeVries,"From hurricanes and floods to volcanoes and earthquakes, the Earth is continuously evolving in fits and spurts of dramatic activity. Earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis alone have caused massive destruction in the last decade—even over the course of writing this post, there were earthquakes in New Caledonia, Southern California, Iran, and Fiji, just to name a few. Earthquakes typically occur in sequences: an initial ""mainshock"" (the event that usually gets the headlines) is often followed by a set of ""aftershocks."" Although these aftershocks are usually smaller than the main shock, in some cases, they may significantly hamper recovery efforts. Although the timing and size of aftershocks has been understood and explained by established empirical laws, forecasting the locations of these events has proven more challenging. We teamed up with machine learning experts at Google to see if we could apply deep learning to explain where aftershocks might occur, and today we’re publishing a paper on our findings.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"MATARAM, Indonesia (Reuters) - Daybreak revealed chaos and destruction across the Indonesian resort island of Lombok on Monday after a magnitude 6.9 earthquake killed at least 83 people and prompted an exodus of tourists rattled by the second powerful quake in a week. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) said the death toll was expected to rise with initial reports of hundreds injured and thousands of buildings collapsed or badly damaged. Power and communications were cut in some areas of Lombok, and the military said it was sending in a vessel with medical aid, supplies and logistical support for the island. Lombok was hit a week earlier, on July 29, by a 6.4 magnitude quake that killed 17 people, injured hundreds and briefly stranded several trekkers on the slopes of a volcano. The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) said that more than 120 aftershocks were recorded after Sunday evening’s quake, whose magnitude the U.S. Geological Survey revised down to 6.9 from an original 7.0. The tremor was so powerful it was felt on the neighboring island of Bali where, according to BNPB, two people died. “I was at the rooftop of my hotel and the building started swaying very hard. It felt like two meters to the left, then two meters to the right, I could not stand up,” said Gino Poggiali, a 43-year-old Frenchman, who was with his wife and two children. His wife Maude, 44, said the family were on Bali for the first quake and Lombok for the second. “This is it for me in Indonesia,” she said. “Next time we will stay in France or somewhere close.” Long lines formed at the airport of Lombok’s main town, Mataram, as foreign visitors cut their holidays short. The Garuda Indonesia airline said it was adding extra flights from Lombok to help tourists leave, and AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes tweeted that the budget airline would try to lay on extra flights. SCREAMS, SHAKING BUILDINGS Carlos Romartinez, a 24-year-old Spaniard who was also waiting for a flight out of Lombok, said he had decided to head instead to the island of Flores to the east. “All the activities are shut down. We can’t dive, we can’t do anything so we will go to another island,” he said. Dutch tourist Marc Ganbuwalba injured his knee as a stampede of diners rushed from a restaurant after the quake. “We are cutting short our holiday because I can’t walk and we’re just not in the mood anymore, more in the mood to see our loved ones,” said the 26-year-old, sitting on a trolley with his leg bandaged. “We are just thankful to god and also to the hotel staff who really helped us. Some of them said their own houses had been destroyed but they were still helping us.” About 1,000 foreign and domestic tourists were evacuated in boats from the three Gili islands off the northwest coast of Lombok, BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said via Twitter. No tourists died on the Gilis, he said. Singapore Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, who was on the 10th floor of a hotel in Mataram when the quake struck, said that his room shook violently and walls cracked. “It was quite impossible to stand up. Heard screams. Came out, and made my way down a staircase, while building was still shaking. Power went out for a while. Lots of cracks, fallen doors,” he wrote on Facebook. His government issued a travel notice on Monday, advising citizens to defer travel to Lombok and urging those currently there to leave. “We were knocked certainly to the floor. We were pretty lucky to get out. Everyone’s a bit shaken but all well,” Australia’s Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton, who was on the 12th floor of a Lombok hotel, told Australian radio.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Moment the quake struck caught on camera Some 10,000 people have been evacuated on the Indonesian island of Lombok after a powerful 6.9 magnitude quake on Sunday left more than 90 people dead. Witnesses spoke of chaos and terror as buildings collapsed and power and communication lines were cut. Boats have been sent to evacuate more than 1,000 tourists from the nearby Gili islands. Aid agencies said the priority was to provide shelter for residents too scared to return to their homes. The agencies said the impact was far bigger than another quake that hit Lombok last week, killing 16 people. What's the latest on Lombok? Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, said that the northern area of Lombok had suffered massive damage. Three C-130 Hercules aircraft and two helicopters have been deployed to deliver tents and medical aid, but the earthquake has brought down roads and bridges, making areas difficult to reach. Electricity supply in the worst-affected areas has been cut off and telecommunication networks are not working. Image copyright AFP Image caption Staff take patients outside as a safety measure at a hospital in Mataram The death toll stands at 91, all Indonesians, but Mr Sutopo said that number would ""definitely increase"". At least another 200 people have been injured. He pointed to the situation at a collapsed mosque in the village of Lading-Lading in north Lombok, where a lack of heavy lifting equipment had made it difficult to locate victims. One official said 80% of north Lombok had suffered damage. The main city of Mataram was also badly affected, with medical staff struggling to cope with the injured at the damaged hospitals. What about the Gili islands? Situated off the north-west of Lombok and popular with backpackers and divers, they were badly hit, with a number of hotels damaged. Video and still images showed hundreds of tourists flocking to the beach to be evacuated. There have been reports of deaths on the islands but these have not been confirmed. Hundreds of tourists have been taken off by boat, but hundreds still remain.

""It's understandable they want to leave the Gilis, they are panicking."" What have victims and witnesses been saying? Helen Milne told the BBC that her daughter, Laura, from Oxfordshire in the UK, is on the island of Gili Trawangan. She said: ""They are stuck on the island and are reporting rioting, fighting, and people can't get on boats. There's no water, no food, the shops have been ransacked. It's a rapidly deteriorating situation out there for them."" Another Briton on Gili Trawangan, James Kelsall, told the Press Association the subsequent tsunami warning was the most terrifying part. ""All the locals were frantically running and screaming, putting on life jackets. We followed them up to higher ground, which was a steep, uneven climb to the top of a hill in darkness."" The tsunami warning was lifted after a few hours. Margret Helgadottir, from Iceland, told Agence France-Presse people screamed as the roof of her hotel on Gili Air collapsed. ""We just froze, thankfully we were outside. Everything went black, it was terrible."" Singapore's Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, on the 10th floor of a hotel room in Mataram, said on Facebook: ""Walls cracked, it was quite impossible to stand up."" And the aid agencies? Dini Widiastuti, executive director of Plan International Indonesia, told the BBC that the top priority was to provide shelter. ""Thousands of people, including children, are still just out in the fields, not properly protected. The impact is very widespread in Lombok and actually this is bigger than the first earthquake last week, so it is difficult."" Meili Narti, from Oxfam, said the government was trying to set up centres to which people could safely evacuate, but colleagues were saying some people did not have sufficient food, water or shelter. What about Bali? At least one death has been reported unofficially but it has not been confirmed. The airport has suffered some damage but is operating. The quake was felt for several seconds. One worker in Denpasar described the scene to the BBC. ""They were initially just little shocks but then they started to get bigger and bigger and people started to shout 'earthquake', then all the staff panicked and rushed out of the building,"" he said. Model and presenter Chrissy Teigen, who is on holiday in Bali, described 15 seconds of a tremor, followed by ""so many aftershocks"". Skip Twitter post by @chrissyteigen another aftershock just now. probably the 8th one we have felt since the big one last night. we are safe, up high and nothing around us. thinking about everyone around us and in Lombok especially. — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) August 6, 2018 End of Twitter post by @chrissyteigen What are the quake details? The earthquake was of magnitude 6.9, according to the US Geological Survey. It struck at 19:46 local time (11:46 GMT) on Sunday at a fairly shallow depth of 31km (19 miles). There have been more than 130 aftershocks since the quake hit. Lombok is a roughly 4,500 sq km (1,700 sq miles) island east of the slightly larger island of Bali. The two islands are home to about three and four million people respectively. Both are popular with tourists who visit beaches and hiking trails. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Deimos Imaging Image caption Thousands of people have left the area around Kadovar Island in Papua New Guinea Tens of thousands of people have had their lives disrupted in the past week by seismic and volcanic activity along the Ring of Fire. An earthquake off Alaska, an avalanche and volcanic eruption in central Japan and a volcano squirting lava in the Philippines all occurred within days of each other. It led the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction to send a tweet on Tuesday warning that the Ring of Fire was ""active"". Many are asking whether there is cause for concern that something more serious might happen. So is there reason to worry? The Ring of Fire refers to a string of volcanoes, earthquake sites and tectonic plates around the Pacific. It spreads across 40,000km (25,000 miles) from the southern tip of South America all the way to New Zealand. Roughly 90% of all earthquakes occur along the area and the ring is dotted with 75% of all active volcanoes on Earth, that's 452 individual active volcanoes. This week alone, a 7.9-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Alaska in the US. The quake briefly triggered a tsunami warning for coastal areas of Alaska and British Columbia in Canada. On the same day, one soldier was killed and at least 11 others injured in central Japan by an avalanche that may have been triggered by a volcanic eruption. The eruption of Mount Moto-Shirane, which is part of Mount Kusastsu-Shirane, also sent rocks raining down a kilometre-wide area near Kusatsu in central Japan, local media reported. Earlier last year, the eruption of Bali's Mount Agung led to the closure of the city's international airport and forced up to 100,000 people to evacuate. Media caption Survivors of the 1963 eruption on the last time Mount Agung erupted Mount Sinabung, more than 3,000km away in Sumatra, Indonesia, had been dormant for 400 years before it began erupting again in 2010. In 2016, at least seven people died after clouds of hot ash and gas consumed the region.. Sinabung began erupting again in 2017 and is still going. And Mount Kadovar, a volcano in Papua New Guinea, has been spewing ash for weeks, causing the evacuation of thousands of people from nearby islands. All are along the Ring of Fire. But Prof Chris Elders, a geology expert from Curtin University in Australia, says the recent activity is entirely normal. ""There's nothing unusual about what we're seeing at the moment,"" he told the BBC. ""It just so happens that these events are occurring at the same time in different parts of the region. There's not necessarily a relationship between them."" He says volcanic and tectonic activity has occurred in the region for ""hundreds and thousands of years"". ""So if you're just looking at one tiny snapshot in such a long period of time it looks like it's something special that things are happening all at once, but if you stand back and look at it in the scale of things, you'll see the action is fairly continuous."" Dr Janine Krippner, a New Zealand volcanologist based in the US, tweeted that the zone was ""not referred to as the Ring of Fire because it sits there doing nothing"". While there are fears that volcanoes are becoming more frequent, she said the rate of eruptions had ""not recently increased"". ""We now have satellites to capture more eruptions, and the internet to talk about more eruptions,"" she said. According to Japan's volcanology division, Mount Moto-Shirane had been quiet for 3,000 years before its sudden eruption. Does it mean anything that it has reawoken? Not really, says Prof Elders. ""To us, 3,000 years is a long period to be inactive but if you look back at the history of the volcano over tens of thousands of years, you might see that that is quite regular for it,"" he said. ""What you can say with confidence is that there will always continue to be earthquake and volcanic activity across different parts of the Ring of Fire.""","BBC News Ring of Fire's volcanic and quake activity is normal, say scientists BBC News Tens of thousands of people have had their lives disrupted in the past week by seismic and volcanic activity along the Ring of Fire.

THOMAS FULLER and MATT STEVENS,"The owners of one of the buildings, a 20-story building at 100 Van Ness Street, reached out to disclose that the building had undergone a comprehensive renovation that brought the building up to code and thus made it more seismically safe. Kevin L. Menninger, the chief engineer of the project, calculated that before the renovation the building was around 15 percent weaker than required by the code. The steel skeleton was too flexible and vulnerable to moving from side to side during a large earthquake, which in extreme cases can lead to collapse. The solution was to significantly lighten the building, replacing the concrete cladding with glass and lopping off a heavy penthouse. Changes to the facade alone, which took a year, cost more than $20 million. Marc Babsin, a principal at Emerald Fund, the building’s co-owner, said they had no choice but to seismically retrofit the building — they were changing the building from office to residential use and thus needed to meet current standards. But Mr. Babsin says he’s skeptical other owners would voluntarily go through the same process. “Unless you’re required to do it by the building code it’s hard to imagine an owner/operator going through the expense of doing it — moving people out, giving up rent, breaking leases,” Mr. Babsin said. “It’s quite an undertaking.”","One Embarcadero Center and Two Embarcadero Center in San Francisco.

Kevin Loria,"USGS expects this sort of damage to occur when the Hayward Fault earthquake hits. USGS/Public Domain On this day 112 years ago, the San Andreas Fault under San Francisco rumbled apart, causing the devastating 1906 earthquake that swallowed city blocks, broke water mains, and triggered massive fires that burned for days. The threat of another major quake for the Bay Area is ""real and could happen at any time,"" according to researchers for the US Geological Survey. But the scariest scenario for the next major earthquake may not be from the San Andreas Fault (though that one still threatens ), but from the Hayward Fault that runs along the east side of the San Francisco Bay. The Hayward Fault is a ""tectonic time bomb, due anytime for another magnitude 6.8 to 7.0 earthquake,"" according to a 2008 USGS report. Since then, research has indicated that the likelihood of a Hayward quake is greater and more threatening to the 7 million Bay Area residents than a San Andreas quake would be. ""It's just waiting to go off,"" USGS earthquake geologist emeritus David Schwartz told the Los Angeles Times. The Hayward Fault USGS/Public Domain The HayWired Earthquake Scenario To better understand what might happen in the case of a quake on the Hayward Fault, researchers from the USGS partnered with a group called the HayWired Coalition. They modeled a hypothetical 7.0 magnitude quake with an epicenter beneath Oakland — a hypothetical event they call the HayWired Scenario. The projections are sobering. According to that model, the violent shaking from the earthquake could cause the two sides of the fault to split six feet apart in some places. Some aftershocks could continue for several months. Cities in the East Bay would be hit hard, including Berkeley, Oakland, San Leandro, and Hayward. More than 300 buildings sit atop the Hayward Fault, including the stadium at the University of California Berkeley. Property damage in the HayWired Scenario is estimated by USGS to be more than $82 billion. The human toll from such an event could be greater. The quake would displace 77,000 households, a number that could rise to 152,000 if fires and utility outages were counted. That means nearly half a million people would be forced from their homes. A major earthquake in 1989 rocked the San Francisco Bay area and damaged parts of the Bay Bridge. AP Photo The scientists think such an event would kill around 800 people and cause 18,000 nonfatal injuries. More than 2,500 people might need to be pulled from collapsed buildings, and around 22,000 could be trapped in elevators. Most counties in the area would have full water service restored within 30 days, the researchers estimate, but it might take up to 210 days before the hardest hit counties would see full service restored. More than 400 gas- and electric-related fires would likely ignite because of the main shock of the quake, and experts think those blazes could burn an area big enough to consume 52,000 homes, kill hundreds, and do another $30 billion in damage. The 72 percent probability of a magnitude (M) 6.7 or greater earthquake in the region includes well-known major plate-boundary faults, lesser-known faults, and unknown faults. The percentage shown within each colored circle is the probability that a M 6.7 or greater earthquake will occur somewhere on that fault system by the year 2043. The dark, thick lines outlined in various colors represent major plate boundary faults; the thinner, yellow lines mark lesser-know, smaller faults. USGS/Public Domain Another quake is coming The last time a major quake hit the Hayward Fault was in 1868, when a 6.8-magnitude tremor raced through the region and leveled several towns. The region was sparsely populated then, but 30 people died and the impact was powerful enough that the 1868 quake is considered one of the most destructive in California history. People felt the shakes as far north as Nevada. The devastation from the next quake will be worse given the current density of the East Bay. The idea behind the HayWired Scenario is to present a realistic model of something experts think is likely to happen — and inspire more investment in earthquake safety. There are steps that experts think could improve the situation. An early warning system could prevent at least 1,500 injuries if people followed alerts. If water utilities replace brittle pipes, acquire emergency generators, and create a fuel-management plan, water service could be restored more quickly. Retrofitting buildings could also reduce the number of fires. But the researchers behind the analysis want people to understand that this scenario is just one of many possibilities. There are seven significant fault lines running through the Bay Area. The risk from a Hayward quake might be highest, but there are worse scenarios that would involve multiple faults rupturing simultaneously. Overall, researchers think there's about a 76% chance the region could get hit by a 7.2 magnitude quake within the next 30 years. As Schwartz told the LA Times, ""You can't hide — there's really going to be very little places in the greater Bay Area that won't be affected.""","There's about a 76% chance that the San Francisco Bay Area could experience a 7.2 magnitude earthquake within the next 30 years, according to some recent reports.

Reuters Editorial,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The U.S. region most vulnerable to tsunamis - the massive waves of water unleashed by undersea earthquakes - is dangerously under-prepared, experts and officials in Oregon and Washington state said after a magnitude 7.9 earthquake this week. The quake that struck in the Gulf of Alaska late Monday, triggering a tsunami warning for Alaska and a tsunami watch for the U.S. West Coast, rekindled concerns that a seismic sea wave along the northwest coast could kill, injure or displace tens of thousands of people and cause billions of dollars in damage. In this week’s quake, the warnings and watches were quickly lifted, and there was no damage from the slight change it caused in the ocean. But experts worry that in some parts of the region there is too little information about where tsunamis might occur, and in others too much infrastructure built in locations known to face a threat. “There’s still a lot that needs to be done,” said Corina Forson, Washington’s chief hazards geologist. Scientists in the state have pinpointed just half the locations where a destructive tsunami triggered by the Cascadia subduction zone off the northwest coast might come ashore, and about 10 percent of sites that might be hit by a wave emanating from the Seattle fault zone, Forson said. She called the lack of information dangerous. A tsunami could send a wall of water 50 feet (15 meters) high crashing onto the coast, or a wave 16 feet (5 meters) high into Seattle, the state’s largest city, she said. “If there’s the real thing and people don’t have evacuation routes and plans, they won’t know where to get to safety and it could be life-threatening,” she said. In neighboring Oregon, officials have created evacuation plans and public awareness campaigns to help people prepare. But the state has not done enough to stop people from building in potential danger zones, said Jay Wilson, former chairman of the Oregon Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission. “There are about 30,000 people who live in the tsunami zones,” Wilson said. “If we do everything right, they’re going to run up to the top of the hill. And then they’re all going to be permanently displaced.” DEADLY THREAT Parts of Oregon and far northern California have up to a 37 percent chance of a tsunami from a rupture of the Cascadia subduction zone in the next 50 years, said Chris Goldfinger, a tsunami and earthquake expert with the Oregon State University. Tsunamis are generally produced when tectonic plates move against each other under the ocean in subduction zones, displacing ocean water through powerful quakes. They have a deadly history. The 2011 quake and tsunami in Japan killed up to 18,000 people and wrecked Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant, causing the worst meltdown since the Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union. The 2004 Asian tsunami killed 226,000 people. A big tsunami on the Oregon coast could kill up to 10,000 people, said Althea Rizzo, the state’s geologic hazards program coordinator. In recent years, Oregon has instituted practice drills at schools and hospitals, provided evacuation materials to tourists in their hotel rooms and in some areas painted blue evacuation lines to higher ground on roads and paths, Rizzo said. The city of Seaside, Oregon, voted in 2016 to fund a bond measure to move its schools out of the inundation zone. There are statewide restrictions on building essential facilities like hospitals in tsunami zones. But updated maps showing where those zones are located have not been incorporated into the law, meaning the restrictions might not apply in areas that are now known to be dangerous, Wilson said. “In the Northwest our biggest problem is not getting the word out, it’s that our built infrastructure is very vulnerable,” said Goldfinger. “Buildings within a tsunami zone are pretty much going to be destroyed.” California is considering adopting international zoning standards for tsunami zone construction, as well as “blue line” evacuation routes like those in Oregon, said Rick Wilson, senior engineering geologist for the California Geological Survey. In Manzanita on the Oregon coast, resident Kerry Driscoll said she has an evacuation plan and the cabins at the beachside resort where she works are equipped with pamphlets telling tourists how to prepare. But tsunamis can come with little warning, and she knows it might be hard to get out. “If we don’t have major advance warning I don’t think there’s much that we can do,” Driscoll said. “I can’t see running from giant tidal waves.” Reporting by Sharon Bernstein; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Frances Kerry","SACRAMENTO, Calif.

This movement, which they called a ""deep creep,"" could help them understand the process leading up to a large and damaging earthquake, the university said. While these earthquakes move differently to how a big earthquake along the San Andreas Fault would, the new findings come as scientists repeat longstanding warnings about the huge earthquake that is overdue to hit California. The data cannot be used to predict when this big earthquake will hit, the researchers warned, but they hope to keep staying smaller earthquakes to learn how the fault is loaded. ""If we can understand how they are being loaded maybe we can understand better when these faults may be going to rupture,"" researchers said. John Vidale, director of the Southern California Earthquake Center, told Newsweek on Saturday that this huge earthquake is ""an inevitability"" as energy has been building up along the fault for more than a century. ""We just don't know if it's going to be now or 200 years from now."" Layers of earthquake-twisted ground at the San Andreas Fault. David McNew/Getty Images San Franciso and Los Angeles are at risk. The impact of a northern earthquake, which would run through San Francisco, would be ""tremendous,"" Vidale said. ""Downtown San Francisco is vulnerable — some of the oldest buildings survived the shaking back in 1906, but that doesn't mean they'd be safe in the next earthquake by any means. Many of the buildings are built close to the fault and on kind of soft ground that might liquify."" The biggest concern in the US after an earthquake, he said, is the cost of repairs and the damage to the economy. ""It's certainly in the realm of possibility that the earthquake causes something that cripples the economy for a long time."" The large number of smaller earthquakes, like those the researchers have been studying, do little to release that energy, Vidale said. ""Those little earthquakes let out only a tiny amount of energy compared to the big ones. It would take 10 magnitude seven earthquakes to let out the strain of a magnitude eight. We don't have that many, so those little earthquakes hardly slow the big ones at all.""","The San Andreas Fault is long overdue an earthquake that could devastate California.

LARA TAKENAGA,"Photo Voodoo devotees take part in Day of the Dead ceremonies in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Nov. 1. Credit Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times The Reader Center is one way we in the newsroom are trying to connect with you, by highlighting your perspectives and experiences and offering insight into how we work. The End, the New York Times series that looks at how we die and what it tells us about how we live, has resonated deeply with readers. Its latest installment — written by Catherine Porter, The Times’s Canada bureau chief, with photos and video by Daniel Berehulak — paints a vivid portrait of the men who bury the abandoned dead in Haiti. Readers were moved by the “ great article and visual into a world of misery few of us really see.” For the past decade, Rick Frechette, an American Catholic priest and doctor whom the story follows, and his team have collected and buried the dead left “in gruesome, wet piles that resemble medieval paintings of purgatory” by relatives and friends who cannot afford funeral services. The description of his work prompted an outpouring of support from readers. Here are some of their comments, which have been edited for length and clarity. When an organization and its founders stretch themselves to do the awful work of retrieving decomposing bodies to perform the final dignity of burial, I have to believe that if there is a God, he must be with them. — Marnie, in Philadelphia My wife and I have been working there since 1997. We know Father Rick and the wonderful, meaningful work he does. — Greg in St. Paul, Minn. I was in Father Rick’s medical school class and have been down to Haiti several times both pre- and post-earthquake. I have participated in the burials. I can tell you with certainty that money given to his organization goes directly (and usually immediately) to people in need. — Patricia Tweedie, in Fall River, Mass. Catherine’s idea for the story was several years in the making. She first visited Haiti as a columnist for The Toronto Star after the earthquake in 2010 that devastated the country. That trip became the first of many. Three months later, I returned to find that hope had shouldered out despair. People really believed the country would change because of this tragedy. Aid was pouring in, international leaders were vowing to help Haiti “build back better,” and Haitians had started to rebuild themselves. Since then, I’ve returned to Haiti 19 more times and watched that hope be washed away by frustration and finally, defeat and cynicism. The rubble was carted off, but not the problems: the lack of public infrastructure, paucity of descent jobs, the blistering poverty, the corruption. The public morgue seemed to capture all of that. The first time I saw it up close was in 2014. I was writing a story about the stalled reconstruction of the country’s drastically underfunded general hospital. Even before the earthquake, it was known by locals as “the place to go to die.” The morgue was located on its broken grounds and had a similar reputation for dysfunction. It had finally broken down so many times, the hospital’s executive director had shuttered it and brought in two shipping containers as an interim measure. I watched in horror as a morgue worker opened one container to reveal a jumbled pile of dead bodies rising from the floor. He climbed up, dragging the latest victim to the very top, and left him there. I couldn’t figure out why that image haunted me more than some of the other horrifying things I’d seen there, but it did. When our international editor, Michael Slackman, who knew about my history covering Haiti, asked me if there was a story from the country I’d want to write for The End, I immediately thought of that shipping container. With some research, I learned there was a group of men who had not only been as horrified as I, but had taken it upon themselves to offer those bodies some dignity and bury them. The act seemed so hopeful. Later, Father Frechette explained why his team continued to do this, week after week, even as their funding drained. His explanation got to the heart of why I’d been so haunted by the sight of that morgue worker climbing up the bodies. “If we treat the dead like garbage,” he said, “then the living are just walking garbage.” Catherine has written a book about Haiti, “A Girl Named Lovely,” which will be published in early 2019.

The death toll following the tsunami caused by the Anak Krakatau volcano has risen to at least 373, Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency says.
Saturday saw giant waves crash into coastal towns on the islands of Sumatra and Java. 
It is thought that volcanic activity set off undersea landslides which in turn generated the killer waves.
""1,459 people are injured, while 128 remain missing,"" said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a statement.
Coastal residents near the volcano have been warned to keep away from beaches amid fears it could trigger a new tsunami.
Anak Krakatau erupted again on Sunday, spewing ash and smoke.
Video shot from a charter plane captured the magnitude of the volcanic event in the Sunda Strait, between Sumatra and Java.
Rescue efforts are being hampered by blocked roads but heavy lifting equipment is being transported to badly hit areas to help search for victims. 
What warning was given?
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency told a news conference that another tsunami is a possibility because of the continued volcanic eruptions of Anak Krakatau. 
""Recommendations from [the] Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency are that people should not carry out activities on the beach and stay away from the coast for a while,"" he said.

 A satellite image of Anak Krakatau erupting in August
Anak Krakatau, which emerged in 1927 from the caldera that was formed during the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, has seen increased activity in recent months with people asked to avoid the area around its crater.
On Monday Mr Sutopo put out a series of tweets explaining why there was no early warning for this tsunami. He said that Indonesia's early warning system is set up to monitor earthquakes but not undersea landslides and volcanic eruptions, which can also generate deadly waves. 
But, he added, with 13% of the world's volcanoes in Indonesia alone, it was crucial for the country to develop such system.
He confirmed there was no tsunami advance warning system on the night of the disaster, adding that because of lack of funds, vandalism to the buoys and technical faults there had been no operational tsunami warning system since 2012. 
Why was Saturday's tsunami so deadly?
The tsunami struck at 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT) during a local holiday, with few of the warning signals that might have come had it been generated by an earthquake.
Seawater did not recede as it would with an earthquake tsunami and experts say that even if there had been warning buoys near the volcano, there would have been minimal alert time.

 Band Seventeen were performing on stage when the tsunami hit
The waves destroyed hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees in several popular tourist destinations, including the Tanjung Lesung beach resort, west Java.
Footage shared on social media showed a large wave crashing into a tent in the resort, in which popular Indonesian rock band Seventeen were performing. 
Members of the band were seen being swept away as the wave destroyed the stage.
How did the tsunami happen?
By Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent
Everyone in the region will have been aware of Anak Krakatau, the volcano that emerged in the sea channel just less than 100 years ago. But its rumblings and eruptions have been described by local experts as relatively low-scale and semi-continuous. 
In other words, it's been part of the background. 
And yet it is well known that volcanoes have the capacity to generate big waves. The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large volume of water.
The first satellite imagery returned after the event on Saturday points strongly to a collapse in the west-southwest flank of the volcano. This would have sent millions of tonnes of rocky debris into the sea, pushing out waves in all directions. 
How common are tsunamis in Indonesia?
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 Some residents in the Pandeglang region ran to a local mosque after the tsunami hit
Indonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific Rim.
In September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu.
On 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia.
However, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity like this are less frequent.
Krakatoa (Krakatau in Indonesian)
Image copyrightOystein Lund Andersen
In August 1883, Krakatoa underwent one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history:
Massive tsunamis with waves of up to 41m killed more than 30,000 people
Thousands more were killed by hot ash
The eruptions were equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945
The eruptions were heard thousands of kilometres away
World temperatures dropped by more than 1C the following year
The volcanic island virtually disappeared

ERIC BISHOP,"Credit Adnan Abidi/Reuters Epic. Historic. Unprecedented. When New York Times editors talk about the 2017 news cycle, we find ourselves reaching for words that our Stylebook calls too hyperbolic for all but the rarest of circumstances. They feel appropriate here. The Times sent over 750 breaking news alerts — the buzzing, light-up-your-phone kind — to millions of devices and email inboxes around the world in 2017. That’s a 30-percent jump from last year, election and all. A disruptive president, a harassment reckoning and other ground-shaking stories forced new debates in the newsroom about what is “alertable” (e.g., when does a tweet from President Trump deserve a push notification?). Here are the 10 breaking news stories that pulled in the highest readership this year, and the corresponding alerts that compelled readers to pause and take notice. Oct. 2 One way to judge a news story’s magnitude is by the number of notifications it merits. Five alerts for one news story in one day is a rarity for The Times, and a grim marker of this shooting’s gravity. Aug. 12 The news from Charlottesville, Va., began with an emergency declaration — not the sort of thing that immediately registers as a presidency-shaking moment. But what came next laid the groundwork for days of controversy. March 24 The first big legislative push of the Trump presidency ended in dramatic disappointment for House Republicans. Although they would later pass a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the effort died in the Senate. Sept. 10 Hurricane Irma’s march up the Florida coast followed catastrophic storm damage in Texas and the Caribbean and a major earthquake in Mexico. It was beginning to feel like a season of endless disasters, and that anxious sense of déjà vu most likely contributed to the resonance of these notifications. Sept. 3 These three alerts greeted many Americans just as they were waking up on a holiday weekend. Coming a month after Mr. Trump threatened “fire and fury” on North Korea, this nuclear test intensified a climate of fear, reciprocal threats and speculation about Kim Jong-un’s intentions. Oct. 30 A burst of notifications before lunchtime announced a major advancement in Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. The latter two thrust George Papadopoulos, a little-known campaign aide, into the public eye. May 9 The abrupt dismissal of James B. Comey altered the course of the Trump presidency, and The Times was among the first to alert readers. But speed can come at a price: Our notification misspelled the attorney general’s name. Sept. 8 In a busy year, September was a particularly busy month. This earthquake was Mexico’s most powerful in decades, but it wasn’t even the country’s deadliest of the month. Just 12 days later, a 7.1-magnitude quake killed more than 300 people. Aug. 17 Assailants in Spain’s worst terrorist attack in years followed a grisly template, using a vehicle as a weapon. But in other ways, this attack was a departure: It was the work of a 12-man extremist cell, the police said, and the driver got away. The police found and killed him four days later. Oct. 31 A haze of uncertainty often obscures the early details from fast-moving news events, as the first alert shows.

Tom McKay,"A Japanese nuclear power station in Hokkaido is operating on emergency power after the region was hit by a 6.7-magnitude quake in the early hours of Thursday morning, Reuters reported. However, though the event carries unsettling overtones of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, authorities say there is currently no danger of any similar radioactive release occurring. 100 people are injured and 19 missing following the quake on Thursday, Reuters reported, citing Japanese broadcaster NHK. The seismic event knocked out local power, forcing Hokkaido Electric Power’s Tomari nuclear plant to switch to emergency generators to keep its three reactors from overloading. Reuters wrote: The station’s fuel rods are being cooled with emergency power supplied by diesel generators, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Thursday. There were no radiation irregularities at the plant, Suga said, citing the operator. The atomic regulator said the diesel generators have enough fuel to last seven days. The Fukushima incident occurred after an earthquake off the coast of Tōhoku prefecture on Honshu, Japan’s largest island, caused a tsunami. The disaster killed some 19,000 people, as well as knocked out power to and swamped backup generators at the Fukushima facility. The result was three nuclear meltdowns and hydrogen-air explosions that spread a radioactive plume up to 25 miles away, as well as resulted in authorities dumping massive amounts of contaminated material into the oceans. Scientists say most of that radiation quickly faded or was otherwise diluted. Most, but not all, also agree that there is likely a low risk to public health outside of the immediate region of the plant. The primary danger is to the thousands of workers involved in its cleanup. On Wednesday, the New York Times reported, the Japanese government acknowledged the first death of a worker from radiation exposure at the plant, a subcontractor for its operator Tokyo Electric Power Company that developed lung cancer in 2016. Japan idled all of its 54 nuclear power facilities after the incident, but seven have since been reactivated “after a protracted relicensing process,” Reuters wrote. The Conversation wrote last year that the Japanese government estimated the total cost of the Fukushima at around $188 billion, while polls indicated the Japanese public had lost faith in the safety of nuclear power. The cleanup effort at the facility still generates huge amounts of nuclear waste, and Tokyo Electric doesn’t expect to begin clearing fuel debris from the destroyed reactor cores until into the next decade. According to Reuters, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that he is coordinating emergency response for the earthquake on Thursday. A government spokesman added that a Mitsubishi Steel Manufacturing plant in the city of Muroran also caught fire, but is being brought under control.

Reuters Editorial,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese nuclear energy station is relying on emergency back up power after a powerful earthquake knocked out electricity on the northern island of Hokkaido on Thursday, a stark reminder of the Fukushima disaster more than seven years ago. The three-reactor Tomari nuclear plant, operated by Hokkaido Electric Power and in shutdown since the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster, lost power after a magnitude 6.7 quake hit the island in the early hours, the government said. The station’s fuel rods are being cooled with emergency power supplied by diesel generators, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Thursday. There were no radiation irregularities at the plant, Suga said, citing the operator. The atomic regulator said the diesel generators have enough fuel to last seven days. More than 100 have been injured and 19 are missing following the quake, according to broadcaster NHK. On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9 earthquake, the most powerful recorded in Japan, struck off the northern Honshu coast. The quake set off a massive tsunami that devastated a wide swathe of the Pacific coastline and left nearly 20,000 dead. The quake knocked out power to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and the tsunami swamped diesel generators placed low in reactor buildings, leading to a series of explosions and meltdowns in the world’s worst nuclear disaster for 25 years. The crisis led to the shutdown of the country’s nuclear industry, once the world’s third-biggest. Seven reactors have come back online after a protracted relicensing process. The majority of Japanese people remain opposed to nuclear power after Fukushima highlighted failings in regulation and operational procedures in the industry. Hokkaido Electric has shut down all fossil fuel plants, cutting power to all its nearly 3 million customers, a spokesman told Reuters by phone. Japan’s industry minister, Hiroshige Seko, has instructed Hokkaido Electric to restart its biggest coal plant after the station was tripped by the earthquake. The blackout shut down Hokkaido’s New Chitose Airport, a popular gateway to the most northern of Japan’s main islands, the second major airport to be knocked out in the country in two days after a typhoon swamped the nation’s third-biggest. Japan is in the midst of a record tourism boom and will host the Olympics in 2020. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, arriving at his office before 6 a.m., told reporters saving lives was the priority as his government set up a command center to coordinate relief and rescue. A fire broke out at a steel plant operated by Mitsubishi Steel Manufacturing in the city of Muroran, but has largely been brought under control, a spokesman told Reuters. Idemitsu Kosan, Japan’s second biggest refiner by sales, stopped all refining and product shipments at its 150,000 barrels per day Hokkaido refinery, an official told Reuters.

http://www.facebook.com/Q13FOX,"SEATTLE — Imagine getting a text alert on your cellphone. An earthquake is coming. You have 15 seconds – at most – before it hits. How much could you really prepare for in 15 seconds? A lot, says Douglas Given, United States Geological Survey’s Early Warning Coordinator. “Early warning, of even a few seconds, would give you a jump on protective action,” Given says. “There are lots of situations where a few seconds or even tens of seconds of warning is enough to get out of harm’s way.” How does it work? USGS's Shake Alert Early Warning system is rolling out this year in Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Using a network of 850 sensors, the Shake Alert Early Warning system will detect an earthquake at one seismograph, then send warnings to other areas before that same earthquake can hit a few miles away. The initial roll out will give warnings to some governmental and transportation agencies, but the ultimate hope is to have an sent to cellphones in the area. It's not an earthquake predictor, Given says, but a way to know a few seconds early that a potentially destructive earthquake is coming. ""The amount of time you get depends on your distance from the earthquake,"" Given says, noting that locations further away from the epicenter will have more warning time. Given and other researchers started building Shake Alert in 2006. They hope to put 1,675 sensors down, and have a comprehensive warning system for the entire West Coast. This year's launch will serve agencies capable of utilizing an automatic system, such as one that could immediately shut off heavy machinery or slow trains. ""There are hundreds of things that can done with an automatic system,"" Given said. 'This can help reduce mass casualty events' San Francisco's rapid transportation system, BART, has been using Shake Alert since 2012, Given says. When an earthquake is spotted, BART almost instantaneously slows down its trains through a computer system. With research showing trains have a tendency to derail during an earthquake, this automatic application may save hundreds. ""They saw the value of (Shake Alert) very early on,"" Given says. ""This can help reduce mass casualty events. There are all sorts of applications for early warning."" But the idea of the Seattle resident getting a text alert - notifying them that an earthquake is coming - is about 3 to 5 years off, Given says. A personal early warning system is blocked by the speed in which alerts can be sent. Working with the cell companies and agencies like FEMA, it would still take almost a minute to send out mass warnings. Too long for an earthquake warning, Given says. ""One of the specific limitations of our limited public roll-out is the ability to do mass notifications to the public fast enough,"" Given says. ""It's not an unreasonable expectation, it's just not possible to do it yet."" How much warning will we ever get? Given says USGS is working with FEMA and the cell industry to reduce delays. A pilot project for individuals is in the works at a few agencies in Los Angeles. Given was not sure which companies and agencies in Seattle signed up for the early warning system, noting it would be ""a number of technical and industrial users."" He knew of at least one water company that planned to use the Shake Alert system in Seattle, shutting down certain pumps to prevent against damage. Given was clear to remind people this isn't earthquake prediction, it's just ""very rapid detection."" Ten or 20 seconds seems about the best warning we can get, as a sort of earthquake prediction seems is almost impossible, Given says. ""You're not ever going to get 10 minutes,"" Given says. The USGS will host a free public lecture on the Shake Alert system in California Thursday night, and it's available on live-stream.","SEATTLE -- Imagine getting a text alert on your cellphone.

Vanessa Romo,"Rescuers are seen entering a building that collapsed onto its side from an early morning 6.4 magnitude earthquake in Hualien County, eastern Taiwan, Wednesday, Feb. 7 2018. Tian Jun-hsiung/AP A series of earthquakes is rocking Taiwan, leaving two dead and more than 100 injured, according to the Associated Press, which cites Taiwan's Premier William Lai. The temblors started late Tuesday night, toppling buildings, destroying one bridge, and buckling paved streets along the island's eastern coast. The quakes continue to jolt the area near Hualien County through early Wednesday morning. The latest AP tally reports 144 people are injured. Four buildings have collapsed and one bridge has been damaged, Taiwan's National Fire Agency told ABC News. The largest quake so far was reported at 11:50 p.m. Tuesday night local time, registering at 6.4 magnitude by the United States Geological Survey. The Central Weather Bureau, which tracks seismic activity in Taiwan, reported the epicenter of the earthquake was at sea about 18.3 kilometers north of Hualien City. The Central News Agency reported that the ground floor of the Marshal Hotel, a building in Hualien district, had caved in and people were believed to be trapped inside. According to ABC, ""there were over 100 guests in the hotel at the time of the quake, and at least three people remain trapped, the department said. Firefighters are continuing to deal with gas leaks and fires as a result of the quake."" And, the AP says, Taiwanese media reported that a separate hotel known as the Beautiful Life Hotel is tilting. Compilation footage posted to Twitter by the China Global Television Network shows a building tilting on its side over a line of cars parked along the street. People can be seen running down the street, carrying ladders to climb over the rubble and reach people still inside the collapsed building. Another clip shows the damage caused inside a store. A handful of employees race out of frame as merchandise is shaken off the shelves and onto the ground. Don Blakeman, a geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information Center, says the temblors have continued into the early morning hours on Wednesday. There have been three aftershock quakes over 5.0 so far. And, he added, these are just the latest in a series of quakes that began last week. The AP reported the 6.4 temblor followed one over the weekend off the coast of Hualien, which lies along the famed ""Pacific Rim of Fire"" known for seismic activity from Alaska to Southeast Asia. This is a developing story. Some facts reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from police officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops.","The earthquake struck the island late Tuesday night and aftershocks continue to shake up the city of Hualien.

Agustinus Beo Da Costa,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi jumped to 384 on Saturday, authorities said, with many of those killed swept away by giant waves as they played on the beach. Strong aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday morning after waves up to six meters (18 feet) high swept through the scenic tourist town on Friday, triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on land. “When the (tsunami) threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB said in news briefing in Jakarta. Hundreds of people were preparing for a beach festival to celebrate Palu’s anniversary. The festival was due to start Friday night. Some people climbed six meter (18 feet) trees to escape the tsunami and survived, Nugroho said. Photos confirmed by authorities showed bodies being lined up along the street on Saturday, some in bags and some with their faces covered with clothes. Amateur footage shown by local TV stations, which could not immediately be authenticated by Reuters, showed waters crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city. Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” with thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed, a bridge washed away and the main highway to Palu cut due to a landslide. Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured. Dozens of injured people were being treated in makeshift medical tents set up outdoors, TV images showed. Indonesia’s meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake, but lifted it 34 minutes later. The agency has been widely criticized for not informing a tsunami had hit Palu on Saturday, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued. The quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu and on Saturday authorities were still having difficulties coordinating rescue efforts. The disaster mitigation agency has not been able to get any information from the fishing town of Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the quake 27 km (16 miles) away. More than 600,000 people live in Donggala and Palu. Chief security minister Wiranto told TVOne the military had started sending in cargo planes from the capital Jakarta carrying relief aid. The city’s airport remained closed after its runway and air traffic control tower was damaged in the quake but officials said they were preparing to reopen to allow aid to come in. Nugroho, spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency, said no command center for disaster recovery has been created yet. The Palu area was hit by a less powerful quake earlier on Friday, which destroyed some houses, killed one person and injured at least 10 in Donggala, authorities said. The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the second quake at a strong 7.5, after first saying it was 7.7. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In August, a series of major quakes killed over 500 people in the tourist island of Lombok and destroyed dozens of villages along its northern coast. Palu was hit by tsunami in 1927 and 1968, according to BNPB.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia is in a race against time to save victims of a devastating earthquake and tsunami on Sulawesi island, the government said on Tuesday, as the official death toll rose to more than 1,200 and looting fueled fears of lawlessness. Four days after the double disaster struck, officials feared the toll could soar, as most of the confirmed dead had come from Palu, a small city 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. Some remote areas have been largely cut off after Friday’s 7.5 magnitude quake triggered tsunami waves, destroying roads and bridges, and their losses have yet to be determined. “The team is racing against time because it’s already D+four,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of National Disaster Mitigation Agency, told a briefing in Jakarta, referring to four days since the quake. He said rescuers had reached all four of the badly affected districts, which together have a population of 1.4 million, but he declined to give an estimate of casualties. He gave few details of the conditions rescuers had found, saying they were similar to those in Palu. Earlier, President Joko Widodo called for reinforcements in the search for survivors saying everyone had to be found. The official death toll surged to 1,234 with 800 people seriously injured. There has been particular concern about Donggala, a district of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the quake, which only a few aid workers have managed to reach. Nugroho said it had been “devastated” by the tsunami. A video from the district, broadcast by the Antara state news agency, showed widespread destruction, including flattened buildings and a ship hurled into port buildings by the tsunami. “What we need is food, water, medicine, but to up now we’ve got nothing,” said an unidentified man standing in ruins. In Palu, tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) smashed into the beachfront, while hotels and shopping malls collapsed in ruins. About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood were swallowed up by ground liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid, and hundreds of people are believed to have perished, the disaster agency said. Before-and-after satellite pictures showed a largely built-up neighborhood just south of Palu’s airport seemingly wiped clean of all signs of life by liquefaction. Nugroho said Sigi district was “flattened” by liquefaction. Among the dead were 34 children killed at a Christian bible study camp. LEAVING AND LOOTING More than 65,000 homes were damaged and more than 60,000 people have been displaced and are in need of emergency help. Thousands of people have been streaming out of stricken areas. Commercial airlines have struggled to restore operations at Palu’s damaged airport but military aircraft have taken some survivors out. Many more want to leave. The government has ordered that aid be airlifted in but there’s little sign of help on Palu’s shattered streets and survivors appeared increasingly desperate. A Reuters news team saw a shop cleared by about 100 people, shouting, scrambling and fighting each other for items including clothes, toiletries, blankets and water. Many people grabbed diapers while one man clutched a rice cooker as he headed for the door. Non-essential goods were scattered on the floor amid shards of broken glass. Police were at the scene but did not intervene. The government has played down looting saying victims could take essentials and shops would be compensated. Indonesia is all too familiar with earthquakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. It has said it would accept offers of international aid, after shunning outside help this year when an earthquake struck Lombok island. A spokesman for the main U.N. aid coordinating agency, OCHA, said humanitarian agencies were in contact with the government and ready to help. “There is an immediate need for food, clean water, shelter, medical care and psycho-social support,” the spokesman, Jens Laerke, told a briefing in Geneva. State port operator Pelindo IV said a ship carrying 50 tonnes of supplies including rice and baby milk had arrived in Palu on Monday. It was unclear if the aid had been distributed. ‘BURIED FAST’ Power has yet to be restored and aftershocks have rattled nerves but rescuers in Palu held out hope they could still save lives. “We suspect there are still some survivors trapped inside,” the head of one rescue team, Agus Haryono, told Reuters at the collapsed Hotel Roa Roa as he pored over its blueprints. About 50 people were believed to have been caught inside the hotel when it was brought down. About nine bodies have been recovered and three rescued alive. Elsewhere, on the outskirts of Palu, lorries brought 54 bodies to a mass grave. Most had not been claimed, a policeman said, but some relatives came to pay respects to loved ones at the 50-meter (165 ft) trench. Rosmawati Binti Yahya, 52, was still looking for her missing daughter. But her husband was among the victims laid in the grave. “It’s OK if he’s buried in the mass grave, it’s better to have him buried fast,” she said.

Reuters Editorial,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Rescue teams in Indonesia struggled on Sunday to reach communities feared devastated by a major earthquake and tsunami on Sulawesi island, with a toll of more than 400 killed expected to rise sharply as contact is restored with remote areas. Dozens of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of two hotels and a mall in the city of Palu, which was hit by waves as high as six meters (20 feet) following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday. A young woman was pulled alive from the rubble of the Roa Roa Hotel, the news website Detik.com reported. Hotel owner Ko Jefry told Metro TV on Saturday that up to 60 people were believed trapped. Hundreds of people gathered at the mall searching for loved ones. “We’ve got information from people that their relatives are still inside, so we’re focusing on that, especially to find survivors,” a rescuer identified as Yusuf, working at the ruins of the mall, told Metro TV. Graphic: Sulawesi map - tmsnrt.rs/2OYa4YD With confirmed deaths only from Palu, authorities are bracing for much worse as reports filter in from outlying areas, in particular, Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and closer to the epicenter of the quake. Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the toll could rise into the thousands. A disaster official said the tsunami traveled across the sea at speeds of 800 kph (500 mph) before striking the shore and casualties could have been caused along a 300 km (200 miles) stretch of coast, north and south of Palu. Donggala town has been extensively damaged, with houses swept into the sea and bodies trapped in debris, according to a Metro TV reporter on the scene. The Red Cross said it had heard nothing from the Donggala region. “This is extremely worrying,” it said in a statement. “This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.” National search and rescue agency chief Muhammad Syaugi told Reuters rescuers were flying to Donggala by helicopter. QUESTIONS ABOUT WARNINGS Indonesia is all too familiar with deadly earthquakes and tsunamis. In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean, killing 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Questions are sure to be asked why warning systems set up around the country after that disaster appear to have failed on Friday. The meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the Friday quake but lifted it 34 minutes later, drawing criticism it had withdrawn it too quickly. But officials said they estimated the waves had hit while the warning was in force. Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on Palu’s beach when the water smashed onshore at dusk. Palu is at the head of a narrow bay, about 10 km long and 2 km wide, which had “amplified” the force of the wave as it was funneled toward the city, a geophysics agency official said. Questions have been raised about what caused the tsunami, with speculation an underwater landslide was to blame. The BMKG said its closest sensor, about 200 km (125 miles) from Palu, had only recorded an “insignificant”, six-cm (2.5 inches) wave, while researchers said it was surprising the quake, which was recorded as a “strike-slip” event, when tectonic plates move horizontally against each other rather than vertically, had generated a tsunami. “It may be that the shock of the quake triggered a landslide underwater, but we don’t have any proof yet,” Abdul Muhari, who heads a tsunami research team that advises the government, told Reuters. Video footage on social media showed a man on the upper floor of a building shouting warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below moments before the wave crashed ashore. Reuters was not able to authenticate the footage. The Head of the National Disaster Management Agency, Willem Rampangilei, told reporters in Sulawesi late on Saturday rescuers were struggling in their hunt for more victims. “We are having difficulty deploying heavy equipment... because many of the roads leading to Palu city are damaged,” he was quoted by the Kompas newspaper as saying. About 10,000 displaced people were scattered at 50 different places in Palu, he said. Dozens of injured people were being treated in tents set up in the open. ‘HORRIFYING’ Photos confirmed by authorities showed bodies lined up on a street on Saturday, some in bags and some with their faces covered by clothes. President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers on Sunday. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Indonesia had not asked for help but he had contacted President Widodo overnight to offer support and deep sympathies. “It is horrifying... If he needs our help, he’ll have it,” he told ABC TV’s Insiders program. The military has started sending in aircraft with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said. Palu’s airport was damaged in the quake, but had reopened for limited commercial flights, authorities said. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In August, a series of quakes killed more than 500 people on the tourist island of Lombok, hundreds of kilometers southwest of Sulawesi.
