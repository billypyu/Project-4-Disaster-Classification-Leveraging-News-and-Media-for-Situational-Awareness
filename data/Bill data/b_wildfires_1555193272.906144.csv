Matt Simon,"Actions have consequences, as our parents likely told us as kids. But inaction has consequences, too. Life or death consequences, in the case of Californias new normal of massive, climate-change-driven wildfires.
After a series of devastating fires over the last few years, critics have turned their ire toward PG&amp;E, a utility that brings electricity to 5.4 million households and businesses in Northern California. Its equipment has been blamed for 17 of 21 major fires in 2017 alone. Facing the prospect that itll be officially implicated in last Novembers Camp Fire, which virtually destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 86, the utility has announced that its seeking bankruptcy protection.
What happens to PG&amp;E nextwhether it sells off bits of the business to survive, or the state forces the company to split up, or its turned into a public utilityisnt clear. But safety will haunt the utility no matter what. They have a failed track record, says California State Senator Jerry Hill. They have no safety culture today.
Preventing electrical equipment from sparking fires is not some arcane art. But it does have its complications, and forcing a utility to get its act together might require forceful regulation of the kind typically reserved for a railroad baron.
The biggest threat to the electric grid is wind. In California this becomes particularly problematic in the fall, when seasonal winds tear in from the east. These winds are hot and dry, and desiccate the vegetation, making ignition all but certain.
High wind not only makes the fire spread very fast, but it also knocks all those power lines and knocks all the equipment, which can generate explosions of sparks, whether that's arcing between lines or transformers exploding, says Michael Gollner, a fire protection engineer at the University of Maryland. It's almost always due to either collapse of power utility poles or contact between different lines.
Those complications arent necessarily a problem if the equipment is surrounded by pavement. But miles upon miles of power lines are strung through the wildlands of California, where they are surrounded by unkempt brush.
Even before these seasonal winds arrive, the lines are a major liability. We hit these really, really dry periods throughout the west in the summertime, says fire ecologist Robert Gray. That means a whole lot of air conditioners running. There's more juice running through the line and it sags closer to lower vegetation.
One fix is to bury the lines, but that doesnt work in much of California, where a lot of rock sits at the surface. You could do it, but it would be enormously expensive. Even if lines were buried where theres dirt, digging them up to do repairs is still pricey.
Then why dont utilities just cut power to lines when they know strong winds are coming? They do, actually, but that call is far from simple. You also cut off certain communities from vital services, says Gollner. You can turn off medical equipmentthere's all sorts of things to consider when you make those decisions. They have to weigh both liabilities, which is bizarre.
The best thing to do now, experts say, is to take a page from the era of railroad barons and rein in the utilities. From the 19th century well into the 1920s, America had a serious problem with railway fires. Burning coal or wood threw sparks out of the engine, which easily ignited vegetation around the tracks. It was like dragging a flare across the countryside.
Then regulators said: Yeah, thats going to have to stop. They made the railroads adopt spark arrestors. They required inspections for brakes, says wildfire historian Stephen Pyne. There were laws passed.
Regulators dragged the railroads into court if they didnt comply. A century ago, this was a huge industry, big money, big political clout, says Pyne. That's not unlike the power line situation.
First and foremost: lines simply have to be kept away from brush. That means a whole lot of money spent in fuel management, which California has been historically terrible at. In California, utilities are legally liable for any fire their equipment starts, even if they arent deemed to be negligent, so they better be damn sure that that equipment is clear of brush. That costs money, but its a tiny investment compared to paying for the ravages of wildfiresPG&amp;E says its facing a liability of $30 billion from just two years worth of conflagrations. Hence bankruptcy.
(PG&amp;E declined to comment for this story, pointing instead to a press release that says it will make investments in system safety as it works with regulators, policymakers and other key stakeholders to consider a range of alternatives to provide for the safe delivery of natural gas and electric service for the long-term in an environment that continues to be challenged by climate change.)
Utilities know full well how to manage their risk. Both Pyne and Hill point to San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, which regulators found liable for the Witch Fire of 2007, as a model of current safety practices. For instance, it created a weather center that monitors for fire conditions. They created a new industry standard that has been ignored by PG&amp;E almost in every regard,"" says Hill. ""Ignoring those basic practices I believe resulted in the fires of 2017 and 2018.
In the long term, though, the solution may be for communities to become more independent about their power. Its not hard to foresee a future (however far off) in which electricity is much more decentralized: Instead of power coming from massive plants dotted throughout California, neighborhoods could establish their own hubs, using solar or wind power to charge large batteries throughout town. Outfitting your home with solar panels still aint exactly cheap, sure, but that price will continue to drop as the technology evolves. And decentralization in California very much depends on PG&amp;Es fate: If the state ends up breaking the utility into smaller entities, that might make things easier.
It's burying lines where we can, where it's feasible and appropriate,"" says Gray. ""It's decentralizing the hub so if you do have a power outage it doesn't impact huge areas. But it's also a system that uses a multitude of different sources of energy.
This is scary new era of climate-change-driven wildfires. But by reining in the utilities, just as we reined in the once-almighty railroads, perhaps we can help avoid catastrophes like Paradise.

CARL ZIMMER,"For early studies of fire refugia, ecologists hiked through forests and grasslands, inspecting islands that withstood surrounding flames. Now researchers are scrutinizing fire refugia from space. With nearly 50 years of satellite data, theyre starting to piece together the recent history of these sanctuaries. After a fire wipes out a forest, fire refugia stand out as green jewels scattered across the blackened land. Depending on the forest, up to 25 percent of it may survive in refugia, Dr. Krawchuk estimated. Sometimes a forest refugium survives a particular blaze thanks to luck. We might have a change of wind, it cools down at night, and the fire might not grab that patch of forest, said Arjan Meddens, a fire ecologist at the University of Idaho and lead author of the BioScience review. But when researchers look at satellite images from other years, they see that some refugia are different. There are some places in the landscape that seem to avoid fire time and time again, said Dr. Krawchuk. The most interesting thing is why, she added. What makes that green spot stay that way? There are probably many factors at work. In the Northern Hemisphere, the north sides of mountains favor refugia. The plants there get less sunlight that their south-facing counterparts. They often hold more water in their trunks and roots, and they grow in moister soil that can tamp down fires. Fire refugia dont have to endure for centuries to be ecologically important. Even a fleeting shelter can be important for local biodiversity.","The Delta Fire burning in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in California last month.

Matt Simon,"Nestled in the foothills of Californias Sierra Nevada Mountains is the quaint Gold Rush town of Nevada City. Surrounded by unkempt brush, the old, highly flammable city is in danger: with Californias wildfires raging with unprecedented ferocity in recent years, one spark could doom Nevada City to the same fate that neighboring Paradise met in November.
But not if the goats get there first. Realizing its predicament, Nevada City has launched a crowdfunding campaign to pay goats (or, more accurately, their herders) to clear brush at the edges of town. Its called, yes, Goat Fund Me. And its part of an ungulate awakening: All across the state, business is booming for herders as panicked homeowners and towns reckon with the wildfire menace.
There is no single explanation for why Californias wildfire problem has gotten so bad. Climate change is oneless rain in the fall means dryer brush, which in turn coincides with seasonal winds that fan massive blazes. More cities encroaching on wildlands is another.
Yet a third factorthe one most pertinent to the interests of goatsis the fact that California has been really, really bad about clearing the brush that turns into tinder. For comparison, the southeastern US, an area only five times bigger than California, did prescribed burns on 5.5 million acres last year, 100 times more than the Golden State. Prescribed burns are expensive, and a huge chunk of Californias fire money goes to battling ever-larger blazes.
Goats, though? A herd's work is relatively cheap, around $1,000 an acre (200 goats can tear through an acre a day). I realized money was an issue, says Nevada City vice mayor Reinette Senum, who launched Goat Fund Me. We can go out and pursue grants but that takes months, and we don't have months. The best time for the goats to do their thing is in the winter, before new growth blooms during the rains of spring. That and the ranchers already have their goats rented out for the rest of the year.
The first step is to identify the most prone areas with the help of the fire chief, then reach out to residents there to tell them that there might soon be a special scent in the air. You've got to let neighbors know: for a couple days you might get a smell, says Senum. Your dogs might be disturbed because they're smelling goats and may want to go after them.
To be clear, the goats dont work alone. They have human handlers and their own muscle in the form of a big white dog. They're fiercely protective, says Brad Fowler, owner of the vegetation management company The Goat Works, which is working with the city. In California we've got mountain lions and coyotes and recently wolves. The dogs, just by their presence and their bark, discourage predators to go somewhere else.
The operation doesnt simply amount to letting goats loose on a property. Basically we have a mobile ranch, says Fowler. We're taking a ranch essentially with all the infrastructure that's included in that to every place we go. The team sets up solar-powered electric fences to keep the goats penned in a particular area. If possible they hunt down local creeks or ponds, but they may also truck in their own water.
But for the most part, once theyre in place, the goats are self-starters. Theyre highly efficient vegetation managers, since they convert a plants solar energy into protein and poop, which nourishes the ecosystem, whereas human crews have to cart off what they clear. Theyll eat most plants from the shoulder up, so dead grasses and such. (If you want to really clear grass, sheep are your best bet.) Nevada City has a particular problem with out-of-control blackberry bushes, whose thorns are no problem for the goats. They've got really nimble lips, says Fowler. It's funny to watch them. They'll hold the branch with their lips and reach in and bite it off with their back teeth.
Being goats, though, they dont necessarily abide by human notions of containment. A bad day would be, you get a call that all your animals are two miles away from where they're supposed to be, says Fowler. The good news is when that happens, people don't get as upset about it as they would if, say, your bulldozer got loose and ran over a bunch of houses. As long as they stay out of traffic, Im OK.
On their own, goats only do part of the job; theyre more of an advance party. They get in there and strip out the brush enough for human crews to come in with chainsaws to cart away the bigger branches and such. Of particular convenience is the fact that goats will happily eat poison oak. They're cute little things, but it's only one little piece, says Senum. Who doesn't love a goat?
Still, the firefighting ruminant business is booming in California, beyond Nevada City. It seems like everybody kind of woke up with these big fires, says Fowler. And I tell you what, there's a huge opportunity. If somebody wants to get into the business, now would be a good time.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"When a cautious, science-based and largely apolitical group like the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the world must utterly transform its energy systems in the next decade or risk ecological and social diaster, attention must be paid. The panel, created in 1988, synthesizes the findings of leading climate scientists, an undertaking for which it received the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. It is not in the habit of lecturing governments. But its latest report, issued near Seoul on Monday, is very different. One United Nations official described it as a deafening, piercing smoke alarm going off in the kitchen an alarm aimed directly at world leaders. Frankly, weve delivered a message to the governments, said Jim Skea, a co-chairman of the panel and a professor at Imperial College, London. Its now their responsibility to decide whether they can act on it. Unfortunately, no alarm seems loud enough to penetrate the walls of the White House or the cranium of its principal occupant. President Trump had nothing substantive to say about the report, preferring, his staff said, to focus on celebrating the elevation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Having already announced that he would withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change, having also rolled back a suite of Obama-era efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Mr. Trump thus reaffirmed his sorry role as an outlier in the global struggle against climate change a struggle few believe can be won without the enthusiastic participation of the United States. The report, written by 91 scientists from 40 countries, came about at the request of several small island nations that took part in the Paris talks, where 195 countries pledged their best efforts to limit increases in global warming to 3.6 degrees (2 degrees Celsius) below preindustrial levels. Fearing that their countries might someday be lost to rising seas, they asked the intergovernmental panel for further study of a lower threshold, 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius). The panels report concluded that the stricter threshold should become the new target. The alternative is catastrophe mass die-offs of coral reefs, widespread drought, famine and wildfires, and potentially conflict over land, food and fresh water.",New research has found that wildfires are likely to worsen if steps are not taken to combat climate change.,2018-10-09T22:35:49Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","‘A Deafening, Piercing Smoke Alarm’",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/opinion/climate-change-ipcc-report.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/09/opinion/09climateWeb/09climateWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfires,0

Welcome to 2018. Everyone from firefighters to the CNN weather guy knows this is wrong, wrong, wrong, so lets break it down: These arent all forest fires The Camp fire did start in a forested area, but the southern California fires did not. As the Pasadena Fire Association replied, these are better described as urban interface firesin other words, ones that start in places where homes are built among flammable vegetation. Wildland fire is a more accurate term, which encompasses brush fires, rangeland fires, and more. So if you imagine nothing but trees burning, youve got the wrong image in your head to start with. There is one big reason for these massive, deadly and costly wildland fires Climate change. We really have to go over this again? Of Californias 10 most destructive fires, nine have been in the last 15 years. Five are from 2017 and 2018. The recipe for these fires requires a few common ingredients : Houses very close to flammable vegetation Dry weather making that vegetation extra flammable High-pressure winds from the jet stream, which occur around this time of year. The hotter California gets, the drier it gets. And the extreme dryness makes the vegetationnot just trees, but also brush and grassesburn more easily. The drier the land, the smaller a spark it takes to catch fire. Then, hot, dry gusts of wind suck up even more moisture, and they push fires forward, throwing embers onto houses and other fuel in their path. Watch this exasperated meteorologist explain it better than I can. President Donald Trump tweeted some incredibly ignorant things over the weekend about the wildfires Read more Read Forest management may be a dog whistle for the logging industry Politicians including Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke have been advocating for fuels reduction management. The thinking seems to be: remove the forest, and you cant have forest fires. In effect, this means opening up lands to logging. But, as Outside explains here, logging isnt effective at removing the kinds of fuel that wildfires thrive on. Loggers want to take the biggest, most commercially valuable trees, and leave the saplings and brush. Guess what catches fire really well? Yeah. Saplings and brush. Funding is necessary for preventing fires and helping affected communities Its not clear what federal funding you could remove from the picture and make fire management better. Much of the area thats burning is federal land anyway. And until 2020, the US Forest Service still has to cannibalize its own fire prevention budget to find the money to put out fires that are already burning.

MITCH SMITH,"“We may not be able to feed the cows enough to gain weight,” said Michael Kelsey of the Oklahoma Cattlemen’s Association, which has been taking donations to provide hay and other supplies. “But if we can feed the cows enough to maintain, we’re in good shape. That’s just the reality of the disaster.” Rhett Smith’s ranch on a gravel road outside Taloga, Okla., was directly in the flames’ path. Unlike some of his neighbors, Mr. Smith saved his house and his 100 cows. But his grass was gone. So when two tractor-trailers carrying 64 bales of hay rolled down Mr. Smith’s winding driveway, a sense of relief washed over him. The hay would be enough to feed his cattle and his neighbors’ herds for at least a few weeks. The trucks were driven by Levi Smith and his brother, Blake, who raise cattle about 100 miles from Vici, along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. The brothers had never met Rhett Smith before — and are no relation to him — but they said they empathized with all he was going through. Their family’s land burned last year, the brothers said. And donated hay had gotten their cattle through it. Photo Eddie Fahley tossed a strap to Matt Schaller in Vici, Okla., as they secured a load of hay for a rancher whose land burned. Credit Mitch Smith/The New York Times “They think it can’t get any worse,” Levi Smith said, “but when these loads of hay come in, it gives you hope.” In the sparsely populated counties where cattle roam, people rely on neighbors and take pride in giving help without being asked. Signs around Vici (which is pronounced “Vy-Sigh”) offer free meals, free clothes, free care for orphaned calves. In nearby Lenora, hay bales are stacked along the side of a road for whoever might need them. As eager as people are to assist, they also seem reluctant to receive. “Nobody wants to take any help if they don’t have to,” said Nick Campbell, a town trustee in Vici. “We’re trying to get them to understand that we’re there for them, whatever they need.” The Oklahoma fires, which burned an area about the size of Chicago and New York City put together, made relatively few national headlines. But in agricultural circles — and especially in places that have seen their own fires — word of the destruction spread swiftly. Prairie fires are a fact of life on the Great Plains, but recent years have brought a series of unusually strong, multiday blazes that set records and spread out of control. When Travis Brown lost much of his pasture in Montana’s fires last summer, other ranchers sent hay. Photo Firefighters struggled to fight a fire near Seiling, Okla. Credit Nick Oxford/Reuters So when Mr. Brown heard about the new fires in Oklahoma, he and three other Montana ranchers paid about $940 each to send more than 100 hay bales to Oklahoma. “I remember the feeling of just being overwhelmed after seeing so much of our livelihood burned,” Mr. Brown said. “The smoke hadn’t event cleared away yet, and people are saying, ‘You’re going to be O.K.’” Around Vici and Taloga, where drivers greet passing trucks with a wave and the skyline is dotted with wind turbines and oil pumpjacks, the flames have subsided. But the damage remains. The fire’s timing was especially cruel, coming in the midst of an extreme drought. Dead cows appear along roadsides, hooves pointed to the sky. Driveways lead to piles of rubble. When the wind blows, it smells a bit like a campfire. “You can see across the river and just see the black as far as you can see,” said Lori White, a Putnam, Okla., rancher who lost a calf and about a third of her pasture in the fire, and who has been helping coordinate hay deliveries for ranchers who fared worse. Last weekend, as a much-needed rainstorm tamped down the last of the flames, Matt Schaller delivered hay to ranchers around Vici. Mr. Schaller, who works on a grain farm, had driven more than 1,100 miles from Michigan with a load of donated bales, part of a nonprofit group he helped start last year after making deliveries during the Kansas fires. “It’s just what you do,” Mr. Schaller said.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Californias 2018 is officially the worst year for wildfires in recorded state history, the Los Angeles Times reported on Saturday, citing the National Interagency Coordination Centers year-end statistical analysis. The 1.8 million acres of California land that burned last year was more than any other state in 2018, and it far surpassed 2017's tally of 1.3 million acres in California. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Scott McLean confirmed to the Times that the wildfires were unprecedented.
The Times wrote:
More than 100 people were killed and 17,000 homes and 700 businesses were destroyed in a state where fires are considered one of the annual seasons. Crews responded to more than 8,000 fires last year.
Its a surprise its that amount, but in a sense because of what Ive seen over the last year, no its not, McLean said. Its what weve been living through.
... Firefighters said the most devastating blazes had the most extreme behaviorwind-driven ember storms that created spot fires far beyond defensive lines and, in the case of the Carr fire, a fire tornado that ignited objects lifted into the air.
Many of the recorded deaths happened during the Camp Fire, which rampaged across Butte County and killed some 86 people, mainly as it rolled through the town of Paradise and burned most of it to the ground. The Camp Fire and the Woolsey Fire, both in November, burned more than 250,000 acres alone, the Times noted.
After a seven-year drought from 2010 to 2017, much of California remains a tinderbox with estimates that there are over 147 million dead trees throughout the state. The end of the drought poses its own problems, as fast-growing grasses and other small plants can dry out and catch flame themselves, carrying blazes right to other sources of fuel. Californias rapidly growing population (which has almost doubled since the 1970s) has also brought many more communities into areas at high risk of fires.
Recent research has also indicated that the historical distinction between the December-February wet season and the fire season has largely disappeared, in part due to climate change.
Last year, Cal Fire Director Ken Pimlott told the AP that the state government should consider a ban on building homes in potentially fire-prone areas, saying: Firefighters are living climate change, its staring them in the face everyday. He added that officials owe it to residents and emergency personnel alike to make such decisions, so that they dont have to keep going through what were going through.
California fire officials are planning a major effort to thin forests throughout the state in an effort to stave off future wildfires, but per the San Francisco Chronicle, some experts are questioning whether it will really be enough. Thinning forests reduces available fuel but can also dry out the forest floor or promote growth of less fire-resistant plants, the paper wrote. Denser forests may burn longer, but they may also burn less intensely.
University of California, Santa Barbara UC Cooperative Extension wildfire researcher Max Moritiz told the Chronicle, Its not fair to say that fuel treatments wont do any good. It may provide some protection in some places. But most of us studying this agree that you cant just do this and (expect to) make much headway.
McLean told the paper the efforts may not stop the catastrophic scale of wildfires in recent years, but It gives the folks in those areas time to evacuate and it also give the firefighters a chance to get in there and mitigate the fire.
According to the LA Times, fire officials are bracing for the worst. McLean said that the recent wet winter has promoted even more growth in fuel, saying that its fire management programs have to continue forever. Its an ongoing process from here on out.

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Unless humans transform the economy in such a way that has no documented historic precedent, the earth will experience worsening food shortages and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040, according to a report published Monday by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And with a government hostile to any sort of climate change initiative, individuals are wondering what they can possibly do to help the planet. To be clear: Changing the course of our planets climate is not something that can be done on an individual levelgovernments across the world along with energy, agriculture and manufacturing companies need to make the biggest changes. But some investors may consider it a moral imperative not to invest in companies that are actively spurring climate change. If you want to move your investments towards companies at least trying to do the right thing, then you can try sustainable investing. For the one thousandth time, an authoritative new report tells us with great certainty thatif we Read more Read If you want a more comprehensive understanding of sustainable investing, Ive broken down what it is and its efficacy here and here. To summarize, Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) is a movement comprised of people who want to invest only in companies that meet a set of standards in regards to lowering their carbon footprint, improving energy and natural-resource use efficiency, treating their workers well, protecting their customers privacy, making safe and useful products, respecting the communities in which they operate, and governing themselves ethically, per Morningstar. Environmental sustainability and clean energy are big components of the movement. Divesting is a way to hold companies accountable, in theory, and to live out your values. If its at the center of a movement, it can start a conversation about important issues (see: any divestment campaign on a college campus). But individuals divesting from a certain company wont hurt its bottom line, or affect the stock price. On a broader level, heres how that works, explained by Voxs Matthew Yglesias back in 2014: When a non-profit endowment sells shares in ExxonMobil, ExxonMobil isnt involved in the transaction at all. The shares are sold to some third party investor who does want to own ExxonMobil shares and the company continues onward as if nothing has happened at all. This applies to individual shareholders as well. Further: Corporate executives dont care who owns their stock, but they very much do care about share prices. When investor sentiment turns against a given sector and everyone starts selling their stock, prices decline and executives worry. Divestment imitates this process, but doesnt really achieve the same thing. As long as other funds and money managers arent divesting, all that happens is that a momentary opportunity exists to pick up shares at a bargain price. Now if an enormous supermajority of investors all decided to divest, that really could push prices down. But long before you reached that level of social consensus you would have the political clout necessary to accomplish whatever it is you wanted. So, now that were clear on that, if you want to invest sustainablyan admirable goalthere are ways to do so.

But there are a few dozen fossil-free mutual funds and ETFs out there that have launched in recent years as investor appetite has grown. You can use Fossil Free Funds, an online tool, which uses Morningstar data along with the Carbon Underground 200, a list of the worlds biggest oil, gas and coal companies, to produce reports on stocks and funds. You type in a fund (one you have in your 401(k), for example), and it will detail what portion of the funds assets coincide with the Carbon Underground 200.

With a new report breaking down exactly Read more Read One thing to keep in mind: Even ETFs marketed specifically for their avoidance of companies involved in fossil-fuel-related activities, such as the SPDR S&amp;P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF (SPYX), still hold companies in oil, coal and natural gas, reports ETF.com. SPYX, for example, holds 5.72 percent of its portfolio in oilfield services firms and coal-fired utilities. That happens for a number of reasons, but, as ETF.com explains, one is that big oil and gas companies have made moves into green energy spaces: Oil producers like Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and BP have invested billions into corn-based ethanol biofuels and hydrogen fuel cells. Utilities like NextEra Energy are transitioning from coal- and natural-gas-fired plants to solar and wind to constrain costs. Oil giant Exxon Mobil even makes lubricants for wind turbines. And pure renewable energy companies arent large enough to be in many broad-based ESG ETFs, which are large cap funds specifically designed to provide marketlike exposure. Youre more likely to find them in small cap funds. Remember that these funds are actively-managed and tend to have higher fees associated with them than your standard low-cost index fund. Of course, investing in line with your morals is worth the cost of admission for many people.","Unless humans transform the economy in such a way that has “no documented historic precedent,” the earth will experience “worsening food shortages and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040,” according to a report published Monday by the…",2018-10-09T20:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Lifehacker.com'}",How to Divest from the Companies Killing the Environment,https://twocents.lifehacker.com/how-to-divest-from-the-companies-killing-the-environmen-1829625706,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--_Il_6eee--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/qichhwub4iuklkm4vi03.jpg",,Lifehacker.com,wildfires,0
Steve Dent,"The ER-2 has been scanning the blazes with a couple of interesting instruments that have flown, or will fly aboard the international space station (ISS). One of them is the AVIRIS spectrometer that can penetrate cloud, dust and smoke to see the ground below. While providing a clear image of the ground, it can also measure fine details in vegetation like water content and plant species growing. Eventually, a similar instrument will be launched into space. On the flight pictured above, however, it's carrying another instrument, the Cloud-Aerosol Multi-Angle Lidar (CAMAL). It was originally developed to a validate space-based version of the instrument called CATS, which operated for 33 months aboard the ISS, before going out of service last month. Now, CAMAL is being used for a similar purpose aboard the ER-2. Unlike other types of LiDAR used to scan the ground, CAMAL can study pollution, smoke, clouds and other atmospheric phenomena. Another view of the Thomas Fires from space Ideally, NASA flies the AVIRIS spectrometer over regions before a fire starts to get a base measurement, then overflies the same spot again afterwards. Comparing the before and after images gives researchers an idea about the severity of a fire. Meanwhile, when the blaze is active, the area can be scanned with the CAMAL LiDAR to get a picture of the dust, smoke and cloud cover in the area. Using the space-based version of the instrument, for instance, NASA scanned the October wildfires, finding plumes extending as high as 2-3 miles that created ""the worst air quality ever recorded in many parts of the Bay Area,"" NASA's CATS team said. ""The vision is that these types of measurements could be available from space in the next decade,"" said JPL's Rob Green. ""The resulting information would then be used to develop fuel maps in advance that could be used to make better predictions about where you could mitigate risk by clearing brush and trees."" CAMAL can also be used by researchers to study cloud formations and learn more about climate change, which is helping fuel the wildfires in the first place.","For the second time this year, swaths of California are burning out of control thanks to unseasonably warm and dry temperatures.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","California is burning. The state’s wild-ass wildfires are becoming the norm, but this change is something many communities in California can’t afford. These wildfires degrade the air quality—and towns near and far are feeling it. Right now, nearly 20 fires are ablaze in the state. The Mendocino Complex Fire has quickly risen to the state’s second-largest wildfire in modern history. The still-raging Carr Fire, meanwhile, is the state’s sixth most destructive. Hell, even Yosemite National Park is on fire due to the Ferguson Fire, which has been burning for 24 days and counting. “If you are near the fire or downwind of the fire, you will be impacted.” The smoke billowing out of these fires has been on the move, posing health threats to communities that might’ve not been worried about the fires at all. Smoke from the Ferguson Fire has traveled about 100 miles to Reno, Nevada, where air quality advisories are on. The smoke created when flames ignite trees and organic matter is nasty stuff full of particulate matter that can lodge itself in people’s lungs and eventually make its way to the heart. Once in our bodies, it can cause lung disease, lung cancer, and heart disease. And the toxic compounds in these particles are worse than the smoke spewing out of cars, said Greg Huey, the chair of Georgia Tech University’s Earth and Atmospheric Sciences department who’s researched the topic. “Car ignitions have a lot of emissions controls on them,” he told Earther. “Even a coal-fired power plant, which we might normally think of as dirty has quite a bit of emission control compared to wildfires. You have a lot of smoldering fires. You can see a lot of brown and black smoke, so you can see quite a range of products that come out of fires. It’s just a much dirtier combustion.” That smoke moves quickly as winds shift, and the people who lie in its path bear the consequence, said Tom Flannigan, a spokesperson with the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. “Our mountains and our microclimates are such that some areas might not be feeling any of the impact at all while others are disproportionately impacted,” he told Earther, “That is very well due to the topography of our state, but most of what we see is that if you are near the fire or downwind of the fire, you will be impacted.” Much of the air throughout the state, as well as neighboring states like Nevada and Oregon, is currently in the “unhealthy for sensitive groups” range. Where the fires have concentrated, southeast of Sacramento near the Nevada state border, the air quality is straight up unhealthy and even hazardous in some areas—for everyone. “It’s a serious public health concern that we have.” California cities already deal with some of the highest levels of air pollution in the country, especially in the state’s Central Valley, where many of its oil refineries are located. The people poised to suffer the most are the low-income families and communities of color that already deal with poor air quality on the daily due to their vicinity to industry. These fires aren’t helping. “It’s a serious public health concern that we have, so we work to let people know that they should do what they can to limit their exposure,” Flannigan said. A study published last month found that extreme air pollution days have gotten worse in the last 30 years for states from Nevada to Montana, and wildfires are largely to blame. And the situation will continue to get worse in the face of climate change. While California used to have a distinct fire season, today it’s more of a year-round thing, Flannigan said. That’s bad news for human health, Huey at Georgia Tech emphasized. “The more fires you have, the more acreages burned, the more emissions you have,” Huey said. “You’re going to raise the levels [of particulate matter] that people can be exposed to.”","California is burning.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","In California, a wet winter no longer protects landscapes from the kind of intense wildfires the states been experiencing lately. 
A new study published Monday analyzed the historical relationship between wet winters and extreme wildfires. Over the past 400 years, the two rarely overlapped, but thats all changing now.
The paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, uses climate models and weather records to piece together this relationship. The international team of researchersfrom places like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Germanys Institute of Coastal Researchfound that the North Pacific jet stream, which is usually responsible for Californias rain, determined whether the state would suffer an awful fire season between 1600 and 1903. A lot of rain from December to Februarytypically meant a low-key wildfire season.
However, that link weakened after 1903. Fast forward to 1977 and the link between the jet stream-induced rainfall and wildfires is pretty much gone.
Thats for two reasons, said lead author Eugene Wahl, a paleoclimate researcher with NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information. First, federalfire suppression policies, which began following the removal of Native Americans from their lands. Native Americans practiced subsistence burning,which reduced fuel for wildfires.Their removal (and genocide, combined with the new fire suppression policies, led to the build up of massive amounts of fire fuel.
This helped uncouple the winter Jet Stream activity from the following fire season conditions, Wahl told Earther in an email.
On top of that physical alteration to the environment, now theres climate change. Our carbon emissions are causing temperatures to rise, which is resulting in a longer, hotter fire season. This allows wildfires to thrive despite the increased wet-season moisture the team expects California will see in our changing world. In fact, increased wet-season moisture could increase fuel loads in the same way that fire suppression used to.
Just look at 2017. That year saw a very wet winter, per the study, yet it still experienced extreme events like the Thomas Fire and Tubbs Fire, which were responsible fora combined 24 deaths and 318,7000 acres burned.
The fact that such extreme wildfires happened in a year with extreme rain is a major shift. The researchers couldnt find a single such instance between 1600 and 1903, before fire suppression techniques began to infiltrate western forests. 
The end of the connection between high water seasons and low-impact wildfire seasons in 2017 could mark a new era. California officials now know fire suppression is bad policy and support prescribed burns, but that doesnt mean the fuel build-up from that policy will just disappear (say nothing of the effects of climate change).
This is bad news for California communities, especially the low income communities of color who are most vulnerable to wildfires. Heavy rains might not be enough to keep them safe anymore.","In California, a wet winter no longer protects landscapes from the kind of intense wildfires the state’s been experiencing lately.

SOMINI SENGUPTA,"This year, heat has been a problem in both northern and southern hemispheres. In Alaska, warmer-than-usual temperatures forced the cancellation of sled dog races, while cities in New Zealand, where the weather is generally so temperate that most homes dont have heating or air-conditioners, broke heat records. On Tuesday, Wellington, the capital, soared past 87 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest since record-keeping began in 1927, and Hamilton topped 91 degrees, the highest since record-keeping began in 1940.
Bob Henson, a meteorologist at Weather Underground, a forecasting service, said that in preparing for how climate change affects the weather, we have to be prepared for a wider range of possibilities.
Some preparation is connected to resiliency. Mayors promise to make their cities more resilient to climate change after one disaster or another. Scientists experiment with crop seeds that are more resilient to the vagaries of extreme heat and drought.
Dr. Kolden, the fire specialist, noted that as a species, we pride ourselves on being resilient. But that human trait can also have a downside. Its why, often, even when officials tell us to evacuate from a fire zone or a flood plain, we dont. We think well make it, because weve made it before. Or that the forecasters are wrong.
In our DNA, weve got this extreme resilience baked in, Dr. Kolden said. That ends up being our downfall when it comes to the changing conditions.

Or their deaths would be in vain.” ‘I don’t feel like doing anything.’ This year, instead of turkey and mashed potatoes, the traditional prayer before the meal and the long football game afterward, Regina Rodriguez wants to stay home, in bed. Her father, Richard, was murdered in Sutherland Springs. He raised her, and they were close. “I don’t feel like doing anything,” Ms. Rodriguez, 33, said. “I really don’t. I’m trying to figure out everything with my dad — Did he have life insurance? Did he have a will? It’s just a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff that’s going on, and I’m trying to take care of it before it’s time to go back to work, and my kids are not doing too good, and I don’t know if I should take some more time off of work —.” She paused. In recent days she had been having panic attacks. Her son Jordan, 6, had begun vomiting before bedtime. “I wish I could say we will have a happy Thanksgiving this year,” she said. “But I don’t think we will.” ‘The kids are going to be sad. But what can you do?’ Photo The Ortiz family, from left, Alexander, 16, Mia, 11, Raymond and Maria, shopped at the Food Lion grocery store in Rocky Mount, N.C. Credit Mike Belleme for The New York Times Back home on that wounded island where Raymond Ortiz’s relatives and neighbors are still waiting for water and power, a Puerto Rican Thanksgiving will somehow go on: Turkey and gravy, stuffed pasteles, rice and beans. Mr. Ortiz, his wife and teenage son and daughter will be eating thousands of miles away at his sister’s home, in their adoptive town of Rocky Mount, N.C. They joined an exodus of tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans after Hurricane Maria, and have been adjusting to life on the mainland. Mr. Ortiz grew up in New York, so it feels like a homecoming to him. But his wife and children have spent almost their entire lives on Puerto Rico, and spoke little English when they arrived. The family is grateful for power and running water, for supermarkets overflowing with affordable groceries, for the pine-scented air. But their gratitude has qualifiers. They are grateful Mr. Ortiz’s sister is letting them stay at her house, but they will soon need to find a place of their own. They are thankful they feel safe and stable, but Mr. Ortiz’s wife is not working, and their 16-year-old son has struggled to get over his shyness and the language barriers at school. “We’ll celebrate everything like normal, just without the family,” Mr. Ortiz said of his relatives in Puerto Rico. “My wife’s going to be crying. The kids are going to be sad. But what can you do? Those are the sacrifices you have to make.” ‘Part of me didn’t have it in me.’ Photo Megan and Matt Condron and their children Mason, 8, and McKenzie, 5, in the ashes of what was their home in Santa Rosa, Calif. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times Every November, inside the family home that is now ash and rubble waiting to be carted away, Megan Condron would make a “gratitude tree” that she and her children would foliate with paper leaves describing everything they were thankful for. “November is the biggest month for gratitude,” Ms. Condron, 38, said. The family’s home in Santa Rosa, Calif., was one of nearly 9,000 buildings destroyed by wildfires last month. Her sister-in-law’s home also burned down. Ms. Condron, her husband and their 8-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter have been living with her husband’s parents, and she said they have been overwhelmed by all the love, donations, gifts, meals and support from friends, family and strangers. But when her son, Mason, pointed out that the family hadn’t set up their “thankful tree” this year, Ms. Condron said she just felt like she couldn’t do it. Not with so much unmoored and dislocated. “Part of me didn’t have it in me,” she said. “We don’t have the space. This isn’t our house. I haven’t done it.” ‘I know it’s going to be hard.’ He is thankful for the time he did have with her, for the extra moments and bonus days together that he never realized would be so finite. That is what Lance Miller says now, as he thinks about the first Thanksgiving without his sister, Hannah Ahlers, 34, who was killed in the mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas last month. Ms. Ahlers was “huge on every holiday,” Mr. Miller said. She loved to decorate the Beaumont, Calif., home she shared with her husband and three children. Her Thanksgiving dinners were a plate of Americana: turkey, sweet potatoes, green bean casserole, and everyone at the table taking turns to say why they were thankful. They had all been planning to spend this Thanksgiving together, Mr. Miller said. “But, you know,” he said. Mr. Miller spent 21 years in the military, much of it apart from Ms. Ahlers and her family. Then he and his family recently moved to Beaumont, where they were a two-minute drive away. He stayed with Ms. Ahlers while the builders finished his family’s home. The families saw each other all the time. He is grateful they got that time. He is grateful, now, that he still lives near her family. “We’re here to help them,” Mr. Miller said. “I know it’s going to be hard.” ‘That’s our mantra: Just stay close with your family.’ Photo Mynda Smith took a photo of her sister’s sons, Kaden, Greysen and Braxton, and her father, Chris Davis. “Since the shooting, we’ve said, ‘You have to find light,’” Ms. Smith said. Credit Isaac Brekken for The New York Times This is the first Thanksgiving without Neysa Tonks, and her family wondered how they should spend the day. They put the question to Ms. Tonks’s three sons, who had one simple answer: Be together. The family’s close bonds grew even tighter in the weeks since Ms. Tonks, 46, was killed in the Las Vegas shooting, her parents and sister said. Her parents moved in with Ms. Tonks’s sons. Relatives often just wanted to be with one another, sitting close in the same room. They wear matching shirts with her name on the sleeves. “That’s our mantra: Just stay close with your family,” Ms. Tonks’s mother, Debbie Davis, said. Ms. Tonks’s sister, Mynda Smith, offered to serve Thanksgiving dinner at her Las Vegas home, and the guest list swelled to 30 people: a brother from Salt Lake City, friends, family and onetime strangers who became like family after the shooting.

A friend sending a smiley-face emoji. A quick check-in text message. Memories of whipped-cream fights during past holidays, or the time years ago when a young Ms. Tonks bolted from the table rather than eat her sweet potatoes. “You learn to appreciate the people who surround you so much more,” Ms. Smith said. “Since the shooting, we’ve said, ‘You have to find light. You have to find the beauty.’ It’s out there. Darkness is so strong, but light is stronger.” ‘We were in need and they felt in their heart that they were going to help.’ Photo Aracely Martinez-Ramirez, center, looked at the spot where a light fixture will be installed in the bathroom of her family’s new home in Galena Park, Tex. Credit Annie Mulligan for The New York Times On Thanksgiving Day, Aracely Martinez-Ramirez will pull on a donated red dress and head to church, where she will tell everyone what has happened to her in the last few months. In August, when Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston, Ms. Martinez-Ramirez, 20, led her three little sisters through churning, chest-high water. With no help in sight, she didn’t think they would make it out alive. When she did, she learned that the storm had destroyed her home, and that the president was considering ending the visa program that allowed her and other young immigrants — so-called Dreamers — to stay in the United States. Everything she had built seemed to be falling apart. Deportation was a possibility. But the Federal Emergency Management Agency came through, she said, providing aid that allowed her family to buy another home. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services renewed her visa, allowing her to stay. And at a time when anti-immigrant rhetoric seemed to have hit a fever pitch, dozens of people she didn’t know reached out to help. They sent food, clothing, couches, refrigerators and more. This is where she sees grace this Thanksgiving. “Nobody cared, or even asked, ‘Are you undocumented? Are you illegal?’ Nobody did that,” she said. “We were in need and they felt in their heart that they were going to help.” Photo Jessica Martinez, 9, jumped on a trampoline with her sisters, Allison, 7, and Fatima, 12.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Just when you think this wildfire season can’t get worse, something new comes along to remind you this year is truly one of rare horrors. Residents of Prince George, British Columbia—a small city 325 miles north of Vancouver—awoke to a sky seemingly devoid of sunlight. The city sits just to the east of British Columbia’s raging wildfires, which have sent smoke all the way across the Atlantic. To get there, the smoke has to pass over Prince George. Freaky orange skies have been the norm as a result, but the smoke became so thick on Friday that it turned the morning sky inky black well after sunrise. Residents turned their headlights on for the morning commute as the halogen glow of streetlights continued to illuminate the road. Even for a town that has been blanketed in smoke for more than a week, the scene was a first of its kind. In my years of covering climate change and the wildfires that accompany it, I can’t recall seeing anything quite like it myself. While conditions cleared up a bit by mid-morning, air quality remains off-the-charts bad, according to ratings from British Columbia’s government. Local journalist Nicole Oud tweeted that you “can feel the smoke and ash the second you step outside.” Other cities in the area are also dealing with high levels of pollution, which can cause respiratory problems even for healthy adults. The vast majority of the province continues to face high or extreme wildfire risk due to hot, dry conditions that have plagued much of the West Coast for the past month. Fires have burned nearly 1.1 million acres in British Columbia for the year-to-date, basically tripling the annual average. The ratio is likely to only become more lopsided with 10 new fires that lit on Thursday in addition to the 500 burning. That means it’s also possible the sunrise could again go up in smoke.","Just when you think this wildfire season can’t get worse, something new comes along to remind you this year is truly one of rare horrors.

Mark Kaufman,"Coastal cities like New York and San Francisco have already started legal battles with oil giants for knowingly fueling climate change. Now, landlocked communities in Colorado have filed their own suit against the oil companies Exxon Mobil and Suncor, both of which extract large amounts of oil and gas from the Colorado ground. The lawsuit, filed by Boulder County, San Miguel County, and the City of Boulder, seeks compensation from oil companies ""for the substantial role they played and continue to play in causing, contributing to and exacerbating climate change."" These climate alterations, they argue, have brought increased heatwaves, droughts, and fire to the region. They believe Exxon and Suncor should pay for the damages. Previously, lawsuits from coastal cities focused on sea level rise, not the other extreme manifestations of global warming. This is the first such climate lawsuit from an inland state, according to the local agencies which filed the complaint. SEE ALSO: In court, oil company admits reality of human-caused global warming, denies guilt ""A few pebbles are turning into a landslide,"" Kassie Siegel, director of the Climate Law Institute, a legal campaign to protect environments from climate change, said in an interview. ""It shows the tide is turning against fossil fuel producers,"" she said. ""This is about fairness. It's completely unfair that taxpayers are being asked to pay for the costs of the damages done by oil companies."" The Colorado counties contend that oil companies have known about the long-term effects of greenhouse gas emissions for 50 years. They cite a report that Stanford Research Institute scientists presented to the American Petroleum Institute in 1968. The report warned that carbon dioxide emissions would warm the planet, melt ice caps, and ""may be the cause of serious world-wide environmental challenges."" The report will likely serve as important evidence in the case, should the trial proceed and not be settled out of court or be derailed by a number of legal circumstances. ""I would expect that report and others like it would be key evidence in this case,"" said Siegel. A 2011 drought in Colorado destroyed a winter wheat harvest. Image: Denver Post via Getty Images The suit also cites the 2017 National Climate Assessment, in which 13 federal departments and agencies found that high-temperature events and forest fires, among many other adverse effects, are expected to increase in frequency and intensity. U.S. government scientists stated bluntly: ""This period is now the warmest in the history of modern civilization."" Some Colorado communities, who know these climatic shifts will adversely affect their business and agricultural sectors, are now working to decrease their dependency on fossil fuels. By 2030, the City of Boulder plans to generate all of its electricity from renewable energies, like solar. ""Communities in Colorado and across the country are already doing what they can to curb their carbon emissions and are spending millions of dollars to adapt to a wide array of harms caused by global warming,"" Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement. ""Those costs will only multiply over the next few decades, and taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to foot the bill that the fossil fuel industry has knowingly run up over the last 40 years."" The Union of Concerned Scientists is a nonprofit science advocacy organization that often speaks out against climate change deniers. In the western United States, one obvious consequence of increased drought and heat are wildfires. Today's wildfires burn nearly year-round and burn significantly more land than wildfires did in the '70s, '80s, and '90s, posing an outsized harm to the forested state, which is consistently battling drought and low snow pack — similar to California. Both Exxon and Suncor sell oil in Colorado. Suncor has an especially prominent presence, as the company runs its operations out of Denver, a city currently facing drought. Suncor sends over 200 truckloads of Colorado crude oil to its refineries each day. Last month, some of the nation's largest oil companies presented their understanding of climate science to a federal judge in San Francisco, in which they admitted humans were contributing to climate change, but side-stepped responsibility. These proceedings move incrementally, so it's not yet known if that hearing will advance to the next step, and then, potentially a trial. But oil companies are now being hit with lawsuits from local governments on both coasts and the interior of the U.S. ""This shows you the list of governments that are being affected and that can take action is almost limitless,"" said Siegel. ""The question is who will be next.""","Coastal cities like New York and San Francisco have already started legal battles with oil giants for knowingly fueling climate change.

Rachel Becker,"An adorable video that shows how beavers can fight wildfires is making the rounds on Twitter, and it’s everything science communication should be: short, compelling, clear, and about beavers. The stop-motion video is the work of Emily Fairfax, a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder. It shows a beaver building a dam and transforming the forest upstream into a marshy wetland filled with splotches of vegetation in shades of green. When a fire rages through the forest, the ponds of water and healthy plants protect the area above the beaver dam from the flames. That includes the beaver, which holds up a little flag that says “I’m okay!” As a scientist I've had an ""elevator speech"" prepared for a few years now. This year I made an ""elevator video"" & let me tell you: people enjoy seeing my research way more than just hearing about it! So what do #beavers have to do with #wildfire ? Watch (with sound) & find out! pic.twitter.com/axc523sRgq — Emily Fairfax (@EmilyFairfax) February 17, 2019 So far, the video has more than 180,000 views on Twitter, and it’s getting the delighted reactions it deserves. Conservation experts, teachers, and beaver advocates have all asked Fairfax for her permission to share the video. Others want to know how she made it, and, as it turns out, it’s pretty low-tech: Fairfax set up a beaver dam in her kitchen, snapped photos on her iPhone, and used an app to turn them into a stop-motion video. The whole thing started because Fairfax is wrapping up her PhD and is studying the ways that beavers can help their habitat withstand hazards like fire and drought. Now that she’s applying to jobs, she’s spending a lot of time trying to explain her research, and she realized she kept reaching for a visual aid. “I’m trying to talk with my hands, and I want to pull up all these pictures on my phone,” she tells The Verge. So she made a video instead. “People give me beaver stuff for the holidays every year.” She set the scene on a cork board at her kitchen table with construction paper, rocks from her garden, and leftover fake plants from her wedding. She made the stream, beaver dam, pond, wetland, vegetation, and the fire out of felt. The beaver was the easy part. “I already had a bunch of little beaver toys because people give me beaver stuff for the holidays every year,” she says. It took her a few tries to snap about 300 photos on her phone, which she stitched together with the Stop Motion Pro app. Then she added sound effects in iMovie — including a banjo soundtrack. The music is a nod to documentaries about beavers, Fairfax told The Verge. “ There’s always banjo music playing when they’re building, and I don’t know why,” she says. “I can’t break tradition!” “ There’s always banjo music playing when they’re building, and I don’t know why.” She tweeted the video on Sunday, not expecting it to have much reach beyond what Fairfax calls her “beaver people” — a small community of people interested in beaver science. She went on a hike, and when she came back, the tweet had blown up. “I’m getting comments from K-12 educators, I’m getting comments from land managers,” she says. “Ultimately that’s the goal of something like this, to make people interested who wouldn’t otherwise read my papers, or come to my conference presentations.” Fairfax thinks part of the video’s appeal is its brevity. “Scientists have great tendency to ramble on — myself included — when we’re talking about things we really like,” she says. This video, by contrast, is less than a minute long. And the best part is that it doesn’t use any of the jargon that can make science so impenetrable because it doesn’t have any words.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Look, I know we cover a lot of the bad types of weather here. Wildfires, droughts, extreme cold, hurricanes. But allow me to make it up to you with some Good Weather. Snow in Sahara? Yes, please. On Sunday, snow fell in one of the most unlikely places on Earth. Ain Sefra, an Algerian town in the Sahara Desert, got a couple inches of the white stuff. It clung to the dunes for an hour and a half before melting. The Atlas Mountains that ring the town saw snow stick around a bit longer according to Zinnadine Hashas, a local photographer who captured the scenes. The town is not exactly a snow magnet at 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) above sea level. The average low in January is 12.4 degrees Celsius (54 degrees Fahrenheit) according to records from the German weather service. Heck, it’s not even a precipitation magnet. Ain Sefra picks up a grand total of 6.65 inches of precipitation a year on average, putting it well under the threshold of 10 inches a year scientists generally use to classify a place as a desert. But over the weekend, the Algerian weather service issued a rare snow warning for the western part of the country forecasting 10-15 centimeters (4-6 inches) of snow. And on Sunday night, its forecast came to bear. A blast of cold air associated with a low pressure system spiraling over the western Mediterranean brought rare snow the town and surrounding dunes and mountains. A similar pattern brought snow there last year, too. Before that, the only other recorded snowfall in the region occurred in February 1979, though the highest reaches of Algeria do receive snow every few years. Now, some troll on the internet will probably use this as an excuse to make a joke about global warming. To which I say the usual: it can and will sometimes snow in odd places, even in a warming world. I could go on to talk about the fact that the planet just had its second- or third-warmest year on record or the record cost of weather and climate disasters in the U.S. or...you know what, screw it.

"DON J. MELNICK, MARY C. PEARL and MARK A. COCHRANE","What has been particularly worrisome in recent years is that the world’s largest forests, the taiga of Russia and its boreal forest cousins that ring the Arctic and store much of the world’s carbon, experienced wildfires at a rate and scale not seen in at least 10,000 years, according to paleoecological records. The explosive rise in wildfires has occurred for two major, interrelated reasons: climate change and human behavior. As land surface temperatures rise, there has been a general warming across all seasons, with intense periods of heat during the warmest parts of the year, longer intervals without rain and marked reductions in relative humidity. Heat waves and droughts cause vegetation to dry into combustible fuels, enabling small fires to become widespread infernos. Tossing a cigarette butt out a car window or failing to extinguish a campfire can end up obliterating hundreds of thousands of acres within weeks. Research on wildfires in the United States over the past 20 years found that 84 percent were started by people, accounting for 44 percent of the land burned. Moreover, when no controlled burning takes place to eliminate flammable brush and deadwood that has built up on forest floors, those forests become ripe for intense fires that are difficult or impossible to control. As we have seen in the unexpected, catastrophic fires last year in Gatlinburg, Tenn., and this year in Sweden, troubled by record heat and a worsening drought, wildfires are no longer limited to regions typically considered prone to such events. People and communities must recognize and come to grips with serious fire danger conditions and have advance plans for responding to disastrous wildfires. Australia has imposed special construction requirements for fire-prone areas to mitigate wildfire damage, but new, firewise policies for construction and development should exist everywhere wildfires loom as a threat. Climate change has made wildfires collectively one of the most destructive extreme natural events we face, and this trend is likely to worsen in the coming years. Unless we take careful and thoughtful actions, providing education and incentives for adapting to wildfires as well as enforcing stricter rules to prevent them, we risk much more than we realize.",Are we locked in a worldwide pattern of persistent and catastrophic wildfires?,2018-08-08T19:12:05Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Earth Ablaze,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/opinion/wildfires-california-climate-change.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/07/opinion/08Melnick/merlin_141928866_4065b9eb-dcaa-47a5-b5c7-2755f2cba9f3-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfires,0

Behind her stands the building she and her coworkers are finishing, future research laboratories for the University of California at San Franciscoone of the leading medical research institutions in the world. To the east, the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. To the north, the windows of Ubers glistening new headquarters glimmer a strange smokey orange. Under normal conditions, Hill would be able to see across the bay to Oakland and Berkeley. But on Tuesday, smoke from the faraway Camp Fire, which left at least 48 dead and 103 more missing, had blanketed the city and the whole Bay Area. The US Environmental Protection Agency considers an Air Quality Index score of 150 or higher to be ""unhealthy for everyone,"" due to the density of particulates in the air. On Tuesday in San Francisco, the AQI was 164. The smoke caused headaches, stung eyes, and obscured skylines with tiny, dangerous particles that left soot on the windshields of Lyfts navigating all the busy construction. When breathed in, those particles can embed in the alveoli of the lungs, causing or exacerbating respiratory distress and potentially leading to future cardiac and respiratory ailments. Hill suffers from respiratory issues already, and though she was wearing a bright yellow jacket and a hard hat to protect her on Tuesday morning, she had no respirator to shield her lungs. They gave us masks but Im not wearing mine because it fogs up my glasses. And I should, she said. A&amp;B gave everyone on her crew an N95 mask on Monday, when it was clear the city was going to again be stifled by smoke from the fire that caught the previous Friday. Hills was unopened in her pocket. When WIRED explained the risks to her lungs, she took it out and put it on. Ill be out here all day, she said. I should know better. Ive been in the field a lot of years. She wore it the rest of the day. The innovations that come out of this neighborhood change the worldfrom new pharmaceuticals and basic research on the brain to startups hoping to elongate human life and change the future of work. Yet the people building it are at risk. All over the neighborhood, construction workers were going up outdoor elevators into buildings, hanging off the sides of lifts, hammering and working and taking breaks with no respiratory masks on. When the tech workers, doctors, nurses, and researchers briefly emerged from their buildings at lunchtime with their face masks strapped on, most of the construction workers on break beside them wore no pulmonary protection. Californias Occupational Safety and Health Administration sent out a warning on November 9, the day the Camp Fire broke out, that all employers in the state who have workers affected by wildfire smoke need to modify work conditions and schedules to minimize exposure, or hand out appropriate respirators, like disposable N95 masks, to protect workers. Special precautions must be taken to protect workers from hazards from wildfire smoke, the warning reads. The greatest hazard comes from breathing fine particles in the air, which can reduce lung function, worsen asthma and other existing heart and lung conditions, and cause coughing, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Hills employer, Berkeley-based A&amp;B Construction, complied. So did Bratton Masonry, an outfit in Fresno, which has some 30-odd workers in town to help build the new Warriors Stadium. At the safety meeting Monday, they warned us about the smoke and handed out respirators, said a Bratton mason who declined to give his name. McCarthy Building, the tenth most lucrative construction company in the state, according to the Engineering News Record, went a step further. McCarthy halted all outdoor construction work on its Northern California projects in areas with an air quality index higher than 150. It completely shut down construction on pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences new headquarters south of Mission Bay, in Foster City, because the air was so bad. ""If you take any project where the purpose of the building is to save lives or create medicines or to treat people, it doesn't make sense to be building these buildings and hurting people at the same time,"" said Paul Erb, Executive Vice President of McCarthy Construction, who couched his comments as referring to the firm's projects in general. The smoke has affected the majority of our projects in Northern California, Erb said. This haze, its unprecedented in modern construction times. In those moments you have to take a pause and think about what the effect is and sometimes it makes sense to shut the job down for the day. Erb was speaking from a cell phone in Nevada, where he had just arrived, but he said his throat still hurt from breathing in the air in the Bay Area over the weekend and earlier this week. WIRED spoke to two subcontractors who had been working for McCarthy on that Gilead project. When it was closed down, they moved to a job on the roof of UCSFs new Cancer Medical Building in Mission Bay. We couldnt see anything driving over the bridge to Gilead, said a machine metal welder on a smoke break from the cancer building. He declined to give his name and wasnt wearing a mask, though he said he had a respirator on the roof where he was working for the day. Other men working on that cancer research building said that the inside was fitted with HEPA filters and those working outside had been given masks by their team. Most were not wearing masks when WIRED spoke to them. Near the sign announcing the future of cancer research, one man in a hardhat could be seen three- or four-stories up on a lift working without a respirator, as air thick with smoke constricted this reporters throat, and hospital employees nearby walked around with masks on their faces. Though most workers WIRED spoke said they had been given respirators or the option to leave work for the day without repercussions, some had different experiences. A lift director for Bigge Crane and Rigging said that he and his crew had been told they could go home but hadnt been given respirators. I have one in my car thats mine, but Im not wearing it because Ill only be out here a second, the man who declined to be named, said. I think everyone should have one. He stood watching one of his crane operators work on the Warriors Stadium. The operator, he said, didnt have a mask but was enclosed in the cab with air conditioning so he wasnt worried. A man Ill call Dade, who works for Conco doing concrete work on a building on 15th street, said his company didnt give him a mask at all and he was worried because he has asthma. No one is talking about it, he said of the atmosphere on his job-site. WIRED observed no workers laboring outside on Clark Construction's massive $1-billion Warriors Stadium project site wearing appropriate masks on Tuesday. One man who works for Clark on that job, who declined to give his name, said that no masks had been handed out and that no one had mentioned in any meetings hed attended that there was increased risk from the air. He asked if he should worry about the risks to his infant daughter in air like this. (Yes.) Hes been outside for hours every workday since the fires broke out. Clark did not respond to numerous requests for comment. WIRED reached out to all the companies listed as running jobs in the neighborhood, and mentioned by workers in interviews. None but McCarthy responded to a request to learn their policy regarding air safety on the job. Down the street, workers on a Webcor job site building UCSFs new Center for Vision Neuroscience were observed not wearing any protective masks. Webcor is the third largest contractor in the state. When WIRED inquired in the project office whether any respirators had been given out, the safety officer replied, I dont like reporters, and refused to give any information, before giving a nonworking number to the companys press office. By press time the company had not responded to repeated requests for information about OSHA compliance. Just because workers werent wearing their masks, though, doesnt mean they didnt have them available. Respiratory risk is a tricky thing to get people to care about. Many of the workers outside without masks in Mission Bay on Tuesday told WIRED they had masks in their pockets, or had been offered them, but werent wearing them. A man on his lunch break from working on the new Uber headquarters shrugged. Its definitely terrible, but what are we going to do? he said. His sister had to evacuate Chico on Friday, and hed spent the weekend driving as far from the city as he could to find clear skies. He came back to the city to go to work. His friend, who was smoking a cigarette next to him, added, Were already killing ourselves. That same nihilism was a common theme among workers WIRED spoke to Tuesday. In 35 years this is the worst Ive ever seen, said ironworker Christopher Hayes, a subcontractor on the new Uber building. The company offered respirators to us, or they said we could go home, he added. As is standard in the industry, anyone leaving would forgo pay. Neither he nor his three coworkers on break outside the job site wore masks and told WIRED they still wouldnt wear them when they went back up to work either. We work 30, 40 feet in the air hanging off a side of a building, so were probably going to die way before cancer, Hayes friend and fellow union member (Iron Workers local 377) Jackie Winslow said, sitting atop an orange box housing tools to measure lead particles in the air (since this neighborhood used to be shipyards, the risk of lead contamination during new construction is high). The younger guys on break with them agreed. Many people told WIRED that since they couldnt smell the smoke Tuesday, they assumed it wasnt that bad anymoredespite how visible it was. Others said that theyre exposed to all sorts of hazards in their daily jobs, so whats one more thing? A vast majority of workers also said wearing the N95 masks was annoying and made work hard. I would advise them to wear a mask, but then I know that it's harder to wear a mask when you're working hard, said UCSF's John Balmes, a doctor specializing in respiratory exposure. If they are doing heavy work to increase their rate of breathing, they're going to have a greater effective dose of the smoke particles. And if they are really working hard and breathing through their mouth, then they bypass the filtering mechanism of the nose. So you should not be training for a marathon like this. You might not want to be doing heavy lifting in that case, either. Balmes runs UCSFs state-of-the-art research laboratory focused on respiratory illness caused by wildfire smoke. That lab, over the hill in the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, is nicknamed HEL (short for Human Exposure Laboratory), which felt fitting on Tuesday. Balmes emphasizes that research into the long-term effects of wildfire exposure is inconclusive. Its especially hard to know whether short-term exposure can lead to future illness like cancer. How can you say for sure many years into the future that it was definitely that one week of smoke inhalation that caused the lung cancer? There are carcinogens in wildland fire smoke, he says, but even studies of the risk to firefighters who breathe that smoke chronically are in their early phases. Breathing this air quality for a week like we're probably going to do here is not going to appreciably increase our cancer risk, he said. But it might not just be one week anymore. As climate change warms the Earth, fires of this magnitude are growing increasingly common in the west. Some professors at UC Davis called on their school to declare smoke dayslike snow days, but for the problem of smoke on campus. On Wednesday, UC Davis did cancel classes, owing to the bad air, which was at an Air Quality Index of 152. In San Francisco, where UCSF, USF and City College of San Francisco were still in session, the air was at 179. Berkeley and schools in the East Bay also remained in session despite an AQI rating of 168. Maybe one more day, or one more week, working in these conditions wont hurt someone who is otherwise healthy. But as it becomes a seasonal norm, the risks to people working outside are much greater, as are the losses to business. These risks are not limited to construction workers, of course. The United Farm Workers of California noted on Twitter that laborers have been in the fields since Nov 9, working in dangerous conditions to pick the food that feeds the nation. WIRED witnessed farm workers in artichoke fields near Salinas picking vegetables with no respirators over the weekend, as SF city residents drove past to the South, fleeing the area for better air. The vegetables grown in California feed the nation, just as the science and technology developed here feeds innovation all over the world. Though the firesand the safety of those working in wildfire-affected communitiesmay seem like a local California problem, the haze settling over Mission Bay and all of the state, working its way into the lungs of thousands of people just trying to do their jobs, affects us all.

The mayor voiced his concern that the younger generation of Chinese Americans were not getting involved in politics and that the older generation was leaving the scene, including Rose Pak, the political boss of Chinatown who died last year. “His concern was the passing of the torch,” Mr. Lee said. “And then he passed away.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by AJ Dellinger to Gizmodo","As we continue to burn fossil fuels like there’s no tomorrow, an insidious transformation is taking place under our noses. Remote ecosystems in our planet’s far north are changing at a scale that’s hard to imagine. A new study published in Global Change Biology is making that imagination part a bit easier. It estimates that 67,000 square miles of land—13 percent of the state of Alaska—has experienced “directional change” over the past 32 years, becoming greener, browner, wetter, or drier as permafrost thaws, glaciers retreat, treelines move north, and wildfires ravage landscapes. Some of these changes are part of the natural course of ecological succession. But the fingerprints of human-induced climate change across this vast state are also impossible to ignore. So are the planet-wide consequences. HEALY, ALASKA—Bitter winters still dominate life in the Alaskan interior, but a practiced eye can… Read more Read The study, led by scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey, analyzed high resolution satellite imagery acquired by Landsat from 1984 to 2015 to develop a mapping algorithm that estimated change across Alaska. Aerial and satellite imagery and field data were used to tie changes in specific satellite metrics, like landscape greenness, to specific drivers like wildfires. In total, 1.4 million square km (540,000 square miles) of land were analyzed for some sort of change. Those changes were widespread and diverse, but a few trends stuck out. For one, vast tracts of Alaska, especially in the far north where boreal forest gives way to tundra, are becoming greener as the growing season lengthens and the treeline advances. Meanwhile in the interior of the state, long-term drying and wildfires are causing vegetation to die back and landscapes to brown. “What impressed me [was] how extensive and influential the fires were,” USGS scientist at study co-author Bruce Wylie told Earther, noting that statewide wildfires were the largest driver of change. Alaska’s water resources are also changing profoundly. As the permafrost that forms a solid foundation beneath the ground thaws, landscapes are collapsing in on themselves, forming wetlands in forests or so-called thermokarst lakes on tundra. Alaska’s coastlines, where many Native villages are located, are eroding as thaw and a longer open water season causes shorelines to crumble. Glaciers, as we already knew, are rapidly diminishing across the state. Peter Griffith, a carbon cycle scientist at NASA’s Goddard Spaceflight Center, said that while the scale of transformation estimated in the new study is in line with prior work, this research took things an important step further by tying landscape-level changes to driving factors. “Now with this study we have spatially explicit interpretations of the changes on the land, with specific drivers identified and attributed to the changes,” Griffith told Earther via email. Teasing out how rising temperatures amplifies or alters the normal course of change remains an key challenge, noted Merritt Turetsky, an ecologist and permafrost expert at the University of Guleph. For instance while wildfires have long been part of the fabric of life in boreal forests, a growing pile of evidence points to climate change making them more frequent and severe. “So I think what future studies need to do is characterize how ongoing warming and disturbance events are pushing ecosystems into new trajectories of change,” Turetksy said told Earther in an email. Turetsky also said that the results of the new paper should be viewed as “quite conservative,” because some of the more fine-scale changes that we know are occurring up north can’t be captured via satellite. “I think that these results represent a minimum estimate of change,” she said.","As we continue to burn fossil fuels like there’s no tomorrow, an insidious transformation is taking place under our noses.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Massive, ravaging wildfires are now the norm on the West Coast, with the state of California now regularly breaking fire records, Canada’s British Columbia experiencing the third-worst fire season in recorded history, and all the smoke from those fires spreading across much of the continent and even further. But don’t worry, an area man has a plan, according to Global News, and that plan is blowing all the smoke from Canadian wildfires back up across the border with box fans. Per Global News’ report, Spokane, Washington resident Caleb Moon formed a Facebook event titled “ Blow Spokane’s Smoke Away to Canada.” It is impossible to believe that the August 24th event, which asks each of the city’s 550,000 to place “at least 5 box fans on their roof” to accomplish this, is anything but a joke. But Moon at least played it earnest in an interview with the network: The event may sound like a joke, but Moon said he’s serious about this. “We figure a small box fan can move smoke about six feet, so if you put 500,000 of them together, you can do the math on that, we can probably get it pretty far into Canada,” he said. British Columbia Centre for Disease Control senior environmental health specialist Sarah Henderson told Global News the idea was “very ridiculous,” noting that a fan does not magically clean air but “pulls air through it.” So even if it did work—which, again, it would not—the fans would probably just pull in fresh smoke from California. In any case, dumb plans for how to deal with the wildfires are kind of in vogue in the U.S. right now. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has spent much of the past few weeks rambling about how the fires are caused by anything from poor forest management to “environmental terrorists” and definitely not climate change, as is agreed to be a major factor by experts. Donald Trump has blamed the fires on “ bad environmental laws ” preventing firefighters from just spraying them with water, which is complete nonsense but nonetheless served as a pretext for the White House to seize control of protected California waterways and open up more federal lands to logging.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"California is entering its sixth day battling dangerous wildfires. They have been driven by extreme weather conditions: low humidity, high winds and parched ground. Authorities issued a purple alert - the highest level warning - amid what it called ""extremely critical fire weather"". Fanned by high winds, six large fires, and other smaller blazes, swept through tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours. About 5,700 firefighters have been battling the fires, with many drafted in from neighbouring states to help. The Thomas fire in Ventura County is the largest, and has destroyed more than 430 buildings. Nearly 200,000 residents were evacuated from their homes, with many forced to flee in the middle of the night as the flames rapidly spread. Three firefighters have been injured and hundreds of buildings destroyed. One death was reported after a 70-year-old woman was found dead in her car on an evacuation route. Satellite imagery shows the vast Thomas Fire, north of Los Angeles, which has spread as far as the Pacific coast. US President Donald Trump issued a state of emergency in response to the fires. There are fears the blaze will hurt California's vast agricultural industry. Much of the state's avocado crop has been destroyed. About 90% of US avocados are grown in California and the industry is worth millions to the economy. The fires have destroyed homes and scorched residential areas. In the wealthy Los Angeles enclave of Bel Air, firefighters were seen removing belongings from luxury homes as the flames spread. Several evacuation orders were lifted on Friday afternoon, leaving residents free to return home and assess the damage.

IVAN PENN,"It was not clear on Thursday whether the company would still seek bankruptcy protection. The company said in a statement that it still faced untold financial exposure as a result of two years of wildfires.
The devastating and unprecedented wildfires of 2017 and 2018 have had a profound impact on our customers, employees and communities, PG&amp;E said. Regardless of todays announcement, PG&amp;E still faces extensive litigation, significant potential liabilities and a deteriorating financial situation, which was further impaired by the recent credit agency downgrades to below investment grade.
But at least one of the companys investors, the New York-based hedge fund BlueMountain Capital, said PG&amp;E ought to reconsider a bankruptcy filing in light of the states conclusions about the Tubbs fire. The hedge fund said earlier on Thursday that it would seek to replace PG&amp;Es board.
The news from CalFire that PG&amp;E did not cause the devastating 2017 Tubbs Fire is yet another example of why the company shouldnt be rushing to file for bankruptcy, which would be totally unnecessary and bad for all stakeholders, Omar Vaishnavi, head of fundamental credit at BlueMountain Capital, said in a statement.","One of California’s most destructive wildfires devastated a neighborhood north of Santa Rosa, Calif., in October 2017.

Jonathan Shieber,"As crews across California battle more than a dozen wildfires—including the largest in state history—the blazes are spewing enough carbon into theair to undo some of the good done by the state’s climate policies. What’s even worse: Climate-warming compounds that will be released by the charred forests long after the fires are extinguished may do more to warm up the planet than the immediate harm from smoky air. Scientists say that only about 15 percent of a forest’s store of carbon is expelled during burns. The remainder is released slowly over the coming years and decades, as trees decay.That second hit of carbon, experts say, contains compounds that do more to accelerate climate change than those from the original fire. And future fires over previously burned ground could make climate prospects even more bleak. “The worst possible situation is the fire that comes through and kills everything,” said Nic Enstice, regional science coordinator for the Sierra Nevada Conservancy. “Then, ten or fifteen years later, another fire comes through and releases all the carbon left in the trees on the ground. That’s really bad.” It’s a scenario that could explode at any time. Enstice cited a research paper published this year that laid out a chilling tableau: California has more than a 120 million dead trees strewn around its mountain ranges, with the southern Sierra hardest hit. When fires hit those downed trees, the state will begin to experience “mass fires” spewing plumes of carbon. The resulting conflagrations, according to the researcher, will be almost unimaginable. “The emissions from those fires will be unlike anything we will have ever seen,” Enstice said. “And you won’t be able put it out.” Computing the carbon released from the the fires so far this year will not happen soon. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration flies planes through smoke plumes, gathering data, but air traffic over wildfires is tightly restricted. Scientific research is not a top priority when fires are threatening towns. But some preliminary data is available now. One method uses inventories of existing forests—surveying how many trees and which type. Those records are updated every 10 years. Researchers then overlay infrared images captured from satellites that show what’s burning and at what intensity. From that, predictions can be made about carbon emissions on any given day. Scientists say that emissions from burned forests are one of the most virulent types, called black carbon. According to the most recent accounting from the state Air Resources Board, California’s annual black carbon discharge—excluding wildfires—are equal to emissions from about 8 million passenger vehicles driven for one year. Not a small number. But when the state calculates the same annual average of black carbon coming solely from wildfires, it’s the equivalent of nearly 19 million additional cars on the road. With year-round fire seasons and fire intensity off the charts, state officials admit that wildfires could set backCalifornia’s myriad policies to offset the impacts of climate change. “It’s significant,” Enstice said. “We don’t have a lot of data to measure yet, we’re still using primitive tools. But everyone is gearing up to study this.” This article is republished courtesy of CALMatters.","Julie Cart Contributor Share on Twitter Julie Cart is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who writes for CALmatters, a nonprofit, non-partisan media venture explaining California policies and politics.

Laura Vitto,"Destructive wildfires have torn across thousands of acres in Southern California since Monday night, destroying homes, forcing evacuations, and displacing thousands of residents as a result. In the days since, nightmarish photos and videos of three massive wildfires in the Los Angeles area have been widely circulated. On Thursday morning, one video in particular seems to have struck a chord for its sweetness: A brief clip that appears to show an unnamed man rescuing a rabbit from the blaze in Ventura County. SEE ALSO: Wildfires lead to hellish scenes for Los Angeles commuters The man in the clip from RMG News (shared on Twitter by ABC News) reportedly declined to share his story on camera. (It should go without saying that getting this close to a wildfire is extremely dangerous and not recommended.) Per CNN, more than 110,000 Southern California residents have been forced to evacuate their homes as the fires spread. Thursday in particular looks to be a potentially devastating day for the area, with exceptionally strong winds and extreme dry air. The Storm Prediction Center estimates that Thursday's conditions will affect 9.5 million people. As Mashable reported, powerful Santa Ana winds have enabled wildfire to move quickly across hundreds of thousands of acres of land, and may continue to do so into Saturday.","Destructive wildfires have torn across thousands of acres in Southern California since Monday night, destroying homes, forcing evacuations, and displacing thousands of residents as a result.

TIM ARANGO and INYOUNG KANG,"Experts also worry that not enough attention is given to all the ways people have made the problem of wildfires worse. Population growth in California means there are more people on the roads — cars are a prime culprit in wildfires — and more homes built in wilderness areas. “It would be easy to throw our hands in the air and say it’s just climate change, and we can’t do anything about it,” said Jennifer K. Balch, a professor of geography at the University of Colorado at Boulder and an expert on wildfires. “But actually we are starting the majority of wildfires, and we can do something about it.” Another factor, many experts say, are policies in California that protect forests from timber harvesting and a reluctance to set off controlled fires to burn vegetation. William Stewart, an expert on forestry at the University of California at Berkeley, said that part of the California dream was keeping “nature as it is,” with minimal management of forests. With so many fires burning so often, Stephen Pyne, a fire historian at Arizona State University, worries the public has become accustomed to disaster, unwilling to have difficult conversations about where houses are being built and whether controlled burns are a good idea.","Thursday: How people start or exacerbate blazes, a sudden opportunity for Duncan Hunter’s challenger, and a teetotaler’s guide to Sonoma County.",2018-08-23T13:00:46Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: The Human Element in California’s Wildfires,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/us/california-today-fires-humans.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/us/22caltoday/22caltoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfires,0
Elena Saavedra Buckley,"This story originally appeared on High Country News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. At the end of July, Twitter user Alicia Santana posted a photo of a man sitting in a plastic folding chair in his yard. He’s looking away from the camera, towards a monstrous, orange cloud of smoke filling the sky beyond a wire fence. “My dad not wanting to leave his home,” Santana wrote, ending it with #MendocinoComplexFire. As wildfires spark, parts of the internet glow with them. The #CarrFire, #FergusonFire, #RanchFire and other hashtags spread quickly this summer on Twitter. If past seasons are any indication, there will be thousands more tweets like this, and they will continue as smoke—the insidious second wave of wildfires—spreads across the West. They can also be used for data. In a recently published study, US Forest Service researchers Sonya Sachdeva and Sarah McCaffrey found that, when analyzed in large numbers, tweets about wildfires can accurately model the way smoke moves. In their study, published by the International Conference on Social Media &amp; Society, Sachdeva and McCaffrey analyzed close to 39,000 tweets posted between May and September 2015 in California. They stripped the tweets to reveal their core subjects: smoke in the air, fallen ash, haziness, smell. By tagging the tweets with the location in which they were posted, the researchers created a verbatim map: a landscape of fire based on the people who experienced it. Their modeling proved accurate when compared to figures from air quality monitors. Their results show that what we write online could fill the gaps that traditional data collection leave behind. While still nascent, using social media to study environmental events is a growing field. Images from Flickr can help researchers understand tourism rates in natural areas, and social media often acts as a crucial tool in disaster relief. “Social media is everywhere people are,” Sachdeva said. “Physical monitors of any kind, by virtue of them being physical, can’t do that.” The 2015 wildfire season, including the Rough and Butte fires, burned nearly 900,000 acres in California alone. The smoke-related tweets Sachdeva and McCaffrey used reflect the air pollution’s wide impact. “Abandoned my 2015 #johnmuirtrail attempt… due to Rough Fire smoke. Poor visibility and headache the culprit,” one Twitter user wrote. Another simply read: “#airquality #cantbreathe #roughfire #California.” If someone #cantbreathe due to smoke, they’re inhaling small particles known as as PM 2.5, which measure under five percent the width of human hair. The particles can lodge into the lung tissue and bloodstream and cause health issues, particularly for people with respiratory issues, pregnant women, and children. In extreme conditions, though, the long-term effects can impact others. During the summer of 2017, Montana saw smoke conditions so dense that they maxed out air quality monitoring capacity. Dan Inouye manages the Washoe County air quality management district in Nevada, home to Reno, which has seven air quality monitors. Smoke is rolling downwind from California and into the county. Inouye’s eyes have been watering for weeks, and the air quality index has registered unhealthy pollution levels. “As long as the fires are active, there’s always that chance that smoke’s going to come our way,” he said. Near cities like Reno, air pollution monitoring stations are plentiful. But they’re absent in many rural areas like central Nevada, leaving small communities with less information about the air they breathe. Using alternative modeling techniques, such as Twitter, could help round out those blank spots. How tweeters’ location affected people’s experience of wildfires also factored into Sachdeva and McCaffrey’s research. By analyzing the topics people tweeted about, they could dig into what people cared about based on distance from the flames. The farther away the tweet from the fire, the more people were interested in concrete information: how the blaze started, say, or what NASA images indicated. The closer the tweets got to the blazes, the more people asked for and offered help. Rather than fleeing, McCaffrey learned, victims often stay put—“people are actually going into the fire.” McCaffrey, who has studied responses to wildfires for 25 years, sees them as a high-stakes—and revealing—event in the human-nature relationship. “There’s that narrative that the people in the immediate path are going to freak out,” McCaffrey said, “but the tweets are a clear demonstration that what people are really thinking about is what we should do and how people want to help each other.""",Social media could help monitor air pollution that physical monitors miss.,2018-08-15T12:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Your Tweets Can Help Map the Spread of Wildfire Smoke,https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-wildfire-model/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b735809be99ce7dfa36496c/191:100/pass/wildfire-1014049338.jpg,wired,Wired,wildfires,0
ADAM NAGOURNEY,"This was the sixth time that Mr. Garcetti had given one of this briefings and once again, he was flanked by two men who have been key in coordinating this response: the fire chief, Ralph M. Terrazas, and the police chief, Charlie Beck. Mr. Terrazas, who Mr. Garcetti promoted to what in this city is a particularly important job, has been briefing Mr. Garcetti before his news conferences, reporting to the mayor every few hours on the latest development. On Monday, at the mayor’s weekly cabinet meeting, Mr. Terrazas warned the mayor about extreme conditions that could lead to disastrous fires later that week. He was proved right the next day, though he was not ready on Thursday to declare game over. “This has been a long week and we are not done yet,” Mr. Terrazas said, wearing a protective yellow jacket and an L.A.F.D. cap. “Tomorrow morning will be Day 5 of a multiday Santa Ana event.” “You can see some improvement,” Mr. Terrazas said, referring to fire conditions. “But it’s still in extreme range.” More Coverage From The Times of the California Fires: Follow live updates today here.

Now, the Trump administration is facing the same kind of assault from Democratic state attorneys general like Xavier Becerra of California. Mr. Becerra, a former congressman from Los Angeles who was appointed California attorney general this year to succeed Kamala Harris when she became a United States senator, has filed around 20 lawsuits against the federal government, challenging its policies on scaling back environmental regulations, cracking down on immigration enforcement, and more. But, speaking to New York Times reporters during a visit to Washington this week, Mr. Becerra sidestepped a suggestion that he was taking a page from the playbook of Obama-era Republican attorneys general like Scott Pruitt — the Trump administration’s deregulation-minded head of the Environmental Protection Agency who rose to national prominence as Oklahoma attorney general by suing the Obama administration, and who is now being sued by Mr. Becerra. “I haven’t opened one of their books,” Mr. Becerra said. “We’re doing this because it’s existential for California to be able to continue doing what we’re doing.” “We have, by a factor of about 10, more clean-energy jobs in California than there are jobs in the entire coal mining industry,” he said. “All of that could be put at risk by all of these rollbacks.” — Charlie Savage, national security and legal affairs reporter in Washington California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

Back Story Jerry Garcia once said the Grateful Dead was like licorice : “Not everybody likes licorice, but the people who like licorice really like licorice.” The Grateful Dead broke up on this day in 1995, four months after the guitarist and vocalist’s death, and after playing more than 2,300 concerts over 30 years.

Credit Associated Press Even Mr. Garcia may have underestimated how long die-hard love for the band would last — or how it would evolve, as seen in a trip through the Times archives. In a 1973 article, “ The Grateful Dead Makes a Real Good Hamburger,” our reporter called the band “experts in the art and science of showing people another world.” Another Times writer liked the band’s “feathery locomotive groove.” Our coverage wasn’t always approving: In “ Just What the Tie-Dyed Crowd Wanted,” from 1989, we noted that “Grateful Dead shows are as iffy as blind dates,” and this year we referred to the band’s history as a “ 30-year hippie-pirate soap opera.” More recently, the Dead have been praised as music business pioneers. They favored the now common formula of prioritizing touring over selling records, and were first to encourage fans to make and trade concert recordings. In 2015, the remaining members reunited for “Fare Thee Well” shows. The average ticket price for some of them was $938.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"Photo Gloria Andruskewicz evacuated her home in Ventura, Calif., on Thursday, as wildfires closed in. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times For the latest news on the wildfires, read our Thursday live updates here. Dangerous wildfires burning around Los Angeles have forced the authorities to tell nearly 200,000 people to flee their homes, some with little time to prepare. It is never too early to plan for a potential evacuation, even if you’re not in an area immediately affected by the flames. Wildfires can quickly travel great distances and move erratically — especially when driven by the wind, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokeswoman, Amy Bastman, said. “I know it can be a scary time, but when it’s time to go, we want to make sure people have all the things they need, all the essentials,” she said. “You don’t know how long you might be away, or whether there will be a home for you to come back to.” Here’s are some suggestions to prepare for such an emergency. Before the fire Make a plan. Families should set a meeting point in case they are not all together at the time of evacuation. Someone should be responsible for grabbing the emergency kit from home. Designate an out-of-area friend or contact, and let that person know that the family is evacuating, and to where. If family members are separated, or phone systems are overloaded, sending a text message to the contact might be the only way to let others know you are safe. Map at least two evacuation routes. Prepare an emergency supply kit. Think beyond a flashlight, batteries, and food and water, Ms. Bastman said. “It’s like imagining you’re going on a camping trip for a week,” she said. “What things would you have to take with you?” Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency, recommends gathering a three-day supply of nonperishable food and three gallons of water per person. Also pack a change of clothes, prescription medications, and extra eyeglasses or contact lenses. If you have pets, do not forget about pet food and medication. “In the Northern California fires, a lot of people didn’t have a pack all ready,” said Brandi Richard, public affairs officer for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “Having those basic things that we discussed in a bag that you can just take with you really quickly is important.” Identify irreplaceable family photos, jewelry or heirlooms, and make room for them in the evacuation kit as well. Keep important documents together. Gather birth certificates, property titles, insurance records and other crucial paperwork. In addition to being difficult to replace, some of the documents could be needed to file claims with insurers or FEMA after the fire. Keeping a digital copy of the files, either on a hard drive in the emergency kit or available online, is also wise. Families that have time to plan might consider sending older photos and videos to an outside company to scan and transfer to a DVD, suggested Julie Sanchez, a New York Times reader who lives in Santa Maria, on California’s Central Coast. The DVD can then be stored in a bank safety-deposit box. “We’ve been doing that in my family for a while,” Ms. Sanchez, 56, said. “That usually seems to be the major thing that people want to save. Those are the irreplaceables.” When the fire approaches Prepare your home. If you have time, remove flammable items like wood piles, brush and propane tanks at least 30 feet away from your house. Patio furniture and umbrellas should also be placed at the same distance. Attach garden hoses to spigots to give firefighters a water source if they need it, but don’t turn the water on. Shut all windows and doors, but leave them unlocked once you evacuate, so firefighters can get in. Turn on outdoor lights so firefighters can see the house through the smoke. Shut off the gas at the meter, and turn off the air-conditioning. Fuel up. Keep the family car topped off with gas to avoid any delays. Go to the ATM. Cash is key after emergencies. Keep your credit cards handy, too. Tune in to local media. There is no better source for information on evacuation orders, routes and shelters, Ms. Richard said. “Monitoring their websites is really important, because as things come in, they’re sharing them on social media,” she said. She recommended following the emergency management agencies for Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Once you decide to evacuate You don’t need to wait for an order. If your home is threatened by fire and you’re able to leave, “there’s no need to wait for warnings,” Ms. Bastman said. “History shows us that those who leave the earliest often fare the best,” she said. That is especially true in densely populated Los Angeles, she added, where roads are jammed and firefighters have little space to move. When you decide to leave, dress in pants, long sleeves and sturdy shoes. A bandanna can help shield your face from smoke. Grab your electronics. Cellphones, personal computers, backup hard drives and chargers should all go into the car, along with the emergency kit, personal documents, family keepsakes, cash and credit cards. Don’t forget the pets. They will be scared. Be smart in the car. Close your windows and use recirculated air-conditioning. Tune in to local radio to hear about safe routes, or follow those identified by the California Department of Transportation or Los Angeles Department of Transportation. (Here is the latest information on road closures.) Continue reading the main story","When wildfires threaten, be prepared to leave at a moment’s notice, officials say.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","In a year of wild heat waves, wildfires, and record-setting hurricanes, why not add one more weird weather phenomenon to the list? Tropical Depression Rosa made landfall in Baja California on Monday and is crawling into the Southwest, bringing with it the threat of flash floods from southern Arizona to Idaho. All told, 9 million people are under a flash flood watch or warning as of Tuesday morning Mountain Time as Rosa lumbers inland. The storm attained Category 4 status at its peak late last week, but has lost steam since then (at least in the wind department). It made landfall as a tropical storm in Baja California late last night and has since become Rosas lowly remnant low. But the winds were never the biggest concern for the Southwest. Instead, its the threat of torrential rain as the storm brings tropical moisture to an arid landscape. More than half an inch of rain has already fallen in and around Phoenix, making this one of the heaviest rain events to hit the city since 1990. Phoenix is already up to its seventh-wettest October on record despite it being just Oct. 2. With the heaviest bands of rain to come in the afternoon, the storm is likely to continue climbing the record books. All told, up to six inches of rain are expected in Arizonas mountains. That may not sound like a lot, especially after Florences recent deluge in the Carolinas, but the parched soil ups the risk of runoff. The scenic slot canyons and dry washes that cut across the desert landscape are disguised highways for water, waiting for rain events like this to send torrents rushing downstream. A recent drought has hardened soils even further, which could help accelerate the runoff process. Large portions of the Four Corners area are in exceptional or extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Rosas rain will certainly help alleviate that drought, but it will also exact a toll on the desert landscape and those living in it. Indeed, footage from Phoenixitself chock full of impervious pavementand the surrounding area shows that roads are already becoming inundated as the aforementioned dry washes fill up with frothing, muddy water. The Utah National Guard has already been activated according to CBS News, and we could see more resources mobilized as flooding continues to unfold. Its weird but not unprecedented for tropical systems to amble into the Southwest. Tropical Depression Storm Newton reached Arizona in 2016, the last tropical system to hit the region. Rosas remnants are just the latest example of a growing problem: Heavy rain events are on the rise owing to a warmer atmosphere. Were seeing that trend driven by named storms like hurricanes Harvey, Lane, and Florence as well as random rain events like the one that hit Kauai in April. The Southwest has seen a five percent increase in heavy downpours since 1958 even as the region becomes drier, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment. This type of weather whiplash poses a huge infrastructure challenge as city and state planners have to figure out how to prepare communities both for downpours and water conservation in increasingly dry times.","In a year of wild heat waves, wildfires, and record-setting hurricanes, why not add one more weird weather phenomenon to the list?

Two loyal enforcers have played pivotal roles in the rise of Saudi Arabias Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman: Saud el-Qahtani, a poet who became the princes chief propagandist, and Turki al-Sheikh, above center, a former bodyguard who runs the Saudi sports commission. Even Saudi royalty came to fear the princes close friends, who were central to many of the brazen power plays that have marked the princes rise to dominance. But now, in the aftermath of the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, their fates are unclear. Neither was among the 18 arrested in Saudi Arabias own investigation into the killing. But Mr. Qahtani has already lost his title as an adviser to the royal court. Mr. Sheikh has since avoided the spotlight.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Dozens of people were killed in last month's fires Greece has appointed new heads of key emergency services following last month's deadly wildfires near Athens. A statement from the prime minister's office on Sunday said that the heads of the police force and fire brigade had both been replaced by their deputies. It comes two days after resignation of the civil protection minister. The government has been strongly criticised over its response to the fires, which claimed the lives of at least 90 people. The government has said the fires were started by arsonists and blamed illegal construction for blocking escape routes. However, a catalogue of errors in authorities' handing of the fires emerged earlier this week. According to one senior expert, police set up diversions that sent drivers into the path of the fire, while a separate study found that authorities did not raise an alarm to allow residents and tourists to escape. The families of a couple in their 70s who were killed in the fires are suing police, fire, civil defence and regional leaders over their deaths. Fanned by strong winds, the flames spread through the Attica Peninsula, with the resort town of Mati among the worst-affected areas.",The police and fire heads are replaced as criticism grows over government's handling of the fires.,2018-08-05T18:56:53Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Greece wildfires: New emergency chiefs appointed,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45077978,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1673B/production/_102836919_53c3d9e7-f7af-4cb3-860c-d0aa79a78ef2.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,wildfires,0

LISA FRIEDMAN and JOSE A. DEL REAL,"“To dismiss the role of climate change on these fires is simply incorrect,” said Mr. Wehner, who was a lead author on a chapter of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, a series of federal summaries of climate change data. He made the point, as most climate scientists do, that the cause of the wildfires is multifold, like in any complex event. And this trend promises to continue: According to the National Climate Assessment science report released last year, the number of large forest fires in the Western United States and Alaska is projected to rise as the climate continues to warm. So did the president capture the causes of the California wildfires accurately? Lisa: The president’s tweet said that the California wildfires were worsened by “bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized.” Virtually every scientist and forest management expert agreed that Mr. Trump’s tweet was scientifically and factually inaccurate. Mr. Trump’s other admonition that California “must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!” raised fewer objections. But, state officials pointed out, California devoted more than $250 million in state funds this year alone on efforts to reduce the risk of wildfires. How about the president’s point about water policy? How is that related to wildfire management and firefighting? Is there any connection, as the president suggested?","Wednesday: Hazardous air quality in the San Joaquin Valley, accusations of slogan-stealing in the 10th district, and LeBron James excites bike activists.",2018-08-08T13:13:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Your Questions About Fires and Climate,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/us/california-today-fires-and-climate.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/07/us/07CALTODAY-01/merlin_142056570_ff8f2de5-3943-43a0-894e-84c0995be321-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfires,0

Dozens of people - including families with children - have died as they tried to escape the flames. But fires are also raging in Sweden, as far north as the Arctic Circle, and have caused huge damage in countries including Portugal, the UK and the US in recent months. So what is happening to cause these infernos and how can we tackle them? Flames take hold Fires can occur naturally in woodland or brush, ignited by heat from the sun or a lightning strike. However, the vast majority of wildfires - as many as 90% worldwide - are started by humans, according to experts. The cause could be barbecue charcoal, a discarded cigarette or even arson. As long as there is fuel and oxygen available, the flames can take hold easily. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A strong wind blows embers in California Greece had an unusually dry winter and spring this year, leaving grass and scrubland particularly flammable, says Thomas Smith, assistant professor in environmental geography at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). As well as a lack of rainfall, wind also determines how devastating the fire will be, depending on its strength and direction. ""Burning embers can travel quite far and start new fires that could spread for kilometres if they are big enough,"" says Smith. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 23 July: Dry grass burns as fire crews tackle the flames in Greece Surface fires - burning on a forest floor, for instance - tend to spread slowly and can be more easily controlled. In fact some surface fires can be good, says Cathelijne Stoof, a wild land fire expert based in the Netherlands. ""It helps plants regenerate,"" she adds. ""The problem is when the flames can climb up low level branches and get to the tops of the trees. That's when you can't stop it."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 15 July: Due to the dry weather, about 80 wildfires have been burning in Sweden The most dangerous part of a blaze is called the head fire, explains Thomas Smith. It is driven forward by the wind and is very difficult to fight directly because it has long flame lengths. Image copyright AFP Image caption 17 July: This aerial view provided by the European Space Agency shows smoke billowing from several fires between the west coast of Norway to central Sweden. Head fires burn with blacker smoke But it is not just wood and grass that quickly become fuel for wildfires. Nearby homes and vehicles will combust because of the materials they contain, such as plastics and rubber. Hazardous In Greece, cars in the road caught fire before the surrounding verdant trees because they were more flammable. And they did not need to be directly licked by the flames to do so. ""It comes down to the amount of energy given off by the flames,"" says Smith. ""The cars could be tens of metres away and still be close enough to ignite."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 24 July: Burned cars are seen following a wildfire at the village of Mati near Athens Sadly, people are often killed by wildfires as they attempt to escape. Many of the victims in Greece were trapped in traffic jams as people tried to flee as fast as possible, according to forest risk management expert Alexander Held. But this could have been avoided with better evacuation plans in place, he says. Fine fuel such as dry shrubs should be cleared away from roadsides and houses to stop flames getting close, he adds. ""This was a bomb waiting to explode.""

""There used to be small agricultural fields across Europe and people would manage the land,"" says Cathelijne Stoof. ""But in the 20th Century people moved away and the land became overgrown. So when you do have a fire it spreads much more easily."" In the case of the huge fire near Saddleworth Moor in North West England, it was not just the vegetation that caught fire. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption At its peak, the fire on Saddleworth Moor covered an area of 7 sq miles (18 sq km) and burned for three weeks ""This fire definitely did get into the soil,"" says Dr Thomas Smith. The moorland is made up of peat soil, which is carbon-rich and needs little oxygen to burn, he explains. ""The fire gets underground and smoulders away.... It makes it much more difficult to put out."" Fighting fire Image copyright PA Image caption 28 June: Firefighters tackle a wildfire with beaters on Winter Hill near Bolton, UK Firefighters have a range of techniques to try to tackle a blaze by depriving it of oxygen or fuel. They need to have the right training to know which one will work the best. In the recent UK wildfires, they used beaters and water hoses to extinguish the flames. Dropping water and fire retardant containing fertiliser from planes and helicopters may also slow the spread of flames. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 7 December 2017: A plane drops fire retardant near a home near Los Alamos Road in Murrieta, California, last December Experts say one of the most effective methods of tackling wildfires is building firebreaks by clearing vegetation. But this is ""dirty and hard work"", says Alexander Held, and not an option that is always popular in public opinion. ""You can send a lot of helicopters and planes but without crews on the ground you won't put it out,"" he insists. Cathelijne Stoof agrees on the importance of creating firebreaks: in some places firefighters will create controlled fires to draw the energy out of the blaze they are battling. And she says fire prevention and land management should be ""sexier"" than it is now.

Meanwhile, actor Rob Lowe, who lives in Santa Barbara, a city of close to 100,000 people, tweeted that he was praying for his town as fires closed in. ""Firefighters making brave stands. Could go either way. Packing to evacuate now,"" Lowe added. California has spent the past seven days battling wildfires. Six large blazes, and other smaller ones, erupted on Monday night in southern California. Fanned by high winds, they swept through tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours, driven by extreme weather, including low humidity and parched ground. The authorities issued a purple alert - the highest level warning - amid what it called ""extremely critical fire weather"", while US President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency. Media caption Large parts of southern California have been affected On Saturday, California Governor Jerry Brown described the situation as ""the new normal"" and predicted vast fires, fuelled by climate change, ""could happen every year or every few years"". The current fires have forced the evacuation of some 200,000 people across the state, and seen more than 800 structures destroyed. Several firefighters have been injured, but only one person has died - a 70-year-old woman who was found dead in her car on an evacuation route. There are also fears the blaze will seriously hit California's multi-million dollar agricultural industry.

Tom McKay,"Verizon throttled the Santa Clara County Fire Department’s supposedly “unlimited” data plan while the agency was fighting the record wildfires that have burned over one million acres of the state, Ars Technica reported on Tuesday. According to the report, Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden brought up the throttling in an addendum to a multi-state legal brief seeking the overturn of the Republican-controlled Federal Communications Commission’s decision to throw out Barack Obama-era net neutrality rules. Bowden alleged that Verizon had throttled a SIM card connecting a fire department mobile command vehicle named “OES 5262” to 1/200th of its normal speed, putting lives and property at risk, and that the company’s support team refused to lift the restrictions until fire officials purchased a new data plan at “more than twice the cost.” Ars Technica wrote: “County Fire has experienced throttling by its ISP, Verizon,” Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden wrote in a declaration. “This throttling has had a significant impact on our ability to provide emergency services. Verizon imposed these limitations despite being informed that throttling was actively impeding County Fire’s ability to provide crisis-response and essential emergency services.” Bowden’s declaration was submitted in an addendum to a brief filed by 22 state attorneys general, the District of Columbia, Santa Clara County, Santa Clara County Central Fire Protection District, and the California Public Utilities Commission. The government agencies are seeking to overturn the recent repeal of net neutrality rules in a lawsuit they filed against the Federal Communications Commission in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. According to Bowden, County Fire IT staff verified the connection was being throttled, which “severely interfered with the OES 5262's ability to function effectively.” When those staff reached out and said the throttling was impacting public safety, Verizon customer support personnel confirmed they had deliberately limited OES 5262's connection, but that it would only be restored if County Fire switched to a more expensive plan and contacted the billing department. As a result, fire personnel were forced to use other departments’ service providers as well as their personal devices until County Fire paid up. Bowden wrote those personnel were deployed to help fight the Mendocino Complex Fire, the largest in the state. The Los Angeles Times reported this week that fire is extremely hazardous to the nearly 3,500 firefighters currently fighting it, with Draper City, Utah fire department Battalion Chief Matthew Burchett dying this month while trying to help contain the blaze. In general, the blazes across the state have increasingly exhibited extreme behavior like immense fire tornadoes. Adding a service provider dispute to this situation is indisputably not helpful. Bowden further alleged that Verizon knew full well what it was doing and took advantage of the situation to “coerce” County Fire into paying more: While Verizon ultimately did lift the throttling, it was only after County Fire subscribed to a new, more expensive plan. In light of our experience, County Fire believes it is likely that Verizon will continue to use the exigent nature of public safety emergencies and catastrophic events to coerce public agencies into higher-cost plans, ultimately paying significantly more for mission-critical service—even if that means risking harm to public safety during negotiations. In a statement provided to Gizmodo as well as Ars Technica, a Verizon spokesperson wrote that the company “made a mistake in how we communicated with our customer about the terms of its plan,” which was a “government contract plan for a high-speed wireless data allotment at a set monthly cost.” The spokesperson wrote that while the plan offers “unlimited amount of data... speeds are reduced when they exceed their allotment until the next billing cycle”—though they added that Verizon maintains “a practice to remove data speed restrictions when contacted in emergency situations” and the incident was a “customer support mistake.” Verizon also stated that the matter had “nothing to do with net neutrality or the current proceeding in court.” It’s true that throttling a plan that goes over its data limits isn’t a net neutrality issue per se. The Obama-era rules prohibited service providers from artificially slowing down or blocking content in a discriminatory fashion, whether it’s to limit their customers’ access to rival services or just charge extortionate fees to access certain services. But Bowden’s argument appears to be that County Fire’s experience with Verizon led him to believe they are quite willing to do just that to emergency personnel. “Please work with us,” a fire official wrote to Verizon on July 30th, according to documents filed with Bowden’s addendum. “All we need is a plan that does not offer throttling or caps of any kind.” [ Ars Technica ]","Verizon throttled the Santa Clara County Fire Department’s supposedly “unlimited” data plan while the agency was fighting the record wildfires that have burned over one million acres of the state, Ars Technica reported on Tuesday.

THOMAS FULLER,"Why do the researcher says we’ve never seen this before in California? Mark A. Finney, an expert in fire behavior for the U.S. Forest Service and an author of the study, says California forests are much more vulnerable now because, paradoxically, they have been better protected. In their natural state, forests were regularly thinned by fire but the billions of dollars that the state spends aggressively fighting wildfires and restrictions on logging have allowed forests to accumulate an overload of vegetation. “We had forests that were very resilient to weather variations and insect disturbances in the past — maintained by frequent fire on the order of every year, or every few years at the most,” Mr. Finney said. By putting out fires, “we’ve changed completely the fire component of these ecosystems,” he said. How might the dead-tree forests affect California? One of the most striking concerns is the damage the fires might do to watersheds. Intense, hot-burning fires could disrupt forests’ ability to channel water into the Sierra reservoirs that provide cities like San Francisco with drinking water. That’s a scenario that could nudge the state into rethinking its forest management.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","It’s the summer of apocalypse weather with wildfires, heat waves, and drought. But it looks like we could be granted a reprieve from the fourth horseman of the weather apocalypse—hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration updated its hurricane forecast on Thursday, and hey, good news. Due to a burgeoning El Niño, it’s likely that the rest of Atlantic hurricane season will be quieter than normal. It only takes one hurricane to do damage, though, and the peak of hurricane season is still ahead, so we’re not out of the woods yet. The forecast calls for 4-7 hurricanes, of which up to two could become major ones with winds of Category 3 or greater strength. All told, NOAA is forecasting there will be 9-13 named storms. That includes tropical storms, hurricanes’ weaker sibling (though they can still dump copious amounts of rain). Overall, forecasters give this season 60 percent odds of being less active than usual, a huge uptick from the 25 percent forecast issued in May. Saharan dust has played a role in tamping down activity, as have cooler-than-normal waters in the part of the Atlantic where tropical storms and hurricanes tend to form. But the biggest reason forecasters think this year could be quiet is the creeping presence of an El Niño, which is characterized by warm waters in the eastern tropical Pacific. Those warm waters kickstart a series of changes in the atmosphere, including powerful upper level winds that cut across the Atlantic hurricane basin and tear storms apart or prevent them from spinning up at all. Some storm systems will inevitably defy the odds, though, which is why forecasters continue to urge anyone living near the coast to stay vigilant. “There are still more storms to come—the hurricane season is far from being over,” Gerry Bell, NOAA’s lead seasonal hurricane forecaster, said in a statement. This Atlantic hurricane season has been a bit of a weird one so far. It started a few days early when a subtropical storm (yet another flavor of hurricane-like weather) formed in the Gulf of Mexico. Said storm then turned tropical as it passed over land and basically made landfall again on the Great Lakes, all of which is extremely not normal. Three other storms have formed including tiny ass Hurricane Beryl, the first hurricane of the season. The lower odds of a season of horrors like last year are a welcome forecast if ever there was one even with the statistical peak of hurricane season still ahead and the official end months away.","It’s the summer of apocalypse weather with wildfires, heat waves, and drought.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","As out-of-control wildfires raged across the West, U.S. firefighting authorities took a seemingly unusual step late last month: they called up Australia and New Zealand and asked for help. It was the first time the southern hemisphere nations had been called on to fight U.S. wildfires since the summer of 2015, when 68 firefighters from Australia and New Zealand spent a month helping stamp out blazes in the Pacific Northwest. But this nearly 20 year old partnership has proven its value time and again over the years, with Australian and New Zealand firefighters coming north during their off-season and vice-versa. Unfortunately, climate change could make the fiery alliance harder to maintain in the future. The U.S. certainly needed the extra hands on deck this summer. About six million acres have burned across the West this year, already a million acres more than the ten-year average. California in particular has been on a seemingly endless tear of destructive, record setting blazes, from the Carr Fire that ripped through Redding in July to the Mendocino Complex, which spawned the biggest single fire in California’s history earlier this month. Mike Ferris, an emergency management specialist with the U.S. Forest Service, told Earther that when the nation hit a National Preparedness Level 5 with respect to fire activity (this happened just after a fire tornado exploded into life near Redding on July 26), international partners were mobilized. This scale, which ranges from 1 to 5, essentially describes how much of the nation’s state and federal firefighting resources are being used. Level 5 means personnel and other resources are basically stretched to the max, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. “When we hit that mark, that means we’re pretty much spread thin, we’ve exceeded the ability to fill [firefighting] orders that are coming in,” Ferris said. In early August, 140 firefighters from Australia and New Zealand arrived at the the National Interagency Fire Center headquarters in Boise, Idaho, after which they were dispatched to help fight the Carr and Mendocino Complex fires in Northern California, as well as several wildfires in Oregon and Washington. According to Ferris, the foreign firefighters could stay through the end of the month or even longer, depending on need. And with the fire situation out West still looking pretty grim, the need could definitely be there. Ferris said that the similarity in command structure, technology, and the types of fires experienced in the hot, dry West and the Australian bush make it easy for Australian firefighters to integrate into U.S brigades. The same is true when Australia calls on U.S. firefighters. “At the very time where we have sent personnel to the U.S. to help with your fires over there, we actually need them over here.” Paradoxically, the partnership also works well because of the distance: Being in opposite hemispheres means Australia and the U.S. experience their worst wildfires at opposite times of the year. But as a warmer climate prolongs fire season on both sides of the equator, Lynne Tolmachoff, chief of public education at CAL-FIRE, told Earther resource sharing “is becoming more and more of a struggle.” A 2016 analysis by Climate Central found that fire season out West is already more than 100 days longer than it was in 1970, “approaching the point where the notion of a fire season will be made obsolete by the reality of year-round wildfires.” Australia faces a similar reality. Despite it currently being austral winter, bushfires have been flaring up by the dozens in New South Wales and Queensland, fueled by prolonged drought and mild temperatures that have turned the region into a tinderbox. In New South Wales, 14 local council areas have already declare bushfire season open, something that normally wouldn’t happen until October, according to Lesley Hughes, an ecologist with the Australian Climate Council. She sees this as an ominous sign, one that’s in line with the findings of a recent Climate Council report (of which Hughes is a member) showing that bushfire season is intensifying the southwest and southeast, placing additional pressure on firefighting personnel and aircraft that are shared with other countries. “At the very time where we have sent personnel to the U.S. to help with your fires over there, we actually need them over here,” she told Earther. “That’s one of the problems with the climate changing—we see extension both at the beginning and end of the fire season as well as the severity ramping up.” David Bowman, a fire ecologist at the University of Tasmania, agreed that the sharing of wildfire resources would become harder as the climate becomes warmer and drier. “Our fire seasons have merged,” he told Earther. “This summer has just been a watershed moment.” He thinks we need accept the fact that the fiery future is upon us and start proactively addressing that through adaptation, whether that means more prescribed fires, stricter building codes, or managed retreat from the wildland-urban interface. Until we’ve figured out how to manage our new pyrotechnic reality, firefighters will find it harder to catch a break as they’re increasingly being flown across the world to battle blazes all year long.","As out-of-control wildfires raged across the West, U.S. firefighting authorities took a seemingly unusual step late last month: they called up Australia and New Zealand and asked for help.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Weeks after Yosemite Valley closed due to wildfires for the first time in decades, parts of Glacier National Park in Montana have been evacuated thanks to an explosive fire. The Howe Ridge Fire “grew significantly” on Sunday according to a Facebook post by the park, the same day Glacier hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit for the first time in recorded history. The blaze has led the park to close portions of the iconic Going-to-the-Sun Road from Apgar to Logan Pass, and to evacuate Lake McDonald Lodge and Avalanche Creek Campground around 9 p.m. local time on Sunday. The park also evacuated private home inholdings and park ranger housing. According to the Missoulian, the park has requested a structure protection team to hold back the flames. There are at least two other fires currently burning in the park, all likely sparked by lightning. So far, firefighting efforts have consisted of planes dumping water, smokejumpers parachuting in, and attempts to access the fires on foot, but the blazes continue largely uncontained for now. Earther has reached out to Glacier National Park for more information on the size of the fires, firefighting efforts, and how long evacuation orders will remain in place or if they’ll expand. Smoke continues to obscure views and fill the sky with noxious fumes. As ash and other particulate matter falls from the sky, it could also add insult to injury for Glacier’s glaciers. Rising temperatures have caused the glaciers to recede and disappear over the course of the park’s history. The dark particles from wildfire smoke will absorb more sunlight, acting as a dark blanket that could cause the glaciers to melt even faster. Not only has it been hot, it’s been dry. According to the National Weather Service, Missoula—located about 130 miles south of Glacier—has gone 40 days without a lick of measurable rain. If the streak continues for seven, it will set a record for the longest dry stretch. Records go back to 1893 and the current record was set in [checks notes] 2017. Well then. Western Montana is under a number of fire restrictions due to the hot, dry weather. Glacier is under a Stage I ban, which essentially means folks need to be more vigilant about campfires, smoking, fireworks, and off-roading. To the south of Glacier, a Stage II burn ban is in place, which means no fires, fireworks, smoking outdoors, or off-roading. I feel like a broken record saying this, but it bears repeating that we are witnessing a new era of wildfires in the West. Rising temperatures have lengthened wildfire season by drying out fuels and melting out snowpack earlier. The increasing heat also ups the odds of explosive fires like what we’ve seen from California to Montana to British Columbia. And it’s going to get worse.","Weeks after Yosemite Valley closed due to wildfires for the first time in decades, parts of Glacier National Park in Montana have been evacuated thanks to an explosive fire.

"Judson Jones, CNN","Smoke from wildfires obscures a scenic view near Lewiston, Idaho, on Monday, August 20. With hundreds of wildfires burning across British Columbia and the western United States, smoke is now an everyday occurrence in the Pacific Northwest. ""Unhealthy air has become common across the area due to smoke from wildfires,"" the National Weather Service said Tuesday in its air-quality alert. On Monday, air quality in Seattle reached one of the worst levels it has seen this year. And an ""unhealthy"" air-quality index was reported from British Columbia to Northern California. When air is measured in the ""unhealthy"" category, everyone -- not just sensitive groups -- may begin to experience health effects, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. British Columbia had more fires burning on Tuesday than at any point last year, and the wildfire season still has months to go. Last year was a record year for acres burned across the province, and so far this year is already its third-worst on record. The good news is that air quality will begin to improve later this week as the wind shifts direction. The bad news is the smoke has to go somewhere. Like we have seen over the past few weeks, the smoke will continue to meander with the overall weather pattern. On Monday, smoke was already reaching Denver. By late Tuesday, the National Weather Service in Fort Worth, Texas, was predicting smoke across its horizon. At multiple points this month, satellite images have shown smoke caught up in the jet stream, which acts like a conveyer belt in the upper atmosphere, sending the smoke as far as the East Coast and even over the Atlantic.","With hundreds of wildfires burning across British Columbia and the western United States, smoke is now an everyday occurrence in the Pacific Northwest.",2018-08-21T16:54:46Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Unhealthy air has become common,https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/21/weather/gallery/wildfires-smoke-wxc/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180821093800-01-wildfires-smoke-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,wildfires,0

CHRISTINE HAUSER and LOUIS LUCERO II,"In Durango, Colo., the authorities canceled the city’s annual fireworks display because of the dry conditions. Other events were affected by the smoke, said Michael Kelly, a community events supervisor. The city’s Freedom 5K race and an outdoor reading of historical documents were canceled because of poor air quality. A pancake breakfast and a bicycle ride were delayed, but they began later in the day, after some of the smoke had cleared. Mr. Kelly said city officials, worried about a recent drought, canceled the fireworks display before the 416 fire started. “We didn’t want to take the risk,” he said.

JOSE A. DEL REAL,"“We want people to remain vigilant. It’s still an active fire but we have a lot of firefighters working on the ground,” Ms. Wilkolak said. “But yes, we’re optimistic that we’re making progress.” Although some evacuations were being lifted near Redding on Monday, the city remained covered in a thick smog that largely obscured the sun. Thin layers of ash accumulated on vehicles overnight, and flecks continued to fall throughout the day, as far as at least 60 miles away. Ms. Catalani, 69, evacuated on Thursday night after police officers informed her and her neighbors that their homes, in an area just outside Redding, were in a high risk zone. She left with her landlord, Dan Markham, 83, and two other roommates; the four spent their first night sleeping in a gas station parking lot. Mr. Markham said that after so many days in the shelter, he was growing a bit anxious and eager to go home. Ms. Catalani was concerned about several of her pets, whom she was unable to evacuate. They both said that they were grateful the ash had subsided, and that the heat was tamer on Monday, giving them an opportunity to spend a little time outside. The soot on the table from the fires was piled high. To keep their spirits up. they doted on a pug named Winston, who they said had become the shelter’s “unofficial mascot.” Ms. Catalani and Mr. Markham praised various aid organizations, and lauded the generosity of their fellow Redding neighbors, who have helped with food and clothing donations. “They’ve been awesome.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Californias largest utility is in a death spiral in wake of the deadly Camp Fire last fall. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. (PG&amp;E) announced Monday itd be filing for bankruptcy on January 29.
This news comes after CEO Geisha Williams stepped down from her position Sunday and just days after Moodys downgraded PG&amp;Es credit rating to junk status. So yeah, things arent looking too bright for the company, which may be responsible for the devastating Camp Fire that devoured the city of Paradise back in November. The wildfire killed some 86 people and injured countless others (including two incarcerated firefighters), making it the deadliest blaze in Californias history.
A federal judge announced last week hes planning to order the utility to inspect its electrical grid and clean up the trees near and around its lines. If ordered, the utility must meet these demands by summer when the states wildfire season officially begins.
This is hardly PG&amp;Es first rodeo with wildfires. In fact, its infrastructure has sparked at least 1,500, per Wall Street Journal reports, including a dozen Northern California fires in October 2017. Together, wildfires from 2017 and 2018 have resulted in some $30 billion in potential liability costs for the company. PG&amp;E could even face murder charges for lives lost during these deadly events.
Following PG&amp;Es bankruptcy announcement, its already-shit stock crashed nearly 50 percent this morning. Its hoping that filing for bankruptcy can help it bounce back. So far, the company doesnt expect this move to impact its 15 million customers.
The people affected by the devastating Northern California wildfires are our customers, our neighbors, and our friends, and we understand the profound impact the fires have had on our communities and the need for PG&amp;E to continue enhancing our wildfire mitigation efforts, said interim CEO John Simon in a press release. We remain committed to helping them through the recovery and rebuilding process.
But the company may be nearing its end. The state is considering whether to break PG&amp;E up into smaller pieces, or even take it public. No matter what happens, customers shouldnt face significant power outages, per the San Francisco Chronicles analysis.
Whatever happens to PG&amp;E, California is set to become drier and warmer in the face of climate change, further increasing the risk of wildfires. If utilities dont get their act together, more lives could be lost.",California’s largest utility is in a death spiral in wake of the deadly Camp Fire last fall. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.

"Paola A. Rosa-Aquino on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The Humboldt marten was once a denizen of vast swaths of old growth forests in Northern California and Southern Oregon. But rampant logging has shrunken its habitat, pushing the objectively adorable little predator into small isolated populations and amplifying other threats, like cannabis growth and wildfires. On Tuesday, conservation groups petitioned Oregon for both state and federal protections for the furry mammals under the Endangered Species Act in the hopes that they’ll have a fighting chance. The roughly 400-strong subspecies has already been flirting with extinction for quite some time. “Small isolated populations are at really high risks of becoming extinct,” Tiarra Curry, senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity, which submitted the petition, told Earther. “To save them, we have to create habitat corridors of appropriate forest habitats to reconnect the population.” The picture is looking pretty dismal: Only four remote populations of the kitten-sized creature remain—two in the state of California and two in Oregon—each pocket with fewer than 100 animals. Currently, neither state has regulations in place to protect it save a trapping ban in California. Today’s remaining Humboldt martens face numerous threats. The cannabis industry has already been known to contribute to deforestation and habitat loss in California. But as the Guardian noted in a recent article, illegal marijuana cultivation also poses a threat to the small weasel-like animals, destroying their homes and introducing rodenticides into forest food webs. Now that the marten is trapped in small patches of habitat, populations are increasingly at risk from wildfires, too. According to Curry, this wouldn’t have been a problem historically. But a a 2017 wildfire tore down dense forests separating the northernmost population in California from the southernmost population in Oregon. Other threats abound in Oregon. The state’s highly localized populations are susceptible to any environmental or man-made threat, including cars speeding down the highway that runs by the coastal dunes where they live. “Anything that affects this little strip of habitat could wipe them out,” Curry said. Incredibly, the Guardian reports it is still legal to trap Humboldt martens in Oregon where the animal’s glossy mink-like pelt sells for about $20 each. This is not the first time conservation groups have pushed for the marten to be granted threatened species protections in Oregon state. A 2010 petition to list the subspecies was denied by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, leading to a lawsuit against the agency in 2015 and an overturning of the decision. While it’s unclear what Oregon will decide this time around, in California, the Humboldt marten’s prospects are looking a bit brighter this week. According to the Guardian, the state has already announced its intention to list the animal as an endangered species. We’re reached out to the California Fish and Game Department for confirmation and will update if we hear back.

JENNIFER MEDINA and JACK HEALY,"After his mother fled, Mr. Sezzi, 51, returned to the home and tried to stave off destruction with a garden hose. He could see a glow behind the ridgeline above him, and as the winds kicked up, the hillsides erupted into quilts of fire. Flames skittered down the hills toward avocado orchards, neighboring streets — and him. “It was like someone had turned on a burner from a range,” Mr. Sezzi said. “The fire, the ash, the smoke — everything right toward me. It’s coming at me, getting in my eyes.” As the flames began to surround him, Mr. Sezzi decided his battle to save the house was lost, and he had to go. The fire destroyed the house. It burned so hot that it cracked the fireplace and melted a pan Mr. Sezzi’s mother used to make Christmas cakes into a “glob of molten metal.” Photo Paul and Steve Sezzi sorted through the remains of their mother’s home in Ventura on Wednesday. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times “Everything is just gone,” he said on Thursday from his own home in Ventura — safe for now — where he was warily looking out the window and watching the winds. “It’s really scary. You just don’t know. We never think that the fire could reach us, but everybody’s a little bit on edge. Because where do we evacuate to?” Trish Valenteen said she had stood in her yard in Ventura and prayed for the fire to pass by the house she shares with her 84-year-old father. They were prepared to evacuate on Tuesday night, but ended up staying. She thought they were safe, but on Thursday morning, the Santa Ana winds carried a grimmer omen. “I’m listening to the wind start up again and realizing that we could be in for more destruction,” Ms. Valenteen said. In the Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles, Amanda Saviss, 26, woke up Wednesday and began packing as much as she could from her family’s home on Moraga Drive. Even before they saw firefighters down the hill from her home, the family knew they needed to get out. Photo A firefighter in the Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on Wednesday. Credit Jae C. Hong/Associated Press “It was in the air everywhere,” Ms. Saviss said. “Ash, smoke, all of it. We took everything we could, our whole lives — clothes, pictures, jewelry.” When they realized they had forgotten to water down some dry bushes nearby, a firefighter allowed them to walk back quickly. None of their neighbors had dared to ignore the evacuation orders, she said. “That would be crazy.” They spent much of the morning at a cousin’s house, glued to the local news. By late afternoon, the family of five started to look for a comfortable place for them and their dog. They landed at Hotel Angeleno, an iconic cylindrical tower just west of the 405 freeway and opposite the burning Bel-Air neighborhood. They tried to find their home from the window of a high building but never managed to spot it. They were assured by reports that the flames never reached their street.

George Dvorsky,"With powerful Santa Ana winds gusting as high as 80 miles per hour, firefighters are bracing themselves for another challenging day in Southern California. Over the course of the week, destructive wildfires in the state have forced the evacuation of more than 230,000 people, destroyed hundreds of homes, and torched over 80,000 acres of land. Since the wildfires began on Monday evening, at least 14 different blazes have swept through a region extending from San Diego to the San Fernando Valley. The fires are being fueled by unusually strong Santa Ana winds and large amounts of dry vegetation—ironically caused by heavy rainfall earlier this year—which are now parched and dried out. The fires have caused severe traffic disruptions, closed schools and museums, and triggered power outages. The largest of the fires, the Thomas Fire, encompasses an area measuring 115,000 acres, and it’s just five percent contained. States of emergency have been declared in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, including the city of LA itself. To date, some 230,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. No deaths have been reported, but several firefighters have sustained injuries. Flying above California aboard the ISS, Russian cosmonaut Sergey Ryazansky took these photos of the wildfires. Earlier this week, California’s Office of Emergency Services sent a broadcast text alert to 12 million people across seven different counties warning of the wildfires. It’s the largest alert the office has ever sent. The state is hoping to avoid a repeat of early October 2017 when wildfires killed 44 people in the state. The text didn’t ask people to evacuate, but instead advised of dangerous conditions. Meteorologists have had to adjust to the severe conditions. A color-coded system used to convey wind strength reached uncharted levels, going past the red “high” level, moving into the purple zone, which indicates “extreme” winds. Incredibly, at 80 mph (130 km/h), the winds reached hurricane-force levels. “The forecast for tomorrow is purple,” said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire protection. “We’ve never used purple before.” These winds are fueling existing fires, turning small brush fires into raging infernos in a matter of minutes, and blowing hot embers into adjoining areas, potentially starting new fires. These high winds are also making it difficult—if not impossible—for firefighters to do their work. On Thursday, the wildfires swept through northern San Diego county, moving toward Oceanside and other coastal communities. The Lilac fire, which extends for 4,100 acres and is zero percent contained, made its way through the Bonsall area, torching areas along State Route 76 corridor and destroying 20 buildings. Earlier this week, 29 horses— including elite thoroughbred race horses worth hundreds of thousands of dollars—were killed when the fire reached the San Luis Rey Training Center. Those rescued endured severe burns, and were treated for smoke inhalation, dehydration, and stress. In Bonsall, around 500 horses had to be rescued when the Lilac Fire began to threaten the region some 45 miles north of San Diego, according to CNN. “There was so much smoke it was difficult to see,” Dan Durhan, a horse trainer, told the Associated Press. “Some of the horses were turned loose so they could be safe. They were scattered around.” Despite these losses, firefighters are making some progress. Of the 14 wildfires, five are now classified as contained (the Oak, Riverdale, Little Mountain, Meyers, and Paper fires). In Bel-Air on Thursday, the 475-acre Skirball Fire failed to get any bigger, largely the result of firefighting crews who worked along its western and northern edges near the 405 freeway and several luxurious, multi-million-dollar homes. Fire crews are also testing new technology. On Thursday, the LAFD tested a drone that used thermal imaging to sniff out hot spots, directing firefighters to areas in need of attention. Sadly, southern Californians will have to stay alert, as high winds are projected to persist until Sunday. This year’s wildfire season can’t end soon enough.

Robbie Gonzalez,"Not for the first time this year, Californians this week donned face masks to protect their lungs from the harmful airborne particles that have smothered the state in a sickly, sooty haze. The pollutants are products of three devastating infernos raging hundreds of miles apart, the largest of which, Butte County's Camp Fire, has swelled to become the deadliest and most destructive in state history. They join the more than 7,500 California wildfires that have this year consumed nearly 1.7-million acres of landmore than any fire season on record. The increasing intensity of California's blazes has many residents of the Golden State wondering: Is the smoke from wildfires also getting worse? That's a complicated question. On one hand, data suggests California's fires are burning hotter and consuming more land than they did in the past. ""If you use intensity as a proxy for pollutionthat is, if you assume stronger fires will produce more emissions like smokethen by stint of that, yes, there ought to be more smoke,"" says atmospheric composition scientist Mark Parrington. A senior researcher at the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, Parrington tracks wildfires around the world to better understand their effect on pollution and public health. Most mornings he's in his office by 8 am, downloading the previous 24 hours' worth of fire data from a supercomputer operated by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The datathermal infrared radiation measurements from NASA's MODIS instrument allow him to estimate the intensity of fires burning around the world; how many emissions (like lung-aggravating aerosols and greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide) they're pumping into the atmosphere; and how those emissions affect global air quality. From his office in Reading, just west of London, he's kept closer tabs on California's current wildfires than most. ""You really don't expect to see emissions of this magnitude, this late in the year,"" Parrington says. ""Even on a global scale, it really stood out."" Parrington also compares each day's emissions data to past measurements, which is how he knows that California's current wildfires have pumped more schmutz into the atmosphere than any November blazes on record. In fact, this year's California wildfires have produced more emissions than all but 13 of the past 16 years. ""It's not just the Camp Fire, but the wildfires from this summer,"" Parrington says. ""The Carr Fire, the Mendocino Complex Firethey've been devastating."" If the state sees any major wildfires in December (the way it did in 2017), 2018 could become the year with the highest emissions ever recorded for California. And yet, the question of whether smoke is getting worse is more complicated than many people realize. That's because smoke itself is pretty complex. For starters, it contains well beyond the 40 different ""pyrogenic species"" Parrington says his analyses account for, which include various forms of carbon, and toxic aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene. The relative and absolute quantities of said species can vary considerably, based on the conditions of the burnlike whether it's wet, dry, or has burned in the past. ""All of these factors contribute to how much of those fire emissions get turned into smoke and how the pollutants interact with each other,"" Parrington says. Determining how much smoke is actually in the atmosphere, let alone entering people's lungs, is also challenging. Parrington says it requires understanding how smoke interacts with large scale weather conditions like wind, ground temperature, air temperature, and cloud cover. In the Bay Area, for instance, high pressure atmospheric systems tend to produce inversion layers that, like a lid on a shallow pan, keep smoky air close to the ground. Determining the region's air quality has to do not just with the absolute quantity of smoke, but how much of it is is trapped at ground level. There's also fuel sources to consider, variations in which produce different kinds of smoke. ""The fact that more fires are happening at the wildland urban interface means that fires are encountering new materials,"" says Jessica McCarty, a geographer at Miami University specializing in fire-related air pollution. When it comes to fuel, McCarty says, fires are agnostic. If it's hot enough, it doesn't care if it's a tree, a house, or your car. But as a rule of thumb, the emissions emanating from a burning shrub are less caustic than those of a burning Subaru. ""Wood is far from clean, but it's nothing compared to something like burning rubber, which is downright toxic,"" McCarty says. Which is why, as people build deeper and deeper into wildland areas, the relevant question isn't just how much pollution these fires producing, but what kind of pollution they're producing. Answers to both questions, Parrington says, could be found in computational systems like the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring service, which is capable of taking many of these variables into account and synthesizing the data across multiples wildfire seasons. CAMs has only been operational for three years, but the data it collects is openly available to scientists around the world who are increasingly interested in nuanced questions about wildland smoke. For residents of California, answers to those questions can't come soon enough. In the meantime, hang on to any extra air masks you have lying aroundthere's no telling when you might need them again.

MIRIAM JORDAN,"Thanks to its mild climate and rich soil, Ventura County produces a variety of crops all year. In the plains around Oxnard, Calif., the vast strawberry fields have been spared from the fires. But thousands of immigrants toiling in the fields initially lacked masks to protect them from the thick, acrid smoke that wafted across the county. Volunteers have descended on the fields to hand out masks since last week. “We have been moving mask distributors up and down the coast,” said Lucas Zucker, policy director of the Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy, known as Cause. The California Strawberry Commission has urged workers to wear masks, and some growers have distributed them. One 44-year-old farmworker from Mexico who gave his name as Alfonzo said he worked without a proper mask before Cause gave him one. “My throat was aching, but I have my family to support and the rent to pay,” said Alfonzo, who earns $10.50 an hour in the fields. Ventura County growers are used to Santa Ana winds, and many have lost crops before, mainly to frost. But they said they were surprised to see wildfires so close to the ocean and so late in the year, which highlights the severity of a yearslong drought. “This is a complete game-changer for a lot of us,” said Leslie Leavens, a fourth-generation farmer whose family grows avocados and lemons on 800 acres in Ventura Country. As for Ms. Brokaw, she said she was confident that the majority of her trees would survive, even if there are barely any avocados for her to sell this year. “The orchard can be rejuvenated,” she said. “We are committed to this, long-term.” Continue reading the main story",The largest of the fires has damaged a portion of the harvest in the country’s most productive region for both crops.,2017-12-14T00:10:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",More Victims of the California Wildfires: Avocados and Lemons,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/us/california-fires-avocados.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/14/us/14avocados-promo/14avocados-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfires,0
CHRISTINE HAUSER,"Wildfires have burned across tens of thousands of acres of parched terrain in Colorado, spurring thousands of evacuations and compelling officials to seal off a national forest from the public on Tuesday. A total of six wildfires were still active in the state, which has endured months of dry weather and little snowfall. The largest, in southwest Colorado, was known as the 416 fire because it was the 416th incident to be called in to emergency officials this year. As of Tuesday morning, it had consumed more than 23,000 acres on the edge of San Juan National Forest and was only about 15 percent contained, according to an interagency team. The authorities said they will keep the national forest closed until it receives “sufficient moisture to improve conditions.” Detected at the beginning of the month, the fire has prompted evacuations of more than 2,160 residences so far and put residents of another 500 homes on notice for possible evacuation, according to the authorities. No deaths or injuries have been reported, officials said; residents have sought shelter in middle schools and local officials fear tourists usually drawn to the region for the summer may not come.","A total of six wildfires in Colorado, including the 416 fire, pictured on June 6 near Hermosa, were still active in the state on Tuesday.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Amidst a government shutdown and on the heels of a sober report concluding Californias Camp Fire was the worlds costliest disaster last year, President Donald Trump decided it would be a good time to reiterate the lie that poor forest management is to blame for Californias wildfires woes. He also again threatened to cut off FEMA aid to the state.
The news was announced this morning on Trumps communication platform of choice, in a typo-laden tweet that has since been taken down and rewritten with the standard English spelling of forest.
Heres the original:
The confusing wording of the tweet has led some outlets to report that the president already ordered FEMA to cut off funding to the state of California. But as we should all be well aware at this point, Trump has a habit of sounding off about matters of national importance without bothering to inform the parties involved, whether hes firing the secretary of state via Tweet or attempting to kick transgender people out of the military.
FEMA told Earther that a statement was being prepared in response to Trumps supposed order, but a spokesperson declined to provide further details. The spokesperson did say that FEMA has continued to pay for disaster recovery despite the government shutdown. There are no disaster projects on hold presently and we are not aware of any that will have to be put on hold in the near future, FEMA said.
The California Governors Office of Emergency Services and state fire agency CalFire, which coordinate with FEMA on wildfire responses, did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding Trumps tweet.
Its not the first time Trump has at least threatened to pull federal aid to California as fires in the state spiral out of control. He issued a similar ultimatum back in November as firefighters were in still battling the Camp Fire. Its also hardly the first time Trump has pointed a finger at state environmental policies or forest management as the cause of Californias fire woes. Hes been doing so months, although Trumps fallacious fire culprit seems to have evolved over time from environmentalists who are wasting the rivers by diverting them into the ocean to state forest managers who cant be bothered to rake enough. 
Every version of these wild-ass claims has been thoroughly debunked by everyone from state firefighters who say they have plenty of water to fight the blazes, to Republican voters in Malibu who have correctly observed that better forest management wouldnt have prevented wildfires in their forest-free backyards to the president of Finland who said he never told Trump good forest management is the result of raking.
A charitable read on Trumps thought-salad about forest management is that hes heard about how the antiquated Forest Service practice of stamping out small brush fires has caused fuel loads to increase on forests throughout the West, priming them for larger fires.
But as University of New Mexico fire scientist Matthew Hurteau explained in a Guardian article in November, this is not the predominant cause of the recent fires that have scorched California.
Rather, human development at the wildlife urban interface has upped the number of fires being sparked, whether due to poorly-maintained power lines or an errant cigarette butt, in addition to putting more people and property in harms way. And climate change has primed landscapes to burn more frequently and more intensely, with hot weather and persistent drought turning landscapes into tinderboxes and causing fire season to start earlier in the spring and extend later into the fall.
Whats more, as Axios notes, more than half of Californias forests are federally-managed, and more fires burned on federal land than state land last year.
Hopefully, this latest threat to cut off FEMA aid will turn out to be as empty as the last one. 2018's wildfires took a devastating toll on California, and the state needs all the help it can get. Since President Trump issued disaster declarations for Ventura, Los Angeles, and Butte counties, FEMA has approved nearly 49 million in federal aid, according to a data tracker on the agency website. On Tuesday, newly-elected Governor Newson, along with the governors of Oregon and Washington state sent a letter to the federal government asking for more collaboration on managing the unprecedented fires the West faces.
We have been put in office by the voters to get things done, not to play games with lives, Newsom tweeted in response to Trumps threat.","Amidst a government shutdown and on the heels of a sober report concluding California’s Camp Fire was the world’s costliest disaster last year, President Donald Trump decided it would be a good time to reiterate the lie that “poor forest management” is to bla…",2019-01-09T19:24:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}","Trump Threatens to Cut off Federal Wildfire Aid to California in Ill-Informed, Typo-Laden Tweet",https://earther.gizmodo.com/trump-threatens-to-cut-off-federal-wildfire-aid-to-cali-1831610415,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--w9hzFmmX--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/yyyonpdq0czaryx3ybex.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,wildfires,0
AJ Dellinger,"Record-setting heat plagued much of southern California Friday, with temperatures touching as high as 117 degrees during the day. The unseasonably hot weather sparked a number of brush fires that swept across hundreds of acres of land and destroyed several homes. The National Weather Service reported that at several locations in California saw new, all-time record-high temperatures. The National Weather Service said the weekend will likely be slightly less intolerably hot for residents of the region, but most of the southern part of the state will remain under an excessive heat warning well into the evening. According to the Los Angeles Times, new record highs were set at the Van Nuys Airport (117 degrees) and Burbank Airport (114), as well as in the cities of Santa Ana (114) and Ramona (115). Daily records were also topped in downtown Los Angeles (95 degrees) and Woodland Hills (115). Coastal cities of Camarillo (92 degrees) and Oxnard (86) also experienced new daily record high temperatures. Those unwieldy conditions weren’t just tough on the citizens of the region, but also for the environment. Per the LA Times, a brush fire broke out in the San Bernardino National Forest that quickly spread and forced residents of the Forest Falls area to flee from their homes. The fire encompassed more than 200 acres and was “out of control” near Interstate 8, burning traffic medians alongside the stretch of road. The roaring fires forced “hundreds” of people from their homes, according to the Los Angeles Times, and at least one dozen buildings were destroyed in its blaze. It is believed that several of those structures were homes, but officials did not have an official tally on what was lost. Firefighters also worked to stomp out several smaller fires that sparked in Angeles National Forest, Montecito Heights, Sylmar, and Pacoima. It seems likely those won’t be the last to occur from the current heat wave. KABC-TV in Los Angeles reported the National Weather Service has issued “red flag” warnings for the Los Angeles County Mountains, Angeles National Forest, Ventura County mountains, and Los Padres National Forest until 6pm local time Saturday. The alerts signify an increased risk of fire danger in the regions, some of which are also under wind advisories until Saturday morning. The heat-induced brush fires are just the latest incidents in California’s seemingly endless state of being on fire. Even before the record-breaking temperatures started bearing down on SoCal, wildfires were doing a number to the northern part of the state. Late last year, raging wildfires wreaked havoc on southern California, forcing the evacuation of more than 230,000 people while destroying hundreds of homes and torching more than 80,000 acres of land in its path. Brush fires in the Los Angeles area two years ago destroyed more than 22,000 acres of land and gave the city sky an apocalyptic look, while sand fires the same year pushed thousands from their homes. If the last few years—and what we know about likely effects of climate change—are any indication, things are likely only going to get worse from here.

"Rhett Jones on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Californias devastatingwildfires are now simply a way of life for residentsand things will likely only get worse. Since the presidents solution for combating these climate change-fueled disasters is to threaten to cut FEMA funding for the state, local governments are taking matters into their own hands. The plan: Goat Fund Me.
The tactic of using herds of goats to clear the flammable dry brush in forest areas has become increasingly popular. Now, the town of Nevada City, California, wants to deploy its own goat army to clean up its surrounding areas as soon as possible. Authorities in Nevada City are attempting to quickly subsidize their preventative measures through the power of crowdfunding and catchy branding.
Goat Fund Me, a campaign launched by Nevada City Vice Mayor Reinette Senum, aims to raise $30,000 that will be used to bring in several large herds of hungry goats for the purpose of eating up the wild brush on city land. Though wildfires in California are becoming a year-round problem, the winter season remains the best time for Nevada City to prepare itself. We can go out and pursue grants but that takes months, and we dont have months, Senum told Wired.
Climate change is undoubtedly making the wildfire situation worse through a combination of droughts and fast, hot winds. Wildfires spew tons of carbon into the atmosphere, further accelerating climate change. And the more wildfires that occur, the more money California has to spend fighting themleaving fewer funds to put toward forest management. Its a spiraling, unwinnable trajectory. But using goats to clear out brush before a lightning strike can send miles of forest up in smoke is a relatively cheap method. On its Go Fund Me page, Nevada City estimates that grazing can cost anywhere from $500 to $1,000 per acre depending on the difficulty of the terrain and how much there is to graze.
Even at those costs, Nevada City isnt looking to clear out all 450 acres of its city-owned greenbelt at once. Its working with experts to target the areas that pose the greatest risk. And theres plenty of risks. Nevada City is located about 80 miles from Paradise, California, where last seasons Camp Fire killed at least 38 people and leveled the majority of homes. That disaster is estimated to have resulted in around $16.5 billion in losses for the region. With those kinds of numbers, $30,000 for some goats really starts to look like a bargain.
Using 200 goats, Nevada City can clear around an acre of its land each day. All thats needed is some solar-powered electric fencing to corral the goats into a specific area, a herdsman on hand to oversee the grazing, and a herding dog to ward off predators. Organizers try to locate areas that have nearby sources of water, but a water wagon is also used to help the goats wash that brush down.
When the goats are done, humans also have a job to do. Chainsaw-wielding hand-crews come in and take care of the bigger tasks. And as city officials go around town for planning their targeted areas they also use the opportunity for community outreacheducating private property owners on best practices to take care of their own lands.
Crowdfunding is no substitute for the massive funds, mobilization, and planning that can be done on the state and federal level. A wildly popular Go Fund Me campaign has raised almost $20 million to fund Trumps border wall since it was launched last month. A congressional report from 2017 estimated the wall would cost almost $70 billion to build and $150 million a year to maintain. So yeah, crowdfunding has its limits. On the other hand, that absurd campaign has raised 20 MILLION DOLLARS! Give goats a chance, people.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Edgar Sanchez/Kern County Fire Image caption Firefighters sleep outside after a long shift tackling a California wildfire - in 2017 As the deadliest wildfires in California's history have spread, so too have misinformation and pictures wrongly attributed to the current blaze. At least 42 people have died and 228 more are missing, officials say, while 300,000 others have been forced to flee their homes. Online, social media users have coordinated missing person appeals, organised assistance for the displaced and shared information. But in the scrabble for details, photographs of previous fires in California and elsewhere have been unwittingly muddled in with legitimate images of the ongoing fires. Here are some of the most widely-shared - and the real stories behind them. Thomas Fire, California - 2017 It's easy to see why this image struck such a chord. California firefighters of the Tehachapi Wildland Fire Crew 11 grab some well-earned sleep after an exhausting 24-hour shift. The photograph encapsulates the commitment and dedication of the emergency services. A single tweet of the image has attracted thousands of shares and tens of thousands of likes, in the context of the ongoing fires in California. Undoubtedly evocative, the image dates, however, from 2017 - and the California Thomas fire which was then the largest in the state's history. An area greater than New York City, Brussels and Paris combined was burned. Michele Newell posted the image to Facebook on 19 December last year. Her son, Dylan, was among the resting firefighters. ""A little over two weeks ago Dylan texted me that Venture had a 100-acre fire,"" she wrote at the time. ""That fire erupted into something that took the homes of many friends and displaced hundreds of families. ""It's been heart-wrenching."" Malibu, California - 2007 Flames dwarf a trailer in the foreground as a fire in Malibu rages. Actor James Woods was among the social media users to share the image - but it actually dates from October 2007. According to the LA Times, close to 4,000 acres of land were burned and dozens of structures and vehicles destroyed when electricity pylons toppled over in high winds. Mr Woods has played a prominent role in coordinating help and assistance for fire victims online, through his use of the hashtags #SoCalFiresJamesWoods and #CampFireJamesWoods. The actor, who has developed a large online following in part through his vocal support of conservative causes, enlisted his 1.85 million Twitter followers in efforts to amplify missing person appeals, solicit donations and attract volunteers. Sula, Montana - 2000 It's been described as "" the most famous wildfire photograph ever taken "" and has been featured in Time magazine's year in pictures. But nonetheless, some social media users mistakenly attributed the fire to California in 2018. Thousands shared and liked posts featuring the image online. The photograph was taken in Sula, Montana, in 2000 by John McColgan, who worked with the Bureau of Land Management, Alaska Fire Service. Sparked by lightning strikes, the fire was one of 86 which raged across America's western states in August that year, according to Time.","As California's deadliest wildfires have spread, so too have photos misattributed to the current blaze.",2018-11-13T13:30:24Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}","No, these photos are not from the California wildfires",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-46194019,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A37A/production/_104305814_edgar_sanchez.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,wildfires,0

The death toll rose from 63 on Friday, eight days after the Camp Fire broke out in northern California. However, the sharp increase in the missing list - from 631 to 1,011 in 24 hours - may not be accurate. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said it was possible it contained duplications. ""I want you to understand that this is a dynamic list,"" he told reporters. ""The information I am providing you is raw data and we find there is the likely possibility that the list contains duplicate names."" Authorities have also warned that some of those on the list may be fine but unaware people are trying to find them, or unable to call. However, there could also be people among the dead who no-one has yet realised are missing. The fire - the deadliest in the state's history - has destroyed 142,000 acres (57,000 ha), including most of the town of Paradise, home to 27,000 people. Rescue workers, aided by cadaver dogs, were continuing to comb what little remained of the town on Friday. In total, some 47,000 people have been told to evacuate, with those who have fled the fire being houses in emergency shelters, as well as with friends and family, while others are camping. President Donald Trump is due to travel to California on Saturday to survey the damage and meet those affected. What's the latest on the firefighting operation? The California Fire Department says it has now contained about 45% of the Camp Fire blaze. Officials say they do not expect to fully contain the blaze until the end of the month.

Brock Long, administrator of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said the damage to Paradise was ""one of the worst disasters"" he had ever seen. Military troops are assisting forensics teams and cadaver dogs as they continue to search for human remains. Officials have warned the search operation could take weeks. Why are the fires burning? Officials have not yet confirmed what started any of the blazes, as investigations are continuing. Several people have already filed a lawsuit against a local power company, alleging that the Camp Fire started when a high-voltage transmission line failed. Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn - but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. Low humidity, warm winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. Have you been affected by the wildfires? If it is safe to do so please get in touch.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The deadly Carr Fire burning in Northern California can now claim an unfortunate milestone: It has officially cracked the list of the 10 most destructive wildfires to ever beset California. The Monday morning update from CAL FIRE shows that 966 structures have been destroyed, making the Carr Fire the eighth-most destructive wildfire to hit the state. At only 20 percent contained, the fire still poses a risk to 5,012 more structures, according to CAL FIRE, meaning that amount of property lost (and its ranking on the list) could rise, especially as assessment crews are able to access more areas that were hit by the fire. At least six people are dead and more are missing, numbers that could sadly also rise. The majority of the losses have occurred in neighborhoods on the north and western side of Redding, a city of 90,000 located on Interstate 5 about two and a half hours north of Sacramento. The Carr Fire rushed into town on Thursday night, jumping the Sacramento River and continued its rampant growth on the backs of gusty winds and 110-degree-Fahrenheit heat. The fire continued to grow over the weekend, doubling in size from day to day before it slowed down on Sunday night. As of Monday, the fire has burned 98,724 acres. The heat in particular has led to near-record-low vegetation moisture, leaving trees, shrubs, and grassland primed to go up in smoke. Vegetation has burned so intensely that the fire has sparked a vortex of smoke and flames, twisting fire tornadoes, and towering pyrocumulus clouds. Smoke has blanketed much of Northern California, spiking air quality to unhealthy levels. Four of the 10 most destructive fires in state history have occurred in the past year, and eight of them have happened since 2000. Three of them occurred last year alone as part of the conflagration in Wine Country and the Thomas Fire that hit Southern California. This wildfire season has proven to be catastrophic as well. Beyond the Carr Fire, wildfires have burned 410,000 acres, more than double the average for this point in the year, according to statistics compiled by Steven Bowen, a meteorologist at insurance company Aon Benfield. The dangerous Ferguson Fire caused Yosemite Valley to be evacuated as a safety precaution last week. And earlier this month, the County Fire ripped through Yolo County, eating up 1,000 acres of land per hour at its peak as onlookers watched its advance from a casino parking garage.

Morgan Sung,"When two bears suffered painful burns while escaping Southern California's wildfires, veterinarians used an unconventional bandage to treat the animals' paws: fish skin. The bears, along with a young mountain lion with less severe burns, were treated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife after the Thomas Fire burned through Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. The wildfires that swept through California in late 2017 were the worst in the state's history. The Thomas Fire was the largest ever recorded, burning through 273,400 acres. According to a statement by the CDFW, the bears' injuries were severe, with ""oozing wounds, and, in some cases, paw pads that were completely burned off."" SEE ALSO: Californians band together to save horses from wildfires Deana Clifford, senior wildlife veterinarian at the CDFW, and Jamie Peyton, chief of integrative medicine at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the University of California, Davis treated the animals by using fresh tilapia skin instead of traditional bandages. Peyton sutured tilapia skin directly onto the bears' paws. Image: California department of fish and wildlife They opted to use fish skin because its collagen levels and moisture retention abilities are similar to human skin. Researchers in Brazil have used fish skin, in favor of human skin grafts, to bandage burn victims, but the practice hasn't been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use on humans in the United States. After applying a homemade salve to speed up healing, Peyton and Clifford cut grafts of sterilized tilapia skin and sutured them directly onto the animals' paws while they were under anesthesia. To prevent them from eating the fish skin, they wrapped the animals' paws in corn husks and rice paper. (The mountain lion ended up eating his, anyway.) SEE ALSO: How to help victims of the Southern California wildfires “One of the first things that the bear did was stand up after we applied them,” Peyton said in a statement released by UC Davis. “She was more mobile, which in my mind is a huge success for pain control.” Veterinarians wrapped the animals' paws in corn husks and rice paper to prevent them from eating the fish skin grafts. Image: california department of fish and wildlife Although the animals received three treatments over the course of a month, Peyton told Mashable that the path to recovery was ""fraught with more challenges."" Unlike with treating domestic pets, it wasn't possible to clean, care, and bandage wounds on a daily basis. She said it was also more difficult to manage their pain with medications, and that they had to deal with ""a time crunch to get them back to the wild as soon as possible."" ""Despite these challenges our therapies helped these animals recover faster than we have noted in some companion animals,"" Peyton said, ""The use of the tilapia skin bandages made a remarkable difference in their pain control and healing ability."" The bears also received acupuncture, which has been administered to pets for years. Peyton said the treatment was similar to that given to dogs and cats. ""The principles of pain management and wound healing are similar across many species,"" she said. One of the bears shortly before she was released back into the wild. Image: California department of fish and wildlife To complicate recovery even more, the doctors discovered that one of the bears was pregnant during a routine ultrasound. “That was a game changer for us, because we knew it wouldn’t be ideal for her to give birth in confinement,” Clifford said in CDFW's statement. “We aren’t really set up to have a birth at the lab holding facilities, and we knew there was a high probability that she could reject the cub, due to all the stress she was under. We needed to get her back into the wild as quickly as possible.” The CDFW team built winter dens so the bears could wake up in safety. Image: california department of fish and wildlife Since the bears' natural habitats were destroyed during the fire, officials from the CDFW built winter dens for each of the animals to sleep in and be protected from danger. The team released them into the wild on Wednesday and plan on monitoring the rest of their recovery via satellite. Peyton doesn't see fish skin becoming a standard treatment for human burn victims in the United States because there are multiple skin graft banks that have the resources to treat patients. However, she does believe there may be more demand for alternatives like tilapia skin in countries with fewer banks and less readily available resources. ""I think we definitely need more research in this area to determine if it will be used more extensively in people,"" Peyton said. ""Based on what we have seen in these animals, there is potential for this to be a more commonly used therapy in the future.""","When two bears suffered painful burns while escaping Southern California's wildfires, veterinarians used an unconventional bandage to treat the animals' paws: fish skin.

JOSE A. DEL REAL and JACK NICAS,"Erin McLaughlin and her 81-year-old neighbor, Elisabeth Mesones, left their homes in Magalia, north of Paradise, on Thursday morning. But after just a few minutes along a road known as Skyway, they hit gridlock traffic. The sky was darkening, smoke was thickening and they could see small fires breaking out around them. But they could not move. Trapped in traffic outside of Paradise, Ms. McLaughlin, 58, watched several other motorists commandeer a Pepsi truck to use as a shelter, which they later decided against. Conditions worsened, and they heard propane tanks exploding on all sides. The next thing we get told is, Get out of your vehicle and run, Ms. McLaughlin said. About 75 motorists hurried to the parking lot of a nearby Chinese restaurant. For the next six hours, they camped out there. Everything was on fire all around you, she said. It was the most scary thing Ive ever seen. The fire never reached them before they were able to escape. But a tour of Paradise on Sunday revealed that the fire eventually did arrive. The restaurant had burned down. The evacuations resulted in moments of heroism, too. Mr. Pierce, a registered nurse, did not end up leaving Paradise right after his truck was freed. He instead returned to the main hospital, Adventist Health Feather River, where he manages the intensive care unit. He and some colleagues began treating injured neighbors. When the hospital caught fire, they moved patients and equipment about 100 yards away, to the hospitals helipad. Eventually, everyone made it out.

"Erin Biba on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","When fire scientist Albert Simeoni wants to study wildfires, he cant exactly run into the nearest blaze with sensors and data collection tools. Its simply too dangerous and these conflagrations, though theyre becoming more frequent and intense with climate change, arent predictable enough to research in the controlled manner that science demands.
But he and his fellow fire protection engineers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute have designed a solution: a wind tunnel where they can burn all sorts of materials under different conditions to see how they respond. Its helping them develop new ways to manage forests and design fire-resilient communitiesalthough in the current federal funding environment, actually implementing this critical research is proving to be an uphill battle.
Its very difficult to study a fire while its happening, Simeoni told Earther in his pronounced French accent. Unpredictable weather patterns, uncertainty regarding how different layers of vegetation burn, topography, local residents and nearby buildings are all elements that change the fire. Not to mention the importance of everyone, researchers included, staying out of the way of firefighters trying to save lives.
Field research does happenfor instance, when Simeoni became a fire chief at his volunteer fire department in France, hed sometimes put sensors on his firefightersbut for the most part, the best way to study wildfire is in what Simeoni calls sealed experiments. That means prescribed burns and lab studies, the latter of which allow very specific variables, like wind or vegetation type, to be studied in isolation. 
We dont have any pathways to deliver the results of our research because theres no funding. Its a dire picture at the moment.
Simeoni has been studying fires at WPI for a year and a half, and he built the wind tunnel last year. Essentially a large glass box, the bottom of the tunnel is removable so it can be operated in the lab with materials the team brings inmostly, vegetation from the Worcester areaor taken out to the field and placed over vegetation.
Right now, the researchers are using the wind tunnel for two basic but essential studies. First, in conjunction with the University of Notre Dame, theyre burning dowels made from different types of coated, lightweight wood often found in hardware stores to watch how the flames spread between fuels. While burning these dowels, theyre also looking at how the wind moves and changes the way the fire spreads.
Simeonis hope is that the results of this research will help communities become more fire-proof. The recent destruction of Paradise, California by the Camp Fire underscores just how high the stakes are.
For most places I firmly believe its a design problem, Simeoni said. We see a domino effect in these communities. You ignite the first row of houses and then you lose the whole community. He believes there may be better ways to engineertowns so that if a row of houses does catch on fire, it doesnt spread and take out the entire neighborhood.
The second set of tests hes performing in the wind tunnel are on vegetation. Specifically, how do different types of plants affect wind patterns? While normal wind tunnels are designed to produce smooth wind patterns, this tunnel can mimic gusts and turbulent conditions. For these tests, the bottom of the tunnel can be removed and the entire rig can be brought out to the field to burn real vegetation.
Simeoni explained that the goal is to separate variables and add them back one by one once weve captured the physics of each piece.
The challenge with all of this, Simeoni said, is that even though they are learning a lot about wildfire and how it works, there is currently no systemized, government-funded pipeline for relaying the information theyve gathered to the public. 
Right now, fire researchers are relying on one-on-one individual relationships with fire managershis team is assisting the New Jersey Fire Service with prescribed burns in the Pine Barrensto try and get their findings put into practice. But on a broader scale, We dont have any pathways to deliver the results of our research because theres no funding, Simeoni said. Its a dire picture at the moment.
Simeoni noted one federal government program, the Joint Fire Science Program, thats dedicated to delivering research for implementation. But its lost significant funding over the years. In 2012 the program was funded at $13 million. It was originally slated to be abolished in proposed versions of the 2019 budget by the Trump Administration, but some funding was restored. The Office of Wildland Fire, which coordinates budget and policy for the Department of the Interiors fire programs, told Earther that, while the 2017 total budget for this program for both the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest Service combined was $9 million, in 2018 that dropped to $3 million and funding came only from DOI. Funding for 2019 is dependent on final congressional action (and the Trump Administrations budget proposal, once again, eliminates the program entirely).
The diminishment of this program comes as climate change is upping likelihood of large blazes and causing the cost of wildfires to skyrocket. Before 2000, Simeoni says, the costliest wildfire in the US was the 1991 Oakland fire, at $1.5 billion. The cost of the Camp Fire is not yet certain, but could be upwards of $10 billion. With little governmental support for further research into how fire conditions are changing and how we can adapt, were essentially flying blind into a more dangerous future.
The level of challenge that we have for our societies now is becoming very, very important and we cannot avoid it, Siemoni said. Were messing around in the playground while we have very dangerous and grave things happening and Im afraid well see more drama down the road if were not tackling this phenomenon as we should. We need more people working on this.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Mario Aguilar to Gizmodo","As scientists warnings about climate change become increasingly dire, our conversations about extreme weather events have become increasingly political. There will always be those who chastise the climate-concerned public for politicizing the storm but theres also an argument for doing just that when it is the refusal of specific politicians to act on climate that increases our vulnerability to powerful storms, wildfires, and more. But drawing linkages between our weather, our climate, and our politics is quite a different thing than blaming victims of a tragedy for their own suffering. That latter, far uglier form of politicization reared its head last week when the Guardian ran an article under a headline seemingly tailor-made to drive the partisan wedge between us even deeper: Victims of Hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers. The headlines implicationthat by voting for the wrong politicians, folks in the Florida Panhandle were somehow getting whats coming sparked swift condemnation on social media. And to the credit of author John Abraham, a professor at the University of St. Thomas, he asked the Guardian to change it after publication, and the Guardian did. But the victim-shaming sentiment the Guardian telegraphed is sadly nothing new. In the aftermath of a storm, those who stay behind are often condemned for not evacuating, even though evacuation is a privilege not everyone can afford. In the wake of the deadly Oso landslide that struck Washington State in 2014, people whose homes were destroyed were blamed for building on unstable ground in the first place. When Hawaiis Kilauea erupted last spring, residents of Leilani Estates took heat for buying property atop an active volcano. The list goes on and on. After a disaster happens, it is a very common human trait to immediately find a way to assign blame, disaster researcher and former Gizmodo writer Mika McKinnon told Earther. A large chunk of why we do this is to say well, it wouldnt happen to me. Perhaps, then, it isnt surprising that how victims voted is starting to creep into conversations about who is to blame when it comes to climate change-fueled disasters, however reprehensible that kind of talk may be. Faith Kearns, a scientist at the California Institute for Water Resources, says shes seen victim shaming based on ideology become increasingly common as we wrestle with how to talk about climate change after a disaster. As an example she pointed to the massive wildfire that tore through Fort McMurray in 2016, which brought out the worst on social media, with some, including former New Democratic Party candidate Tom Moffatt, calling it karmic that a town in the Canadian oil-sands was devoured by a blaze likely exacerbated by climate change. A brief scan of responses to the recent Guardian article reveals there are indeed jerks who saw citizens of the red-leaning Florida Panhandle getting what they deserve when Hurricane Michael struck last week. Matthew Motta, a postdoc studying science communication at the University of Pennsylvania, wasnt aware of any research showing that a significant number liberals blame conservative voters for extreme weather, or, more perniciously, revel in disasters striking their communities. But he said the deep partisan divide over climate change makes it the sort of issue where we might expect to see affective polarization, that is, polarization that causes us to dislike the other side even more. And its not just random internet commenters who are liable to resent and blame those they disagree with on climate change. Sarah Myhre, a climate scientist at the University of Washington, told Earther that derision or dismissal of the uninformed or misinformed public is a sentiment shes been exposed to quite a few times, particularly among male colleagues whove never had their authority questioned ever. The righteousness of male power brokers when they are not believed gets re-routed into anger and cynicism, Myhre told Earther. She said we need more leadership from women, particularly women of color, to reframe our conversations about climate change centering the values of human rights. NASA climate scientist Kate Marvel emphasized that blaming disaster victims, which she described as at best unproductive and at worst just morally abhorrent, sets up a false narrative when it comes to climate change. After all, its hardly the citizens of the Florida Panhandle among the poorest in the statewho are responsible for our planetary fever. That distinction goes to the fossil fuel industry, which has reaped unimaginable profits off our outdated energy system. It goes to the shareholders and executives whove hid their own companies research on the link between carbon emissions and warming, whove built misinformation campaigns to sow confusion among the public, and even now, when the science is too clear for bald-faced denials, who have convinced us we are all equally to blame. And it goes to politicians who continue to bury their heads in the sand at industrys behest. Politicizing the storm can be the right thing to do. But if were using politics to punch down, were giving these real power brokers a pass.","As scientists’ warnings about climate change become increasingly dire, our conversations about extreme weather events have become increasingly political.

JENNIFER MEDINA and SARAH MERVOSH,"The fires are fueled by extreme heat and parched vegetation from years of drought. And firefighters have repeatedly been vexed by the soaring temperatures and rugged terrain of the current fires. Scientists say climate change is a central factor in creating the atmospheric ingredients that make wildfires like California’s more extreme. Warmer global temperatures, driven by the greenhouse gases emitted from man-made activity like burning coal and driving cars, has led to droughts as well as more intense heat waves that last longer. The result: increasingly intense fire seasons that start earlier and last longer. “You combine drought and heat, you get record wildfires. It’s not rocket science,” said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. Michael Wehner, a senior staff scientist at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said it is still not possible to quantify the role that climate change plays versus other factors from more housing developments to the way forests are managed. But, Mr. Wehner said, “It’s fair to say that there is a human influence, and it’s not small.” The Mendocino Complex Fire is a combination of two fires that ignited a few miles apart, Ms. Tolmachoff said. In instances where multiple blazes are close enough together and affect the same area, she said, officials consider them one fire, called a complex. Officials are investigating the cause of the fire, which started on July 27 and was 34 percent contained as of early Tuesday. It has so far destroyed 143 structures, including 75 residences. Despite its size, no one has died in the Mendocino Complex Fire, Ms. Tolmachoff said. Of the top 20 largest wildfires in California, about half have come in the last decade, according to Cal Fire. “That says a lot about the way things are changing in California,” Ms. Tolmachoff said.","Two fires have combined in Northern California to form the largest wildfire in state history. The Mendocino Complex has doubled in size in the past four days and now spans more than 283,000 acres.",2018-08-07T18:23:18Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Fires Grow to Largest in State History,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/us/california-fires-mendocino.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/08/us/08calfire-03/08calfire-03-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfires,0
Andrew Freedman,"The wildfires raging across Southern California have scorched tens of thousands of acres of land, destroyed hundreds of homes, and disrupted countless lives. While the scenes of flames screaming up hillsides, and smoke trailing hundreds of miles out over the Pacific are dramatic, they're not unprecedented. In fact, they're not even that rare. However, they are likely to be more damaging in the future, and more common in certain parts of California and the American West in general, thanks to climate change and other factors. SEE ALSO: California's worst fire season just got even more terrifying Wildfires, particularly during the fall, are endemic to California. In Southern California, the biggest blazes tend to flare up when the dry, warm Santa Ana winds blow, sometimes unceasingly for days on end. This week, for example, the Santa Ana wind event began on Monday, and is not forecast to stop until Friday night. Flames from a wildfire leap above traffic on Highway 101 north of Ventura, Calif., on Dec. 6, 2017. Image: Noah Berger/AP/REX/Shutterstock Much of the time during these events Southern California gets lucky, and there are no major blazes to speak of. It's not one of those years. This year is proving to be California's worst wildfire season on record. In October, more than 40 were killed and at least 10,000 homes lost when fires tore through Sonoma and Napa Counties, devastating the community of Santa Rosa, in particular. Known as ""El Diablo"" winds in this area, the offshore airflow was instrumental in propelling the wildfires faster than people could get out of the way, let alone allow firefighters to squelch the flames. Santa Ana winds result from a particular weather pattern featuring a high pressure area anchored over the Great Basin, and a low pressure area southwest of California, over the Pacific Ocean. The air pressure contrast between these two systems results in a funneling of air from east to west. As the air descends from the higher elevations toward the coast, it warms and dries, leading to extremely low humidity. These background conditions set the scene for a major fire, provided there's a spark. This year, there's been added fire risk from repeated heat waves that have sent temperatures soaring into the triple-digits as late as October, further drying out vegetation that is now serving as fuel for the fires. “It’s the coincidence of an ignition,"" that determines whether a Santa Ana event will lead to major fires, said Jon Keeley, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, in an interview. ""And the two big causes of ignitions during Santa Ana wind events are power lines that blow down from the strong winds and arson."" The winds themselves can initiate a fire by downing power lines, something suspected in the fires that affected Northern California in October. Power outages preceded the Thomas Fire in Ventura on Tuesday, as well. Upper level winds showing the huge area of high pressure, or ""ridge,"" in the jet stream across the West, highlighted with the blue box. Image: earth.nullschool.net Importantly, the winds also make the fires nearly impossible to contain, blowing hot embers well ahead of the fire line, allowing blazes to hop across 10-lane highways with unsettling ease. The National Weather Service has been warning of the likelihood for ""extreme fire behavior"" with any fire that starts during this long-lasting wind event, going as far as designating the fire danger as ""extremely critical"" in the Los Angeles area. Once the fires get going, they can create their own weather, sucking in air from surrounding areas and lofting it upwards, promoting further fire growth and unpredictable behavior. Longer term trends This week, the high pressure area, or ""ridge"" in the jet stream, is extremely pronounced, part of a tendency toward more extreme weather patterns across the country. Recent studies indicate there may be connections between altered weather patterns, which are favoring drier conditions in California, and climate change. Last summer was the state's hottest on record, following a wet winter, which in turn followed the worst drought in modern California history. These episodes of weather whiplash have left the Golden State's trees stressed, making them more susceptible to toppling over from strong winds. Multiple studies have found that long-term climate change, which is mainly due to human emissions of greenhouse gases, is raising the risk of large wildfires in the Western U.S. However, according to the USGS' Keeley, this doesn't apply to the lower elevations of southern California. His research has shown that the warming climate is leading to more frequent and larger fires in Northern California, particularly in high elevation forests, he said. There are broader, non-climate forces at work, too. Population growth is placing more people in harms' way, including by building in areas at the so-called wildland-urban interface, or WUI, where areas that traditionally burn as part of their natural ecology butt up against homes and businesses. In short, urban sprawl is not helping solve our wildfire problem. Keeley emphasized this point, saying that it's not just climate change, but global change that will alter wildfire severity and risk going forward. Wildfires are likely to have more catastrophic human impacts due to population growth along with climate change, he said. California statewide average temperatures for June through Nov. 2017. Image: noaa/ncei. For example, he cited a 1964 wildfire that burned almost the exact same area as the deadly Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa. However, back then, the blaze caused no fatalities and only destroyed about two-dozen homes. Since that fire, though, he said the population in that area grew fivefold. “We need to be thinking about all the global changes that are taking place,” Keeley said. In the near-term, though, the Santa Ana winds are forecast to increase on Wednesday night, and may hit 70 miles per hour in some spots of Southern California on Thursday. In other words, this latest round of fires, which is a sign of the state's heritage and future challenge in a warming world, may yet grow worse.","Read more... {""player"":{""description"":""These fires may be a glimpse into SoCal's future under climate change."",""image"":""https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-UjmGCjSM8A3WRuM-dU4wz3FFDc=/https%3A%2F%2Fvdist.aws.mashable.com%2Fcms%2F2017%2F12%2F2c93672f-2bfe-c7a0%2Fthumb%2…",2017-12-06T22:40:04Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}",The combustible mix behind Southern California's terrifying wildfires,http://mashable.com/2017/12/06/causes-of-southern-california-terrifying-wildfires-climate-change/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/44W3cplqc12pcASZtA9Xo3fYuNs=/1200x630/2017%2F12%2F06%2F0c%2Ff6cdf617cb964daf939a45ff2bdc5e85.b9168.jpg,mashable,Mashable,wildfires,0

Andrew Freedman,"Southern California is no stranger to wildfires, but even by historical standards, the events of early December 2017 stand out. The dreaded Santa Ana winds, which transport warm, dry air from inland toward the coast, have been unceasing. The air is dry enough to ignite any vegetation exposed to a spark, be it a downed power line, carelessly-discarded cigarette, or an arsonist's can of gasoline. Through December 7, wildfires had burned more than 100,000 acres in the greater Los Angeles area alone, with more than 200,000 people evacuated from erratic flames fanned by 50 to 80-mile-per-hour winds. The Thomas Fire, in Ventura, about 60 miles northwest of downtown L.A., has proven to be the biggest blaze so far, burning at least 96,000 acres. The weather conditions have been too difficult for firefighters to gain the upper hand against many of the wildfires, with the combination of the winds, lack of significant rain for at least 8 months, and some of the driest air ever measured in this part of California. In San Diego, the National Weather Service found relative humidity levels well below 10 percent on Thursday, with tinderbox dry air draped across the entire West Coast.","Southern California is no stranger to wildfires, but even by historical standards, the events of early December 2017 stand out.

NASA satellite shows smoke plumes and heat signatures (red dots) from the wildfires burning in the Los Angeles area on Dec. 5, 2017 Image: NASA WorldView The fires have spread so quickly and grown so large thanks to the California weather phenomenon known as the Santa Ana winds. The east-to-west blowing winds come from the Pacific and tap into warm and dry conditions inland. The winds push against the air coming from the LA basin's eastern mountains, which compresses the wind and heat between the ocean and the mountains, further drying out vegetation that has dried out over the summer. The phenomenon makes for dangerous fire conditions, which is now affecting residents across Southern California, from Ventura County to the north, and Santa Clarita and Santa Ana to the east. The Los Angeles Fire Department has ordered the evacuation of the 20.5 square miles including and surrounding the Creek Fire, which jumped the 210 Freeway and is threatening Santa Ana's Sylmar and Lake View Terrace neighborhoods.

Two more people were killed in the south, near Malibu. An estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes to avoid three major blazes in the state. The Camp Fire began spreading through Butte County on Thursday, and firefighters were powerless to stop it destroying the town of Paradise. Another fire swept into the affluent southern beach resort of Malibu on Friday and has now doubled in size. That fire, known as the Woolsey, now covers an area of 70,000 acres (28,000 hectares). Among the towns under evacuation orders is Thousand Oaks, where a gunman killed 12 people in a rampage on Wednesday. Meteorologists have warned that dangerous conditions may continue well into next week, but firefighters say they are hoping to take advantage of a temporary lull in the wind fanning the flames. Where is the Camp Fire? The 20,000-acre (8,100-hectare) fire north of Sacramento started in the Plumas National Forest on Thursday and quickly engulfed the town of Paradise. Residents fled for their lives as more than 6,700 homes and businesses were destroyed, making the fire the most destructive in the state's history. The flames moved so fast that some had to abandon their cars and escape the town on foot. Rescuers used a bulldozer to push abandoned cars out of the way in order to reach a hospital and evacuate patients as the fire engulfed the building, Butte County Supervisor Doug Teeter said. ""There's nothing left standing,"" said Scott Maclean, the state's forestry and fire protection spokesman. The fire has now been partially contained. Media caption The Camp Fire has been fuelled by strong winds and dry forest Driving through walls of flame By the BBC's James Cook, Paradise in California Paradise is hell. A smouldering, sepia world in ruins. The air is acrid. Burning chemicals leave a bitter taste in your mouth. Walking among the ashes of people's lives is eerie and awful. There is a profound sadness here. We pass a child's charred swing, a swimming pool filled with filth, and worst of all, a pet dog which did not survive. Such was the intensity of the blaze that much of the debris is hard to recognise. Wafers of ash are drifting down like enormous snowflakes, smothering sound. But it is not quite silent here. A sooty squirrel scrambles up a blackened tree in a panic. There are booms and creaks from burning trees and telegraph poles. And soon, going from ruin to ruin, there will be the sound of those with the hardest job of all, checking to see if anyone was left behind. Fire officials have also issued evacuation notices for parts of Chico, a town of 93,000 people north of Sacramento. Where is the Woolsey Fire? The blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. Another blaze, the Hill Fire, started at about the same time, also near Thousand Oaks. Media caption 'How much more can this town endure?' - deadly wildfire hits Thousand Oaks, where 12 people were killed in a mass shooting On Friday, the flames jumped Highway 101 and headed into coastal areas. All residents have been ordered to evacuate. Los Angeles County sheriff's Chief John Benedict said on Saturday that two people had been found dead but provided no details on the deaths. Malibu and nearby Calabasas are home to many celebrities. The actor Martin Sheen was briefly reported missing but he later reported that he was on the beach, unharmed. On Twitter, reality TV star Kim Kardashian said the home she shared with rapper Kanye West had been hit by the flames. ""Trying to get my mind off this fire...

The Camp Fire, centred in and round the town of Paradise northeast of San Francisco, is now 95% contained. Forecasts of fresh rainfall could help extinguish the remaining flames, but might also hinder rescue efforts. At least 83 people died in the blaze, and more than 500 remain missing. Workers have been combing through the debris from more than 10,000 homes that were burned down by the fire. Hundreds of people - along with cadaver dogs - swept through the debris of Paradise and surrounding areas in the search for the missing, wading through ash that officials fear could turn into a thick paste with the onset of rain.

CONOR DOUGHERTY and ADAM NAGOURNEY,"The proposed law is the latest twist in a long and contentious fight over rent increases in Santa Rosa. The Sonoma County city, like much of California, is struggling with a difficult housing shortage and rising rents. The City Council passed a rent control and just cause eviction measure in 2016, only to see it repealed by a landlord-backed ballot initiative during a June special election this year. After the fires, community groups continued to organize renters, holding clinics and renewing their push for expanded rights. “The fires are clarifying the deep need that our region has for tenant protections,” said Davin Cardenas, a director of the North Bay Organizing Project.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People across northern California are snapping up masks to try to handle the smoke Northern California's air quality has become the worst in the world, according to monitoring groups, as the state battles devastating fires. Air quality network Purple Air said on Thursday the air is now worse than smoggy cities in India and China. Schools have cancelled classes, flights have been delayed, and internet searches for smoke masks are soaring. At least 63 people have died in the Camp Fire - the state's deadliest and most destructive blaze. The number of missing people has jumped to more than 600, local authorities said, doubling the size of the list in a day. Three more people have also died in the Woolsey Fire, further south. President Donald Trump will travel to California on Saturday to survey the damage and meet those affected. The Camp Fire - which broke out eight days ago - swept through a swathe of the north at high speed, leaving residents little time to escape. How bad is the air? The AirNow website ranks the air around San Francisco and Oakland as ""very unhealthy"", meaning everyone in the area could experience more serious health effects. Around Elk Grove and Sacramento, it is classed as ""hazardous"" - the whole population is likely to be affected, their website states. A San Francisco Chronicle reporter tweeted that breathing in San Francisco was equivalent to smoking nearly a dozen cigarettes. In Paradise, which was destroyed by the wildfire, it is closer to smoking 22 cigarettes. Internet searches for smoke masks have reportedly skyrocketed, while schools and universities have cancelled classes and held recesses for students inside. Flights have also been affected. Health officials warned people to stay indoors rather than risk the smoke. ""Wearing a mask may encourage outdoor activity when staying indoors is the best way to minimize exposure to smoke,"" the Sacramento County Public Health Office said Butte County released advice for residents about how to handle the poor air quality. What's the latest on the firefighting operation? The California Fire Department says it has now contained about 45% of the Camp Fire blaze. Officials say they do not expect to fully contain the blaze - which has razed 145,000 acres (56,600 ha) - until the end of the month. Media caption California wildfires survivor's tearful account of escape with son They are also battling several other fires, including the Morgan Fire in Contra Costa County, near San Francisco, the Woolsey Fire in Ventura County near Los Angeles and the smaller Hill Fire, also in Ventura County. The worst-hit area is the town of Paradise, with officials saying it will need a ""total rebuild"" job that will take several years. Brock Long, administrator of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said the damage to Paradise was ""one of the worst disasters"" he had ever seen. Military troops are assisting forensics teams and cadaver dogs as they continue to search for human remains. Officials have warned the search operation could take weeks. Why are the fires burning? Officials have not yet confirmed what started any of the blazes, as investigations are continuing. Several people have already filed a lawsuit against a local power company, alleging that the Camp Fire started when a high-voltage transmission line failed. Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn - but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. Low humidity, warm winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. What about climate change? Prof David Peterson of the University of Washington, a former senior researcher with the US Forest Service, told the BBC there is no hard evidence that climate change has affected US wildfires - yet. ""We expect that there will be significant effects in future decades as the climate continues to warm,"" he said. A warming climate, Prof Peterson explained, would increase the duration of the fire season, and more droughts would in turn create more wildfire fuel. Globally, the length of the wildfire season has already increased by nearly 19% between 1978 and 2013. ""By around 2050, fires may burn two to three times more area than they have historically."" As fire seasons worsen worldwide, all the carbon released as smoke into the atmosphere could have a serious impact on climate change, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

"Anna Merlan on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","This month, California has been gripped by three devastating wildfires: Northern Californias Camp Fire, which recently became the deadliest in the states history, and, in Southern California, the Woolsey and Hill Fires. An emerging, deeply weird conspiracy theory holds that those fires arent caused by wind patterns, brutally dry conditions, the worsening effects of climate change, or possible downed power lines, but by a sinister scheme directed by nefarious elements within the government. The claim, being taken up by an increasing number of people in QAnon circles, is that the fires are caused by directed energy weaponsthat is, government-directed lasers bent on destroying homes, property, and lives. And if recent history is any judge, theres a chance the countrys biggest conspiracy-peddlers, up to and including the one who lives in the White House, will take up the cause. Directed energy weapons, or DEWs, have an interesting place in conspiratorial circles. DEWs are, to begin with, a real technology, but one still in its infancy: a report produced for Congress describes that term as an umbrella to refer to technologies that produce concentrated electromagnetic energy and atomic or subatomic particles. The consensus is that there are a number of logistical issues to work out before that the U.S. government will be able to build a laser system that would actually be workable on a battlefield, but that the Department of Defense and private contractors are eager to leverage laser power towards killing people and/or destroying enemy missiles, aircrafts, or satellites. If you ask people in the deep end of the conspiracy theory pool, though, DEWs are here already. Theres a small body of people who believe themselves to be targeted individualsstalked, harassed, and attacked by the government or other shadowy groupsand at least some of them believe those attacks are being carried out by DEWs. Now, through a strange confluence of forces, the paranoia over DEWs is making its way into the discussion about natural disasters. What were seeing is a convergence of longstanding American fears about government mind control and manipulation of the weather merging with climate change skepticism, as climate science becomes ever-more-politicized. Like many conspiracy theories, its not entirely possible to trace where the DEW theories came from. As best I can tell, one of the earliest promoters of that claim was a flat-earth YouTuber going by the name ODD Reality (real name Matt Procella), who started talking about DEWs during the devastating wildfires that raged across California in October 2017. Youll notice here that stores and restaurants are wiped out, while other things are still in perfect shape, Procella intones, over still images of fire damage, some of them sourced, he says, from a Serbian conspiracy site (and some of which appear to be computer-generated). Other buildings are fine, trees are untouched, but specific structures are just devastated. You gotta ask yourself, whats up with that... Is this the result of direct energy weapons? Ranged weapons that inflict damage on a target by emitting highly-focused energy? The answer is most likely yes. Theres actually a fair amount of research to explain why some structures are destroyed and some are spared during a wildfire that has nothing to do with laser weapons. But the broader point Procella is trying to make is about intent: Someone is deliberately destroying certain buildings. That point, though, gets a little mushy. He speculates that all these things are a distraction from the Vegas incident, by which he means the mass shooting in Las Vegas that month that killed 58 people. Elsewhere, the question of why the government would spend its time pointing lasers at peoples houses and Burger Kings has been made somewhat clearer. The left-leaning March Against Monsanto site, which often engages in conspiracy theorizing about GMOs, ran a speculative article about DEW s, reasoning that they could be just another form of government manipulation. People who believe in chemtrails are also concerned about DEWs, and have a more fully fleshed-out explanation for what theyre meant to do. (Chemtrails are harmless condensation trails left by aircrafts, but since the late 1990s, a conspiratorial community has been raising concerns that theyre actually toxic, potentially mind-controlling chemicals.) On one chemtrail-oriented site, Chemtrail Planet, an unnamed author speculates that last years fires were part of a joint plan by FEMA and the United Nations to institute more centralized global control, what they called Agenda 30. The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is actually a resolution passed in 2015 by the General Assembly, promising to do a host of things to make the world better by 2030, including taking urgent action on climate change. Like every UN action, conspiracy theorists claim its mean to institute a centralized one-world government, and like always, that is not true. Theres also evidence that DEWs are becoming part of the cosmology of the QAnon crowd, a remarkably pliant group who have proven that theyre able to incorporate just about anything into their belief system. (QAnon, for the uninitiated, is the conspiracy theory that Donald Trump is secretly doing a really good job, and is this close to uncovering and disarming various evil forces working against him within the government.) The hashtag #DEW has begun to show up in QAnon-oriented Twitter conversations, with several much-retweeted Tweets imploring Trump to take action. Yet another version of the DEWs story claims that the wildfires were directed in such a way to destroy structures in order to make way for a high-speed rail system, part of a Democrat plot. Thats right: the government is destroying vast swaths of trees, houses and infrastructure to force people to ride the train. That tweeted idea is also tagged with several QAnon-related hashtags. Inevitably, the conspiracy theory is migrating to bigger and bigger accounts. On Thursday, a far-right internet personality and QAnon booster named Mike Tokes, who has 170,000 Twitter followers, aggressively took up the cause, using the same line of argument: some homes burned, others didnt, thus lasers must be at work. The DEW theory is inextricably tied to skepticism about the very idea of climate change, a sense that global warming is just the cover explanation for the various sinister plots at work against us. Its also, of course, tied to longstanding conspiracy theories about the government controlling the weather, such as the idea that the government already has a weather control tool called HAARP, which it also uses for electromagnetic warfare. (HAARP is actually a much less exciting research program that studies the uppermost levels of our atmosphere and was years run by the Air Force and University of Alaska Fairbanks. Since 2015, UAF has run it alone, albeit on Air Force land, and has produced a very patient FAQ explaining that HAARP does not exert mind control over people.) Weather and climate conspiracists are, though, not a big group of people, says John Cook, a research assistant professor at the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University who also runs a site called Skeptical Science that outlines the shoddy science and arguments behind global warming skepticism. Climate change conspiracy theories may seem more popular but theyre still very marginal, Cook told Earther. The proportion of the US public who are dismissive about climate change is about nine percent. You dont want to overstate their importance because that can have a negative effect. That said, there may well be a broader swath of the public that is open to conspiracy theories and denialism, if not hardcore about them. For instance, a survey on chemtrails from last year that found up to 30 percent of people polled thought they may be somewhat real. And recent polls show most U.S. Republicans still believe global warming concerns are exaggerated, and that the partisan divide on the issue is growing. Climate change skepticism and other, more out-there forms of conspiracy theorizing about the weather have a few things in common, Cook said. There is a similarity in that its trying to make sense of disturbing events by imaging these patterns. But theres also an important distinction. Climate conspiracy theories tend to be an attempt to explain why theres a scientific consensus on climate change, usually by invoking a vast conspiracy among the worlds climate scientists. Whereas space laser wildfires arekind of Cook paused for a moment, politely. Theyre an isolated single event thing, he finished. As opposed to a more systematic, holistic explanation of the whole climate. Social media, particularly Twitter, has inarguably helped the spread of conspiracy theories about the climate, Cook said. He and his colleagues have studied how to inoculate people against misinformation (and even made a handy video about it), but he admits its an uphill battle. Its difficult, he said. Conspiracy theories are the hardest thing to counter. Theyre so nihilistic, and any attempt to rebut them is seen as more evidence of the conspiracy theory. But the general rule is the way to counter the myth is to replace it with a stickier fact. One issue, Cook said, is that conspiracy theories can cause people to shut down and stop looking for whats true: Theres a danger that theyll disengage and just stop believing in facts. And the facts are plenty terrifying on their own: These fires have already been hellaciously destructive, the deadliest in a century or more, with at least 63 people dead in the Camp Fire alone, three more killed in the Woolsey fire, more than 600 missing, thousands of acres burned, homes destroyed and lives devastated. The president is already engaged in smears and misinformation, bizarrely claiming that forest management was to blame for fires that didnt even originate in forests. Though the causes of the fires are still under investigation, theres evidence that a downed PG&amp;E power line could have potentially sparked the Camp Fire. Theres evidence that public policy and regulation simply arent working, given that PG&amp;E electrical equipment was found responsible for 17 of 21 wildfires in Northern California last fall, and that climate change is only making the situation worse. And theres deep inequality at work, given that working-class communities like Paradise are all but destroyed, while wealthier areas are able to hire their own firefighters to battle the blazes.

There are dozens of reasons a signature mismatch may occur, the judge explained. And indeed, one study found that younger voters were more likely to have their mail-in ballots rejected partly because they didnt use handwriting enough to develop a steady signature.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption The wildfires have devastated parts of southern California Much of California's avocado crop has been destroyed by wildfires that have ripped through the southern part of the state, industry experts say. ""We've lost at least several hundred acres of avocados, probably more,"" the California Avocado Commission told agriculture news site AgNet West. About 90% of US avocados are grown in California, and the industry is worth millions to the economy. About 5,700 firefighters have been battling the fires, officials say. One death has been confirmed - that of a 70-year-old woman found in her car on Wednesday. Three firefighters have been injured and about 500 buildings destroyed. There are now fears the fires will have serious implications for California's vast agricultural industry. Last season's avocado harvest produced a crop worth more than $400m (£300m), according to the California Avocado Commission. Much of this was grown on family-owned farms in the south of the state. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Avocado trees grow near Valley Center in southern California Ventura County, which is California's largest growing region for avocados, has seen the worst of the fires with 180 square miles (466 sq km) consumed, according to officials. John Krist, chief executive of the Ventura County Farm Bureau, told Reuters news agency: ""A lot of that fruit everybody was looking forward to harvesting next year is lying on the ground."" Food safety regulations mean the crop cannot be sold once it falls from the tree. Media caption In California, entire neighbourhoods are fleeing The fires mean the upcoming harvest, which usually takes place in February or March, is likely to be smaller than usual. However experts say it too soon to assess the full extent of the damage. Elsewhere, US President Donald Trump has declared a state of emergency, which will free up funding to ""help alleviate the hardship and suffering that the emergency may inflict on the local population"". Nearly 200,000 residents have been evacuated from their homes as firefighters battle the wildfires on several fronts. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in San Diego on Thursday after a new blaze spread from 10 acres to 4,100 acres in just a few hours.

On Wednesday afternoon, 44 fires were burning from Lapland in the far north to the southern island of Gotland. Hot weather and persistent drought are the main causes, and the national weather service has issued fire warnings for almost the entire country. Italy and Norway have both despatched firefighting aircraft to help. Sweden said Italy had sent 13 people in two Canadair CL-415 ""waterbombers"", each of which can carry 6,000 litres of water at a time. Norway's national broadcaster NRK, meanwhile, reported that 10 helicopters had been despatched to aid its neighbour - six on Tuesday and another four on Wednesday- despite the risk of similar fire outbreaks in Norway itself. The wildfires have raged in parts for days and without a break in the hot dry weather they have shown little sign of stopping. Many people have been evacuated from their homes in Sweden, while others have been told to shut off all ventilation to keep smoke outside. Fire chief Britta Ramberg told Swedish media the fire in Jämtland was ""the largest and spreading the fastest"". Official advisories said that this blaze grew from 1,600 hectares to 3,000 on Tuesday alone, and that firefighters had been unable to contain it.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Los Angeles PD Image caption Burned out areas from wildfires are more susceptible to flooding and mudflow At least two people are dead amid mudslides in Southern California, where heavy rains triggered flooding and massive run-off, US media report. ""Waist-deep"" mudslides in areas scorched by wildfires last month shut down more than 30 miles (48km) of the main coastal highway, officials say. Emergency crews are working to rescue multiple people trapped in vehicles and homes, a Santa Barbara official said. At least eight people were injured and thousands have fled ahead of the rain. Heavy rain run-off caused waist-deep mudflow in the Montecito, where some homes were knocked from their foundations, Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason told the Los Angeles Times newspaper. Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kelly Huber told the newspaper two people were found dead on Tuesday in Montecito and may have been killed as result of the storm. Wildfires in December, including the Thomas Fire, swept through the area burning vegetation that helps prevent flooding and landslides. Thousands of California residents were asked to evacuate on Monday for the second time in two months. Homeowners in the area shared photos of mud in their homes. Several roads are closed due to mudslides and debris, including the major thoroughfare Highway 101. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption and leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. ""Recent burn areas will be especially vulnerable where dangerous mud and debris flows are possible,"" said the National Weather Service in a statement. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shared a warning for California homeowners explaining that homes that had never flooded before were now at risk. About 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders on Monday. This comes after a record-setting year of $306 billion (£226 billion) of weather and climate-related disaster costs in the United States, the third warmest year on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The storm over California is expected to produce 4 inches to 7 inches (10 to 18 cm) in the foothills and 9 inches (23 cm) in select areas.

Photo The former King Edward VIII, then the Duke of Windsor, and Wallis Simpson on their wedding day in France in June 1937. Credit Associated Press The British news media largely blacked out coverage of Edward’s yearslong affair with the American socialite Wallis Simpson, who by that time was divorcing her second husband. Pages were reportedly even torn from foreign magazines, which were writing freely about the couple. The average Briton was unprepared for the looming constitutional crisis when the affair was publicly revealed and Parliament refused to allow the marriage. As The Times wrote, “Public in London Is Bewildered.” In a changed world, the royal family has struggled against the intrusive media attention, particularly in the marriage and divorce of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and in Diana’s death. But Harry and his brother, William, have tried to establish a respectful relationship with the news media ( despite the occasional warning ). Ultimately, the news of Harry and Ms. Markle’s engagement received a far warmer reception than that of Edward, the brother of Harry’s great-grandfather.

Andrew Freedman,"Barely two months after wildfires swept across California wine country, a strong Santa Ana wind event propelled fast-moving flames across Ventura County, California on Monday night, killing at least one and destroying more than 100 homes. The blaze, known as the Thomas Fire, expanded from nothing to 31,000 acres in just a few hours thanks to fierce Santa Ana winds. The strong winds also caused power outages, plunging thousands of residents of Santa Barbara and Ventura into the dark as flames rushed in. SEE ALSO: 'We're just existing': What it was like to survive the deadly Northern California wildfires The fire has come close to downtown Ventura, a city of more than 100,000 people about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Social media images taken by evacuating residents show nightmarish scenes of onrushing flames. According to the Ventura County Fire Department, 27,000 people have evacuated. One of the structures that succumbed to the fast-moving flames was a large apartment complex. Santa Ana winds blow offshore, from east to west, tapping into warm and dry conditions inland. Close to the coast, these winds compress the air coming off the hills and mountains to the east, further warming and drying out the air mass, and helping to dry out already combustible vegetation. The fire threat had been anticipated, as the National Weather Service issued a rare ""critical"" fire outlook for Southern California on Tuesday due to the Santa Ana wind event. High wind warnings and red flag warnings were in effect for much of Southern California. The Thomas Fire was visible from space, via the Suomi-NPP satellite as well as other observing platforms. Heat signature from the Thomas Fire depicted from the Suomi-NPP satellite on Dec. 5, 2017. Image: NOAA. Typically, the fire season in Southern California peaks in October, but it can occasionally flare up again in November and December. In this case, a strong area of high pressure has built in across the West, and the clockwise air circulation around that high pressure is responsible for triggering the Santa Ana wind event. The Storm Prediction Center, which is part of the National Weather Service, issued a forecast discussion on Tuesday morning warning that fire weather conditions will further deteriorate during the day, as winds increase, humidity drops, and temperatures climb. The Weather Service has designated parts of Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernadino, and Riverside counties as being in ""extremely critical"" fire weather risk, which is the highest category. These areas could see sustained winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour, the Storm Prediction Center said, with gusts up to 80 miles per hour in hills and mountains. Relative humidity levels could drop to as low as 4 percent in these areas, the center stated. The immediate Los Angeles metropolitan area is included in the slightly less serious zone of ""critical"" fire danger. The October wildfires that killed more than 40 people and destroyed more than 10,000 structures in northern California also occurred during a period when strong, dry offshore winds were present. Such winds can allow a fire to spread quickly and erratically, including by spreading burning embers far out in front of the main blaze. This hampers firefighting efforts and can force hasty evacuations.","Barely two months after wildfires swept across California wine country, a strong Santa Ana wind event propelled fast-moving flames across Ventura County, California on Monday night, killing at least one and destroying more than 100 homes.

"THOMAS FULLER, KIRK JOHNSON and CONOR DOUGHERTY","One possible solution, she said, would be for FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to provide trailers that people could live in while their homes were being rebuilt.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Local officials have hit back at President Trump's claims that firefighters don't have enough water Twin wildfires in California, known as the Mendocino Complex Fire, have grown to become the largest active wildfire in state history, officials said on Monday. The fires have spread rapidly in recent days to burn 283,800 acres of land - an area almost the size of Los Angeles. Firefighters are tackling 16 major blazes across the state amid hot weather, strong winds and low humidity. At least seven people have been killed in the Carr fire in the state's north. Meanwhile US President Donald Trump has reiterated social media comments that the fires' spread is being ""made so much worse"" by California's environmental laws. Local officials and experts have criticised and dismissed his tweets. Where are the fires burning? More than 14,000 firefighters and hundreds of US army personnel are trying to contain the more than a dozen major fires burning throughout the state. National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley has warned conditions are not going to immediately improve - with temperatures as high as 43C (110F) being forecast for some areas. Media caption Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years Officials say the Mendocino Complex Fire, which is made up of two nearby fires being treated as the same incident, has surpassed last year's Thomas Fire to become the largest in state history. Scott McLean, a deputy chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) described the wildfires as ""extremely fast, extremely aggressive, extremely dangerous,"" ""Look how big it got, just in a matter of days... Look how fast this Mendocino Complex went up in ranking. That doesn't happen. That just doesn't happen,"" he said on Monday. It is only 30% contained so far, with authorities warning it could take another week to get the blaze under control. Experts say 2018 has the worst start to the fire season in 10 years - partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation. In December, Governor Jerry Brown said devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change had become ""the new normal"". What is the row with Mr Trump? The US president has criticised Governor Jerry Brown and California's environmental laws on social media in recent days.

Paul Hockenos,"Paul Hockenos is the author of ""Berlin Calling: A Story of Anarchy, Music, the Wall and the Birth of the New Berlin."" The opinions in this article belong solely to the author. (CNN) This summer's sizzling temperatures, savage droughts, raging wildfires, floods and acute water shortages -- from Japan to the Arctic Circle, California to Greece -- are surely evidence beyond any reasonable doubt that the climate crisis is upon us now. This is the new normal -- until it gets worse. We, the entire global community, the residents of this planet, must finally grasp the urgency at hand and undertake dramatic, meaningful measures -- initiatives beyond the modest goals of 2015 Paris climate accord -- to stave off nothing less than the destruction of civilization as we know it. This may sound hyperbolic, but it's mainstream opinion among serious scientists worldwide: Climate change, unchecked, will eventually wipe out our race -- and man-made greenhouse gas emissions are still rising. An open letter signed by 15,000 international scientists last year read in part: ""Soon it will be too late to shift course away from our failing trajectory, and time is running out. We must recognize, in our day-to-day lives and in our governing institutions, that Earth with all its life is our only home,"" the letter warns. ""Since 1992, carbon emissions have increased 62 percent,"" said William Ripple of Oregon State University's College of Forestry, who initiated the letter. ""And the global average temperature change has paralleled that. Also since 1992, we have two billion more people on Earth, which is a 35 percent increase."" In his epic tome ""Collapse,"" the American physicist Jared Diamond attributes the decline and extinction of several historical civilizations, among them the Maya and the Inca, to climate change, overpopulation and incompetent resource management. The book's telling subtitle is ""How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed."" It was resolute stubbornness and bad management that killed off the great Latin American peoples, Diamond argued. Today, though, an entire world civilization, not just a regional people, has neglected and defiled the very resource base from which it sustains itself. We've got to move past the false, stubborn debate about whether global warming is happening or not. Obviously it is, plentiful research has underscored this for years, and with the natural disasters everywhere we're feeling it now. Those who still don't get it may have stuck their heads in the sand -- or perhaps they're lying to themselves. But either way we can't lose more time trying to convince them. And those who are slowly coming around -- including US Republicans, notorious former skeptics -- have to catch up on the learning curve very quickly. Resignation or fatalism -- that it's a tragedy, the destruction of life as we know it, but alas we can't affect it -- is as self-defeating as denial, and lazy too. I've seen one too many dystopian, post-apocalyptic thrillers recently based on worst-case, extreme-weather scenarios, but too few about saving mankind from these fates. In the 1980s, the international community's response to the ozone's thinning and the scourge of acid rain illustrate what mankind can do when it puts its mind to changing human and above all industrial behavior. In the form of the 1987 Montreal Protocol and 1985 Helsinki Protocol respectively, treaties were put in place that halted the destructive menace of the pollutants responsible for those blights. They're success stories. Admittedly, these afflictions were more contained than the entire planet's warming, but they show that human beings can at least constrain the folly that they've set in motion. So the battle against climate change is in our hands. Despite the meager political action to date, we're not starting at square one. Our scientists, in a feat of global cooperation orchestrated through the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), have enabled us to understand climate change as the consequence of two centuries' intensive burning of petroleum-based fuel, and what it portends -- namely a future in which human beings and other inhabitants of the planet will find it increasingly difficult, and eventually impossible, to live as we have. Another product of science is the technology that can replace fossil fuels. It's already there, and in use in small quantities almost everywhere in the world. The clean tech that we have today -- solar power, wind energy, battery-propelled transportation, smart grids, and more -- is enough for us to go completely green in the near future. Advances are made and costs come down on this technology every six months, but we don't have to wait. Germany, for example, turned 40% of its electricity renewable in just 15 years. Today that could happen twice as fast. A number of diverse, evidence-based studies show that a global transition to 100% renewable electricity, or close to that, isn't utopian dreaming at all but feasible, and in the near future. A massive roll out of renewables, not including nuclear energy, could cover the globe's energy needs by 2050, even with the world's population growing. All investment in fossil fuel production would have to be switched to renewables. One recent study, the product of a Finnish university and German think tank, envisions a global renewable energy mix comprising 69% solar power, 18% wind energy, 8% hydropower, and 2% bioenergy. A full decarbonization of the electricity system by 2050 is possible based on available technology, according to Christian Breyer, a renewable energy expert and lead author of the study. ""Energy transition is no longer a question of technical feasibility or economic viability, but of political will,"" says Breyer -- and he's not alone in asserting this. A 2017 study from Stanford University came to similar conclusions. But just as global warming today is something we can feel, so too can we see renewable energy at work. In Europe, Germany is the most commonly cited example because it is home to one of the world's most advanced industrial economies, which has prospered with the renewables surge. Yet Norway and Iceland already run almost completely on renewable energy, namely hydroelectric and geothermal power respectively. Denmark plans to convert fully to renewable energy by 2050 by scaling back on energy use and exploiting wind power to meet demand. By 2020, extensive reductions in energy consumption will make it possible for wind power to cover half of the country's electricity consumption. Danish power plants relying on coal will be phased out by 2030. And by 2035, all electricity and heating will be generated using renewable sources. As individuals, of course we can curb our consumption and make our lifestyles as sustainable as possible. But as citizens we have to mobilize too and force our elected leaders (and unelected leaders in China and elsewhere) to tackle the industrial giants whose fortunes are tied up in petrochemical generation. Until this summer, many in the developed world probably assumed that global warming would only affect the undeveloped and the far-away. But global warming has hit home for all of us in 2018. If empathy for others or future generations can't inspire concern, then let pure self-interest dictate action. Whatever the motive, the time for half measures is past.","This summer's sizzling temperatures, savage droughts, raging wildfires, floods and acute water shortages -- from Japan to the Arctic Circle, California to Greece -- are surely evidence beyond any reasonable doubt that the climate crisis is upon us now.",2018-07-31T14:34:31Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","Clearly, the climate crisis is upon us",https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/31/opinions/climate-crisis-is-upon-us-opinion-intl/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170710065324-california-firefighters-us-flag-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,wildfires,0

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Imagine a future where the United States is experiencing multiple Katrina or Sandy-like storms at the same time—all while wildfires rage in the West. Right now, the Department of Defense is in no way ready to handle that, said Francesco Femia, the co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security, a nonpartisan think tank made up of military and security experts. “Though we’re capable of managing a lot of natural disasters, a future with runaway climate change is one that’s going to become very difficult to manage even here at home,” Femia told Earther. Luckily, the Department of Defense is one of the few federal agencies that still treats climate change as a threat under President Donald Trump. On Monday, the president signed a $716 billion defense bill that Congress passed earlier this summer. It includes plans to prepare current and future military bases and military facilities for “environmental condition projections,” such as sea level rise and increased flooding. There’s also an entire section devoted to the rapidly-melting Arctic, which Russia and China are eyeing to take over. “The Department of Defense is witnessing and really on the frontlines of a lot of these changes,” Femia said. “They’ve got military bases across the world, including at sea level. They’re seeing the effects of flooding. They’re seeing the effects of wildfires and what that does to their own capabilities and priorities.” Apparently, ramping up global military efforts is one way to get the president to support climate legislation. “This bill just starts to scratch the surface of what kind of capabilities the military will need as the Arctic melts.” Sure, this bill doesn’t explicitly call out climate change by name once, but that doesn’t diminish its value. The bill lays out plans to adapt military infrastructure around the world to our changing environment and climate. That’s in line with last year’s defense spending bill, for which former President Barack Obama had laid the groundwork. The new bill requires Secretary of Defense James Mattis to prepare a report on a new Arctic strategy by June 1, 2019. This means taking a look at the sea vessels the U.S. has for this region—like icebreakers, of which the U.S. has just two ( Russia has 40 ). The bill requires that the U.S. keep at least six icebreakers starting in fiscal year 2029. Another important piece, said Femia, is the bill’s attention to training for future operations in the Arctic. “There’s an expectation of there needing to be greater capacities for search and rescues in the Arctic as we get more commercial activity and more activity, in general, in the Arctic, and we’re not really prepared to handle that level of activity,” Femia said. “This bill just starts to scratch the surface of what kind of capabilities the military will need as the Arctic melts.” This bill comes after months of back and forth between members of Congress and the Department of Defense on the importance of highlighting climate change’s roles in reports and assessments the department puts out. More than 40 House representatives in both parties sent Mattis a letter in July expressing concern that an assessment had not mentioned climate change outright. That followed a January letter from over 100 lawmakers concerning Trump’s National Security Strategy, which also failed to mention climate change. The security of military bases abroad and here in the U.S. are at risk as sea levels begin to rise and flooding becomes more imminent. The Union of Concerned Scientists published a report in 2016 that found bases along the East and Gulf Coast—where many military members live with their families—could see flooding 100 times a year by midcentury if sea level rises even moderately. Members of Congress are not scared to discuss their concerns around climate change and national security. Neither is the Department of Defense. As for the president? He’s got a long way to go.","Imagine a future where the United States is experiencing multiple Katrina or Sandy-like storms at the same time—all while wildfires rage in the West.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Wildfires cause devastation in Greece The search for survivors is continuing in Greece, where at least 74 people have died in wildfires near the capital Athens. High winds spread the fire, trapping many in homes and vehicles and forcing others into the sea as they tried to escape the flames. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has declared three days of mourning. On Tuesday, the bodies of 26 adults and children who apparently died embracing each other were found on a cliff top. ""They had tried to find an escape route but unfortunately these people and their kids didn't make it in time. Instinctively, seeing the end nearing, they embraced, "" Nikos Economopoulos, head of Greece's Red Cross, said. On Monday night, hundreds of firefighters battled the flames, which were fanned by winds of up to 100km/h (60mph). Coastal patrol boats and private vessels picked up hundreds of those who managed to reach harbours or beaches. Rescuers are now searching houses, cars and the coastline for survivors and victims of the fires, amid fears the death toll will rise. Image copyright EPA Image caption Rescuers continue their search of the area Relatives of those reported missing have been posting photographs on a website in the hope of tracing their whereabouts. Prime Minister Tsipras has declared a state of emergency in Attica, saying all emergency services have been mobilised. Italy, Germany, Poland and France have all sent help in the form of planes, vehicles and firefighters, while Spain and Cyprus have also offered assistance. 'Biblical catastrophe' The seaside resort of Mati, in Attica, is popular with local tourists, especially pensioners and children attending holiday camps. Survivor Kostas Laganos said: ""It burned our backs and we dived into the water... I said: 'My God, we must run to save ourselves.'"" George Vokas, whose family also escaped by sea, told BBC News that two women he had tried to help had died. ""We're talking about a biblical catastrophe in this wonderful area of Mati,"" he said. Charred bodies lay just 15m (50ft) from the sea, photographer Pantelis Saitas told the Athens-Macedonian News Agency. At least 150 people were injured in the area. What caused the fires? Fires are a recurring problem during the hot, dry summer months in Attica. Officials have suggested the current blazes may have been started by arsonists looking to loot abandoned homes. ""Fifteen fires had started simultaneously on three different fronts in Athens,"" said government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos. Greece, he added, had requested drones from the US to ""detect any suspicious activity"".

TIM ARANGO,"The Camp Fire, which tore through Paradise and its surroundings last week, has become the deadliest wildfire in modern California history, with at least 48 people confirmed dead so far. Another three people were killed in the Woolsey Fire, which raced through the mountains of Southern California near Malibu. With so many still unaccounted for and investigators scouring the ruins of Paradise and collecting DNA samples from relatives of the missing, the identities of many more victims are expected to emerge in the coming days and weeks. On Tuesday night, the Butte County sheriff, Kory Honea, said the number of missing was in the hundreds. The department has released a list with 103 names on it, which in no way is a list of everybody, said a spokesman for the department, Megan McCann. Among those unaccounted for, although not on the list, is Mr. Burt, Ms. Loos stepbrother. I dont have confirmation, she said.

JILLIAN RAYFIELD,"Why it matters: The surprise decision threatens to derail Mrs. Mays exit plan, which cabinet ministers had reluctantly approved on Wednesday. If the discontent spreads, her leadership position could be in danger. Investigators are trying to piece together the origins of the deadly Camp Fire, which has killed at least 56 people. Experts usually begin looking for the source of such blazes with the premise that humans are responsible, but their efforts will be severely hampered in a town like Paradise, which has been mostly destroyed. As the current fires rage, officials have determined that the Pacific Gas and Electric Company was responsible for at least 17 of 21 major fires in Northern California last fall. The utility, one of the states biggest, revealed that it could face crippling liability bills, potentially leaving customers on the hook for billions. A continuing search: Local officials released a list of those they cant find. The victims: Ernie Foss, a musician from San Francisco, was among those confirmed dead. As Florida recounts votes county by county, one major issue of contention is unclear signatures on ballots, particularly those that were mailed in. Thousands were rejected because the signature on the ballot did not exactly match whats on file. Democrats have argued that the rejections are disenfranchisement, and lawsuits have followed. Young peoples ballots are the ones most often thrown out, with some speculating that they dont use their own handwriting enough to develop a consistent signature.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Jessica Wentz escaped the concrete confines of New York for her childhood home of Santa Rosa, California last year. At the time, the decision seemed like a no brainer, leaving behind a landscape dominated by humans for one where homes mingled with the forest and rolling chaparral hills of Northern California. But the dream of moving home turned into a nightmare on an early October night. Whipped by gusty winds and tinderbox conditions, the Tubbs Fire roared into town, melting cars, consuming homes, and leaving nearly two dozen dead en route to becoming California’s most destructive fire in history. By the time the flames were contained on Halloween, the fire had claimed 5,636 structures, including Wentz’s parent’s home where she had grown up. “I’m definitely reconsidering my whole perspective of where I want to live and how I want to live and how I want to raise a family,” Wentz, a staff attorney at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, told Earther. “It’s hard to explain that, to feel like I can’t return to that place.” Millions of Americans may soon be forced to confront similar feelings. California has been at the epicenter of a fiery crisis over the past year as everything from iconic locales like Wine Country to interstate towns like Redding burn. More generally, across the West towns small and large have been decimated by wildfires in recent years thanks to rising temperatures, more human-sparked fires, and more humans living in harms way. It raises an uncomfortable question that coastal residents, policymakers, and insurance underwriters have been forced to grapple with in recent years: Is it worth it to build (or rebuild) in a landscape primed for explosive fires? The answer—for now—is yes, but that calculus could change as rising temperatures and more frequent droughts conspire to make the forest a riskier place to live. And it’s an open question of who will foot the bill as that risk increases—and what happens when the risk becomes too high. “Increasing wildfire risk is a top concern of many insurers,” Chris Folkman, a senior director at catastrophe modeling firm RMS, told Earther. 2017 was the costliest wildfire season in American history. The National Centers for Environmental Information estimates that were $18.4 billion in wildfire-related damages, including three separate California fires that topped $1 billion. The losses were an eye opener for insurers. Folkman said the previous standard for issuing policies in fire prone areas relied on surcharges in high risk areas based on what insurers viewed as “frequent but manageable outbreaks of claims.” “As we’ve learned from recent events, this approach will no longer cut it,” he said. Indeed, this year has seen fire-lated damages continue to mount, with the Carr Fire currently sitting as the sixth-most destructive fire in California history and the Ranch Fire taking the claim as the largest. Across the West, more than 5.9 million acres have burned for the year-to-date, upwards of a million acres more than than the 10-year average. Rising temperatures are in part responsible for more dramatic wildfire. But humans are making fires worse in other ways as well. The vast majority of fires are started by us, and decades of fire suppression have increased fuel loads for incendiary fires. Perhaps most importantly, there’s more people living at the so-called wildland-urban interface or WUI, than ever before. A paper published earlier this year found that from 1990 to 2010, the WUI grew from 224,325 square miles to nearly 297,300 as 13.4 million new homes were built there. “This area is larger than the state of Wisconsin, and made the WUI the fastest-growing land use type in the conterminous United States,” Miranda Mockrin, a research scientist with the U.S. Forest Service who co-authored the paper, told Earther. All of this means more property and people in harm’s way, upping the risk of catastrophic fires. There are a few ways that risk is currently being mitigated. The most obvious is firefighting to either tamp down fires or control them in ways that can help clear some of that heavy fuel load. But fighting fires is a costly endeavor. Last year, the federal government spent $2 billion fighting wildfires with state agencies chipping in billions more to combat blazes. “A lot of that money is spent on protecting homes,” Judd Boomhower, an economist at the University of California, San Diego studying fires, told Earther. That creates what economists call a moral hazard, essentially encouraging risky behavior. In the case of wildfires, firefighting incentivizes people to either move to fire-prone areas or rebuild after disaster strikes. This means insurance rates don’t reflect the true risks. What’s more, a number of states have something called the FAIR Plan, which offers individuals insurance in areas deemed too disaster prone by private insurers. That includes a number of fire prone states, such as California, New Mexico, and Oregon. Those policies often have high premiums and are only viewed as a last resort. But California law also prohibits insurers from cancelling a homeowner’s policy while they’re rebuilding after a fire or other natural disaster. Moreover, companies have to renew a policy at least once after that, making rebuilding a much more attractive option. “I think we’re on a threshold.” Boomhower said (while stressing he was not advocating for it) that the most market-based solution would be to charge communities a fee for firefighting services. While private wildland firefighting might be a libertarian wet dream, it’s definitely not politically palatable. It’s also unfeasible to let insurers cancel policies in the wake of wildfire damage, since kicking people while they’re down is a surefire way to lose an election. But taking the two most obvious fixes off the table doesn’t mean the problem is totally intractable in the short-term. In her work looking at the wildland-urban interface, Mockrin found some communities were already adapting to our hotter, more flammable present in the wake of fires. Their solutions ran the gauntlet from voluntary programs and education about risks to more stringent building codes. But nearly all the solutions have focused on new builds, leaving older homes facing higher risks. “It’s very rare to see regulations that require retrofitting,” she said. “The only thing I’ve seen for that is if your roof needs to be replaced, it has to be fire resistant.” Folkman said RMS is working on a new wildfire model that will help capture some of the risk in more actionable terms. The idea is that quantifying the biggest risks—say rising temperatures, drier fuels, or housing density—will allow state agencies or even local communities can take more preventative actions that keep houses safer. It could also help insurers set rates that are more in line with the risks while also rewarding good behaviors. That’s something already happening in some places. In Colorado, for example, a number of insurers require some fire mitigation for homeowners to get a policy. Beyond these fixes, there’s even bigger picture stuff, like prescribed burns to reduce fuel loads, fixing the firefighting budget or, you know, reducing carbon emissions so the climate doesn’t get even hotter and more fire-prone. But eventually, the rising tide of risk and repeated losses could be too much, forcing individuals and communities to confront some hard truths. Wentz wasn’t ready to leave California so soon after moving back home. Instead, she settled on buying a place in what she described as “the center of town.” It’s a compromise much like managed retreat somewhat inland from the increasing rising ocean to a place where risk is lower but still present. “Over half the acreage in Lake County has burned over the past five years,” Wentz said. “You’re seeing fires come through multiple times. Once you have two fires in the area over a couple decades, that’s a sign to insurance companies. I think we’re on a threshold.” We could find out what’s on the other side sooner than later, and it’s unlikely to be pretty.","Jessica Wentz escaped the concrete confines of New York for her childhood home of Santa Rosa, California last year.

TIM ARANGO,"Every fire is investigated, and as wildfire seasons have grown worse, California has been more aggressive in holding people accountable — either with criminal charges for arson or negligence, as with Mr. Martinez, or, if there is a deep-pocketed culprit, with a lawsuit to recoup costs from fighting the fires. In the summer of 2013, a wildfire broke out in Riverside County and grew to threaten the desert resort town of Palm Springs. No one was killed, but it took thousands of firefighters, and almost $26 million, to put it out. Investigators found the blaze started with a faulty electrical box on a private property. Lawsuits in both state and federal court against the owner, a wealthy Saudi businessman, are still pending, although the state case may be resolved soon by mediation, according to the Idyllwild Town Crier, a newspaper in the area where the fire occurred. “Our civil cost recovery is definitely something we do on a regular basis,” Ms. Tolmachoff said. “Ninety-five percent of these fires are caused by humans and they could have been prevented somehow.” Last year the state saw what was then its biggest wildfire in recorded history — the Thomas Fire, in Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties — and its most destructive, the Tubbs Fire in Northern California’s wine country. The causes of both fires are still under investigation, but some lawsuits point the finger at the power companies Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison. And in several other Northern California fires last year, Cal Fire determined that faulty power lines were the cause. In the aftermath of those fires, California’s power companies have received close scrutiny from the State Legislature. “They talk about climate change,” said Steve Campora, a Sacramento lawyer who has made a career of suing utility companies on behalf of fire victims. “And climate change makes it more difficult to control the fire. But climate change does not cause ignition.” Edward Struzik, a fellow at the Queen’s Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy in Ontario and the author of “Firestorm: How Wildfire Will Shape Our Future,” said he believes fires will continue to get worse, year by year, through a combination of climate change and human activity. “There is no end in sight for this fire activity,” he said.

MIHIR ZAVERI,"The program has increasingly drawn scrutiny from criminal justice reform advocates, who have called it one of the most striking examples of undercompensated prison labor. It also illustrates how convictions can have lasting impacts on peoples lives, said Angela Hanks, the director of the Center for Postsecondary and Economic Success at the Center for Law and Social Policy, a Washington-based nonprofit group that promotes policies that help low-income Americans. Ms. Hanks said that incentives given to prisoners to join the fire camps, such as reduced sentences, might draw some who would otherwise not want to join the program. It is such a dangerous job, she said. At a minimum, people should be paid a fair wage. Once they are released from prison, inmates find it difficult to join the ranks of professional firefighters, said Katherine Katcher, the founder and executive director of Root and Rebound, a nonprofit group that helps people with criminal histories re-enter society. Some former inmates, like Ms. Mota, dont bother applying, Ms. Katcher said. Some fire departments also bar people with certain criminal backgrounds from becoming firefighters, she said. For example, the fire department in Bakersfield, a city of more than 380,000 people in Southern California, said it disqualified applicants who have been convicted of a felony. In the Los Angeles County Fire Department, felonies and some misdemeanors are grounds for disqualification, said Capt. Tony Imbrenda, a department spokesman. I can tell you that someone who has been incarcerated and part of an inmate hand crew has no chance of employment with this agency, he said. Various counties also have restrictions on who can get a license to be an emergency medical technician, which is required by many fire departments in California, Ms. Katcher said. State law directs local E.M.S. agencies to deny an E.M.T. certification if the person has been convicted of two or more felonies, or has been convicted of any theft-related misdemeanor in the preceding five years, among other possible factors.","About 1,500 inmates in California prisons are helping the state fight wildfires, including the Camp Fire, for several dollars a day.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"Hundreds of thousands of people had to evacuate their homes in Southern California over the span of a week due to wildfires sweeping the region. In response to the ongoing devastation, Apple announced on Monday that it is donating $1 million to aid in relief efforts. “Our thoughts are with all those affected by the fires in Southern California, including our colleagues, friends and their families,” the company said in a statement, posted in a tweet by KTLA reporter Rich DeMuro. “Apple is donating $1 million to aid in the rebuilding and recovery efforts of the communities that have been impacted.” We have reached out to Apple for comment on how it determined the amount of its donation and where, specifically, it is donating the money. Apple has donated to relief efforts in the past. It donated $1 million to Northern California wildfire relief efforts in October and also matched employee donations. And without question it’s a good thing to provide resources following natural disasters. But it’s also important to understand just how impactful these contributions are. Apple is worth hundreds of billions of dollars, and it’s on the brink of becoming a trillion-dollar company. One million dollars is generous, but the cost of wildfires is astoundingly more than that. Cal Fire has an emergency fund budget of $426 million, KCRA reported, but it cost the department approximately $70 million more than that to fight wildfires from July 1 through December 7. “This is the worst season I’ve had — the longest, most devastating, most loss of life, most loss of structures,” Michael Bradley, Northern California assistant region fire chief, told KCRA. “Rate of spread is extreme.” I’m not shitting on Apple for donating 1,000 iPhone X’s-worth of money to help wildfire relief efforts, but Apple is the largest public company in the world. It’s important to remember how much Apple’s worth, versus how much it donated, versus how much is really needed to help. This is good, albeit incremental, support. But it’s also great PR for the tech giant.

Daniella Cheslow,"Flames and smoke billow skyward as a wildfire burns near Durango, Colo. on June 7, 2018. The 416 Fire continued to burn more than 27,000 acres Wednesday morning, causing the closure of a nearby national forest. Provided by Inciweb via AP Wildfires continue to scorch swaths of Colorado early Thursday while new blazes have destroyed homes in Utah and burned through Wyoming, at a time when Western states are experiencing acute drought. The Colorado blaze, known as the 416 Fire, began on June 1 near the city of Durango, which is near the state's southern border with New Mexico. The National Wildfire Coordinating Group said more than 1,000 people have been dispatched and close to 2,000 homes have been evacuated. Some evacuees were allowed to return home Wednesday afternoon, but they remained under orders to prepare to possibly leave again. Photographer Hank Blum posted to social media a timelapse of the fire and smoke billowing near Durango earlier this week. The fire and high fire conditions from exceptional drought have caused the closure of the San Juan National Forest, which covers 1.8 million acres. About 300 miles to the northeast, in an area known for its ski resorts, a fire in Silverthorne near Denver spread across 91 acres. Helicopters battled it with water pulled in from Lake Dillon, according to Colorado Public Radio. As of Wednesday night, no structures or human lives had been lost, county officials said. While the exact cause of the fire is unknown, officials said ""Some type of human element is likely.""

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption The town of Paradise has been all but destroyed by the wildfires The death toll in wildfires sweeping California has risen to 31, with more than 200 people still unaccounted, officials have said. Six more people were confirmed killed in the Camp Fire in the north of the state, taking the toll there to 29. It is now equals the deadliest wildfire on record in California - the 1933 Griffith Park disaster in Los Angeles. In the south, the Woolsey Fire has claimed two lives as it threatens beach resorts including Malibu. An estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes to avoid three major blazes in the state. With strengthening winds threatening to spread the flames, state Governor Jerry Brown has urged President Donald Trump to declare a major disaster, a move that would harness more federal emergency funds. The appeal came a day after Mr Trump threatened to cut funding for California, blaming the fires on poor forest management. What is the latest on the Camp Fire? Emergency teams have been sifting through the remains of more than 6,700 homes and businesses burned down in the town of Paradise. The town and surrounding area bore the brunt of the inferno, which started in nearby forest on Thursday. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Residents of Paradise are in shock from the scale of the destruction Media caption Fleeing through flames: 'I'm so scared right now... so terrified' At a news conference late on Sunday, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said the bodies of five people had been found in their burned-out homes and a sixth was found inside a vehicle. He said that more than 200 people were still unaccounted for. The fire is the most destructive in the state's history and the joint deadliest. It has burned more than 109,000 acres (44,000 hectares) and is nearly 25% contained, fire officials said. What about the Woolsey Fire? The blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. By Sunday it had consumed 83,000 acres and destroyed at least 177 buildings, officials said. It is only 10% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is 75% contained. Some looting was reported in the southern fire area over the weekend and police said arrests had been made. Luxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among properties that have fallen victim to the flames. Firefighters used a respite from strong winds on Saturday to drop fire retardants to strengthen fire lines. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Fire retardant is dropped on to the Woolsey Fire near Malibu Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Woolsey Fire is only 10% contained Image copyright AFP Image caption Luxury beachfront homes in Malibu have been claimed by the fire But officials warned against complacency, with winds of up to 70mph (112km/h) expected over the coming days. They said fires could spread quickly and unexpectedly. ""Winds are already blowing. They are going to blow for the next three days. Your house can be rebuilt but you can't bring your life back,"" said Los Angeles County fire chief Daryl Osby. Meteorologist David Gomberg told the Los Angeles Times newspaper that fire tornadoes were possible. What do the politicians say? Governor Brown's request to President Trump was aimed at bolstering the emergency response to what he called the ""catastrophic"" nature of the wildfires. ""We're putting everything we've got into the fight against these fires and this request ensures communities on the front lines get additional federal aid,"" Mr Brown's letter said. Mr Trump's response to the fires has been criticised as unsympathetic and ill-informed. On Sunday, during a trip to France, he tweeted that: ""With proper Forest Management, we can stop the devastation constantly going on in California. Get Smart!"" He has previously blamed Californian officials for wildfires and threatened to withhold federal funding. In a tweet on Saturday, he accused state authorities of ""gross mismanagement"" of forests.

Firefighters say rains will aid efforts to contain the blaze but will also turn ash on the ground into a thick sludge. Workers combing through homes and cars will struggle in the mud, and scorched landscapes may see land and mudslides, state wildfire officials warn. Wildfires across the state have so far claimed a total of 80 lives. The so-called Camp Fire in northern California has destroyed the town of Paradise, about 190 miles (290km) north of San Francisco, and left nearly 1,000 people unaccounted for. The number of believed missing fell 283 late on Sunday, down from 1,276 people, they say, but gave no other details.

Nearly 400 people searched for victims amid the scorched debris in Paradise on Sunday, wading through ash that officials say could turn into a thick paste, the Associated Press reported. A breeze caused by Santa Anna winds may complicate fire-fighting efforts, forecasters warn. But the rain may tamp down some of the smoke in the air that has caused health officials to release warnings due to poor air quality. Media caption Drone footage shows complete devastation in the Californian town of Paradise 'Toxic wasteland' Melissa Schuster, a Paradise town council member, told ABC News on Monday that the ""entire community of Paradise is a toxic wasteland right now"". Over the weekend, crews with cadaver dogs swept homes, vehicles, bathtubs, and mattresses among the rubble. ""We have been told we're to look as hard as we can, but it's still possible we may not be able to find something left of someone,"" Trish Moutard, a volunteer with the California Rescue Dog Association, told Reuters. ""If the fire stayed long enough and burned hot enough, the bones could, at a minimum, be fragmented down to such a small amount that we couldn't see them, and it's possible that even the dogs might not be able to detect them."" Sheriff Kory Honea said it was within the ""realm of possibility"" that the full death toll in Paradise may never be known. He added that rescuers hope to complete their work before rains come mid-week, but may not be able to. ""As much as I wish that we could get through all of this before the rains come, I don't know if that's possible,"" the sheriff said.

Raymond Wong,"As California's deadly wildfires rage on, none other than billionaire SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk has come forth to offer help once again. Just after midnight (ET) on Saturday morning, Musk took to Twitter (where else?) to offer help from his electric vehicle company Tesla, which is based in the state. SEE ALSO: Elon Musk goes underground to show 'disturbingly long' LA tunnel ""If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know,"" he tweeted.

Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 10, 2018 He also reportedly sent out an email to Tesla employees giving them permission to assist in any way they could, and for them to ""not worry about payment"" according to the memo obtained by Electrek. ""If theres any way for Tesla to be helpful, please provide assistance and dont worry about payment,"" Musks email reportedly said. This wouldn't be the first time Musk has volunteered his or his companies' services to help a disaster. In 2017, on Musk's orders, Tesla shipped its Powerpack and Powerwall batteries to hospitals ravaged by Hurricane Maria. Then in the summer of 2018, Musk attempted to help with efforts to rescue the Thai soccer team that was trapped in a cave for 17 days. He controversially insisted on building a kid-sized "" submarine "" and sending it to Thailand to transport them through the treacherous tunnels. While Musk likely had good intentions, his offer ended up being more interference that would land him in hot water with British cave diver Vern Unsworth, who did help rescue the trapped team, and whom he repeatedly accused of being a pedophile. Bizarrely, after initially apologizing to Unsworth, Musk backpedaled and doubled down on the unsubstantiated claim after immaturely goading the cave diver into suing him, which is happening. The question facing Musk is has he really changed his tune? Can he and Tesla really provide actual aid without interfering with the authorities? Or is this yet another marketing ploy to shout out Tesla veiled as an offer of help? After the episode in Thailand over the summer, some think that Musk's seemingly always-buzzing noggin is just savvily taking advantage of another unfortunate situation.","As California's deadly wildfires rage on, none other than billionaire SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk has come forth to offer help once again.

Ryan Craig,"This week has been a good one for those who like to talk about the limits of technology. Over in the UK, a prankster managed to fool Trip Advisor into naming his shed the #1 ranked restaurant in London. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, a city struggling to manage several wind-fueled wildfires, the L.A.P.D. has asked drivers to refrain from using navigation apps because they’re steering drivers onto open routes that may, in fact, be on fire. In the world of higher education, technology has always had the potential to upend the academic enterprise. In the late 1990s, as I began working in higher education, the New York Times mused about the transformative potential of online education: “Just by doing what he does every day, a teacher potentially could grow rich instructing a class consisting of a million students… ‘Faculty are dreaming of returns that are probably multiples of their lifetime net worth,’ said Kim Clark, dean of the Harvard Business School.” As anyone who has taken an online course will tell you, none of this came to pass. Nearly 20 years ago a company called UNext – founded by disgraced junk bond king Michael Milken – spent $180M to build million-dollar simulation-based business courses with universities like Columbia, Stanford and Chicago, only to disappear several years later. No one has really tried to do this since. Why bother when over 3 million students are enrolled in online degree programs that are largely text-based, translated from traditional onground college courses in such a literal manner that it’s almost robotic: read material, participate in discussion, submit weekly assignment. And the faculty who deliver these courses are about as far from rich and famous as you can get. Image: Getty Images/smartboy10/DigitalVision About five years ago, two Silicon Valley companies – Coursera and Udacity – made new waves with big name tech founders, mountains of venture capital, and a goal of revolutionizing learning. Their model was Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) – free self-paced courses, open to everyone. When it turned out that few learners completed the MOOCs, and that it was difficult to build a viable business model on a foundation of free anything, both companies pivoted to tuition-based novel credentials: Udacity nanodegrees with curriculum from brand-name companies like Google and Apple; Coursera specializations with curriculum from brand-name universities like Yale and Stanford, but with additional content from some of the same brand-name companies e.g., Google, Splunk, Yelp, Qualcomm. One of the challenges facing online providers is the question of efficacy. It turned out that online education revolution wasn’t in quality or outcomes, but rather access – allowing millions of Americans to pursue degrees on their own time. Completion rates remain low and prominent researchers have questioned the return on investment of online programs. Concerns about quality may explain why none of the major employers associated with Coursera and Udacity have committed to hire or even interview graduates of these novel online programs. No one seemed surprised at VentureBeat’s report from mid-2017 that of the 10,000 nanodegree graduates, “more than 1,000 participants have found jobs” – a ~10 percent placement rate that should spell the demise of any last-mile program. As a result, Udacity has resorted to a series of money-back guarantees for graduates who don’t find jobs. But of course, money back guarantees don’t address the real guarantee students are seeking: a job. Udacity may give you back your money, but who’s going to give you back your time? The lesson Udacity, Coursera and others are learning is that developing skills-based online courses and credentials is the easy part. The hard part is getting employers to pay attention. One thing all successful last-mile programs have in common is that they’re intensive. Many are eager to embrace the bootcamp moniker. In contrast, Coursera and Udacity online skills-based offerings are self-paced and might lead one to believe that an “online bootcamp” is an oxymoron. There’s simply no way to guarantee intensity in an asynchronous online program. At any moment online students are likely to surf to another site, turn away from the screen, or simply drop out. Based on the completion rates of these courses, that’s often what happens. These online programs are in stark contrast to programs like Galvanize where employers are present in the same physical environment, come into contact with students, and appreciate the high intensity. Demonstrating confidence in Galvanize’s model, WeWork, the leading co-working space company, recently acquired coding bootcamp Flatiron School with the objective of integrating Flatiron’s programs into some of WeWork’s 170 global offices. While employers show great interest in physical proximity, they’re less interested in engaging with online programs and graduates of such programs. As a result, expect continued inferior placement outcomes for online programs, which defeats the purpose of last-mile training. But surely there must be ways to use technology to bridge the skills gap. There are, but they’re more nuanced than throwing a bunch of courses online, hoping employers will bite. MIT’s experience is instructive. Several years ago, MIT began offering MOOCs through its partnership with edX, a nonprofit version of Coursera. One of these courses was Entrepreneurship 101, which aimed to teach the “essential skills needed to effectively identify and target customers.” As is usually the case, tens of thousands of students enrolled in the free course, but only a small percentage completed. In thinking about the MOOC’s purpose, MIT Lecturer Erdin Beshimov had the idea of inviting successful students to apply for a one-week onground bootcamp that would challenge students to start a company in five days. A single email to students who completed the MOOC generated 500 applicants interested in paying $6,000 for the one-week bootcamp. 47 students enrolled in MIT’s first entrepreneurship bootcamp and had a transformative experience based on the following principles: (1) A meaningful goal (e.g., launch a new business); (2) Intensity (according to Beshimov, the typical student slept 10 hours that week); (3) Team-based active learning (leading to bonding and a typical “hero’s journey” i.e., adventure-crisis-victory); and (4) Exposure to employers. Employers judged the final competition and met students. One student in that initial bootcamp, David Anderton from the UK, described the program as “super-intensive.” “The first day we formed groups and ideas for projects, and we had the week to develop the project before a final pitch. Every night our team worked till 3 or 4 a.m. There was lots of problem solving and team arguments. Our team won the bootcamp with our idea, Uplook,” Anderton related. “Say you read a fashion blog and you want to buy the outfit the model is wearing. In Uplook, you can click to buy that outfit in a widget, without leaving the page; this captures people in the emotional high to buy, the blogger gets higher commission, etcetera.” But Anderton’s team experienced major stress the night before the presentation. “I remember one guy was writing an idea on the board, and right behind him another person was erasing it. The lesson I learned was to respect each other, and we hadn’t done that,” he said. “We put on professional faces for the presentation, but when we got a real offer, nobody from our team wanted talk to each other. Another team that didn’t win got a half million dollar offer from Verizon.” Since that first bootcamp, MIT has gone on to extend MOOCs into bootcamps for Food Innovation (large food companies provide the challenge and judge) and Internet of Things. Bootcamps have run not only in the U.S., but also in South Korea and Australia, attracting students from over 30 countries. Beshimov says that the bootcamps appear to be producing strong outcomes for students; “in just two years, bootcamp graduates have raised tens of millions of dollars for their ventures.” Moreover, MIT’s MOOCs “command convening power for latent talent from every corner of the globe.” Unlike many other last-mile programs, MIT spends zero on marketing. When a school as digitally savvy as MIT recognizes that digital delivery of postsecondary education has its limits, it’s worth paying attention. While online delivery can make a text-based asynchronous degree program even more convenient, it’s not doing much to address the skills gap manifested by millions of unfilled jobs, unhappy employers, and underemployed college graduates. Technology can play an important role, but it requires more thought and creativity than ranking a shed the #1 restaurant in London, or following Waze onto a burning L.A. street.","This week has been a good one for those who like to talk about the limits of technology.

Benji Jones,"Its hard to imagine your housecat as a particularly savvy killer. Sure, it may swat at a shoelace dangled in its face, or bunny-kick its favorite fish toy when its in, you know, a mood. It may even catch a bug now and then. But your cat probably spends most of the day delicately curled up on the couch, seemingly content to do absolutely nothing. But dont let their delicate purrs deceive you: Cats are brilliant, cold-blooded assassins. And nowhere is this clearer than in Australia, where feral cats unleash utter mayhem on native fauna using a stunningly smart tactic: seeking out wildfires so they can slaughter vulnerable and disoriented prey. (Yes, everything really is more deadly in Australia.) Hugh McGregor, a biologist at the University of Tasmania whos been studying feral cats for years, has examined this cunning predation strategy. Cats can locate wildfires far off in the distance and then travel to the burn scars weeks later to feed on mammals whose homes just went up in flames, as McGregor discovered after reviewing data from 32 felines with GPS collars. Theyre so hyper-aware of the environment and their home range within the landscape, McGregor said. If theres a fire, they work out where it is, travel huge distances, and hunt there until theres nothing left. Then come back home. In one case, a cat traveled nearly eight miles to a fire scar. In another, its path was so direct that McGregor thought the tracking device had malfunctioned. But in all events, the reward was worth the journey: a bounty of prey with nowhere to hide. Hunting attempts in burn scars are three times more likely to end in a kill, said Sarah Legge, a biologist at the University of Queensland, who worked with McGregor on the project. Its a dire situation for animals who survive the smoke and flames. If youre a small mammal living in an area thats burnt by fire, your mortality goes up about 20 times, she said. Thats not because theyre harmed by the fire directlyits a result of heightened predation, she said. How exactly these cats pinpoint wildfires is still in question, but McGregor has some ideas. One theory is that cats will climb tall buildings and hills to scan the horizon for a glow. You could see it walk on to a hill, stay there for a few hours, and then walk directly to a fire scar, he said of one of the cats in his 2016 study. They spend a lot of time looking and watching the horizon. Its almost a bit like the Lion King at times. He also wondered if feral cats have some form of rudimentary communication. Not anything complex, but maybe a way of communicating something simple to close kin, such as where the nearest fire scar might be. That might explain how cats navigate so effectively, he said. Cats arent just attracted to recent fires. Downpours in the desert, for example, are often followed by a boom in small mammals, McGregor said, which wild kitties also seem to know about. After a big rain they appear in droves, he said, as if someone sent out a free food email complete with a map. These cats seem unstoppableor at least, highly adaptable, Legge said. Its not only mammals theyre hunting. According to the Australian Wildlife Conservancy, feral cats kill more than a million birds and well over a million reptiles every day, amounting to a death toll of 2,000 native animals every minute. In fact, not even poisonous snakes stand in their way. They eat those, too. It proceeded for 10 minutes to chew the neck off, McGregor said, describing an observation of a cat eating a brown snake, one of Australias most deadly. It obviously knew if it digested the head it would die. And so the clever kitty severed the head and slurped the body down like spaghetti. With tactics like these, native species should be absolutely terrified of feral cats. And yet, theyre blithely unaware of the danger, since local animals didnt evolve alongside feline predators. Native wildlife doesnt respond to the cat smell, McGregor said. Theyre just not that scared of cats. Cats have been altering ecosystems Down Under ever since they were introduced to Australia in the 17th or 18th century by Europeans. Theyve established feral colonies that now cover more than 99 percent of the continent. And theyve been chewing on far more than shoe strings since they arrived. In just a few centuries, cats have been implicated in the extinction of more than 20 mammals, including the lesser bilby and the desert bandicoot, giving Australia the worst mammal extinction record in recent times, said Karl Vernes, a biologist at the University of New England in New South Wales. As these tiny terrors have done irrevocable damage to so many native critters, humans have had to intervene. Earlier this year, the Australian Wildlife Conservancy completed the worlds largest cat-proof fence, which encloses an area theyll stock with native species. And last year, the government announced a more dramatic approach: the culling of 2 million cats (which currently number between 2.1 million and 6.3 million ) by 2020. McGregor said conservationists should also find ways for feral cats and native wildlife to coexist. That might mean teaching small mammals to fear invasive predators or controlling the frequency of wildfires (which have seen an uptick following the introduction of grasses brought in for cattle grazing, Vernes noted). But you cant blame the catsa predator has gotta eat. So now, more than ever, is a great time to remind you to keep your pet cat indoors, lest it unleash its formidable hunting prowess on local wildlife.

Devin Coldewey,"Wildfires are consuming our forests and grasslands faster than we can replace them. It’s a vicious cycle of destruction and inadequate restoration rooted, so to speak, in decades of neglect of the institutions and technologies needed to keep these environments healthy. DroneSeed is a Seattle-based startup that aims to combat this growing problem with a modern toolkit that scales: drones, artificial intelligence, and biological engineering. And it’s even more complicated than it sounds. Trees in decline A bit of background first. The problem of disappearing forests is a complex one, but it boils down to a few major factors: climate change, outdated methods, and shrinking budgets (and as you can imagine, all three are related). Forest fires are a natural occurrence, of course. And they’re necessary, as you’ve likely read, to sort of clear the deck for new growth to take hold. But climate change, monoculture growth, population increases, lack of control burns, and other factors have led to these events taking place not just more often, but more extensively and to more permanent effect. On average, the U.S. is losing 7 million acres a year. That’s not easy to replace to begin with and as budgets for the likes of national and state forest upkeep have shrunk continually over the last half century, there have been fewer and fewer resources with which to combat this trend. The most effective and common reforestation technique for a recently burned woodland is human planters carrying sacks of seedlings and manually selecting and placing them across miles of landscapes. This back-breaking work is rarely done by anyone for more than a year or two, so labor is scarce and turnover is intense. Even if the labor was available on tap, the trees might not be. Seedlings take time to grow in nurseries and a major wildfire might necessitate the purchase and planting of millions of new trees. It’s impossible for nurseries to anticipate this demand, and the risk associated with growing such numbers on speculation is more than many can afford. One missed guess could put the whole operation underwater. Meanwhile if nothing gets planted, invasive weeds move in with a vengeance, claiming huge areas that were once old growth forests. Lacking the labor and tree inventory to stem this possibility, forest keepers resort to a stopgap measure: use helicopters to drench the area in herbicides to kill weeds, then saturate it with fast-growing cheatgrass or the like. (The alternative to spraying is, again, the manual approach: machetes.) At least then, in a year, instead of a weedy wasteland, you have a grassy monoculture not a forest, but it’ll do until the forest gets here. One final complication: helicopter spraying is a horrendously dangerous profession. These pilots are flying at sub-100-foot elevations, performing high-speed maneuvers so that their sprays reach the very edge of burn zones but they don’t crash head-on into the trees. This is an extremely dangerous occupation: 80 to 100 crashes occur every year in the U.S. alone. In short, there are more and worse fires and we have fewer resources and dated ones at that with which to restore forests after them. These are facts anyone in forest ecology and logging are familiar with, but perhaps not as well known among technologists. We do tend to stay in areas with cell coverage. But it turns out that a boost from the cloistered knowledge workers of the tech world specifically those in the Emerald City may be exactly what the industry and ecosystem require. Simple idea, complex solution So what’s the solution to all this? Automation, right? Automation, especially via robotics, is proverbially suited for jobs that are “dull, dirty, and dangerous.” Restoring a forest is dirty and dangerous to be sure. But dull isn’t quite right. It turns out that the process requires far more intelligence than anyone was willing, it seems, to apply to the problem with the exception of those planters. That’s changing. Earlier this year, DroneSeed was awarded the first multi-craft, over-55-pounds unmanned aerial vehicle license ever issued by the FAA. Its custom UAV platforms, equipped with multispectral camera arrays, high-end lidar, 6-gallon tanks of herbicide, and proprietary seed dispersal mechanisms have been hired by several major forest management companies, with government entities eyeing the service as well. These drones scout a burned area, mapping it down to as high as centimeter accuracy, including objects and plant species, fumigate it efficiently and autonomously, identify where trees would grow best, then deploy painstakingly designed seed-nutrient packages to those locations. It’s cheaper than people, less wasteful and dangerous than helicopters, and smart enough to scale to national forests currently at risk of permanent damage. I met with the company’s team at their headquarters near Ballard, where complete and half-finished drones sat on top of their cases and the air was thick with capsaicin (we’ll get to that). The idea for the company began when founder and CEO Grant Canary burned through a few sustainable startup ideas after his last company was acquired, and was told, in his despondency, that he might have to just go plant trees. Canary took his friend’s suggestion literally. “I started looking into how its done today,” he told me. “Its incredibly outdated. Even at the most sophisticated companies in the world, planters are superheroes that use bags and a shovel to plant trees. Theyre being paid to move material over mountainous terrain and be a simple AI and determine where to plant trees where they will grow microsites. We are now able to do both these functions with drones. This allows those same workers to address much larger areas faster without the caloric wear and tear.” It may not surprise you to hear that investors are not especially hot on forest restoration (I joked that it was a “growth industry” but really because of the reasons above it’s in dire straits). But investors are interested in automation, machine learning, drones, and especially government contracts. So the pitch took that form. With the money Droneseed secured, it has built its modestly sized but highly accomplished team and produced the prototype drones with which is has captured several significant contracts before even announcing that it exists. “We definitely don’t fit the mold or metrics most startups are judged on. The nice thing about not fitting the mold is people double take and then get curious,” Canary said. “Once they see we can actually execute and have been with 3 of the 5 largest timber companies in the US for years, they get excited and really start advocating hard for us.” The company went through Techstars, and Social Capital helped them get on their feet, with Spero Ventures joining up after the company got some groundwork done. If things go as Droneseed hopes, these drones could be deployed all over the world by trained teams, allowing spraying and planting efforts in nurseries and natural forests to take place exponentially faster and more efficiently than they are today. It’s genuine change-the-world-from-your-garage stuff, which is why this article is so long. Hunter (weed) killers The job at hand isn’t simple or even straightforward. Every landscape differs from every other, not just in the shape and size of the area to be treated but the ecology, native species, soil type and acidity, type of fire or logging that cleared it, and so on. So the first and most important task is to gather information. For this Droneseed has a special craft equipped with a sophisticated imaging stack. This first pass is done using waypoints set on satellite imagery. The information collected at this point is really far more detailed than what’s actually needed. The lidar, for instance, collects spatial information at a resolution much beyond what’s needed to understand the shape of the terrain and major obstacles. It produces a 3D map of the vegetation as well as the terrain, allowing the system to identify stumps, roots, bushes, new trees, erosion, and other important features. This works hand in hand with the multispectral camera, which collects imagery not just in the visible bands useful for identifying things but also in those outside the human range, which allows for in-depth analysis of the soil and plant life. The resulting map of the area is not just useful for drone navigation, but for the surgical strikes that are necessary to make this kind of drone-based operation worth doing in the first place. No doubt there are researchers who would love to have this data as well. Now, spraying and planting are very different tasks. The first tends to be done indiscriminately using helicopters, and the second by laborers who burn out after a couple years as mentioned above, it’s incredibly difficult work. The challenge in the first case is to improve efficiency and efficacy, while in the second case is to automate something that requires considerable intelligence. Spraying is in many ways simpler. Identifying invasive plants isn’t easy, exactly, but it can be done with imagery like that the drones are collecting. Having identified patches of a plant to be eliminated, the drones can calculate a path and expend only as much herbicide is necessary to kill them, instead of dumping hundreds of gallons indiscriminately on the entire area. It’s cheaper and more environmentally friendly. Naturally, the opposite approach could be used for distributing fertilizer or some other agent. I’m making it sound easy again. This isn’t a plug and play situation you can’t buy a DJI drone and hit the “weedkiller” option in its control software. A big part of this operation was the creation not only of the drones themselves, but the infrastructure with which to deploy them. Conservation convoy The drones themselves are unique, but not alarmingly so. They’re heavy-duty craft, capable of lifting well over the 57 pounds of payload they carry (the FAA limits them to 115 pounds). “We buy and gut aircraft, then retrofit them,” Canary explained simply. Their head of hardware, would probably like to think there’s a bit more to it than that, but really the problem they’re solving isn’t “make a drone” but “make drones plant trees.” To that end, Canary explained, “the most unique engineering challenge was building a planting module for the drone that functions with the software.” We’ll get to that later. DroneSeed deploys drones in swarms, which means as many as five drones in the air at once which in turn means they need two trucks and trailers with their boxes, power supplies, ground stations, and so on. The company’s VP of operations comes from a military background where managing multiple aircraft onsite was part of the job, and she’s brought her rigorous command of multi-aircraft environments to the company. The drones take off and fly autonomously, but always under direct observation by the crew. If anything goes wrong, they’re there to take over, though of course there are plenty of autonomous behaviors for what to do in case of, say, a lost positioning signal or bird strike. They fly in patterns calculated ahead of time to be the most efficient, spraying at problem areas when they’re over them, and returning to the ground stations to have power supplies swapped out before returning to the pattern. It’s key to get this process down pat, since efficiency is a major selling point. If a helicopter does it in a day, why shouldn’t a drone swarm? It would be sad if they had to truck the craft back to a hangar and recharge them every hour or two. It also increases logistics costs like gas and lodging if it takes more time and driving. This means the team involves several people as well as several drones. Qualified pilots and observers are needed, as well as people familiar with the hardware and software that can maintain and troubleshoot on site usually with no cell signal or other support. Like many other forms of automation, this one brings its own new job opportunities to the table. AI plays Mother Nature The actual planting process is deceptively complex. The idea of loading up a drone with seeds and setting it free on a blasted landscape is easy enough to picture. Hell, it’s been done. There are efforts going back decades to essentially load seeds or seedlings into guns and fire them out into the landscape at speeds high enough to bury them in the dirt: in theory this combines the benefits of manual planting with the scale of carpeting the place with seeds. But whether it was slapdash placement or the shock of being fired out of a seed gun, this approach never seemed to work. Forestry researchers have shown the effectiveness of finding the right “microsite” for a seed or seedling; in fact, it’s why manual planting works as well as it does. Trained humans find perfect spots to put seedlings: in the lee of a log; near but not too near the edge of a stream; on the flattest part of a slope, and so on. If you really want a forest to grow, you need optimal placement, perfect conditions, and preventative surgical strikes with pesticides. Although it’s difficult it’s also the kind of thing that a machine learning model can become good at. Sorting through messy, complex imagery and finding local minima and maxima is a specialty of today’s ML systems, and the aerial imagery from the drones is rich in relevant data. The company’s CTO led the creation of an ML model that determines the best locations to put trees at a site though this task can be highly variable depending on the needs of the forest. A logging company might want a tree every couple feet even if that means putting them in sub-optimal conditions but a few inches to the left or right may make all the difference. On the other hand, national forests may want more sparse deployments or specific species in certain locations to curb erosion or establish sustainable firebreaks. Once the data has been crunched, the map is loaded into the drones’ hive mind and the convoy goes to the location, where the craft are loaded up with seeds instead of herbicides. But not just any old seeds! You see, that’s one more wrinkle. If you just throw a sagebrush seed on the ground, even if it’s in the best spot in the world, it could easily be snatched up by an animal, roll or wash down to a nearby crevasse, or simply fail to find the right nutrients in time despite the planter’s best efforts. That’s why DroneSeed’s Head of Planting and his team have been working on a proprietary seed packet that they were unbelievably reticent to detail. From what I could gather, they’ve put a ton of work into packaging the seeds into nutrient-packed little pucks held together with a biodegradable fiber. The outside is dusted with capsaicin, the chemical that makes spicy food spicy (and also what makes bear spray do what it does). If they hadn’t told me, I might have guessed, since the workshop area was hazy with it, leading us all to cough tear up a little. If I were a marmot, I’d learn to avoid these things real fast. The pucks, or “seed vessels,” can and must be customized for the location and purpose you have to match the content and acidity of the soil, things like that. DroneSeed will have to make millions of these things, but it doesn’t plan to be the manufacturer. Finally these pucks are loaded in a special puck-dispenser which, closely coordinating with the drone, spits one out at the exact moment and speed needed to put it within a few centimeters of the microsite. All these factors should improve the survival rate of seedlings substantially. That means that the company’s methods will not only be more efficient, but more effective. Reforestation is a numbers game played at scale, and even slight improvements and DroneSeed is promising more than that are measured in square miles and millions of tons of biomass. Proof of life DroneSeed has already signed several big contracts for spraying, and planting is next. Unfortunately the timing on their side meant they missed this year’s planting season, though by doing a few small sites and showing off the results, they’ll be in pole position for next year. After demonstrating the effectiveness of the planting technique, the company expects to expand its business substantially. That’s the scaling part again, not easy, but easier than hiring another couple thousand planters every year. Ideally the hardware can be assigned to local teams that do the on-site work, producing loci of activity around major forests from which jobs can be deployed at large or small scales. A set of 5 or 6 drones does the work of a helicopter, roughly speaking, so depending on the volume requested by a company or forestry organization you may need dozens on demand. That’s all yet to be explored, but DroneSeed is confident that the industry will see the writing on the wall when it comes to the old methods, and identify them as a solution that fits the future. If it sounds like I’m cheerleading for this company, that’s because I am. It’s not often in the world of tech startups that you find a group of people not just attempting to solve a serious problem it’s common enough to find companies hitting this or that issue but who have spent the time, gathered the expertise, and really done the dirty, boots-on-the-ground work that needs to happen so it goes from great idea to real company. That’s what I felt was the case with DroneSeed, and here’s hoping their work pays off for their sake, sure, but mainly for ours.","Wildfires are consuming our forests the institutions and technologies to keep these environments healthy have suffered decades of neglect.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Power provider PG&amp;E Corp filed for voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Tuesday, succumbing to liabilities stemming from wildfires in Northern California in 2017 and 2018. 
PG&amp;E, the owner of the biggest U.S. power utility, also filed a motion seeking court approval for a $5.5 billion in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing, it said in a statement. 
PG&amp;E, which had a debt burden of more than $18 billion, said earlier this month it would need to pursue a court-supervised reorganization in the aftermath of the blazes, including November’s so-called Camp Fire. 
“Throughout this process, we are fully committed to enhancing our wildfire safety efforts, as well as helping restoration and rebuilding efforts across the communities impacted by the devastating Northern California wildfires,” PG&amp;E interim CEO John Simon said. 
The company also intends to pay suppliers in full under normal terms for goods and services provided on or after the filing date of Jan. 29, it said. 
The San Francisco-based company expects the court to act on these requests in the coming days. 
The bankruptcy petition was filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California.

Frederic Lardinois,"It’s one thing to dispatch a drone when an accident happens to get an aerial overview of what’s happening on the ground, but you get far better situational awareness if you can use augmented reality (AR) to add the names of roads, the location of key personnel, cars and other assets to that view. That’s what Edgybees, a Santa Clara-based startup that current specializes in AR for drones, offers first responders. Its system has already been used by emergency teams during the Northern California wildfires and hurricane floods in Florida. The company today announced that it has raised a $5.5 million seed funding round that includes Motorola Solutions Venture Capital, and Verizon Ventures, as well as 8VC, NFX, Aspect Ventures and Israeli crowdfunding platform OurCrowd. The company plans to use the new funding to bring its existing AR technology, which I recently saw in action during a drone demo with Israel’s volunteer first responder organization United Hatzalah in Jerusalem, to other platforms and to enter new verticals. These include defense, smart cities, automotive and broadcast media. Last year, Edgybees also partnered with drone manufacturer DJI to use its AR systems to build a racing game. That’s not really the company’s focus these days, but it shows the power of the platform the team has built. “What started as technology powering a racing game is now saving lives around the world,” co-founder and CEO Adam Kaplan writes in today’s announcement. “The overwhelming response by commercial and industrial drone users looking to leverage AR, and partner with us in the fields of fire, public safety, and search &amp; rescue has been amazing, and we can’t wait to expand the next set of drone applications into new markets.” Kaplan previously co-founded a number of companies, while his CTO Menashe Haskin was previously the head of Amazon’s Prime Air office in Israel.","It’s one thing to dispatch a drone when an accident happens to get an aerial overview of what’s happening on the ground, but you get far better situational awareness if you can use augmented reality (AR) to add the names of roads, the location of key personne…",2018-02-28T14:40:08Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Edgybees raises $5.5M to bring better AR to cars and drones,http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/28/edgybees-raises-5-5m-to-bring-better-ar-to-cars-and-drones/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/edgybees.png,techcrunch,TechCrunch,wildfires,0
Sarah Buhr,"Molekule, a San Francisco-based startup with a sleekly designed molecular air purifier started as an immigrant dream twenty years ago and ended up being named one of Time’s top 25 inventions of 2017. The inventor Yogi Goswami came up with the idea when his baby son Dilip started having a hard time breathing the air around him. Dilip suffered from severe asthma but no air purifier at the time seemed to work well enough to clean up indoor pollutants. Traditional HEPA filters simply trap a few pollutants but they don’t grab everything and they don’t break them down before releasing them back into the air. So, Goswami the elder came up with a filter technology that could both suck up things like allergens, mold and bacteria and then break them down to particles one-thousand times smaller than what a HEPA filter can catch using photo electrochemical oxidation (PECO) and nanotechnology to destroy the pollutants on a molecular level and eliminate the full spectrum of indoor air pollutants. The result? Clean, breathable air that even the most sensitive person can handle. Dilip and his sister Jaya Goswami patented the tech and founded Molekule to bring their father’s invention to the rest of us. The company now ships a stylish $800, two-foot-tall cylinder with the patented filter inside. Sure, it’s a lot pricier than most filters out there but the company also offers financing at $67 a month. It was also instrumental in helping folks breathe during the Northern California wildfires this fall. Jaya mentioned Molekule’s inventory was completely depleted during that time and that the company couldn’t ship fast enough — the product is still backordered till January 3rd, 2018. So far Molekule has brought in just over $13 million in venture funding to keep it going. It may be just in time as California is still dealing with wildfires elsewhere and, as global warming releases more C02 into the air, that causes more plants and flowers to release more pollen throughout the year. I visited Molekule’s headquarters South of Market lately to chat with Jaya about the business and get a look at how her filter works.

Tom McKay,"Wildfires in California have continued to ravage large portions of the state, with the Thomas fire in southern California now entering its 13th day and claiming over 267,500 acres of land, CNN reported. The wildfire is now the third-largest in California history and is just 40 percent contained, with over 8,400 firefighters and $110 million in resources deployed to fight it. Now-familiar scenes posted by the Santa Barbara County Fire Department and others this weekend showed Ventura and Santa Barbara counties descending into a nightmarish state, just as with a prior spate of wildfires elsewhere in California earlier this year. Ventura resident Patricia Rye told KEYT she had woken up in the middle of the night after her son-in-law arrived and did not have time to grab anything before the fire approached her building. “I didn’t have time to take anything,” Rye said. “My wallet, or any of my personal things. I literally left with the clothes on my back. If I had been thinking I would have got into my car, but I wasn’t thinking so my car was there.” Elsewhere, CNN reported, thousands of people were evacuated and animals at the Santa Barbara Zoo were loaded into cages in anticipation of a possible emergency. The Thomas fire could be on track to become the largest fire in recorded California history, the L.A. Times reported, potentially surpassing both the 2003 Cedar fire (273,000 acres) and the 1889 Santiago Canyon fire (300,000 acres). UCLA and U.S. Geological Survey research ecologist Jon Keeley told the paper that half of the largest wildfires in the state since 1861 have occurred in the last 15 years, with humans primarily to blame—both as a result of arson or accidental fires being started by them or due to persistent regional drought, which is linked to climate change. “We think that this fire, the Thomas fire, is likely very large in part not just because the Santa Ana wind event is long, but there was this very extreme drought between 2012 and 2014,” Keeley said. “... What extreme droughts do is they cause dieback of the vegetation,” he added. “Basically a canopy of the vegetation dies and oftentimes the entire plant dies. So you have lots of dead vegetation out on the landscape from the drought. And when the Santa Ana winds blow embers ahead of the fire front, they’ll ignite spot fires, but only if they land on dead vegetation.” Associate director of the Center for Environmental Journalism at the University of Colorado, Boulder Michael Kodas wrote in the L.A. Times that prior to 1995, the U.S. averaged one “mega-fire” of more than 100,000 acres a year. California now experiences one such fire a year on its own, while the U.S. averages nearly 10. Elsewhere in the paper, concerned readers urged fellow residents to stop building homes or developments in the wildland-urban border zones where the fires spread. [ CNN / L.A.

CHARLES McDERMID,"Mr. Witwer was referring to what many are calling the “new normal,” a term now commonly applied to the state’s drastically worsening fire seasons as a result of cyclical drought, climate change and the ceaseless drive to populate fire-prone areas. Last year was the most destructive fire season in California history: more than $10 billion in damage and 44 dead. The ominous question is what comes next. “There is a new normal in California,” Toni Atkins, the State Senate president pro tem, said by email. “Massive wildland fires are now a part of our life — and one of biggest challenges facing the Legislature and governor this year. These fires are every bit the same kind of disaster as earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters that confront states across the country.” Fear has translated into policy: California will spend as much as $1 billion in the coming year to prevent and prepare for wildfires. Mr. McLean said that through Sunday, Cal Fire had this year responded to 1,200 fires that had burned 8,000 acres. Last year at this time, they’d responded to 1,049 fires that burned 2,200 acres. For some, “new normal” is already passé. Scott McLean, the deputy chief of Cal Fire, drives from Chico to Sacramento every day. He’s already watched fire conditions change this year, the grass turning from green to brown.","Wednesday: A battle for second place in the governor’s race, a death in Yosemite and Golden State comes up short.",2018-05-23T13:02:40Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: Experts on Fire Season 2018: Dealing With the ‘New Normal’,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/us/california-today-fire-season-2018.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/world/12CALtoday-1/12CALtoday-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfires,0
Mark Kaufman,"For the second time in less than eight months, California broke its record for the largest fire in the state's history. Tuesday morning, the Golden State's fire protection agency, Cal Fire, reported that the Mendocino Complex fire had now burned over 290,000 acres — over nine times the size of San Francisco — surpassing the previous record of 281,893 set in December by the destructive Thomas Fire. SEE ALSO: A NASA prototype could save the lives of firefighters as blazes erupt in western U.S. The Mendocino Complex, which is comprised of two massive fires whose edges are as close as three miles apart, is not nearly finished. The larger of the two fires, at some 240,000 acres, is just 20 percent contained. Other major wildfires are also burning across the state, including the 94,000-acre Ferguson Fire which has closed down Yosemite National Park indefinitely, and the 167,000-acre Carr Fire — the twelfth largest in state history — which last week produced a towering fire tornado. Though climate change itself, specifically extreme and recording-breaking heat, doesn't create fires, it enhances them. As fire experts pointed out earlier in the season, hot temperatures and heat waves have parched much of Northern California's vegetation to near-record levels of dryness — turning the land to fire-ready kindling. California's large-scale fires are creating seriously polluted air over vast portions of the West. As climatologist Robert Rohde noted on Twitter Monday, ""the worst particulate air pollution anywhere in the world that we have data is in southern #Oregon due to the smoke from the #wildfires."" This is a growing, and troubling, trend. As air quality continues to improve around most of the U.S., wildfires are tainting the air across a large swathe of the West. The reason is simple. Twice as much U.S. land burns today than in the 1980s, filling the air with more tiny bits of particulate matter. Since 2000, California has seen seven of its top 10 largest-ever recorded fires. What's more, over the same period, the state has experienced eight of its 10 most destructive fires in history. The U.S. Forest Service is in its highest level of fire response, with 29,500 firefighters battling blazes around the nation. Most, however, are combating fires in the super-parched West, where the record-breaking Mendocino Complex promises to spread even more.","For the second time in less than eight months, California broke its record for the largest fire in the state's history.

You’re just putting more and more pollution into a limited space and it’s getting more concentrated, more concentrated, more concentrated,” said Jamie Holt of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. “We don’t create more pollution than other parts of the country, we actually create a lot less pollution,” she added. “But because we have this topography and meteorology, we have less ability to clear the pollution out.” It’s not just the inland San Joaquin Valley that is getting hit. An air quality advisory has also gone out for the Bay Area, which has been affected by smoke from the nearby Mendocino Complex Fire. A “spare the air” alert was even issued by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District — which oversees nine counties around the bay — asking people in the area to reduce their driving to minimize smog; those alerts are issued when air quality has reached levels that are potentially unhealthy. The Sacramento Valley has received less bad air than the San Joaquin Valley, but a “spare the air” advisory was released there as well. “It doesn’t really matter which way the wind blows because you’ll get smoke from some fire or another,” said Jamie Arno of the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District.",A man wears a mask while fishing from his boat on Wednesday as smoke from the Mendocino Complex Fire covers Clear Lake in Clearlake Oaks.,2018-08-09T12:00:25Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","California Today: California Today: Amid Wildfires, Bad Air Becomes a Threat, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/us/california-today-wildfires-air-conditions.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/08/world/o9-california-today-1/o9-california-today-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfires,0
John Timmer,"reader comments 0 Tuesday evening, Columbia University's Earth Institute hosted a panel that was meant to focus on an issue we're likely to be facing with increasing frequency: the need to move entire communities that are no longer viable due to rising seas or altered weather. But the discussion ended up shifting to how people in at-risk locations aren't moving, and the entire governmental structure in the US is focused on keeping them right where they are. As a result, the entire US population is already paying for climate change, whether we accept the science behind it or not. And things will almost certainly get worse. Staying put That's not to say that climate-driven migrations aren't an issue. They've happened in a number of countries, and the panel noted that China, in particular, has been fairly aggressive about moving communities that the government feels cost too much to support. It's also happening a bit in the US with coastal villages in Alaska and Louisiana. But the wildfires on the edge of urban areas in California provided the panel with a perfect backdrop: climate risks in areas we're not just going to walk away from. There was also the perfect panelist for this: Lisa Dale has tracked climate-related issues in the Western US. She said a number of trends are colliding out west. One of these is the warming and drying climate, which has led to a hotter fire season and produced fires that reach higher temperatures. As a result, the amount of the US Forest Service budget that goes toward firefighting has more than tripled from 16 percent to half the agency's budget. That drains its ability to take preventative actions on fire risks, even as many western states are seeing development on lands that border wilderness managed by the federal government. Despite all that (and the steady flow of images of destroyed homes), development isn't slowing down, and people who are living on the wildland-urban interface aren't thinking of leaving. Dale said that surveys of people who had actually lost their homes to fire indicated that more than 90 percent preferred to rebuild. Michael Gerrard said the responses to increasing flood risks aren't much different. Climate change is enhancing these through rising ocean levels, changing patterns of rainfall, and increased intensity of storms. But the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which handles this issue, only evaluates flood risks based on historical events, even though climate change is altering those risks. Gerrard also called the results of FEMA's evaluations ""perverse,"" since declaring an area high-risk allows its residents to obtain federally subsidized flood insurance, in effect ""subsidizing continued development in high-risk areas."" A few years back, the government actually considered bringing the insurance costs up to something closer to market rates. But a huge outcry from those living in these areas caused Congress to back down, leaving this subsidy in place. And, as panel member Alex de Sherbinin noted, FEMA does not have the ability to do anything other than offer post-disaster response. No change in sight Overall, the panel saw little hope of the market or government shifting matters so that our housing better reflected changing risks—""markets haven't yet processed what's inevitable,"" as moderator Radley Horton put it. Mortgages ""are a barrier to property prices reflecting reality,"" Gerrard argued. Local governments don't want to deal with relocating anyone out of harm's way because it means they'll lose tax revenue. And the federal government has generally acted to block restrictions on land use. Which means that we're going to be stuck paying these costs for the indefinite future. Dale said that there had been some successes when it came to fire risks. Private insurance companies have brought rates up to match risks and compelled owners to take measures like clearing underbrush, while local communities have rolled out fire-education programs. But flood risks have proven much harder. There have been a few relocation programs, but Gerrard called them ""very few and very expensive."" Yet, unlike the erratic danger of wildfires, the rising oceans can't really be handled in a way that minimizes risk. Horton said that it's estimated that about two million US residents will need to be relocated before the century's out due to rising oceans, and, if that rise accelerates faster than we expect, we could be looking at situations like the complete loss of far-southern Florida. At that point, the societal costs for our policy decisions get quite a bit larger.","When it comes to floods and wildfires, the damage is shared with the public.",2017-12-06T22:28:36Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",We’ve all managed to end up paying the costs of climate change,https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/12/weve-all-managed-to-end-up-paying-the-costs-of-climate-change/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/710937main_climate-fire-lg-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,wildfires,0

Andrew Freedman,"Thursday looks to be a pivotal, frightening day in Southern California's battle against a wildfire siege that began early this week and has since spread out of control. At least three large fires are currently burning in and around Los Angeles, including one — the Thomas Fire — which has already burned at least 90,000 acres near Ventura. Early Thursday morning, authorities closed the 101 Freeway in both directions due to strong winds pushing fire close to the road, cutting off movement between Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. Evacuation orders have gone out for idyllic communities in the Ojai Valley, as well as parts of Santa Barbara, as flames move toward the coast, according to the LA Times. More evacuations are likely on Thursday. SEE ALSO: Wildfires lead to hellish scenes for Los Angeles commuters The weather conditions on Thursday are downright dire, with strong, damaging winds rushing through mountain passes and down hillsides toward the coast. This will create extraordinarily dry air, and make any new fires or ones that are already in progress extremely difficult, if not impossible, to control. California’s fire history is replete with Santa Ana-driven, damaging blazes. However, the combination of factors present on Thursday — powerful winds, preexisting fires, desiccated vegetation, and also population growth — make it stand out as an especially risky day for the state. According to news reports, more than 200,000 people have been evacuated due to the fires, and this number may climb as the winds interact with the fires to push them in new directions at a faster clip. According to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), which forecasts the risk of wildfires based on anticipated weather conditions, fire weather is likely to be ""extremely critical"" — a rare designation reserved for only the most threatening situations — in a swath of Southern California on Thursday. These combustible conditions are going to affect about 9.5 million people, the SPC forecasts. Another 10.7 million people reside in a ""critical"" fire weather zone, including the city of Los Angeles. Elevated fire risk is forecast for Southern California straight through Saturday. ""Large fire spread and extreme fire behavior will occur with any new/ongoing fires,"" the SPC said in a forecast discussion. Average temperatures across California during the summer months (June, July, and August) in 2017. Image: NOAA The high winds may prevent aircraft, including helicopters and heavy water bombers, from doing their work, as well. This further inhibits firefighters' ability to contain these blazes. The National Weather Service is predicting strong winds to last all day on Thursday. The winds have already exceeded hurricane force in some high elevation areas, with gusts above 75 miles per hour. While wildfires are a typical occurrence in Southern California each fall, when the dry, offshore Santa Ana winds blow, the current blazes are occurring later in the year than normal. In addition, conditions in the region are far drier than they normally would be. These fires are an illustration of how short-term weather variability can interact with longer-term climate trends to create a precedent-setting, potentially deadly extreme event. A fire sends embers all over residential neighborhoods north of Ventura, Calif. on Dec. 5, 2017. Image: Marcus Lam/LA Times via Getty Images ""The risk of large wildfires in coastal California typically peaks in Autumn after the long dry summers — typical of California’s Mediterranean climate — increase the flammability of the vegetation that fuels wildfires,"" LeRoy Westerling, a scientist researching climate and wildfire at the University of California at Merced, said in an email. ""The overlap between the dry fuels and these warm dry wind events marks the peak fire risk for the year in coastal California,"" Westerling said. ""Usually, Autumn rains put an end to the fire season by wetting fuels and raising humidity, even though wind events may continue to occur."" The problem is, Westerling noted, it hasn't rained much in Southern California since March. The state also had its hottest summer on record, which dried out the vegetation that grew after one of its wettest winters, forming a perfect weather whiplash combo that is conducive to igniting large fires. ""Southern California has remained unusually dry through November and into December this year, extending the high fire risk fueled by the confluence of dry conditions and Autumn winds that are driving the large fires burning in coastal Southern California,"" Westerling said. While these fires cannot be directly tied to climate change, since they were most likely ignited by downed power lines or arson, they are consistent with what scientists expect to occur more frequently from a warming, drying climate in much of California. The entire American West, in fact, is likely to see — and in many cases has already seen — an increase in the size and frequency of large wildfires. ""Climate change is increasing the variability of precipitation as well as increasing temperatures,"" Westerling said. ""This means that the probability of extremely large wind-driven fires in California occurring later in the year is increasing.""","Thursday looks to be a pivotal, frightening day in Southern California's battle against a wildfire siege that began early this week and has since spread out of control.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"In September, following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Congress approved $15 billion in relief aid. Lawmakers signed off on another $36.5 billion for storm and wildfires assistance in October, after weeks of criticism leveled against the Trump administration for its response to Maria in Puerto Rico. The $90 billion disaster relief package outlined on Wednesday also includes aid for communities affected by hurricanes or wildfires in California, Florida, Texas and the Virgin Islands. When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in 2005, Congress approved $10 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency four days later, and another $50 billion six days later. The federal government is still spending money on Katrina assistance, more than 12 years after the storm’s landfall. Before Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in nearly a century, the island was already grappling with insolvency. The government declared a form of bankruptcy last May, after years of borrowing money to pay for operating expenses after a painful recession that began in 2006. The relief package sets aside $4.8 billion for Medicaid in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, helping to avoid a looming shortfall that could have left some 600,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in Puerto Rico without health insurance by April. Puerto Rican leaders worried some of the people left uninsured would migrate to the mainland seeking coverage. Compared to the states, territories receive only a fraction of funding for entitlement programs. The Senate deal would waive the requirement for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to share in the cost of Medicaid for two years, placing the funding responsibility on the federal government instead. Louisiana received the same reprieve after Hurricane Katrina, but for only one year, said Representative Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting delegate in Congress. Lawmakers approved relief packages for 10 years after that storm, she noted. Puerto Rico is not that far removed yet from Hurricane Maria. “Receiving these funds is important, and that will demonstrate that Puerto Rico will use them wisely and with transparency,” she said. “That’s an important issue here: We can be a model for how to invest in infrastructure on the island.” Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló, said the $2 billion earmarked for power restoration in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could help his island harden its battered grid. While funds from the previous aid packages went to FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers, the latest relief package will give money directly to the Puerto Rican government. Twenty-eight percent of Puerto Ricans — more than 400,000 utility customers — still do not have power more than four months after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico. “With these resources, we can begin rebuilding our housing and energy future, putting Puerto Rico on a new path forward,” Mr. Rosselló said in a statement.

Mark Kaufman,"The flames scorching the Western U.S. aren't expected to relent anytime soon. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) gave its monthly U.S. climate report on Thursday, and they used the opportunity to show that the next couple of months are ripe for an enhanced fire risk out West. SEE ALSO: The baking Pacific Ocean is changing the weather on the Southern California coast After noting the exceptionally hot and dry conditions that stoked destructive wildfires so far this summer, Tim Brown, director of the Western Regional Climate Center, said in a press call that it won't be until after October that ""we see a decline in significant fire potential."" A critical driver of this heightened fire potential is that trees, grasses, and shrubs, known collectively as fuels, are currently ""flirting with all-time record lows for fuel moisture,"" said Brown. In short, hot temperatures and multiple heat waves this summer have parched the land to extreme levels, turning it to tinder. Meaningful rains can solve the problem, but they don't usually show up in many portions of the West until November. What's more, the coming fall months have another potent fire factor that isn't usually seen in August: Strong offshore winds, blowing from the northeast. Called ""diablo winds"" in Northern California, these gusts are hot, dry, and fast and have historically whipped up fires. Case in point: The deadly firestorms that swept through Northern California neighborhoods last summer were stoked by October's diablo winds. On top of all this, Brown underscored that since 1895, there has been a trend in increasing temperatures at night, which ultimately won't allow fuels to cool off and recover. ""This can lead to longer fires and more smoke production,"" he said. But in the last couple decades, ""this trend has taken off,"" said Brown. Taken alone, each of these environmental conditions can stoke fires, but taken together, they invite major flames. Some of the largest fires in California history are burning through the ravaged state right now, and smoke from both the Western U.S. and Canada has traveled thousands of miles away to the Atlantic Ocean, actually engulfing a cyclone. Just out: NASA global temperature for July. It was the 3rd warmest July on record after 2016 and 2017. Since July is the warmest month of the year, the past July was one of the warmest recorded months ever. Likely among the warmest months since the Eemian 120,000 years ago. pic.twitter.com/KGZXh5ZXOS — Stefan Rahmstorf (@rahmstorf) August 15, 2018 Brown likened the profoundly parched vegetation in the West to a dying Christmas tree. During winter, the tree might be wet and green, but as time passes and the leaves brown, it becomes an increasing flammable object. And unfortunately, that's how we all should be thinking about the West right now.","The flames scorching the Western U.S. aren't expected to relent anytime soon.

Mark Kaufman,"It should come as no surprise that California is burning. On Wednesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that July was California's hottest month since record keeping began in 1895. Those scorching temperatures withered the land, creating profoundly parched forests primed to catch fire with just a spark. SEE ALSO: Engineering Earth's climate might quell global warming, but it could come with a cost Major wildfires are propelled by weather, notably strong winds, but they're also enhanced by overall rising global temperatures due to human-caused climate change, say scientists. This is a particularly stark reality in California, where even in early July, fire scientists noted that the state's vegetation reached near-record dryness. On Monday, the Mendocino Complex Fire became the largest blaze in state history, easily outpacing the Thomas Fire, which broke the record just this past winter. Nearly the entire Golden State experienced either record heat or temperatures ""much above average"" in July, said NOAA. However, California wasn't alone in experiencing scorching temperatures and multiple heat waves. Most of the West was abnormally warm, and in the contiguous U.S., May through July temperatures were also the warmest on record, eclipsing the previous record set in 1934. Image: noaa As climate and environmental scientists are quick to point out, individual temperature records are not too meaningful — it's the long-term trends that matter. And California's summer heat is certainly a continuation of accelerating warming trends in both the U.S. and around the globe. Heat waves and longer warming spells will certainly happen, regardless of what the climate is doing, as big blobs of warm air can settle over areas, like California or Europe, for extended periods of time. But the climate is simply warmer that it was a half century ago, giving hot temperatures an extra boost — which can mean vast swathes of land are turned to fire-ready tinder. Yet another heat wave continues this week in portions of California, like Los Angeles. As might be expected, this doesn't bode well for the already dry vegetation in the region. Southern California's Holly Fire is now actively growing near suburban neighborhoods. Relieving rains aren't expected in much of the state for months. California, like recently scorched Greece, experiences the dry, warm summers defined by the Mediterranean climate. Historically, fires happen during this time of year. But now — just like heat waves around the world — they're getting worse. And the consequences are plainly visible.","It should come as no surprise that California is burning.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption California wildfires continue to rage Thirteen more bodies have been recovered in California, bringing the death toll in the US state's deadliest wildfires to 42, officials say. The remains were found in and around the largely incinerated town of Paradise, in the north of the state. At least 228 people are missing, as the Camp Fire continues to rage. Nearly 7,200 structures have been destroyed, and another 15,500 are at risk. The fire has now surpassed the 1933 Griffith Park disaster that killed 31. In the south, the Woolsey Fire has claimed two lives as it damaged beach resorts, including Malibu. An estimated 250,000 people have been forced to flee their homes across the state. Speaking at a news conference on Monday evening, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea confirmed the number of dead, and the official number of missing. Many more people are said to be unaccounted for. How did people die? Some bodies were found in gutted cars that were overrun by the fast-moving blaze. Paradise and its surrounding area bore the brunt of the inferno, which started in nearby forest on Thursday. Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The town of Paradise has been obliterated by the blaze ""It was very scary,"" Paradise Mayor Jody Jones told CNN, recounting her family's escape from the town. ""It took a long time to get out. There was fire on both sides of the car. You could feel the heat coming in through the car,"" she said. Among the victims were also elderly residents with mobility issues or people who decided to stay despite evacuation orders. Forensic experts are stepping up their search in the ruins of Paradise, but officials warn that finding the bodies could take weeks. Two mobile army morgues are being brought in to help to identify the dead. The fire has burned more than 111,000 acres (45,000 hectares) and is nearly 25% contained, fire officials said. Media caption Fleeing through flames: ""I'm so scared right now... so terrified"" What about further south? The separate Woosley Blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. It has consumed at least 85,500 acres and destroyed at least 177 buildings, officials said. It is only 10% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is 75% contained. Luxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among the properties razed by the flames. Why are the fires so bad? Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn. But experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. The current fires are being blamed on a combination of climate change and weather conditions. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. The state's 40-million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Population density has been growing in areas that used to be sparsely inhabited And then there's climate change.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Dogs are being used to search for human remains among the devastation US President Donald Trump is heading to California to survey the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state's history. The Camp Fire in northern California has killed at least 71 people. More than 1,000 people are reported to be missing, although officials say that figure could fluctuate. Leaving for California, Mr Trump again focused on forest management as a cause of the blazes, a claim that has been disputed by experts. On top of the Camp Fire, firefighters are also tackling several other blazes, including the Woolsey Fire near Los Angeles which has claimed at least three lives. And adding to the misery, scores of people have become sick after outbreaks of the norovirus at shelters and the air quality in northern California has been rated the world's worst. Heavy rain is forecast next week that could douse the flames but also bring mudslides and floods on hillsides stripped of vegetation. What's the latest on the Camp Fire? The death toll rose to 71 on Friday after seven more bodies were found in the town of Paradise, which has been all but destroyed by the fire. Military troops are assisting forensics teams and cadaver dogs as they continue to search for human remains eight days on after the Camp Fire first broke out. Image copyright AFP Image caption The town of Paradise is in ruins Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea put the number of people unaccounted for at 1,011, a sharp leap from the 631 reported just 24 hours earlier. However, he described the list as ""dynamic"", ""The information I am providing you is raw data and we find there is the likely possibility that the list contains duplicate names,"" he said. Some of those on the list may be fine but unaware they have been reported missing, or unable to call, authorities say. The Camp Fire is now about 50% contained but fire officials say they may not have it fully under control until the end of the month. What kind of welcome will the president get? Mr Trump is due to meet survivors and firefighters involved in tacking the blaze when he touches down. Asked on Fox News if he thought climate change had contributed to the wildfires, he said ""Maybe it contributes a little bit. The big problem we have is management."" California Governor Jerry Brown, who has criticised this argument as simplistic, said he would welcome the president to the state. ""Now is a time to pull together for the people of California,"" he tweeted. Media caption California wildfires survivor's tearful account of escape with son Others suggested the president faced a difficult reception.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images The Californian town of Paradise has been devastated by the deadliest wildfire in the state's history. At least 81 people have lost their lives and hundreds more have been reported missing. As families across the US come together for Thanksgiving, Paradise's residents are beginning to assess the damage to their lives and the town they called home. When gale-force winds drove flames from the Camp Fire through dried-out scrub and trees into Paradise on 8 November, its people fled for their lives. In the space of a day, the flames had engulfed much of the town - home to 27,000. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Some of the victims died trying to get away, while others were discovered in the burned-out ruins of their homes. An estimated 13,000 homes were destroyed, with many of the town's mainly-wooden houses quickly reduced to ashes. The authorities are still working to search and identify bodies as the fire continues to burn in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas. While a forecast of heavy rains could help extinguish the flames, it could also hinder the search for the remains of victims and cause misery for those left homeless by the disaster. Thanksgiving plans As the rest of America sits down to celebrate Thanksgiving on Thursday, those left homeless by the raging Camp Fire are contemplating their futures. A number of organisations are on hand to help with the immediate crisis, providing shelter, clothes and food. And for Thanksgiving itself, meals are being donated by several non-profit organisations - the day seen as a chance to bring together those affected to start the healing process. For Kassy Parish, 19, such generosity after the trauma of the fire has been comforting. She plans to spend Thanksgiving at her mother-in-law's, but a stranger has offered her twin sister, Alli, somewhere to sleep and invited her to join his family for the annual celebratory meal. ""It's brought out so much good in a lot of people in the area,"" said Kassy. ""A lot of people have been getting together and making sure everyone is taken care of."" Image copyright Kassy Parish Image caption Kassy Rose Parish, her twin sister Alli and their family home before the fire Kassy was staying with her mom and stepfather at their home on Skyway - one of the three main routes into Paradise - when the fire spread through the town. Their house was burned down. Her six siblings also lost their homes. Before the disaster struck, the town was a popular retirement spot and, according to the latest census, about a quarter of the population was aged 65 or over. Kassy worked as a personal carer providing support for adults in the town when they were unable to live independently. She plans to stay in the town, where everyone knows everyone. ""I know it's going to take a couple of years until Paradise is rebuilt but I have lived here all my life,"" she said. Acres of land destroyed The Camp Fire scorched 152,000 acres of land along with the thousands of the homes built on it. The blaze is still only 75% contained. The fire isn't expected to be fully under control until the end of the month, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Although, there is no exact figure for the number of people left homeless, six official evacuation centres have been set up, including two in fairgrounds which had closed for the season. Some people have also taken refuge in tents or cars. Hundreds of Red Cross volunteers are helping run the emergency shelters, which slept up to 950 on one night, as well as providing meals for all evacuees. They are also dealing with a fast-spreading norovirus outbreak, which has been reported at four of them. The Red Cross is helping people search for those still missing, through their safe and well website. Sean Smith, debris coordinator for the California Office of Emergency Services told Time magazine the post-fire clean-up would be the biggest since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. One estimate puts the cost at $1.2 billion (about £900m). Along with the 13,000 homes destroyed, almost 500 businesses have also been hit. Morgan Stanley estimates insured property losses could approach $4 billion (£3.1m), while Moody's Investor Services puts the figure at $6.8bn (£5.3m). ""It's one of the worst disasters that I've seen in my career, hands down,"" Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Brock Long told a news conference. While federal funds are expected to provide about 75% of Paradise's recovery costs, the state of California will also contribute. Image copyright Justin Sullivan The money will help rebuild streets, public utilities and buildings and possibly install a new sewer system - Paradise was the largest town in California relying on septic tanks - but families without insurance may have to bear the cost of rebuilding their own homes. Kassy and her family have set up a crowdfunding page to help them get back on their feet. Others are expected to do the same. 'Survived three fires' But for Maurine Johnson, who has lived in Paradise for more than 60 years, it is too soon to contemplate the future. The 79-year-old great-great grandmother has lost her family home and her estate agency business, built up over many years with her late husband. Her two sons have also lost their homes. She has experienced blazes before, but this one was different, she said. ""We have been through two or three fires up there and never felt threatened or worried."" Maurine, who fell over and broke her nose and damaged her teeth while visiting her sister-in-law at one of the evacuation centres, described how she fled her home with just one change of clothes and her mobile phone. She admitted she still did not appreciate the gravity of her situation, but has been cheered by other people's generosity. Image copyright AFP ""I am having to wear donated clothes,"" she said. ""It's a humbling experience when you are having to take from people."" It is this spirit of giving that has led many organisations to provide 15,000 Thanksgiving meals to Camp Fire survivors at several locations, including shelters, on Thursday. Food for the Thanksgiving Together events will be provided by the non-profit World Central Kitchen and Sierra Nevada Brewing Co, while celebrity chefs will work side by side with Paradise restaurant owners to prepare the food. ""We have seen the power of food to bring communities together, especially in times of great need,"" reads a post on the World Central Kitchen website. But the question for many of those affected by the Paradise fire, is whether they will return to the town. Mayor of Paradise Jody Jones believes they will and that the town will be reborn. ""We're committed to rebuilding,"" she said. ""It's not an 'if', it's 'How long is it going to take?'"" But Maurine, who is considering winding up her estate agency business and retiring, fears many will not return. People are already moving on, she said. ""They are leaving the state - others won't be back.""

"Madison Park, CNN","(CNN) It may take until September to contain the largest fire in California history, which is now nearly the size of Los Angeles. So far, two firefighters have been injured while fighting the Mendocino Complex Fire, which consists of two fires -- the Ranch Fire and the River Fire -- in Northern California. The pair have burned 292,692 acres and was 34% contained as of Tuesday evening. The colossal fire altogether has destroyed 75 residences, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire. Cal Fire estimated that full containment could take until September 1. The Mendocino Complex Fire ignited on July 27. Last year's Thomas Fire, which is the second-largest fire in California history, took more than six months to extinguish after burning 281,893 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. Firefighters in the state are currently battling 17 large fires. Trump weighs in on wildfires This week, President Donald Trump appeared to blame California's environmental protection laws for the cataclysmic fires. Administration officials declined to offer any clarity on Trump's series of tweets. Trump claimed in his tweet that the fires were being ""made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized."" He also added that water in the state was ""being diverted into the Pacific Ocean,"" in a tweet that named California Gov. Jerry Brown. ""This does not merit a response,"" said Evan Westrup, Brown's spokesman. Environmental scientists, California water experts and local officials have disputed Trump's claims. ""It is climate change that is causing this,"" says Michael Mohler, spokesman for Cal Fire. ""There is no other way to explain explosive fuel conditions, that come with increased winds and higher temperatures."" California's multiyear drought ended last year, but it also left a lot of dried and weakened plants and trees. ""You don't recover from six years of drought overnight,"" Mohler said. California has approximately more than 100 million dead trees in the state due to drought and infestation from bark beetles. Dead trees pose a major hazard as they allow wildfires to spread rapidly in hot, dry conditions. Cal Fire's vegetation management crews are out year-round to thin and remove such trees, while also doing prescribed burns. Experts cite hotter temperatures causing lengthier fire seasons, that burn up dry, dead vegetation as factors for more wildfires. Other fires in the state continue Cal Fire reported that warm temperatures, with highs in the 90s and triple digits, are expected in most areas of the state -- which isn't good news for firefighters. But a slight cooling is in the forecast for the weekend. More than 14,000 firefighters are battling the wildfires across the state. The second biggest fire in California is the Carr Fire, located in Shasta County in the northern part of the state. The deadly fire has been burning for more than two weeks and consumed 172,055 acres, as of Tuesday evening. It has killed seven people and destroyed more than 1,100 homes. The next largest fire is the Ferguson Fire, near Yosemite National Park, with 94,992 acres. That fire which has lasted more than three week, has killed two people.

JOUMANA KHATIB and MARCUS PAYADUE,"8. Air pollution is shortening your life. Months, and sometimes years, are being shaved off life expectancy, according to a new study. Outdoor air pollution — fine particulate matter from sources like coal-fired power plants, truck tailpipes, wildfires and dust storms — reduces the worldwide average life expectancy at birth by one year, researchers found. The average Egyptian loses 1.9 years; the average Indian, 1.5 years; the average American, a little more than four months. Many of the sources of outdoor air pollution are linked to greenhouse gas emissions, suggesting that moving to cleaner sources of energy could deliver public health dividends. _____",Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day.,2018-08-22T22:13:16Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Michael Cohen, D.N.C., Tariffs: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/briefing/michael-cohen-dnc-tariffs.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/briefing/22PM-briefing-US-core-tryptch/22PM-briefing-US-slide-KQH8-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfires,0
Mark Kaufman,"Newly-born fires torched bone-dry Northern and Southern California throughout the night of November 8. One deadly blaze in particular, the Camp Fire, ripped through 70,000 acres in just 24 hours. ""It's incredible,"" Michael Gollner, a fire scientist at the University of Maryland, said of the uncontrollable Northern California wildfire. ""I dont know if I want to say unprecedented but it's getting close to that. It's incredibly rare."" ""That blows your mind,"" Brenda Belongie, lead meteorologist of the U.S. Forest Service's Predictive Services in Northern California, said in an interview. "" That impresses us in the industry."" While the Camp Fire nearly burned the entire town of Paradise to the ground, residents in heavily-populated Southern California documented their nighttime escapes from falling embers and glowing hillsides. The Woolsey and Hill fires have now burned through 14,000 acres, with thousands of residents receiving urgent nighttime evacuation messages via text. In both the north and south of the parched Golden State, the rapidly-evolving circumstances are similar: profoundly dried-out land with the arrival of persistently dry, gusty winds. ""Then all you need is a spark,"" said Belongie. Clouds of smoke seen from Hermosa Beach, California. Image: susan kaufman Although fires are complex environmental phenomena driven (and exacerbated) by weather, U.S. fires in the last couple decades have been burning at least twice as much land than in the early 1980s, and they've been burning for weeks not days longer. A warmer climate means more dry, flame-susceptible vegetation. ""These fires are going to be happening more often,"" noted Gollner. ""That blows your mind"" The California fire season should be nearing its end. Typically, by mid-October the season dies down as the first rains will make the grasses and forests less likely to burn particularly in Northern California. But not this year. ""We are still very much in fire season,"" said Belongie. ""It's just one fire after another."" The Camp Fire, barely contained as of Friday morning, is the continuation of a historic fire season in the heavily-forested northern part of the state. In July, the Carr Fire after jumping the Sacramento River grew into a towering, spinning vortex of flame. SEE ALSO: The EPA completely axed its climate change websites. But why are NASA's still live? Northern California has now seen a record number of acres burned during a fire season, Belongie said. That's around 150 percent of the previous record, she noted. The now-raging Camp Fire has exploited exceptionally dried-out forests and grasses. In some portions of Northern California, forests are now as dry as they were during the peak summer fire season, when temperatures were in the triple digits. It's now well into November, and parched forests are at their seasonal records for dryness, with some setting new records. ""This is a huge deal,"" said Belongie. For a few weeks now, California forests have been increasingly dried-out by strong, dry winds, blowing from the north and east so fire experts expected flames. And through the night, east-blowing winds blew persistent gusts through much of the state. The dry stage was set. ""Unfortunately, it's not unexpected,"" said Gollner. And Westerners can expect similar circumstances in the future. Once these large fires start, there's little that can be done to stop them even our massive fire-retardant dropping aircraft have little effect. ""The airplanes arent going to do very much once the fire grows to this enormous size,"" said Gollner. With this modern reality, society needs to prepare, emphasized Gollner. For instance, it's now imperative that flame-vulnerable communities reduce vegetation near their homes, so communities aren't met with 100-foot tall walls of flame. We can't stop the flames but we can make them manageable. ""It's not about making it a black-top all around,"" said Gollner.

Mark Kaufman,"Anthony Wexler, the director of the Air Quality Research Center at the University of California, Davis, packed his bags and drove his family out to the coast. They're escaping the smoke. Davis, California, sits amid a layer of wildfire smoke in Northern California. To the northwest, the largest fire in state history, the Mendocino Complex Fire, continues to burn. To the southeast, the Ferguson Fire has closed down smoke-choked Yosemite National Park indefinitely. And to the North, the Carr Fire, infamous for its towering fire tornado, still burns. SEE ALSO: California just had its hottest month on record, and that means more wildfires The air quality in the region around the fires — whose spread has been enhanced by extreme heat parching the land — is some of the worst in the world. ""I decided to go out to the coast for a couple days because it was so ridiculous,"" Wexler said. On Wednesday, the National Weather Service illustrated how winds have lifted bounties of smoke across the entire U.S., bringing pollution even beyond the East Coast. Smoke from the western fires is making it all the way to the East Coast and beyond (at least aloft—mostly above a mile above the surface). Here's the vertically integrated smoke (HRRR model from last night). Another map showed some smoke near the surface even in New England. pic.twitter.com/0Jl6WDAFjg — NWS San Diego (@NWSSanDiego) August 8, 2018 That said, it's not as if these smoke particles are harmful to those on the East Coast. By the time that smoke arrives in Boston and New York, the particles have been diluted with fresh air, and certainly can't be seen, nor are concentrations unhealthy. It's normal for pollution to waft from west to east across the country, just like pollution from China is regularly transported over the Pacific Ocean into the U.S. That's how air generally moves over the Northern Hemisphere, said Wexler. But it's much rarer for even low concentrations of smoke to find their way across the nation. ""It doesn’t happen every day,"" Gabriele Pfister, deputy director of the National Center of Atmospheric Research’s atmospheric chemistry lab, said in an interview. ""But, it can happen."" ""Normally, the pollution isn’t so great that it’s noticeable when it gets east,"" added Wexler. But just how bad is the air pollution in large regions of the West? ""It's been like a reasonably decent day in Beijing,"" said Wexler. ""That's really telling. It’s really awful there."" ""It’s unbelievable,"" said Pfister. She noted that planes flying over the area, as part of a National Science Foundation-funded wildfire study, have picked up some alarming pollution numbers. It's expected that particulate matter — tiny fragments of pollution 30 times thinner than a human hair — would be bad. But the flights even picked up abnormally high concentrations of carbon monoxide, an odorless gas that can be dangerous to human health in enclosed spaces, and at worse, lethal. However, some of the measured values around the fires are about 5 parts per million, or ppm, which are not considered nearly dangerous — but it's still telling. ""These are values you don’t typically find near the surface in the U.S.,"" said Pfister. ""Maybe you’ll find that if you stick your head into the exhaust of a car."" It's not carbon monoxide, however, that people in burning regions need to be concerned about. One of the main factors that's figured into air quality ratings is particulate matter. Both U.S. government and university researchers have repeatedly shown that breathing this stuff is bad for your heart, as it accelerates plaque build-up in blood vessels. In some areas of Oregon, the Air Quality Index currently registers as ""Hazardous."" In Redding, California, where a fire tornado spun for 80 minutes last week, the air quality is rated as ""Unhealthy."" But out near the windswept coast, like in San Francisco, the air quality is ""Good."" It's likely that the West will be intermittently blanketed in unhealthy to hazardous air for months ahead, as the fire season is not nearly over. Rains aren't expected for months, and more temperature and fire records might be broken. Many Westerners aren't near the fires themselves. But it's harder to outrun the smoke. ""In my experience, it's never been this bad,"" said Wexler.","Anthony Wexler, the director of the Air Quality Research Center at the University of California, Davis, packed his bags and drove his family out to the coast.

JOHN SCHWARTZ,"“Understanding the changing climate is becoming more critical by the day, as the effects of global warming mount,” he added. Climate research already protects the economy, Mr. Rosenberg said. “NOAA is continuously working to improve forecasts of extreme events, which are intensifying in a warming world. As we know from last year’s wildfires and hurricanes, these kind of forecasts are critical for protecting American lives and infrastructure.” When asked for comment, Dr. Gallaudet said in a statement that the presentation was “a simplified draft for discussion.” “It was not intended to create change in NOAA mission or policy from what it was before,” he said. “Any interpretation to the contrary is simply inaccurate.” Another NOAA scientist said that he doubted the statements would lead to broad change. “This is really not a big change in the core mission,” said the scientist, who asked that his name not be used because he was not authorized to comment. “It’s all in how you interpret the slides.

George Dvorsky,"In what’s already been a particularly cruel wildfire season for California, a series of fast-moving blazes have torched more than 65,000 acres since Monday, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing thousands to flee. Alarmingly, winds are expected to pick up in the coming days, making a bad situation potentially worse. The latest California wildfire started in early Monday evening in the foothills near Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula, spreading quickly to more than 15 square miles in just a few hours. The fires, fueled by strong Santa Ana winds and dry conditions, are devouring vegetation that hasn’t burned in decades, according to fire officials. To date, around 10,000 people have had to flee their homes. It’s a destructive and dangerous climax to what has been a devastating wildfire season in the state. As of late yesterday, the blaze had burned over 100 square miles in areas just north of Los Angeles and east of Santa Barbara. Currently, there are five active major blazes. Some 150 structures have burned down, including the 82-bed Vista del Mar Hospital in northwestern Ventura. Officials say the number of homes damaged by the wildfires is likely much higher. The wildfire is also causing mass power outages and water disruptions. Around 43,000 homes are currently without power (with more expected), and the Casitas Municipal Water District has advised residents of the city of Ventura, Upper Ojai Valley, Casitas Springs, and Foster Park to boil their tap water for about a minute before drinking and cooking. Without power, some water pumping systems and fire hydrants are inoperable, complicating matters for fire crews. The largest of the five wildfires, the Thomas Fire, has reached and skipped across the 101 freeway just north of Ventura, burning through oil fields, and reaching the Pacific Ocean. This fire is moving extremely quickly, torching an acre per second. As of Tuesday, the Thomas Fire has spanned 50,000 acres, and is listed as “zero percent contained” by fire officials. No fatalities have been reported to date, but three firefighters in LA were hurt and taken to a hospital where they’re listed in stable condition. “This is life in Southern California. This is where we live,” Mark Gennaro, who’s home of 12 years was destroyed, told The Washington Post. “I stand on that back hill and I see all that brush and I’m like, ‘Something’s gonna happen at some point.’” About 150,000 people in LA have been affected by evacuation orders for the Creek Fire near Sylmar and Lake View Terrace. Curfews have been enacted in the city of Ventura from 10:00 pm to 5:00 am. In Ventura, more than a quarter of its 100,000 residents have been told to evacuate. And it’s not over yet. After a brief respite late yesterday, the Santa Ana winds are expected to pick up today and tomorrow, gusting as fast as 35 to 50 mph, according to National Weather Service. This will likely fuel the fires even further, and possibly start new fires as it blows embers and ash elsewhere. The dry Santa Ana winds are caused by high pressure in the Great Basin and lower pressure off the coast. In the previous two years, rains have arrived prior to this stage in the wildfire season, but the region hasn’t seen any rain in the past three months. California Gov. Jerry Brown has declared state of emergency for Ventura County, and LA Mayor Eric Garcetti said “We expect to be out here all week fighting and containing this fire,” Some 1,100 personnel are currently battling the wildfires. “We’ve been watching all these disasters on TV, you really don’t think about when it happens to you, and what do you pack in that moment?,” said Ventura resident Samantha Wells-Zuniga on KABC news. “Now, everything that I have, except for my lovely family, is gone.” Beginning Monday night, dry conditions combined with the most intense Santa Ana wind event of the… Read more Read [ CNN, LA Times, Washington Post ]","In what’s already been a particularly cruel wildfire season for California, a series of fast-moving blazes have torched more than 65,000 acres since Monday, destroying hundreds of homes and forcing thousands to flee.

,"At a Glance Wildfires near Athens, Greece, have claimed the lives of at least 79 people. This fire season has become is the deadliest in decades. More than 170 others have been hospitalized with burns and other injuries. A state of emergency has been declared in the eastern and western parts of greater Athens. The death toll from two big wildfires raging on the outskirts of Athens, Greece, has risen to at least 79, making this fire season the deadliest in decades, a spokesman for the Greek government says. Authorities reportedly found 26 bodies believed to be groups of family members or friends huddled together, some of them hugging. Fire authorities said Tuesday that at least 156 adults and 16 children have been hospitalized with injuries. Many are in serious condition. “There was a great panic because the whole street was blocked by cars,” said Theodoros Christopoulos. “Shouting, hysteria, they could see the fire was coming with the wind. It already smelled a lot, the sky was black overhead and in no time at all the fire was here.” Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras declared three days of national mourning Tuesday for those killed by the wildfires. “Today Greece is mourning, and in memory of those who were lost, we are declaring a three-day period of mourning,” Tsipras said. “But we mustn’t let mourning overwhelm us, because these hours are hours of battle, unity, courage and above all solidarity.” The two largest wildfires — one 20 miles northeast of Athens near Rafina, the other 30 miles west of the capital in Kineta — broke out Monday during hot, dry summer conditions. Fanned by gale-force winds that frequently changed direction, the flames spread rapidly into populated seaside towns — too fast for many who were in their cars or homes to flee, fire department spokeswoman Stavroula Malliri said. ""The police tried to direct us away from the fire, but we couldn't escape it,"" said Aleka Papariga, a former Greek Communist Party leader who lives near Rafina. ""We got stuck in traffic and the flames were on top of us. We managed to find a small gap and we made it out."" Many tourists and residents fled toward the coastline to escape the ferocious flames and choking smoke. Authorities evacuated more than 700 people by sea overnight, said Merchant Marine deputy minister Nektarios Santorinios, whose ministry is in charge of the coast guard. Nikos Stavrinidis, his wife and two of their friends were rescued after escaping one of the fires by jumping into the sea near Ravina. They spent two hours being pulled by the strong current before they were rescued. ""It happened very fast. The fire was in the distance, then sparks from the fire reached us. Then the fire was all around us,"" he said. ""The wind was indescribable — it was incredible. I've never seen anything like this before in my life."" Others did not fare as well. Stavrinidis said they watched as a woman and her son disappeared into the waves. ""It is terrible to see the person next to you drowning and not be able to help him. You can't,"" Stavrinidis said, his voice breaking. ""That will stay with me."" Fire Service spokeswoman Stavroula Malliri said three hospitals in greater Athens have been placed on alert to receive more casualties if needed. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras cut short a visit to Bosnia on Monday and returned to Athens to preside over an emergency response meeting with fire chiefs and government officials. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is offering her country's help to fight the fires. In a message of condolence sent to Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras on Tuesday, Merkel said that ""in these difficult hours Germany stands firmly by the side of our Greek friends."" She added: ""You can be sure of our willingness to provide support in coping with the fire disaster."" (MORE: Vietnam Floods, Mudslides from Tropical Storm Son Tinh Turn Deadly ) Greece's coast guard says a search-and-rescue operation is underway for 10 people, believed to be foreign tourists, who fled a massive forest fire in a boat and were missing. A coast guard helicopter and vessel were searching the sea near the town of Rafina, northeast of the Greek capital of Athens. They acted after receiving notification from Danish authorities, who had received a call from someone in Greece saying they were among a group of 10 people who fled a forest fire in a boat. The coast guard said it was unclear what type of vessel the 10 people were in. In all, 47 brush and forest fires broke out across Greece Monday and early Tuesday, with most of them quickly extinguished, the fire department said. Ten were still burning late Tuesday morning, including blazes in Corinth, Crete, and in central and northern Greece. According to EM-DAT, the international disaster database, the deadliest and most expensive wildfire in Greece since 1983 occurred in August 2007 in the southern Peloponnese peninsula.

EditorDavid,"Within hours of the attack, the government of embattled President Nicolas Maduro began accusing the U.S. of a cyberattack. Maduro has stuck to that narrative, saying hackers in the U.S. first shut down the Guri Dam and then delivered several ""electromagnetic"" blows. Engineers have questioned that assertion, contending that the Guri Dam's operating system is on a closed network with no internet connection. Several consulted by The Associated Press speculated that a more likely cause was a fire along one of the electrical grid's powerful 765-kilovolt lines that connect the dam to much of Venezuela. The transmission lines traverse through some of Venezuela's most remote and difficult to access regions on their way toward Caracas, making it difficult to obtain any first-hand information that could back up or pinpoint the location of a fire. Working with an expert at Texas Tech University's Geospatial Technologies Laboratory, Jose Aguilar, an expert on Venezuela's electrical grid, said satellite data indicates that on the day of the blackout there were three fires in close proximity to the 765-kilovolt lines transmitting power generated from the Guri Dam, which provides about 80 percent of Venezuela's electricity...

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Paradise resident Sorrell Bobrink describes 'apocalyptic' scenes California's latest catastrophic wildfire, the Camp Fire, was impossible to outrun when it first began burning. Officials say winds caused the blaze to burn through 80 miles (128km) of Northern California's hillside in just one hour. So how can you escape such a blaze, and why is the western US state so susceptible to these deadly fires? What's the best way to escape a wildfire? Once evacuation orders are issued by local law enforcement, residents generally have hours to leave, Kathleen Schori, information officer for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) told the BBC. ""But in those initial stages of a fire, you may have minutes,"" she added. Fleeing in a vehicle is ideal as most wildfires cannot be outrun. But the Camp Fire's especially rapid spread, fuelled by high winds, made the situation even more dangerous. ""This fire moved so fast - I don't think anybody did anything wrong,"" Ms Schori says when asked whether those forced to abandon vehicles and escape on foot could have acted differently. ""During the initial phases, it was burning 80 miles in an hour."" She stressed the importance of following evacuation orders immediately, especially with fast-moving blazes. ""If you don't evacuate and it becomes a rescue situation, then our firefighters are taken away from the firefight and moved to the rescue."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Environmental conditions in California in recent years have made wildfires deadlier How do you fight a wildfire? Sometimes, you do fight fire with fire. In addition to old-fashioned water and flame retardant (delivered from ground-level and above the flames by aircraft), sometimes firefighters have to burn more to quell the flames. Intentionally burning areas around a wildfire can help starve the blaze and control its direction. Clearing out brush and flammable material from an area to create ""firebreaks"" is another way to achieve the same. ""Ninety-eight percent of fires are small and/or suppressed quickly,"" Prof David Peterson of the University of Washington, a former senior researcher with the US Forest Service told the BBC. ""The other 2% are very challenging when they get large, and are almost impossible to put out, at least until it rains."" Ms Schori of Cal Fire said that with wind-driven blazes like the Camp Fire, officials often have no choice but to wait for conditions to improve. ""There are never enough firefighters to combat a fire that's moving as fast as this was moving,"" she says. ""You have to deploy your resources on each side [of the fire] and continue to construct lines. And when that wind stops, then you can safely get in front it."" H ow do wildfires start? Officials define wildfires, or wildland fires, as any fire occurring on undeveloped land. Forest fires are uncontrolled wildfires burning in lands covered at least in part by timber or flammable vegetation. In nature, two things can spark wildfires: lava and lightning. According to the National Park Service, 90% of wildfires in the US are caused by humans - whether by unattended campfires, burning debris, cigarettes, or arson. About 2% of California's 2,816 wildfires in 2016 were caused by lightning, according to data from Cal Fire. The majority could be attributed to humans, though only 8% were caused by arson. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cal Fire firefighters have been fighting the Camp Fire for days Why are California fires so devastating? According to Prof Peterson, fires in the region have not necessarily increased in frequency in the last 100 years - but the area affected has. ""The area burned annually has been higher during the past 30 years or so,"" he told the BBC. ""It should be noted that 2% of fires burn 98% of the area."" In California, recent years have seen a combination of extremely high temperatures, strong winds, a long drought, and population growth causing lethal, fast-moving blazes. Last year, the state had over 9,500 wildfires that burned over a million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, and had the highest number of homes and buildings lost in one state. And straying away from natural burning cycles has also contributed to the lethality of recent fires, Prof Peterson says. Keeping fires from starting in Western forests has caused fuel to accumulate ""far beyond"" historical levels. ""Therefore, when fires occur they can burn hotter,"" he says. ""These high-intensity fires can cause rapid and in some cases long-term changes in vegetation, making it more difficult for the ecosystem to recover."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Many Californians have had to abandon vehicles and escape the flames on foot What about climate change? Prof Peterson says there is no hard evidence that climate change has affected US wildfires - yet. ""We expect that there will be significant effects in future decades as the climate continues to warm,"" he told the BBC. A warming climate, Prof Peterson explained, would increase the duration of the fire season, and more droughts would in turn create more wildfire fuel. Globally, the length of the wildfire season has already increased by nearly 19% between 1978 and 2013. ""By around 2050, fires may burn two to three times more area than they have historically."" How do homeowners pay for the damage? According to 2017 data from Verisk Analytics, 4.5 million US homes were in areas of high or extreme wildfire risk - and over 2 million of those homes were in California. Damage caused by wildfires has cost $5.1bn in the last decade, Verisk found. In California, homeowners who do not qualify for private insurance coverage can opt into a statewide pool, called the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plan. FAIR is comprised of all property and casualty insurers in California and is not run by a state agency.",Fires have claimed dozens of lives in California.

Tom McKay,"Southern California’s Thomas fire is now officially the largest in modern state history, Cal Fire announced late Friday night, after surpassing the 273,000-plus acre Cedar fire from 2003. Per CNN, Cal Fire says the blaze has now burned through some 1,063 buildings and is just 65 percent contained weeks after starting on December 4th. It also said it expects fire crews to be working on the blaze 24/7 until at least January 7th. The fire began in Ventura County and spread to neighboring Santa Barbara County, fueled by flame-optimal winds and plenty of dry brush to burn. As the L.A. Times reported, the official list of wildfires only dates back to 1932 because prior records are less reliable. One contender for the all-time spot remains the 1889 Santiago Canyon fire, which reputedly scorched some 300,000 acres (and some research supports those accounts ). Large stretches of southern California now lie in ruins. In some cases, the fire spread so fast that terrified residents were forced to evacuate without their possessions in the dead of night as smoke surrounded their homes. “I feel like I’m spinning,” local resident Jeff Jacobson, whose house was mostly burned, told the L.A. Times. “I’m overwhelmed and stressed, which is hard because I need to be clear-minded.” According to officials, this is the worst season for wildfires in memory. Wildfires have ravaged vast parts of the state this year, with blazes burning from southern California all the way up to wine-growing regions hundreds of miles to the north. The frequency of massive fires in the state has dramatically increased in the last few decades, due to both accidental blazes started by humans and trends linked to climate change like extreme droughts. “We think that this fire, the Thomas fire, is likely very large in part not just because the Santa Ana wind event is long, but there was this very extreme drought between 2012 and 2014,” UCLA and U.S. Geological Survey research ecologist Jon Keeley told the Times. “What extreme droughts do is they cause dieback of the vegetation,” he added. “Basically a canopy of the vegetation dies and oftentimes the entire plant dies. So you have lots of dead vegetation out on the landscape from the drought. And when the Santa Ana winds blow embers ahead of the fire front, they’ll ignite spot fires, but only if they land on dead vegetation.” Fire officials said that the blaze is contained enough that any further spread will be the result of deliberate actions by firefighters, not uncontrolled expansion. “The main fire itself will not have any growth,” the California City Fire Department’s Captain Brandon Vaccaro told the Times. “Any growth that we see or is reflected in the acreage will be based on the control burns.” [ CNN ]","Southern California’s Thomas fire is now officially the largest in modern state history, Cal Fire announced late Friday night, after surpassing the 273,000-plus acre Cedar fire from 2003.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","Smoke from the wildfires that have devastated California for weeks has stretched some 3,000 miles to East Coast cities. The Weather Channel reported this week that the haze was expected to linger through Wednesday before an arctic chill descends on the Northeast over the Thanksgiving holiday. While pictures shared on social media captured a colorful hazy sunset, reports confirmed that smoke over cities like New York City and DC had traveled from the west. Meteorologist Gary Szatkowski shared a forecast map from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association on Twitter on Monday that captured the smoke plume moving across the United States. Others confirmed the observation, with NBC News meteorologist Kathryn Prociv on Monday tweeting : Wow. I knew tonights sunset over New York City seemed different, and I shouldve realized! Wildfire smoke is in the air, all the way from California. Reports of intensified sunsets following wildfires are common. The Washington Post noted that this phenomenon results from the way light interacts with smoke particles in the upper atmosphere. Smoke is made up of tiny particles from wildfires, which can provide more points for light to bounce off and scatter. This leads to the enhancement of the red and orange hues you see. A deck of clouds near the horizon also has this effect, allowing the suns rays to reflect off the clouds and to our eyes. California now has some of the most toxic air on the planet as the result of the wildfires, and thousands have been left homeless because of their destruction. At least 83 people are dead in the Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive fire in Californias history. The Camp Fire had burned more than 153,000 acres and 13,000 homes as of Wednesday evening, with nearly 5,000 other structures lost in the blaze.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Shares in California power company PG&amp;E fell sharply for a second day on Tuesday as investors took fright at the prospect of bankruptcy proceedings to protect from $30 billion in potential liabilities related to wildfires in 2017 and 2018. 
The state’s biggest private utility’s shares have lost 75 percent of their stock value since the start of January, when the company first began exploring options for protection from claims its equipment was responsible for the fires. 
Shares lost 52 percent of their value on Monday after the company said it was preparing to file for Chapter 11 protection, and they were down another 28 percent in morning trade in New York. 
California politicians are in a quandary over whether to offer a bailout or risk allowing the state’s largest private utility to fail. 
Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, told reporters late on Monday his team was discussing the possibility of helping PG&amp;E stay solvent, but no decisions had been made. 
PG&amp;E said on Tuesday that Rothschild Inc banker Roger Kimmel had resigned from the company’s board, adding only that the resignation did not involve any disagreement on any matter relating to its operations. 
Rothschild did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment, while PG&amp;E declined to comment. 
PG&amp;E, which provides electricity and natural gas to 16 million customers in northern and central California, faces widespread litigation, government investigations and liabilities that could potentially exceed $30 billion due to the fires. 
Its chances of emerging from bankruptcy proceedings hinge in part on an arcane California legal rule that threatens to keep it perpetually on the hook for liabilities from catastrophic wildfires. 
The doctrine, known as “inverse condemnation,” exposes utilities in the state to liabilities from wildfires regardless of their negligence, as long as their equipment is involved. 
That legal rule could keep PG&amp;E exposed to additional liabilities from future fires and leave the company stuck in bankruptcy limbo, according to restructuring experts and people familiar with the matter. 
Still, analysts from Chicago-based brokerage Morningstar, said in a note to clients that this was one of the rare cases where shares could emerge from the process with some value. 
“The most likely near-term scenario is a fourth-quarter 2018 accounting charge that cuts PG&amp;E’s book equity well below its allowed regulatory capital structure,” they said. 
“Our new fair value estimate for PG&amp;E is $11 per share after considering possible bankruptcy scenarios.” 
It was trading at around $6 half an hour after opening on Wall Street.

Saqib Shah,"Although, it's difficult to chalk 2017 up as anything other than a lousy year, we can find some solace in the well-meaning ""how"" queries sent Google's way. Aside from an increase in political mobilization (as evidenced in the popularity of ""how to make a protest sign?""), we were asking ""how to help?"" more than ever. Spurred by natural disasters (like the California wildfires), people also looked for ways to help out within local communities by asking how to become firefighters, paramedics, social workers, and activists. ""In these moments and others, our collective humanity shined,"" remarked Google.

Richard Gonzales,"Flames burn near power lines in Montecito, Calif. State fire officials say power lines coming into contact with trees sparked four Northern California wildfires last October.
Mike Eliason/AP
A federal judge in California dealt utility giant PG&amp;E another setback Wednesday by proposing to restrict the beleaguered company from using unsafe power lines during the 2019 California fire season.
U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco, who is overseeing the utility after a 2010 gas pipeline explosion, said the company should be required to ""remove or trim all trees that could fall onto its power lines"" and reinspect its grid.
The utility has two weeks to respond as Judge Alsup set a new hearing for Jan. 30.
PG&amp;E's power lines are widely believed to have caused the massive fires in northern and southern California that killed 86 people and destroyed 18,500 structures in 2018.
In June, state fire officials blamed PG&amp;E power lines for sparking several northern California wildfires in 2017.
Last week NPR's Eric Westervelt reported that PG&amp;E is considering selling off a major part of the company in the face of staggering liability costs for its potential culpability in the wildfires of 2017 and 2018.
""Internally, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric has dubbed this strategy ""Project Falcon."" Under the plan, the company would sell its natural gas division this spring. After years of deadly errors and safety violations, the utility giant is looking for ways to cover liability costs and avoid bankruptcy, a senior company official and a former employee with knowledge of the plan tell NPR.
""All net proceeds from the sale of PG&amp;E's gas division would be used to set up a fund to pay billions of dollars in potential claims from wildfires, the sources said. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
""The company also is exploring selling key real estate assets, including its San Francisco headquarters, and moving its operations elsewhere in the Bay Area, the sources say.""
On Tuesday, Westervelt reported that a key ratings agency slashed the California utility giant's credit rating to ""junk"" status.
""S&amp;P Global Ratings stripped PG&amp;E of its investment-grade rating significant deterioration in the company's political and regulatory environment,"" Westervelt reported.
The company also announced the retirement of three executives in the utility's electric division.
A spokesman for PG&amp;E, James Noonan said safety is the company's ""most important responsibility.""
""We are aware of Judge Alsup's orders and are currently reviewing,"" Noonan added. ""We are committed to complying with all rules and regulations that apply to our work, while working together with our state and community partners and across all sectors and disciplines to develop comprehensive, long-term safety solutions for the future.""",PG&amp;E is under fire from many fronts as it faces the possibility of being found responsible for massive California wildfires the past two years.,2019-01-10T01:58:42Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Federal Judge Proposes Restrictions On Unsafe PG&E Power Lines,https://www.npr.org/2019/01/09/683815660/federal-judge-proposes-restrictions-on-unsafe-pg-e-power-lines,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/01/09/ap_18146054495537_wide-c1672ddf4ab30259d4aa76c0af7fb2312524b4fe.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,wildfires,0
Ben Gruber and Mike Blake,"FARIA BEACH/LILAC, Calif. (Reuters) - Firefighters battled several intense wind-driven wildfires early on Friday that have swept across densely populated Southern California, destroying at least 500 structures and chasing 190,000 people from their homes over the past five days. A firefighter is working on extinguishing the Lilac Fire, a fast moving wildfire in Bonsall, California, U.S., December 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake More than 5,700 firefighters from across California and the region worked to stop the spread of six large wildfires and other smaller blazes that erupted since Monday, ranging from Los Angeles up the Pacific coast to Santa Barbara County and stoked by fierce westward Santa Ana winds. [nL1N1O7081] Firefighters and helicopters sprayed and dumped bucketloads of water and fire retardant on flames against a hellish backdrop of flaming mountains and walls of smoke as the blaze hopscotched over highways and railroad tracks and torched rows of houses. The raging fires have forced the evacuation of about 190,000 people and threatened 23,000 homes as of late on Thursday, CAL FIRE said on Twitter. The Los Angeles Unified School District, the country’s second largest with more than 640,000 students, said it closed more than a quarter of its nearly 1,100 schools for the second day in a row on Friday. The University of California Santa Barbara canceled Friday classes as well. The Thomas Fire northwest of Los Angeles grew to 115,000 acres (46,540 hectares) from 96,000 acres (38,850 hectares) and destroyed 439 structures, officials said. More than 2,600 firefighters from as far away as Portland, Oregon, and Nevada were battling the blaze, which was 5-percent contained. North of San Diego, another blaze called the Lilac Fire grew from 10 acres to 4,100 acres (1,659 hectares) in just a few hours on Thursday, CAL FIRE said, prompting Governor Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency for San Diego County. The blaze destroyed 20 structures and prompted evacuations and road closures. Propane tanks under several houses exploded from the heat, sounding like bombs, according to a Reuters photographer at the scene. Three people sustained burn injuries and another suffered from smoke inhalation in the Lilac Fire. Two firefighters were also injured, CAL FIRE said on Twitter early on Friday. The other fires, which broke out on Monday and Tuesday, have reached into the wealthy enclave of Bel-Air on the west side of Los Angeles. Some major highways in the densely populated area were intermittently closed. In the seaside enclave of Faria Beach, caught between burning mountains and the Pacific Ocean northwest of Ventura, fires spread down the smoking hills. Flames jumped the heavily used U.S. 101 highway and headed toward clusters of beach houses. Firefighters lined up along a railroad track, the last barrier from the flames. Heavy smoke made breathing hazardous in some areas, and residents were urged to stay inside. Ventura County authorities said air pollution measures in the Ojai Valley were “off the charts.” The Los Angeles Police Department tweeted, “LAPD Working to Save Every Californian, Pets Included” along with a photo of a police officer in a respirator rescuing a cat. The Los Angeles County animal shelter said it was hosting 184 pets including llamas, donkeys and horses while reports said 29 horses were burned to death on Tuesday at a ranch in the Sylmar neighborhood of Los Angeles. The Skirball Fire in Los Angeles has forced hundreds of residents in the wooded hills near the Bel-Air neighborhood to evacuate and charred more than 475 acres (192 hectares). Skirball threatened media magnate Rupert Murdoch’s Moraga Estate winery. The property was evacuated, with possible damage to some buildings, Murdoch said in a statement, but “We believe the winery and house are still intact.” Utilities cut power to customers in some mountain communities northeast of San Diego and east of Los Angeles to lessen fire danger. The outage could last several days. The fires are the second outbreak to ravage parts of California this autumn. The celebrated wine country in the northern part of the state was hit by wind-driven wildfires in October that killed at least 43 people, forced some 10,000 to flee their homes and consumed at least 245,000 acres (9,900 hectares) north of the San Francisco Bay area. The California Department of Insurance said the northern California blazes caused insured losses of more than $9 billion.

"Marie Hattar, Elizabeth Geary","gece33/Getty Images When fire swept through Santa Rosa, Calif., last month, destroying 4,658 homes, 94 commercial buildings, and displacing tens of thousands of people, Keysight Technologies was in the direct path of the disaster. Most people might think of Sonoma County for its wine, but Keysight is the largest employer in Sonoma County and has had a strong presence in the area since 1972. The Tubbs fire broke out at 10 p.m. in the hills above Santa Rosa and by 1:30 a.m. the flames were ferocious. Our headquarters was in the center of the mandatory evacuation zone, and many employees who lived nearby were ordered to evacuate. It was evident that we faced a crisis of a magnitude we hadn’t prepared for. Though our CEO, Ron Nersesian, and his chief of staff were in Germany presenting at a customer forum, our executive team leapt into action in the middle of the night, rushing to evacuate people, assess impact to our headquarters, and safeguard the 1,300 employees and families who work and live there. The next 13 hours were a blur of on-the-spot decision making and crisis triage. The team set up a command center a safe distance away from the fires, implemented an aggressive phone calling effort to locate every employee known to be in the area and made critical decisions on employee aid and compensation. The crisis had repercussions that extended well beyond company walls to our community, worldwide employees, customers, competitors, and numerous others. It tested our crisis management and leadership skills beyond what we could have foreseen or prepared for, demonstrating that in a large-scale crisis, it’s how you react to its real-time situations that determines the speed at which you can begin to rebuild. In the end, we ended up managing three crises: employees, customers, and competitors. Here’s how we did it. The First Crisis: Employees It became clear in the first 24 hours that many employees would lose their homes. As a leadership team, we wrestled with the company’s responsibility to its employees in the wake of a natural disaster. We had to remember these were people’s homes, families, and friends affected. CEO Nersesian’s messages to employees emphasized people first, response and resources second. But these conversations were not easy. Nothing brought the people vs. profit tradeoff to the surface more than the heated debate between company officers determining not if, but how much, aid to provide. On the financial side, we had no idea how many homes were destroyed and offering $10,000 per employee who lost their homes could quickly add up to millions. In addition, offering $5,000 per displaced employee could potentially extend to 1,300 people. The team knew the costs could be enormous and needed to weigh that against our desire to do right by loyal employees that were impacted by a once in a lifetime event. In the end, we offered an aid package of $10,000 to people who lost homes and $1,000 to displaced employees under the premise that the company’s strength and innovation rests on the long-term tenure of its people, offsetting short-term financial impact. But we needed to meet immediate needs, too. We set up a makeshift relief center to provide phone chargers, underwear, bottled water, and other basics. It was also a gathering place for employees to connect, help, get support, and receive counseling. Once relief assistance was set up, we were flooded with calls from employees requesting aid and unable to get to the relief center. Long wait times and voice mail became major obstacles to receiving desperately needed help. With no bandwidth left, the crisis team reached out one of our R&amp;D directors who researched and set up an external call center within 2 hours. The crisis, however, proved too big for the crisis team to handle themselves. With unreliable cell and internet coverage, the company engaged employees outside Santa Rosa to organize phone trees and deploy multiple forms of communications to reach impacted colleagues. Employees around the world, eager to help, rallied quickly offering aid. A software team in Atlanta got an SMS text solution working within hours as well as a public website for matching requests with aid. The social media team in Colorado used its channels to help employees keep track of one another. Another team set up a charitable fund. Critical to the effort was our ability to use these extended teams across the company to solve problems that could be addressed remotely. The Second Crisis: Customers Keysight customers are innovators who win or lose in the market based on being first and best. Their timelines don’t leave room for crises. And while most Keysight manufacturing is done outside headquarters, the site does house some high-end inventory and customers were naturally worried about impacts on their own operations. This was especially true of customers engaging in the 5G new radio (NR) pre-standard testing, the set of requirements for next-generation mobile networks that promise to deliver breakthrough performance and functionality to meet the growing demands of mobile data and applications. Keysight’s customers were concerned about the availability of products, especially since the initial phase of the 5G standard is expected to be ratified in December. Senior leaders from Keysight’s industry solutions teams personally visited those customers to reassure them that their product delivery would not be impacted or delayed. In one case pertaining to 100G production, the Keysight team worked to bridge possible delivery interruptions with loaners sourced from within Keysight as well as from channel partner inventories. This, combined with daily updates on our production ramp schedule enabled this customer to stay on plan with their own commitments. In other cases, the company deployed targeted communications to global sales arming them with drawer statements and Q&amp;As, assessed specific impacted orders and initiated customer outreach. Manufacturing facilities outside Santa Rosa drew from safety stock to maintain continuity. The mitigation actions had to be swift, ongoing, and tuned to each customer’s specific needs. The Third Crisis: Competitors In the midst of dealing with the local crisis, the repercussions turned global. While we went into the crisis believing we could isolate it from the rest of the company, it became clear customer-facing functions had to be prepared to stay on alert for unexpected and predatory side-effects of the crisis. Even while the fire was still burning, we got word from customers that some competitors were spreading rumors and uncertainty about Keysight’s ability to ship products. The competitors were offering to fill product gaps to purportedly de-risk customers’ production plans. They told our customers that Keysight would not be able to deliver on commitments Though we were already in touch with our customers, we realized we had to take both offensive and defensive action; we asked Keysight account managers to re-connect with customers and reassure them about product delivery, and Nersesian reached out to those competitors’ CEOs. When the CEOs denied these activities, despite confirmation from a customer that indeed it was a competitor’s high-level leader spreading this uncertainty, Nersesian told them that this predatory practice needed to stop or we would go public with their practices. As we move into this next phase, we’re figuring out day by day what that rebuilding looks like. It’s new homes for employees, new lives as children enroll in different schools, community gatherings to get stronger together. Now, as the wildfires are no longer the immediate threat, decisions can be more thoughtfully considered based on the longer term needs of our people, our business, and our community. Restarting critical operations is a source of stability for all of them; delaying optional ones gives us the breathing room we need to find our new normal.",Sonoma County’s largest employer faced three crises at once.,2017-11-29T15:03:35Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Hbr.org'}",What Happened When the California Wildfires Engulfed Our Headquarters,https://hbr.org/2017/11/what-happened-when-the-california-wildfires-engulfed-our-headquarters,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2017/11/nov17-29-496800078-gece33.jpg,,Hbr.org,wildfires,0
Aditya Shah,"Whenever I get a chance, I pick up my camera and spend hours capturing the immaculate beauty of Big Basin Redwood State Park. It’s been my favorite pastime for years. Giant sequoias, which are the world’s largest single trees and largest living thing by volume, always help me understand our connection with something bigger than ourselves. Last year, those towering trees were being turned into ashes by wildfires. 2017 was California’s most destructive wildfire season on record, with more than 9,000 fires burning approximately 2,200 square miles of forest. Watching the destruction of centuries-old trees, I challenged myself to find a solution to stop this colossal loss. When I was 15 years old, I had started a nonprofit organization, Raindrop US, to help raise awareness about the California drought. I also created the “Green Society” at my school, Monta Vista High School, to increase awareness about global warming. It was in meetings of this society last April that I began to partner with Sanjana Shah, a friend and fellow student, to create a permanent solution to wildfire prevention. Sanjana shares my passion for environmental issues and has received multiple national and international awards in the environment space, including the U.S. Presidential Award in 2016. We decided to develop a device that could identify and predict areas in a forest that are susceptible to wildfires, providing an early warning to fire departments. Available tools measure most of the factors responsible for wildfires like wind speed, wind direction, humidity, temperature. However, biomass, which is created by years of falling branches and trees, is challenging to estimate and measure. Using TensorFlow, Google’s open source machine learning tool, we can analyze images of biomass and estimating their moisture content and size to determine the amount of dead fuel.","Whenever I get a chance, I pick up my camera and spend hours capturing the immaculate beauty of Big Basin Redwood State Park.

Associated Press,"SEATTLE – Poor air quality will be common across parts of the Pacific Northwest this week as winds push smoke from surrounding wildfires into the region, forecasters and regulators said. Air quality alerts are in effect for much of Washington state through Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. Smoky, hazy conditions are making a return to the Puget Sound region because of wildfires in British Columbia and the Cascade Mountains, according to the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency. Smoke could worsen into unhealthy levels by Monday, the agency said. An air quality alert is also in place across eastern Washington and north Idaho. Smoke from fires in British Columbia drifting into Washington and Idaho will cause unhealthy air levels through Tuesday, the weather service said. On Sunday afternoon, several monitors in north-central Washington state showed air quality at hazardous levels. Two women's college soccer matches scheduled at Gonzaga University in Spokane and Eastern Washington University in Cheney were canceled Sunday because of the poor air quality, university officials said. Air pollution can be a particular concern to sensitive groups such as the elderly, children and those with respiratory conditions. But high levels of pollution can affect everyone. Environmental regulators also issued a pollution advisory for southwest Washington, Portland and much of the Willamette Valley. The air quality level is expected to reach into unhealthy for sensitive groups. Conditions are expected to get worse Sunday night and last through Wednesday. An air pollution advisory for southern Oregon remains in effect until further notice.","Fox News Smoky skies, poor air from wildfires return to Northwest Fox News SEATTLE – Poor air quality will be common across parts of the Pacific Northwest this week as winds push smoke from surrounding wildfires into the region, forecasters and regulators sai…",2018-08-20T03:41:04Z,"{'id': 'fox-news', 'name': 'Fox News'}","Smoky skies, poor air from wildfires return to Northwest - Fox News",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/19/smoky-skies-poor-air-from-wildfires-return-to-northwest.html,http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2018/08/19/smoky-skies-poor-air-from-wildfires-return-to-northwest/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.png/0/0/1534736250202.png?ve=1,fox-news,Fox News,wildfires,0
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright NASA/EPA Image caption Satellite imagery shows the vast Thomas Fire, north of Los Angeles, which has spread as far as the Pacific coast A deadly wildfire which has destroyed more than 700 homes in California is now the largest blaze in the state's recorded history. The Thomas fire has burned more than 1000sq km - an area greater than New York City, Brussels and Paris combined. The blaze broke out in Santa Paula in early December and has moved west towards the coast, one of several major fires in California in recent months. Thousands of firefighters have been deployed to bring it under control. Most of California's largest wildfires have been recorded this century. Scientists say the warming climate and spread of buildings into wilderness areas have contributed. The Thomas fire slowly eclipsed previous record-setting blazes, finally overtaking the 2003 Cedar fire in San Diego County, which burned 273,246 acres. It follows a series of deadly fires in the state's wine country in October that burned more than 10,000 homes and killed more than 40 people. The Thomas fire has destroyed more than 1,000 buildings and claimed the life of one firefighter - Cory Iverson, a father of one from San Diego whose wife was expecting another child. The blaze is now moving slower because of rain and less wind. Image copyright MARK RALSTON Image caption Development has encroached into wilderness, contributing to the wildfires State fire agency Cal Fire says the Thomas blaze is now 65% contained and expected to continue to slow. Controlled burns by firefighters may cause some temporary expansion, it said. Seven of California's 10 largest fires on record have occurred since 2000. Two were in the 1970s and the earliest was in 1932 - the Matilija fire which, like the Thomas fire, burned through Ventura County.","The Thomas fire has now burned an area greater than New York City, Brussels and Paris combined.",2017-12-23T08:22:18Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",California Thomas fire becomes largest in state's history,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42464835,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3272/production/_99141921_hi043472430.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,wildfires,0

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Interior Secretary Ryan Zinkea man who wears ranger hats backwards and spreads conspiracy theories about radical environmentalists are responsible for wildfires when hes not destroying public land protections and calling for more drilling just accused a sitting congressman of alcoholism in retaliation for writing that Zinke should resign. Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee and its likely future chair in 2019, penned an op-ed in USA Today on Friday saying Zinke should leave his post. Grijalva noted that there are at least 17 publicly known formal probes of either Zinke or his department, including one referred to the Department of Justice in which Zinke allegedly met with a Montana property developer and the chairman of oil contractor Halliburton to lead them on a secret, private tour of the Lincoln Memorial. Thats at the same time his family foundation, which Zinke may have still been involved with, is discussing a land deal with a Halliburton-backed investment group and the developer in question. Grijalva added: Beyond his personal foibles, he has overseen the degradation of his departments senior work force in the name of enforcing loyalty to himself and the Trump administration; announced his intention to cut thousands of permanent positions ; prompted mass resignations from a nonpartisan National Park Service advisory board by refusing to meet with members; and tied his own employees and aides in knots to make himself and his wife more financially comfortable. In retaliation, Zinke issued a mind-blowing statement to Twitter saying that it is hard for [Grijalva] to think straight from the bottom of the bottle, referring to allegations that Grijalva paid $48,000 in severance to a female committee staffer that was allegedly threatening to sue him for drunken behavior and a hostile work environment. The incident was covered by right-wing media, but as Vox noted, the incident was dismissed by the Office of Congressional Ethics, which found no evidence to support the claim that the staffer was paid inappropriately. Zinke also demanded Grijalva resign and pay the bill for ethics investigations of his own alleged misconduct. The #TuneInnForMore hashtag is a reference to Tune Inn, a D.C. dive bar and eatery that is frequented by Congressional staff and where Grijalva is reportedly a regular. According to E&amp;E News, sources said Grijalva was there during lunch hours at the time of the tweet and promptly left. Its hard to think how Zinke could have handled this worse: Its true that Grijalva was accused of misconduct, but as the Tucson Sentinel noted, conservative media like the Washington Times that covered the alleged scandal got several key facts about the matter, such as her exact job, wrong. The congressman has been adamant that he does not drink while working, that the claims never involved sexual harassment, and that his alcohol consumption has been long under control. Conversely, Zinkes ethics problems are much more numerous: He might face criminal charges related to the land deal. Politico wrote that yet another ethics probe involves the Interior Departments rejection of plans for an American Indian casino in Connecticut, raising questions as to whether he caved to lobbying by opponent MGM International. Several other investigations have raised troubling signs, Politico added, including incidents where Zinke tried to subvert department policy to improperly justify using government funds to pay for his wifes travel expenses and allegedly threatened Alaska senator and Senate Energy chair Lisa Murkowski with retaliation over her vote against a GOP plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act: But last month, the IG found that Zinke had sought to skirt or alter department policies to justify his taxpayer-funded trips with his wife. Earlier it found that he had not properly disclosed ties to donor Bill Foley, whom he used a charter flight to visit last year while on official business. An earlier investigation into alleged political threats against Murkowski was deemed inconclusive after investigators said Zinke did not cooperate. In October, Zinke was briefly reported to be considering firing the Department of Interiors inspector general and filling the slot with a Donald Trump loyalist with limited experience. After a significant amount of criticism, Interior claimed media had simply gotten the story wrong. As Grijalva noted in his op-ed, he is a top candidate to head the Natural Resources Committee when the newly elected Democratic majority takes power in 2019 and his scrutiny of the secretary will only intensify as part of my and my colleagues legitimate oversight duties. My jaw did literally drop when I read it, Center for Western Priorities spokesman Aaron Weiss told the New York Times of Zinkes tweet. It is so far outside the norms and just disgusting, I guess, to even go there. But then immediately after that my mind went to how strategically poor a choice it is to antagonize the likely incoming chairman of the committee that you have to answer to.

Rachel Kraus,"The wildfire-prone Santa Monica Mountains might sound like a terrible location for a billion dollar museum containing priceless works of art. But when Los Angeles' Getty Center was conceived by its board in the late 1980's, they were well aware of the risk. In fact, the fire currently raging across the highway from the Getty as of Wednesday is exactly the scenario the museum was built to withstand since it first opened its doors in 1997. SEE ALSO: California's worst fire season just got even more terrifying The center uses a variety of architectural and design techniques to mitigate the adverse affects of wildfires. ""When the Getty was designed and built 20 years ago, it was designed in such a way to actually protect the collection from disasters, like a fire,"" said Ron Hartwig, the Getty's vice president of communications. The Getty Center is closed to the public today. The fire is northeast of the Getty Center and east of the San Diego Freeway. Air filtration systems are protecting the galleries from smoke. We continue to monitor the situation and will issue updates as we have them. — J. Paul Getty Museum (@GettyMuseum) December 6, 2017 Early Wednesday morning, a brush fire in West Los Angeles quickly grew to over 50 acres, prompting the shut down of the 405 freeway, and threatening the wealthy neighborhood of Bel-Air, as well as other nearby communities like Brentwood and Westwood. The latest figures from the LA fire department put the blaze at 150 acres. The fire is raging on the east side of the freeway, where Bel-Air residents have been told to evacuate. According to the LA Times, several homes in the area have already succumbed to fire. The Getty Center is a 940,000-square-foot complex that fills 24 acres of the 110-acre Santa Monica Mountains site. It's also on the freeway's west side. But 10 lanes of concrete doesn't mean the museum is safe - all it would take is one ember blown from the adjacent hillside to set aflame the western hills on which the Getty sits. But even in that scenario, thanks largely to architect Richard Meier, the art at The Getty - including Van Gogh's ""Irises"" - is surprisingly secure. ""Meier was sensitive to the fact of where the Getty was being built,"" Hartwig said. ""And of course, very, very sensitive to the fact that it would contain world class art that had to be protected."" Vincent Van Gogh's 'Irises' is part of The Getty's permanent collection. Image: The Getty center The Getty Museum is essentially a fortress specifically designed to protect itself and the art it houses from fire damage. That's because its founders were well aware that the low-moisture vegetation growing on the mountains make for ""volatile fire risk,"" according to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. The museum is built of non-flammable materials including travertine and aluminum panels. And landscapers placed fire-resistant plants with high water content around the compound's perimeter. Inside the building itself, a ""sophisticated"" air filtration system pushes air out of the galleries, and seals them off from smoke and fire. The Getty closed the museum to visitors on Tuesday, before the Wednesday fire, to protect the art from smoke that had reached West Los Angeles from the Thomas, Creek, and Rye fires to its north. Due to continuing smoke from fires in the region, the Getty Center and Getty Villa will remain closed to visitors tomorrow, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017. pic.twitter.com/rAxpPYx0GT — J. Paul Getty Museum (@GettyMuseum) December 5, 2017 Protecting the priceless The Getty Center itself cost over one billion dollars to construct between 1987 and its 1997 opening. That doesn't even take into account its contents, which include, just to name a few, a Manet painting that the museum purchased in 2014 for $65.1 million, and a collection of 16 drawings and a painting by artists including Michelangelo, Parmigianino and Watteau that the museum recently purchased for $100 milion this year. ""It would be hard to put any kind of an estimate on it,"" Hartwig said, ""simply because some of the works are priceless."" The Getty purchased Édouard Manet's 'Jeanne (Spring)' in 2014 for over $65 million. Image: The Getty museum The Getty's security team is in communication with the fire department, and monitoring the situation. But that's par for the course for the museum, which Hartwig says consistently works closely with the LA fire department and police department to ensure the building's security. Because of the smoke, the Getty was already closed to the public the day the fire broke out. But the museum faced a more unexpected wildfire scenario in 2015. During that year's Sepulveda Pass fire, the Getty had to evacuate visitors from its premises before it could put the air filtration safeguards in place. In 2015, The Getty had to evacuate visitors during the 'Sepulveda Pass Fire.' Image: Myung J. Chun/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Still, Getty employees worry about the risks should the fire travel across the 405. The forecast for stronger winds overnight and Thursday adds to that concern. ""Whenever there's a situation like this, until it's finally resolved, and until all the fire is out, we're on constant alert, and always concerned about anything that could happen that we haven't thought about,"" Hartwig said. ""But at this moment in time, with the exception of our deep concern for our neighbors, everything at the Getty is going according to plan."" ""Whatever can be done to protect the Getty center from danger,"" he added, ""has been done.""","The wildfire-prone Santa Monica Mountains might sound like a terrible location for a billion dollar museum containing priceless works of art.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"My sincere hope is that I dont have to come here each night and report a higher and higher number, the Butte County sheriff, Kory L. Honea, said at a news conference on Monday night. [ Heres how you can help those affected by the fires ] The authorities on Monday night released the names of three people who were killed: Ernest Foss, 65, from Paradise; Jesus Fernandez, 48, from Concow; and Carl Wiley, 77, from Magalia. The death toll in the Camp Fire surpassed the Griffith Park Fire of 1933, which killed 29 people and for decades had held the infamous distinction of being Californias deadliest wildfire. Read more about the Griffith Park Fire here. Among the missing in Paradise are many older residents of the Ridgewood Mobile Home Park, a close-knit retirement community of 97 pastel-colored homes, where residents were so tightly bound that they ate together, took walks together and often prayed together, bowing their heads at the mailbox, or in the middle of the street, when they heard of anothers misfortune. Just 20 or so of those people are accounted for by the parks owner, Glen Fuller. Ridgewood was flattened by the fire, a remarkable feat of destruction even for a blaze defined by its speed and brutality. Because the fire came from the east the park sits east of downtown it is likely that the people of Ridgewood were among the first to be hit by the flames. Compounding the danger, many of the residents were older, making a hasty escape difficult. This means that those who did make it out chased by the sound of exploding propane tanks have been left to wait for news of the people they cared for most. Its awful. Its just awful, said Sheila Schriber Cox, 64, a retired family counselor who fled with her dog Daisy, leaving behind her walker, her oxygen tank and a stack of Bibles shed meant to distribute.",Search teams were heading back into the devastated town of Paradise on Tuesday with the grim expectation of finding more bodies in the charred remnants of the town.,2018-11-13T15:44:29Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Wildfires Updates: 42 Dead in Camp Fire and Toll Expected to Rise,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/us/california-fires-updates.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/12/us/14calfires1/00missing-02-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,wildfires,0

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them California's biggest wildfire on record is expected to burn for the rest of the month, fire officials said on Tuesday. The Mendocino Complex Fire has already engulfed 290,692 acres (117,639 hectares) - almost the size of Los Angeles. Barely a third of it is under control, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Firefighters are tackling 18 major blazes across the state amid strong winds and low humidity. The fire - which comprises two blazes in the state's north - was declared the biggest in California's history on Monday. Officials had set a target to extinguish the fire by mid-August, but they now say they will need until early September. The fire has burned 75 buildings and led to thousands of evacuations. A separate blaze - the Carr fire, further north - has killed at least seven people and destroyed more that 1,500 structures. Burning through almost 160,000 acres, it was 47% contained by late Monday. Meanwhile, more fires have been breaking out, adding to the mammoth workload of fire crews. The so-called Holy Fire, in southern California, grew dramatically and rapidly on Monday, with two hikers needing to be airlifted to safety. How are firefighters coping? At least 14,000 firefighters are struggling to contain the multiple outbreaks. The crews have been boosted by US army personnel and more than 1,000 prisoners. The inmates - who are considered low-risk offenders - work on a volunteer basis but they also receive $2 (£1.50) a day, plus $1 an hour. Fire crews from Australia and New Zealand have also flown over to share their expertise in battling bush fires. Firefighters told the LA Times about their gruelling schedule. One said his crew had slept - sitting up - in the seats of their fire engine on some nights. ""It's been pretty crazy - they're calling this the new norm,"" said Omar Estorga, captain of a crew working on the Carr Fire. ""In years past, there were one or two big fires a year. Now they're doing three to four huge fires in a week."" Nearly half of the 10 largest California wildfires on record have occurred in the past decade, according to Reuters news agency. Officials have rejected a theory, tweeted by President Donald Trump, that the fires' spread was being ""made so much worse"" because of a Californian policy to divert water into the Pacific Ocean. Deputy fire chief Mr Mclean dismissed Mr Trump's comments to US media, saying firefighters had ""plenty of water"" to carry out their work. Will it get worse? National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley has warned that conditions are not going to immediately improve - with temperatures as high as 43C (110F) being forecast for some areas. Media caption Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years Experts say 2018 has the worst start to the fire season in 10 years - partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation.

Back Story Photo Credit Associated Press It was “a date which will live in infamy.” Or would it “live in world history”? Seventy-six years ago today, Japan bombed the U.S. naval base in Pearl Harbor, killing more than 2,400 Americans and propelling the U.S. into World War II. News of the surprise attack in Hawaii “fell like a bombshell on Washington,” The Times reported the next morning. “Administration circles forecast that the United States soon might be involved in a world-wide war, with Germany supporting Japan, an Axis partner.” A few hours later, President Franklin D. Roosevelt stood in the chamber of the House of Representatives and, in a speech that lasted only about seven minutes, asked Congress to declare war on Japan. An initial draft of his speech said that the day of the attack would “live in world history.” But Roosevelt had changed the wording to say “a date which will live in infamy” — now among the most recognizable phrases in U.S. history. The president’s three-page typewritten manuscript would be lost for more than four decades until a curator, Susan Cooper, found it during a routine search of Senate files at the National Archives in Washington. “I hadn’t known that it was missing,” she told The Times in 1984.

Tom McKay,"Donald Trump’s administration has moved to have the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration take control of California water management under the official rationale of fighting the state’s rampaging fires, saying that the water “should be prioritized for wildfire response instead of endangered species protections,” ABC News reported on Wednesday. Of course, state officials say that there is more than enough water to fight the fires. The Commerce Directive announced a directive on Wednesday ordering the National Marine Fisheries Service, a sub-agency of NOAA, to “facilitate access to the water needed to fight the ongoing wildfires affecting the State of California.” Per ABC News, said directive would allow federal officials to overrule protections for threatened and endangered wildlife: The change announced Wednesday would allow federal agencies to expedite decisions about water under an emergency provision of the Endangered Species Act. The directive specifically says that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Marine Fisheries Service, will take over management of water during the wildfire emergency in California. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross directed the Service to tell other federal agencies “the protection of life and property takes precedence over any current agreements regarding the use of water in the areas of California affected by wildfires.” That follows on a very ill-informed tweet from the president earlier this week accusing California officials of wasting water needed to fight the fires, namely that it is “being diverted into the Pacific Ocean.” (Actual wildfire experts point to the state’s extreme droughts, which are being worsened by climate change, as well as human encroachment in wildfire-prone areas and arcane funding laws that force the Forest Service to raid its regular forest management funds for emergency firefighting, per the New Republic.) This is probably all as cynical as it sounds, because firefighters who can’t access protected waters are obviously not the cause of the fires raging throughout much of the state. The Trump administration has been hostile to endangered species protections overall, as well as sought to undermine strict California environmental laws on everything from auto pollution to a water-use plan designed to protect salmon. As ABC News noted, there is “concern” what Trump actually intends to accomplish as a result of the order is injecting itself into a fight between the salmon fishing industry, which wants to reduce stress on populations critical to its future, and industrial farmers that want access to protected waterways. Per the Los Angeles Times, wildlife experts say the move is nothing more than a pretext to give the Trump administration the power to bypass laws protecting endangered species and redirect the water to “corporate agribusiness”: “Secretary Ross’s directive is nothing more than a smokescreen designed to weaken these protections that NMFS’s scientists determined are necessary to keep these native fish from going extinct,” Kate Poole of the Natural Resources Defense Council said after the statement was issued. “It’s almost like the extinction of these creatures is their real goal, so that they no longer have to leave any water in rivers, but can divert it all to corporate agribusiness.” “Secretary Ross’s directive is nothing more than a smokescreen designed to weaken these protections that NMFS’s scientists determined are necessary to keep these native fish from going extinct,” Natural Resources Defense Council water division senior director Kate Poole told ABC News. “It’s almost like the extinction of these creatures is their real goal, so that they no longer have to leave any water in rivers, but can divert it all to corporate agribusiness.” “At this point, water supply hasn’t affected any of our operations,” Cal Fire deputy director Mike Mohler told the Times. As the paper noted, firefighters have been drawing water from the Clear Lake reservoir to fight the nearly 300,000-acre Mendocino Complex fire, but the order could be a pretext to undermine California’s regulation of the Shasta Lake reservoir, which feeds recently devastated salmon smolt populations in the Sacramento River. The Times added: As we’ve reported, the Bureau of Reclamation, an Interior Department agency, has proposed changes in both state and federal water projects to “maximize water deliveries” to non-environmental users and consider “modifications to regulatory requirements” established by the biological opinions. ABC News added that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recently wrote an op-ed saying that part of the solution to the fires needs to include a more “aggressive approach to thinning of forests. That approach is less controversial, but much of the necessary funding is tied up in budget fights, according to the New York Times. University of California, Merced management professor LeRoy Westerling told the paper that California “spending millions and millions of dollars on this while the federal government is sitting on its hands... And all that money is being raised because we’re putting a price on carbon.” According to CBS News, firefighting costs in California more than tripled from $242 million in the 2013 fiscal to $773 million in the fiscal year ending in June 30, while smoke from the fires now consuming some 600,000 acres across the state now cover three-quarters of the state.

Mark Kaufman,"The consequences of America’s swelling wildfire problem are traveling well beyond blackened, ashy forests. They're now tainting the air in cities and towns over vast regions of the western U.S. Since the mid-1980s, fine bits of air pollution that have been repeatedly linked to heart and lung diseases have diminished in a good portion of the United States — except in an expansive zone of the western part of the country. In this region, which extends north from Utah to Montana and west from Oregon to Wyoming, the most polluted days — when the air quality is at its most harmful — are getting even worse. SEE ALSO: A NASA prototype could save the lives of firefighters as blazes erupt in western U.S. The culprit, say atmospheric scientists in a Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study published Monday, is expanding wildfires, which are burning considerably more land than they were three decades ago. “It’s not just a rural thing anymore,” Anthony Wexler, director of the UC Davis Air Quality Research Center who took no part in the research, said of the bad air. The red area shows the zone in the U.S. where the worst days of particulate matter pollution (PM 2.5) are getting worse. Image: Image adapted from McClure C.D. and Jaffe D.A/PNAS Wexler, speaking from smoky Aspen, Colorado, near where blazes had recently charred the Rocky Mountains, noted these tiny particles — which at their largest are still 30 times thinner than a human hair — don’t just transform blue skies into unsightly hazes. “It’s also a killer,” said Wexler. A recent 10-year-long Environmental Protection Agency study observed some 6,000 people and found exposure to this particulate matter, known formally as PM 2.5 (for particulate matter less than 2.5 microns across), accelerated the build-up of plaque inside the walls of blood vessels, which leads to heart attacks, strokes, and even death. A size comparison of Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5) pollution versus human hair and sand particles. Image: epa “Lots of people have been predicting that this [harmful air pollution] would be happening in the next decades — but we’re starting to see it now,” Dan Jaffe, a study coauthor and University of Washington atmospheric researcher, said in an interview. The worst polluted days, when this tiny pollution is at its highest, comes out to around seven extremely unhealthy days a year. “At high levels, it affects everybody,” said Jaffe, even people in fine health. “In short, it’s harder to breathe.” And wildfires aren’t expected to diminish anytime soon. They’re a result of a hotter climate, which parches the land and provides fires with more fuel. The recent return of large blazes to California’s wine country, for example, were largely stoked by hot temperatures, turning abundant vegetation to tinder. “We’re right in the middle of climate change,” Gabriele Pfister, deputy director of the National Center of Atmospheric Research’s atmospheric chemistry lab who had no involvement in the study, said in an interview. A wildfire burns in southern Colorado on June 28. Image: Uncredited/AP/REX/Shutterstock “There’s yet another record, and yet another record, and yet another record,” said Pfister, referring to the increased frequency of record-breaking heat as average temperatures continue to climb. “Climate change is definitely not getting better.” All three atmospheric scientists, however, pointed out that that climate change certainly isn’t the only culprit in increased wildfires over the last few decades. The U.S. government’s historic mismanagement of forests, specifically by not allowing fire-prone underbrush to burn away in typical fires, has given large fires more fuel to burn, and an upper hand. But higher temperatures are simply the elephant in the room. “It’s hotter than it used to be,” said Wexler. And this heat, unfortunately, helps drive a vicious cycle of more heat. As more forests burn, they don’t just release bounties of tiny bits of matter into the air; they also fill the atmosphere with more carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes “substantially to the global greenhouse effect,” according to the U.S. Forest Service. And more greenhouse gases mean more trapped heat in Earth’s atmosphere. “It’s a circle,” said Pfister. A plane dumping fire retardant near Idaho's 2016 Pioneer Fire. Image: U.s. Forest Service/Kari Greer As the planet continues its accelerated warming trend, this means government air quality warnings in communities long distances from burning forests will likely become more frequent, she said. “Take it seriously. Stay indoors,” said Pfister. “Sometimes it’s pretty healthy to be a couch potato."" Bad air may make for a grimmer future, but there is the ever-conspicuous solution: Slashing the greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere – which requires the transformation of how nations generate electricity and fuel transportation. “We can do something about it by addressing climate change,” added Pfister. Though in the short term, the West will burn, like it is this summer. “It’s going to be a tough season,” said Pfister.","The consequences of America’s swelling wildfire problem are traveling well beyond blackened, ashy forests.

"Matt Novak on Earther, shared by Matt Novak to Gizmodo","President Donald Trump tweeted some incredibly ignorant things over the weekend about the wildfires that have so far killed at least 31 people in California. Firefighters have explained repeatedly why the president is so wrong, but CNN meteorologist Tom Sater broke it all down on Sunday to show why President Trump has no idea what hes talking about. There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor, President Trump tweeted on Saturday. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments! Sater started his segment on CNN by explaining that he enjoys covering the weather because, outside of climate change issues, its neutral and doesnt often intersect with politics. But when the president says something this terrible, even guys like Sater clearly have to speak out against it. This is wrong on so many levels, Sater explained. This has nothing to do with forest management. Were not looking at dense forest here, Sater said while gesturing at a photo of Paradise, California, where the town has been completely wiped out by the fires over the past few days. Especially down in Malibu! Forest management has nothing to do with mountain winds coming down the passes at 70 miles per hour. Or humidity levels in one hour dropping Thursday from 35 percent down into single digits, dryer than most deserts, Sater continued. Its like taking funds from the National Hurricane Center until you stop all these hurricanes, its the same notion, Sater said. But more importantly, people died in their homes, they found bodies outside their homes, in their vehicles trying to flee, outside their vehicles just trying to run away. You can watch the rest of the segment on YouTube, where Sater explains how firefighters are working their tails off, both in the northern part of the state to battle the Camp Fire and in the southern part of the state to fight the Woolsey Fire. Its not exactly news that President Trump is a blathering idiot. But when youve got the weather guy riled up you know something is very, very wrong. President Trump has always been a danger to national security. But his latest statements are particularly galling, even for Trump. People are dying, and hes threatening to pull funding. There are only two options: Hes either too dumb to be president or hes too callous to the suffering of his fellow Americans to be president. Either way, America is suffering because hes president. And that suffering isnt going away anytime soon.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","While visiting California this weekend, President Donald Trump said Finnish President Sauli Niinisto told him that raking was part of the countrys forest management before insinuating that its something the United States should be doing to mitigate wildfires. The remark was bizarre, to be sure. But now, Niinisto says that no such conversation ever happened. Answering questions from reporters with California officials about the states wildfires on Saturday, Trump said that management of the floors of the forest was important for avoiding future environmental catastrophes like the Camp Fire, which has become the states deadliest and most destructive fire in its history. He then pointed to a conversation he claimed he had with Niinisto. You look at other countries where they do it differently and its a whole different story, he said. I was with the president of Finland and he said, Were a forest nation. He called it a forest nation. And they spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things. And they dont have any problem. And when it is, its a very small problem. It now appears that the conversation never happened. Asked about the remark by Finish newspaper Ilta-Sanomat, Niinisto said he didnt recall a discussion about raking, though he did recall telling the president that we take care of our forests. Beyond the fact that Finlands president insinuated this conversation about raking happened exclusively in Trumps mind, perhaps at the very moment the words fell out of his mouth, it is not the first time Trump has mentioned raking in relation to Californias fires. Just one day before visiting Paradise, the California town that was essentially burned to the ground by the Camp Fire, Trump again mentioned raking.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Both ends of California are on fire. While firefighters battle the Camp Fire in Northern California, their compatriots in Southern California are facing an equally harrowing situation. Spurred by the Santa Ana winds, the Woolsey and Hill fires are wreaking havoc just north of Los Angeles with an estimated 75,000 homes under evacuation orders. The number is likely to rise as winds conditions pick up again on Friday. The twin blazes began in Ventura County on Thursday, forcing widespread evacuations in a region reeling from a deadly mass shooting earlier this week. As of late Thursday night, the Woolsey Fire had burned 7,500 acres and the Hill Fire was up to 10,000 acres. Both are running completely wild with zero percent containment as flames race up and down the steep hillsides. Powerful Santa Ana winds blasting up to 60 mph have made conditions even worse. The winds are annual occurrence in Southern California. As they flow from east to west, rolling down the mountains and into valleys, the air they move becomes compressed. That heats it up and dries it out, which in turn can create dangerous fire conditions. Pile that on top of a severe drought thats gripped the region for months, creating loads of fire fuel, and you have a recipe for the disaster currently unfolding. Mandatory evacuations went up overnight in large parts of Ventura County. The countys fire department reported that there were 30,000 people under evacuation orders, many forced to flee in the dead of night. The evacuation orders have spread to Los Angeles County as firefighters have been unable to keep pace with the fires racing across the landscape. The Woolsey Fire jumped the 101 Freeway on Friday morning and began to descend on the multi-million dollar homes of Malibu. The Los Angeles County Fire Department tweeted that it posed an [i]mminent threat! Fire season is changing in Southern California in a variety of ways that are not good. That includes the global warming rigamarole every corner of the planet is dealing with to bizarre local impacts like the region losing its cooling cloud cover. Add in densely populated areas like Malibu and, well, you have a trappings of a very, very bad situation. Update November 9, 12:31 p.m. ET: Local officials held a press conference to update reporters on the state of the Woolsey and Hill fires. Los Angeles County Chief Deputy David Richardson said there are more than 2,000 firefighters currently battling the blazes in Southern California and that up to 60,000 homes could see mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders over the course of the day. If you have a mandatory evacuation order, leave., Linda Parks, a Ventura County Supervisor, said. We dont want any tragedies, any deaths, any injuries. In addition to the challenging conditions, theres also a resource challenge. Firefighters are being stretched thin between these fires and the Camp Fire, making it tough to set a proper fire line. Thats in part why the Woolsey Fire jumped the 101 Freeway and Malibu is being evacuated. The perimeter now is the Pacific Ocean, Richardson said.","Both ends of California are on fire.

"Melissa Etehad, Ruben Vives","Firefighters hoped to make more progress Saturday against wildfires burning from Ojai to Oceanside, destroying more than 500 structures and forcing hundreds of thousands to flee from their homes. As Santa Ana winds finally died down Friday, crews were able to begin containment of some of the biggest fires. But red flag fire warnings remain in effect, and forecasters say the Santa Anas will return to San Diego County late Saturday evening. On Saturday, Gov. Jerry Brown plans to survey the devastation Saturday in Ventura, the hardest hit by this week’s firestorms. Firefighters had a successful day battling flames on the southern edge of the Thomas fire, working toward the coast as well as parts of Ojai thanks to favorable wind patterns, a weakening of the winds and fire crews improving fire lines they had established, according to Bill Murphy, a spokesman for Cal Fire. By Friday evening, the Thomas fire had burned 143,000 acres and was 10% contained. As a result, Murphy said evacuations for most of the city of Ventura and Santa Paula were lifted. Firefighters continued to encounter difficulty on the east side of the fire above Fillmore. Crews used helicopters to drop water on that portion to try to contain the fire. Firefighters also made progress on Highway 33 and the 101 Freeway on the west side of the blaze. In Los Angeles County, firefighters were making progress on blazes in Sylmar, Santa Clarita and Bel-Air. Even as the tide began to turn, residents were beginning to come to terms with the devastation and loss from the fires. On Friday afternoon, Jacklyn Mann, 29, sifted through the charred metal and debris that was once her house. Her brother Ben Mann, 26, and her father, Roger Mann, 60, scoured the debris. The family is one of the first residents on their block in Ventura to return to the neighborhood. All down the windy street, houses like the Mann family’s had been destroyed by the Thomas fire. The Manns came back with one goal in mind: to salvage any household items they could find that held sentimental value. “I found another one!” Jacklyn shouted to her dad. In her hand was a dusty ceramic pinch pot that her other brother, Dixon Mann, had made years ago in elementary school. “Oh, cool. Sweet,” Roger responded. Lined on the side of their property were small items the family had dug up that day. Among them was Ben Mann’s swimming medals from when he was a child. The family decided to spend the day digging through the rubble after they had earlier found a Christmas ornament that belonged to Jacklyn. It had been hanging on their Christmas tree, which they had decorated on Monday before the fires destroyed their house. “We didn’t want to wait,” Jacklyn said. “It’s weird to see what survived the flames.” In northern San Diego County, the Lilac fire had 4,100 acres burned and 105 structures destroyed along the Highway 76 corridor that stretches west from the 15 Freeway through Bonsall and Fallbrook. But officials cautioned that dry, swirling Santa Ana winds are expected to return Saturday and Sunday and could kick up embers that might start new fires. At least 65 of the houses lost were at the Rancho Monserate Country Club, a mobile home community near where the flames leapt to life late Thursday morning. The blaze took off on a fast-paced rampage that also killed 35 horses at the storied San Luis Rey Downs thoroughbred-training facility and injured two firefighters and four civilians, including a horse trainer burned over 50% of her body. Among those coping with their losses was Jon Stecker, who stood alongside what had been his two-story, 2,700-square foot home on Olive Hill Road in Bonsall as the sun began to set Friday. “It’s gnarly, huh?” he said. He lost not just his home, but two other houses on the 1.2 acre property he’s owned since 1992. He’d been at work in San Diego when the fire hit, but said he knew his home was gone because his wife had told him she saw a solid wall of burning trees across the street as she fled. Stecker, 53, pointed to what had been his deck, now just a pile where a tiny orange flame or two stubbornly flickered. “Want a tub?” he asked, motioning at a buried bathtub, which on Thursday morning had been in a second-floor bathroom. He said he lost a horse and a pig in the fire, but his wife had been able to get their dogs out. They also lost three vehicles, now just metal shells. Waiting for his insurance agent, he said he’s resigned to rebuilding. “What can you do?” he said. Several people were hurt in the San Diego fires. Among those injured Thursday was Martine Bellocq, a trainer at San Luis Rey Downs, who suffered second- and third-degree burns over 50% of her body as she tried to rescue six horses, according to Alan Balch, executive director of the California Thoroughbred Trainers. She was airlifted to UC San Diego Medical Center and placed in a medically induced coma, Balch said. Bellocq was among several trainers, grooms and staff who tried to evacuate hundreds of thoroughbreds as the fire roared toward the sprawling, 200-acre, 500-stall training facility Thursday afternoon. In the rush to get horses to safety, many were simply allowed to run free once the flames began to sweep through the barns. Many of the 35 horses killed there perished in their stalls.

Sudhin Thanawala and Cathy Bussewitz,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Faced with potentially ruinous lawsuits over California's recent wildfires, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Corp. filed for bankruptcy protection Tuesday in a move that could lead to higher bills for customers of the nation's biggest utility and reduce the size of any payouts to fire victims.
The Chapter 11 filing allows PG&amp;E to continue operating while it puts its books in order. But it was seen as a glimpse of the financial toll that could lie ahead for the industry because of climate change , which scientists say is leading to fiercer, more destructive blazes and longer fire seasons.
The bankruptcy could also jeopardize California's ambitious program to switch entirely to renewable energy sources within a few decades.
PG&amp;E, which supplies natural gas and electricity to 16 million people in Northern and central California, cited hundreds of lawsuits over fires in 2017 and 2018 and tens of billions of dollars in potential liability when it announced earlier this month that it planned to file for bankruptcy.
The blazes include the nation's deadliest wildfire in a century -- the one in November that killed at least 86 people and destroyed 15,000 homes in and around the Northern California town of Paradise. The cause is still under investigation, but suspicion fell on PG&amp;E after it reported power line problems nearby around the time the fire broke out.
Last week, however, state investigators determined that the company's equipment was not to blame for a 2017 fire that killed 22 people and destroyed more than 5,600 buildings in Northern California wine country. That finding spared PG&amp;E from billions in liability.
PG&amp;E said the bankruptcy will not affect electric or gas service and will allow for an ""orderly, fair and expeditious resolution"" of wildfire claims.
""Throughout this process, we are fully committed to enhancing our wildfire safety efforts, as well as helping restoration and rebuilding efforts across the communities impacted by the devastating Northern California wildfires,"" interim CEO John R. Simon said in a statement.
The wildfire lawsuits accuse PG&amp;E of inadequate maintenance, including not adequately trimming trees and clearing brush around electrical lines, and failing to shut off power when fire risk is high.
The bankruptcy filing immediately puts the lawsuits on hold and consolidates them in bankruptcy court, where legal experts say victims will probably receive less money.
""They're going to have to take some sort of haircut on their claims,"" said Jared Ellias, a bankruptcy attorney who teaches at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. ""We don't know yet what that will be.""
In a bankruptcy proceeding, the victims will have little chance of getting punitive damages, and their claims will almost certainly be heard by a judge, not a jury. They will also have to stand in line behind PG&amp;E's secured creditors, such as banks, when the judge decides who gets paid and how much.
Jeffrey Hammond said he is pessimistic that he will collect any money from the company now that it has filed for bankruptcy.
His home in Napa County was destroyed in 2017 in a fire that investigators say started when an oak tree fell onto a PG&amp;E power line.
He said the house could have been sold for $500,000, but his insurance company paid only $100,000 -- the most recent county assessment. He sued PG&amp;E hoping to ""close the gap.""
""I'm 76, going to be 77 soon,"" he said. ""And this will take years to sort out.""
Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement that his administration will work to ensure that ""Californians have access to safe, reliable and affordable service, that victims and employees are treated fairly, and that California continues to make forward progress on our climate change goals.""
Amanda Riddle, an attorney representing victims of a deadly 2015 wildfire, said that even before the bankruptcy filing, PG&amp;E had stopped making settlement payments to her clients. They will now have to fight for their money in bankruptcy court, she said.
""It shows PG&amp;E does not actually have the best interests of the wildfire victims in mind,"" she said.
Riddle attended the first court hearing on PG&amp;E's bankruptcy Tuesday. Judge Dennis Montali did not rule on any requests by PG&amp;E, including approval for up to $5.5 billion in bankruptcy financing. He said he would give the public a chance to weigh in on the case in the future and set another hearing for Thursday.
""For me and for most of you by my calculation we haven't even had 14 hours to absorb what was filed just after midnight,"" he told a packed courtroom.
Legal experts said customers could also be hit with higher rates to help PG&amp;E cover its costs. PG&amp;E would not speculate about the effect on customers' bills, noting that the state Public Utilities Commission sets rates.
Part of the company also filed for bankruptcy in 2001 during an electricity crisis marked by rolling blackouts. It emerged from court protection three years later but obtained billions in higher rates.
Utilities around the nation are preparing for the potential effects of climate change, taking such steps as fortifying substations and burying power lines against severe hurricanes and wildfires. The costs are high, but the risks of catastrophic damage appear to be growing.
The PG&amp;E bankruptcy ""is sort of a test case for how utilities and other major infrastructure players are going to deal with climate change, and who's going to be responsible for it, and who's going to be accountable,"" said John MacWilliams, a fellow at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. ""I would be surprised if this is the last utility that's going to have to deal with this.""
California has set a goal of getting 100 per cent of its electricity from carbon-free sources such as wind, solar and hydropower by 2045. To achieve that, utilities must switch to buying power from renewable sources. PG&amp;E, for example, made agreements in 2017 to buy electricity from solar farms.
But because of its bankruptcy, some experts have questioned the company's ability to pay what it agreed to, or to make investments in grid upgrades and batteries necessary to bring more renewable energy online.
""PG&amp;E's bankruptcy is going to make it a lot more costly for California to meet its environmental goals, and could make it more challenging just to get the infrastructure built to help cut emissions and increase renewable energy,"" said Travis Miller, an investment strategist at Morningstar Inc.
PG&amp;E's stock is down 70 per cent from about a year ago amid fears about the effects of the wildfires.

"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=742186908, https://www.facebook.com/markberman","OJAI, Calif. — As the Golden State continued to burn for a sixth day, California officials warned that higher Santa Ana winds forecast through the weekend could create more erratic fire behavior, offering little chance of a reprieve for residents and firefighters who have endured flames and smoke for nearly a week. On Saturday, multiple wildfires continued to rage throughout Southern California, cloaking the area in nightmarish flame and towering plumes of smoke so thick they were visible from space. On Friday, authorities reported the first fire-related death: The Ventura Medical Examiner Office identified a body found on Wednesday as Virginia Pesola, 70, from Santa Paula, the “only confirmed fire-related death in Ventura County to date.” Pesola had died from “blunt force injuries with terminal smoke inhalation and thermal injuries” in a traffic incident during “active fire evacuation,” according to the county medical examiner. As the fires spread, much of the region also faces the threat posed by the dense smoke. Public health officials warned of dangerously bad air quality and said it was particularly threatening for the elderly, children and people with respiratory or heart conditions. Los Angeles County issued smoke advisories, urging people to remain indoors when possible, while Santa Barbara County officials said they expected to distribute 50,000 masks to area residents. Phil Moyal, an air quality specialist in Ventura County, said the smoke was causing hazardous conditions there, especially in the Ojai Valley, which is surrounded by mountains that have been trapping the smoke. “When we say ‘off the charts,’ we mean off the charts,” Moyal said Friday about air-quality measurements there. “I would not want to be there too long... I would tell people to go to Seattle. There are not many places in Southern California that are clean or will stay clean, and that can change in a minute depending on the wind.” [ How Santa Ana winds spread wildfires ] There were a few positive signs for the state. Officials battling the Thomas Fire in Ventura County — the biggest active blaze in the state after burning through 140,000 acres — spoke in cautiously optimistic tones as they lifted evacuation orders for cities along the fire’s southern edge: Santa Paula, and parts of Ventura. The coastal enclaves of Carpinteria and Santa Barbara were still under threat as the fire’s northern vanguard continued to move. And officials said that winds which could strike up at a moment’s notice remained a concern. The fire had burned more than 200 buildings in that county, alone. President Trump on Friday declared a state of emergency in California, ordering federal aid to the state in response to a request from Gov. Jerry Brown (D). Firefighters, joined by reinforcements from outside the state, battled the blazes. Hundreds of buildings have been destroyed and thousands more remain at risk as more than a half-dozen blazes continued to burn, officials said. The fires combined to burn across nearly 250 square miles. In San Diego County, firefighters continued to battle the Lilac Fire, which injured three civilians and two firefighters. Residents who fled described rapidly moving flames. “Oh my God, the heat, the heat,” Clifford Sise, a horse trainer who had to evacuate while trying to get his horses out of the San Luis Rey Downs, a racehorse facility in San Diego County. “One of my fillies wouldn’t leave, she burned to death in like one minute. I had ’em all out, and then when I went back after. I must’ve had two little babies run back in their stalls and they died.” The winds fanning the flames were lighter Friday, but forecasts call for them to increase again through Sunday. Red flag warnings of heightened fire risk will remain in place for at least Los Angeles and Ventura counties through Sunday, when winds could peak at around 50 mph. That could combine with extremely low humidity to create more unpredictable fire behavior and severe conditions for firefighters on the ground. “We’re not out of the woods yet,” Dianne Jacob, chair of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, said Friday at a news briefing. “We need to stay vigilant and be prepared.” Across the region, people who fled recounted fire and smoke that seemed to come from everywhere. The sounds of helicopters woke Patricia Hampton and her boyfriend at their house in Ventura as the Thomas Fire was growing. When they looked outside, the ground was covered in ash, the air so smoky it was hard to breathe, she said. They hopped on bicycles and tried to flee. “We didn’t know what had happened,” Hampton, 48, said at a temporary shelter at the Ventura County Fairgrounds on Thursday, two days after leaving home. “We rode down into town trying to make sense of what we were seeing — police everywhere, firetrucks, helicopters. It was like a war zone. You could hear transformers blowing up.” In Los Angeles, Lili Hamedi said she went into her yard during the week and found her swimming pool filled with ash. “We were surrounded by the fires,” said Hamedi, who lives in the Encino area. “I heard the fire. I never knew you could hear a fire.” In Ojai, the favorable weather Friday allowed fire crews to make progress against what had been multiple lines of flames in recent days. A morning offshore wind calmed to nothing by midday, then shifted to a light breeze that had firefighters near Ojai preparing to defend the western edge of the city. Along the Thomas Fire’s northern edge near Carpinteria, a small city in Santa Barbara County, fire crews, backed by helicopters dropping water near homes and ranches, made great strides against multiple blazes Friday morning and throughout the day. Parts of the city remained under mandatory evacuation orders, but the flames just miles away the previous day had turned into smoldering plumes of smoke. This let fire crews concentrate on Ojai, a quirky town where New Age and the Old West mix in the hills high above Ventura. It has been surrounded by the Thomas Fire for much of the week. Over several breezeless hours, smoke settled into the canyons and dry river beds, complicating visibility for the helicopters making drops to the north and west of the city. For firefighters, the stillness meant the wind was shifting, so they had to get ready, said Forrest Rowell, a battalion chief and strike team leader from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire Department. “We’re preparing to go in and keep the fire off the city from the north, and clean up some edges that could worsen with the new wind,” Rowell said. The smoke spreading through Ventura pushed Jet Kauffman to pack up her two dogs, two cats and valuables into a car. “Everything is literally burning around you and it’s raining ash and ember, and things are just lighting on fire around you, and you can’t really do much to stop it,” Kauffman said. Her boyfriend, Shaun Kelleher, stayed behind to protect the Victorian house he bought in 2012. He looked out a back window and saw the glow creeping over the hillside, consuming palm trees in its path. The 32-year-old, ignoring mandatory evacuation orders, threw a scarf over his mouth and goggles over his glasses and ran outside to douse the home and yard with a hose. “I saw a house light on fire, and that’s when I started to freak out, because there was no one around,” Kelleher said. A second house burst into flames, then a third, and then an apartment complex. Fire and smoke were getting closer to his house and the wind was picking up. Kauffman, at a friend’s house, called Kelleher and pleaded with him to leave. Then he heard a sound that filled him with relief: Sirens. Some 20 firetrucks pulled into the area, he said, and firefighters stopped the flames bearing down on the house. The couple ended up in Thousand Oaks, a nearby city, staying with Kelleher’s father. Their Victorian home in Ventura had no power or drinkable water, but it was still standing. Ventura resident Nate Weber wasn’t so fortunate. The anesthesiologist and his wife Christine fled Monday evening with their four- and two-year-old daughters to his mother’s house in Oxnard Shores. Early the next morning they got a call from a neighbor: their home at the top of a hill on Mint Lane was gone. Nate returned to find sympathetic neighbors crowded around what remained of his house. He said the experience was “similar to a friend dying.” “I lived in that house six years, but it was a very formative six years,” he said. “I got married, I had two kids — just watching the kids grow up in that house, all those memories.” The kids, too, have had trouble processing the loss. When he showed his 4-year-old daughter a picture of the burned home, she remarked about how sad it was. “Then she goes off to play,” he said. “Two hours later she said, ‘Dad, I’m ready to go home.’ ” Wang, Berman and Rosenberg reported from Washington. Rob Kuznia and Noah Smith in Los Angeles; Soo Youn in Ventura, Calif.; and Angela Fritz in Washington contributed to this report. The Thomas Fire burns between the 101 Freeway and the Pacific Ocean.

Mark Kaufman,"After transforming the once tranquil town of Paradise, California into charred automobiles and tales of horror, the Camp Fire takes its infamous spot as the deadliest wildfire in California history. At a multi-agency press conference Monday night, the Butte Country Sheriff's office announced that 42 have been confirmed dead. This grim statistic surpasses the 29 Los Angelenos killed by the Griffith Park Fire in 1933. After sparking on November 8, the newly-born blaze raced with rapid, potentially unprecedented speed toward the forested community of 26,000. In just 24 hours, the Camp Fire burned 70,000 acres of exceptionally dried-out vegetation. ""That blows your mind,"" Brenda Belongie, lead meteorologist of the U.S. Forest Service's Predictive Services in Northern California, said on Friday. The wildfire isn't just the deadliest blaze in California history. It's also the most destructive. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CalFire, reports that 6,453 single residences have been destroyed, while 260 commercial structures went down in flames. This toppled the previous record for destructiveness, set just last year by the Tubbs Fire, which also took 22 lives. SEE ALSO: The EPA completely axed its climate change websites. But why are NASA's still live? Now, seven of the top 10 most destructive wildfires in state history have occurred since the year 2000, and nine of the top 10 largest in recorded state history have occurred over the same period. The reality that the Golden State's fires are burning more land, destroying more homes, and inevitably killing Californians is consistent with a region that's growing hotter, and dryer. Larger wildfires though also strongly influenced by weather and human manipulation of the land are a well-understood consequence of climate change. This is particularly the case in California, which has experienced larger, more destructive wildfires in the last two decades as the region becomes both hotter and drier. In particular, conditions over large swaths of the state, notably forested Northern California, are seeing seasonal records or near-records for dryness. Now enter the Camp Fire. Like many climate change implications, scientists aren't arguing that climate change itself causes wildfires, hurricanes, or drought. These events happen regardless. But climate change often makes these events more extreme. And in the case of the Camp Fire, the inferno capitalized upon land that wasn't just dried out and whipped over the forest by seasonal winds: California has had little-to-no rain this autumn, and experienced record heat this summer. The land is tinder, waiting to burn.","After transforming the once tranquil town of Paradise, California into charred automobiles and tales of horror, the Camp Fire takes its infamous spot as the deadliest wildfire in California history.

"Joe Sutton and Susannah Cullinane, CNN","(CNN) Firefighters are struggling to contain the biggest of six blazes burning in southern California, with the Thomas Fire slipping from 15% containment to 10% Sunday. Covering 230,000 acres, the Thomas Fire is now the fifth largest blaze in modern California history. The fires are collectively burning an area larger than New York City and Boston combined. Gusty winds and dry conditions are not helping the wildfire's spread, and there's no rain in the forecast for at least 10 days. Elevated conditions: The Santa Ana winds are forecast to decrease heading into Tuesday, but could gust between 40-55 mph on Monday before tapering, CNN meteorologist Rachel Aissen says. Ventura County and surrounding areas are under an elevated fire outlook, with temperatures remaining between 78-82 degrees as humidity continues to fall in a range below 10%. Warnings: A Red Flag Warning for much of Los Angeles and Ventura counties has been extended through Monday evening, the National Weather Service said. It means that elevated fire weather conditions are expected due to a combination of gusty winds and low humidity. Power cuts: The Thomas Fire is causing intermittent electricity outages in Santa Barbara County. Southern California Electric said that outages and surges could potentially affect up to 85,000 customers, with 2,432 customers without power at 9 p.m. PST Sunday (midnight ET). Evacuations: Some 94,607 people were under mandatory evacuation orders in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties Sunday evening, Ventura County Sheriff Captain Garo Kuredjian told CNN. School closures: The Santa Barbara City Office of Emergency Services said in a tweet that 19 of its 20 school districts would be closed Monday and that all South County School Districts would remain closed through the end of the week. Death toll: The death toll from the Thomas Fire stands at one. Authorities believe Virginia Pesola, 70, of Santa Paula, died in a crash while fleeing the fire, her body was found Wednesday. The six blazes vary in size. Thomas Fire: It had scorched 230,000 acres by Sunday evening, with about 10% of it contained. It started Monday in Ventura County, and has since spread into Santa Barbara County. The fire has surpassed the 1932 Matilija Fire -- which burned 220,000 acres -- to become Ventura County's largest recorded blaze, according to CalFire. It has destroyed 790 structures and damaged 191, Ventura County Sheriff Captain Garo Kuredjian told CNN, with firefighting efforts costing $34 million by Sunday night. Creek Fire: The second-largest blaze ignited Tuesday in neighboring Los Angeles County. It has burned 15,619 acres and is 95% contained. Rye Fire: It broke out Tuesday in Los Angeles County and has burned 6,049 acres. Firefighters are making progress, with 93% of the blaze contained. Lilac Fire: This fast-moving fire has consumed 4,100 acres since it ignited Thursday in San Diego County. Firefighters have regained control of it, and it's 75% contained. Skirball Fire: It started Wednesday as a brush fire in Los Angeles County. It has burned 422 acres and is now 85% contained. Liberty Fire: The blaze in Riverside County has burned 300 acres since it ignited Thursday. It's 100% contained, but authorities are monitoring it ahead of a forecast increase in winds. As California Gov. Jerry Brown surveyed the damage in Ventura County Saturday, he predicted that extreme fire activity would happen on a regular basis for decades. ""With climate change, some scientists are saying that Southern California is literally burning up,"" the governor, who is a n advocate for climate science, said. ""So we have to have the resources to combat the fires and we also have to invest in managing the vegetation and forests... in a place that's getting hotter."" As for those facing the flames of the current wildfires, there's gratitude -- for life, community and the efforts of the firefighters working to protect both. One family whose home was destroyed in the Creek Fire told CNN affiliate KCAL9 News that they had lost everything to the blaze but were grateful to be alive. ""For me, it was like my 15 years of living here was flashing by -- of memories, you know, the gatherings, all that,"" Javier Hernandez told the station. ""And then at the same time, we were like, 'OK, my family's OK. If it's gonna burn, it's gonna burn.'"" A number of celebrities voiced their thanks to firefighters and concern for the communities at risk from fire. Oprah Winfrey and Ellen Degeneres, who both have homes in Montecito, tweeted that they were praying for their communities. ""Our house is under threat of being burned. We just had to evacuate our pets. I'm praying for everyone in our community and thankful to all the incredible firefighters,"" Degeneres said, adding in a later tweet that she was proud to be part of a community where people were helping each other to safety. Winfrey tweeted that her prayer as the fires raged was ""peace be still."" Retired tennis player Jimmy Connors' said the Thomas Fire was also threatening his home, tweeting his thanks to the firefighters ""working tirelessly."" Firefighters from Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Washington state are helping to fight the fires.
