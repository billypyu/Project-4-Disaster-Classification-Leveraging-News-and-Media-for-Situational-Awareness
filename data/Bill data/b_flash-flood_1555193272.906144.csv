ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"When: Officials will send high-priority warnings during tsunamis, blizzards, tornadoes, hurricanes, extreme wind conditions, storm surges, snow squalls and flash floods. In New York, flash flood warnings are the most common, said Nelson Vaz, a warning coordination meteorologist for the Weather Service. On days like today, the Weather Service’s forecasters are constantly monitoring rainfall rates and the affected environments. “If they feel the rainfall rates are going to exceed the ability of the ground to absorb that rainfall, and you’re going to see a threat to life and property from flooding, that’s when the forecaster will issue a flash flood warning,” Mr. Vaz explained. How: The warnings are issued from the National Weather Service’s offices in Upton, N.Y., using computer software called WarnGen, which allows the forecasters to create the text of the message — describing the location and hazards, for example — and to target the geographic area where the flooding is expected to happen. The technology, called Wireless Emergency Alerts, is the same tool that can push out Amber Alerts or emergency warnings from the president.

A fifth person in the French hiking group - a woman - is still missing. Rescuers resumed a search for her near Soccia on Thursday. Seven tourists were canyoning with a guide when a wave about 3m (12ft) high hit them, a Corsican prosecutor said. The guide was among those killed. Two were rescued from the torrent.

The executive order allows the state of Maryland to coordinate support to local jurisdictions experiencing flooding conditions. “Less than two years ago, the citizens of Howard County and Ellicott City went through a horrific ordeal, and sadly, they are facing a similar emergency today,” said Governor Hogan in a statement. “Our administration is closely monitoring the situation and working in partnership with local officials, including Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman, to respond to this extreme weather as quickly and efficiently as possible.” “The immediate focus is ensuring everyone is safe and secure. The state will continue to provide all available resources to assist Howard County with their response to this extremely dangerous and ongoing situation. I strongly urge all Marylanders to monitor the weather, heed all warnings, and avoid the affected areas.” After the floodwaters had receded, the Baltimore Sun reports that emergency officials announced no injuries, fatalities or missing persons as of Sunday night, following safety checks throughout Main Street and surrounding areas. Exceptionally active on Twitter during the flooding, Howard County Fire &amp; EMS posted that rescues, some using rescue swimmers, were under way in Ellicott City, and that in some areas, water had risen to the first floor of buildings.

"Holly Yan, CNN","(CNN) Deserts aren't supposed to get much rain, but Tropical Storm Rosa is flipping the script. Rosa is forecast to make landfall early Tuesday with more than 11 million people under a flash flood watch in the Southwest, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said. It'll drench Baja California with 3 to 6 inches of rain, with some spots getting up to 10 inches, the National Hurricane Center said. As it moves northeast, Rosa will also dump 2 to 4 inches of rain on much of Arizona, with up to 6 inches in the mountains. A flash flood watch is in effect for parts of Arizona until Wednesday as the storm's remnants move across the state, the National Weather Service said. ""These rainfall amounts may produce life-threatening flash flooding,"" the National Hurricane Center said. ""Dangerous debris flows and landslides are also possible in mountainous terrain."" Historically, it's unusual for the US Southwest to get pummeled by a hurricane or tropical storm. But ""these events have begun to increase in recent years,"" CNN meteorologist Gene Norman said. Research indicates that global warming contributes to tropical storms getting ""more intense, bigger and longer-lasting, thereby increasing their potential for damage,"" said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. While there might not be a direct link between global warming and the recent increase of severe storms in the US Southwest, ""it is possible that this could be a side effect of climate change,"" Norman said. ""Warmer oceans are allowing eastern Pacific storms to reach higher latitudes,"" he said. ""This was not the case earlier. It was quite rare for an eastern Pacific storm to even reach Baja California, and this is now becoming more common."" Rosa was about 75 miles (125 kilometers) North of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, late Monday night, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h).

(Photo: Brian Powers, Rodney White/The Register) Buy Photo Though emergency officials expected a storm in Des Moines on Saturday, the sheer strength of it took people by surprise, according to a news conference on Sunday. ""It’s hard to predict how that water is going to rise and how quickly it’s going to come,"" said Sgt. Paul Parizek, spokesman for Des Moines police. ""The speed and how long that rain fell caught us by surprise."" For the near future, the heavy rain has ended across central Iowa, according to Kelsey Angle, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Des Moines. Between 3 to 8 inches of rain fell rapidly across the Des Moines metro Saturday, contributing to ""catastrophic flooding,"" Angle said. Walnut Creek at 63rd Street recorded the highest crest on record just over 19 feet, Angle said. Take a look from above as water spills over the banks of Walnut Creek in Windsor Heights. Rodney White and Michael Zamora, The Register The Saylorville Lake reservoir is forecast to crest at about 888 feet by next weekend — a depth that is above the lip of the concrete emergency spillway, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday. On Sunday, 20,500 cubic square feet was flowing out. ""We are not anticipating a flood release that is uncontrolled out of Saylorville,"" said Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie. Much of the Des Moines area got 6 to 7 inches of rain in less than three hours Saturday, and the flash flooding resulted in one death, rescues of people stranded in their vehicles, apartment evacuations and a house explosion in Urbandale. At least 100 people have been displaced, according to the American Red Cross. As of 9 a.m. on Sunday, the Saylorville Lake reservoir stands at 878.39 feet, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. It increased over 2 feet in the last 24 hours. Saylorville Lake reached 866.6 feet above sea level Tuesday afternoon, an increase of more than 15 feet in just five days. The top of the dam's spillway is at 884 feet; that figure can be increased to 890 feet with the use of pneumatic crest gates. When in use, the inflatable pneumatic crest gate pushes water back from the lake's spillway dam and allows engineers to keep channeling it through the dam's main gates. This helps control erosion on the spillway. Last Slide Next Slide Saylorville Lake hit a historic high level on July 11, 1993, when it crested at 892 feet above sea level. On June 12, 2008, the lake level rose to 891 feet above sea level. The most heavily damaged areas in the Des Moines area are along Fourmile Creek and Walnut Creek in the metro, said A.J. Mumm, Polk County Emergency Management Director. The worst flooding damages are along the Fourmile Creek from East Douglas Avenue all the way to Pleasant Hill, until it meets the Des Moines River. Damage is along Walnut Creek through Urbandale, Clive, Windsor Heights and Des Moines. Walnut Creek flooded at record levels during Saturday's deluge. A little east of Clive, the creek at 63rd Street in Des Moines set a record when it crested at 11:45 p.m. at 19.08 feet. The previous high was 18.7 in 2015. ""We've seen truly historic crests on both of the waterways,"" Mumm said. Fleur Drive in Des Moines appears to be safe as of Sunday morning, but residents in the eastern side of town should use caution near the Fourmile Creek area, where numerous buildings were evacuated Sunday because of record flooding, said Chad Christensen, Des Moines Public Works flood systems engineer. How to deal with a flooded home: The latest forecast from the National Weather Service in Des Moines shows the Raccoon River cresting at 16.5 feet near Fleur Drive — just on the brink of when water comes on to the road. If no additional rain hits the metro, the road will not have to close, Christensen said. Public works is focusing its attention along the Fourmile Creek area, which was hit with 6 to 10 inches of rain along its base, Christensen said. Drivers are advised to stay away. Road damage has been reported along Second Avenue, where water peeled and displaced the asphalt. Birdland Drive and Prospect Road are also closed. The city closed the gate that’s a part of the Birdland levee across from Saylor Road as a precaution. It’s been all-hands-on-deck in the public works department as crews survey and fix damages since 8 p.m. Saturday, Christensen told the Register.

Evacuations occurred at Pleasant Valley Mobile Home Park in Pleasant Hill and Parkside East Apartments in Des Moines. Transportation: Multiple roads are closed across the metro. Drivers will also find abandoned and flooded vehicles on roads across the metro Sunday. Some tow companies are reporting a three-day wait to clear all vehicles. The overhead floodgate at 63rd Street and Grand Avenue has been closed. Many Des Moines Area Regional Transportation routes are on temporary detours due to flooding. Routes will return to normal as roads reopen throughout the day. Expect delays and call 283-8100 with questions.

MIHIR ZAVERI,"Tropical Storm Lane drenched parts of Hawaii with about four feet of rain as it crept past the state on Saturday, causing flash floods and prompting evacuations even as it dissipated over the islands’ rugged slopes. The storm had weakened over several days from a Category 5 storm, with maximum winds now reaching up to 60 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service. But its plodding pace — just 3 m.p.h. — prolonged the rains. Some 46 inches fell on the eastern side of the Island of Hawaii, where landslides shut down roads and search-and-rescue efforts were underway. Flash flood warnings were still in effect on Saturday morning. Kelly Wooten, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii County Civil Defense, which has been coordinating the emergency response in hard-hit areas on Hawaii Island, said the agency had not yet been able to assess the damage from the storm. She said police, fire and other departments were working to keep people off the roads, as some areas were still under water. Ms. Wooten said no injuries or deaths had been reported so far.

MARY WILLIAMS WALSH,"Yet inland flooding is in some ways more perilous. A study by the National Hurricane Center found that more than half the Americans killed by flooding during hurricanes and tropical storms over a 30-year period had died after the storms moved inland, presenting hazards like flash floods and mudslides and sweeping motorists off flooded roads. And it’s many of the people affected by those hazards who don’t have flood insurance. People near the coasts tend to know their risks. Owners of expensive beach houses often buy even more flood insurance than they have to, because the government’s mandatory coverage is capped at $250,000 per house plus $100,000 for the contents. On top of that, additional “layers” of coverage can be purchased from private insurers. In the Carolinas, a quarter to half of the households near the coast are insured, said Ray Lehmann, a member of SmarterSafer, a coalition of taxpayer groups, environmental organizations, insurers and others that has pushed for flood-insurance reform. Further inland, it’s another story. “We’re talking about places in North Carolina where the coverage is less than 1 percent,” said Mr. Lehmann, also the director of finance, insurance and trade policy at the R Street Institute, a think tank that promotes free-market policies.","Flood waters inundated Lumberton, N.C., on Tuesday following Hurricane Florence.

Andrew Freedman,"A devastating flash flood event in mid-April caused widespread damage on the lush Hawaiian island of Kauai. Now comes word that during the 24-hour period between April 14 and 15, a staggering 49.69 inches of rain fell at a rain gauge about 1 mile west of Hanalei. If this amount is verified by the National Climatic Extremes Committee, which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and serves as a sort of Guinness Book of World Records for weather and climate, it would be the heaviest 24-hour rainfall total ever recorded in the U.S. SEE ALSO: The National Weather Service had to add a new color to its maps to show Harvey's rainfall The current record is 43 inches, set on July 25-26, 1979, in Alvin, Texas. It would also crush the state record of 38 inches, which was also set in Kauai, back in 1956. The committee members will review the rain gage to determine if it was functioning properly at the time of the rainstorm. This particular gage is operated by a nonprofit organization called the WAIPA Foundation. It's possible that the committee will conclude that the amount of rain was actually less than recorded, or conversely, that it underestimated the rainfall total. It's not surprising that a national rainfall record would come from Kauai, since it's rugged terrain contains some of the wettest landscapes on Earth. Mt. Waialeale, for example, receives about 460 inches of rain per year, and is the wettest place in the country. The April rains, though, were unusually intense and widespread, causing flash flooding throughout the island and forcing thousands to evacuate. Homes, businesses, and infrastructure was damaged or destroyed in a disaster that few in the continental U.S. heard of. This rainstorm is in keeping with climate change trends, as global warming is already making extreme precipitation events both more frequent and intense. No studies have yet been done on this particular event to see how climate change affected it, but other research has shown that global warming has made heavy rainfall events, including Hurricane Harvey, which was the most extreme rainstorm on record in the U.S., much more likely.","A devastating flash flood event in mid-April caused widespread damage on the lush Hawaiian island of Kauai.

A new time-lapse video from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) onboard the GOES-17 weather satellite, which launched to space on March 1, 2018, shows flashes of lightning above North and South America, zooming in on a line of storms moving east across the Central U.S. SEE ALSO: Satellite Captures Stunning Swirl at Bottom of Globe Note: The mapper does more than just take pretty pictures of what's happening back on Earth. ""The mapper observes lightning in the Western Hemisphere, giving forecasters an indication of when a storm is forming, intensifying, and becoming more dangerous. Rapid increases of lightning are a signal that a storm may strengthen quickly and could produce severe weather,"" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in a statement. ""During heavy rain, GLM data can show when thunderstorms are stalled or if they are gathering strength. When combined with radar and other satellite data, GLM data will help forecasters anticipate severe weather and issue flood and flash flood warnings sooner."" GOES-17 isn't the only satellite keeping an eye on lightning on Earth. The GOES-16 satellite also watches out for large thunderstorms rolling across the U.S. on behalf of weather forecasters and scientists on the ground. And astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station are able to see thunderstorms from 250 miles above the planet's surface. Over the years, the space station's crew members have taken gorgeous time-lapse videos of thunder storms swirling below them.

Travis Fedschun,"A torrent of heavy rain spawned flash floods across northern New Jersey on Saturday, sending cars from a dealership down a river and striking a highway overpass. In video taken from an overpass on Route 46 in Little Falls, located about 20 miles west of New York City, several cars can be seen floating away down the Peckman River in Passaic County from the parking lot of a dealership. The vehicles, which still have sticker prices available on the windshield, swiftly float down the swollen river as onlookers watched the scene unfold. CAUTION: STRONG LANGUAGE IN THE VIDEO BELOW The vehicles eventually knock into each other and pile up as drivers stranded on the highway react. The National Weather Service's New York office had issued a flood advisory at the time for the region. ""Showers &amp; thunderstorms producing heavy rain will move across the area causing urban and small stream flooding,"" the NWS said. ""Overflowing poor drainage areas will result in minor flooding in the advisory area."" The NWS noted that 12 inches of fast-moving water can carry away a small car.

Patricia Kitchen,"Long Islanders can expect heavy rain and potential flash flooding Thursday as a cold front from the west interacts with tropical moisture from the south, forecasters said. Associated with Tropical Storm Michael, the moisture, surging northward from eastern North Carolina and Virginia, will move up into the area this afternoon and tonight, the National Weather Service said in a flash flood watch. The watch is in effect for the entire metropolitan region. On Long Island, the watch lasts from noon through late Thursday. The storm itself will stay to the south, moving off the coast and into the mid-Atlantic later in the day, according to the National Hurricane Center track. Look for showers and a few thunderstorms starting late morning to early afternoon, said Joe Pollina, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Upton. Long Island is looking at 1.5 to 2 inches of rain Thursday, with 2 to 4 possible in some spots, the watch said. Any heavy precipitation falling within a one- to three-hour time frame could result in flash flooding. With the Island already having had an abundance of recent precipitation, the ground is still rather moist and with up to 2 inches of rain or even a bit more possible, there will be some local flooding to contend with, said News 12 Long Island meteorologist Bill Korbel. Isolated minor coastal flooding is expected with the morning to early afternoon high tide cycle, particularly for the most vulnerable spots along the South Shore bays of Nassau County.

The weather service issued a small craft advisory from noon to 6 a.m. Friday for seas of 7 to 11 feet and a gale warning until 6 p.m. Friday, both for waters off the South Shore. There is also a small craft advisory for the Long Island Sound. Thursday should be the last day with highs in the mid-70s for the near future as the cold front moves in. Thursday's low will be near 61. ""We have big changes coming our way,"" said News 12 Long Island meteorologist Rich Hoffman. ""Go find those jackets, because youre going to need them by the weekend."" Showers continue into Friday morning, with cloudy skies gradually becoming mostly sunny. The day also sees an increase in winds from the northwest, with a few gusts of 35 to 40 mph possible. Highs will be in the mid-60s with lows dropping all the way to the low 40s. Saturday and Sunday will have highs near 60 and lows near 50. ""Overall most of the weekend looks good for outdoor fall events just watching wet weather Saturday morning,"" Hoffman said. This will be the first time this month that daily highs dip to below normal, which at this point is 64 degrees at Long Island MacArthur Airport in Ronkonkoma. As of day-end Wednesday, the month so far was averaging 10.2 degrees above normal.","Newsday Long Island weather: Heavy rain, flash flood watch Thursday Newsday Long Islanders can expect heavy rain and potential flash flooding Thursday as a cold front from the west interacts with tropical moisture from the south, forecasters said.

Matt Simon,"California continues to take stock of its unprecedented conflagrations between the Camp Fire in the north, which on its own is the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, and the Woolsey Fire in the south, 82 lives have been lost so far, with hundreds more still missing. As firefighters keep battling the blazes, a new menace is emerging: debris flows. The rains are coming to California, as soon as Tuesday night, and the fires have primed the soil for another disaster that can claim yet more lives. The coastal town of Montecito, in Southern California, learned this lesson less than a year ago. Last December, the massive Thomas Fire burned through the hills, right up to the edges of town. Thanks to the communitys comprehensive fire preparedness plan, only 7 homes were lost. But a month later, the scorched hills outside of town let loose a storm-driven debris flow that enveloped the town, killing 21. The problem is a fundamental change to the soil itself. When a wildfire burns vegetation, it releases organic compounds. These compounds are heated in the fire, volatilize, and then re-condense on soil particles, says Brian Ebel, a hydrologist with the USGS. This soil normally absorbs water, but the organic compounds turn it hydrophobic, literally meaning fear of water. It is not an understatement: You can pour a bottle of water on this burned soil and itll bead right off, as if the dirt were polished marble. The water will pool up and sit there, and it can take more than an hour for it to penetrate fire-scorched soil, says Ebel. Problem number two: vegetation anchors the soil. When fire burns it away, the soil loosens. You can think of vegetation as a protective blanket, says Jason Kean, a hydrologist at the USGS. Without it, sediment has nothing to hold it in place. Before there's even rain, debris can roll down the hill and accumulate in channels. Now hydrologists and meteorologists are keeping a close eye on communities that butt up against these latest fires, where the conditions are set for catastrophic debris flows when the rain comes. Once it starts raining hard on a burn area, the things can get generated really fast, like five minutes, says Kean. The debris flow can carry boulders and trees along with mud, making it more dangerous than a regular flood or a dry landslide. When you mobilize themkeep them mobile with this muddy matrix in between themthey can go 3 kilometers, says Kean. The video below shows just how easily the flow tosses boulders around. Boulders can also act like a moving dam, retarding the flow. So you get this surging behavior, where these things are holding back a whole bunch of flow behind it, adds Kean. It really makes the flow depth increase several times what you'd get in a water-only flood. The Montecito debris flow got to be 30 feet deep at points, lodging boulders in trees. Humans are powerless to stop itsandbags just become more debris for the flow. But it can be predicted, giving residents a chance to evacuate. The work begins as soon as a wildfires smoke clears enough for satellites to get a good look at how badly areas have burned. This information is relayed to scientists on the ground, who enter those burned regions as soon as its safe. The greatest risk of debris flow is in the zones that burned the most intensely, and scientists spend two or three days wandering the fire perimeter taking soil samples. That involves testing the hydrophobicity of the soil, the water repellency, says Eric Huff, staff chief of Cal Fires Forest Practice Program, and actually getting down on hands and knees and looking at what that surface soil layer is showing, whether or not organic matter has been completely burned off. Kean and his colleagues then compare this data to their understanding of where debris flows have let loose in the area historically, building a map that captures the probability and potential volume of a debris flow. They also identify values at riskhuman life and structures that may be in danger. With all this data in mind, they can calculate how much rain you would need to potentially let loose a debris flow for different regions of the map. Often half an inch of rain in an hour is enough to kick one off, or as little as five minutes of heavy rain. It's kind of a run-of-the-mill storm, says Kean. It's heavy rain, but it's not particularly exceptional. So the National Weather Service carefully watches storms as they head into California. (Unfortunately, with climate change, California may see fewer yet more intense storms going forward.) As the rain approaches the coast, officials can send out wireless alerts, like you would get for an Amber alert, as well as warnings on TV and radio. Which brings us back to the Montecito disaster. Forecasters saw the storm coming, predicting it would drop an inch and a half of rain an hour. What we saw in reality that night was a 30-minute heavy rain that moved through that area, says Eric Boldt, a warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service. It was closer to six and a half inches per hour. And there's no computer models that exist today that can predict that type of rate. Officials had put voluntary evacuation orders in place, but not everyone heeded the advice. This was just after the Thomas Fire, after all. They had just been evacuated for two or three weeks over the holiday season, says Boldt. They were just getting comfortable back in their homes and they didn't want to leave again. If you havent cleared out in time and the flow comes, the recommendation is to shelter in placemoving to the upper story of your house, for instance. Out on the streets is exactly where you don't want to be, as the flow follows those paths. We've even seen people, if they were able to get up on their countertops in their kitchen, the mud came up to about that level, says Boldt. It's a different way of thinking about the impact because it's not the same as a flash flood. With a flash flood, you can see a river swelling and move to higher ground. Flee up a hill just before a debris flow, though, and that ground could kill you. The debris flow risk can persist for up to five years after a wildfire. So residents whose homes narrowly survived a wildfire may not realize theyre in danger of the surrounding hills for longer than a year. But the danger is most certainly there. Its a brutal consideration for those trying to recover from the Camp and Woolsey fires, but its also an extremely important one. A menace begets another menace.

Klint Finley,"Even if you're not a gadget geek, you likely know whether your laptop is powered by an Intel chip or one from a competitor like AMD. The sticker plastered next to your keyboard won't let you forget. But even if you know your Ryzens from your Ice Lakes, you probably don't put much thought into who makes the memory chips that store your data and keep your laptop and smartphone working. There’s a decent chance at least one of your gadgets includes memory made by a company called Micron Technology. Boise, Idaho-based Micron is one of only three outfits that still make DRAM, the chips that provide short-term memory in personal computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices. Micron, which also sells products under the brand name Crucial, is the smallest of the three with a market share of around 21 percent, but it's the only one based in the US. Micron also makes another kind of memory, called flash, where it faces more competition and holds about 13 percent of the market. That’s helped Micron build a pretty good business, thanks to strong demand for memory for everything from smartphones to cloud computing servers. The company generated $20 billion in revenue last year, putting it among the world’s five largest semiconductor companies, ahead of better known companies like Nvidia and Texas Instruments. Micron shares have more than doubled in the past year, giving the company a market value approaching $70 billion. Not bad for a company few outside the chip industry have heard of, based far outside traditional high-tech hubs. With success comes challenges, though. Memory chips are considered commodities with little differentiation among them, making competition notoriously brutal, and marked by boom and bust cycles. Micron’s two larger rivals, Samsung and SK Hynix, are part of better-heeled, more diversified Korean conglomerates. Now, China plans to throw its awesome manufacturing capability and the resources of the world’s second-largest economy into the game. To survive, Micron is counting on continued growth as computing power is built into more devices, from TVs to cars and robots. ""We believe artificial intelligence and machine learning and autonomous driving applications will present huge areas of opportunity for Micron,"" CEO Sanjay Mehrotra tells WIRED. Mehrotra was a cofounder of the flash-memory maker SanDisk who joined Micron last year after SanDisk was acquired. Key to his strategy is developing new technology that can distinguish Micron from rivals. Prime example: a new type of memory called 3D Xpoint that Micron developed with Intel that is intended to bridge the gap between DRAM and flash memory. DRAM, short for dynamic random-access memory, loses most of the data it stores when power is shut off. Flash memory can store data long term, and is much cheaper than DRAM, but it’s slower. So most computing devices use both: DRAM for short-term memory, and flash (which has largely replaced mechanical disk drives) for long-term storage. Micron pitches 3D Xpoint as faster than flash but cheaper than DRAM, which could be a boon for applications that depend on large data sets, such as artificial intelligence. Most important, says Objective Analysis analyst Jim Handy, it's patented technology that customers won't be able to get anywhere but Intel and Micron. From Potatoes to Silicon Micron was founded in 1978 by three former engineers for Texas-based memory maker Mostek, along with one cofounder’s twin brother. The team spent their early years doing consulting work for Mostek out of the basement of a dentist's office in Boise. Micron lost its contract after United Technologies acquired Mostek in 1979, so the team decided to start making its own DRAM chips. That meant competing not only with Mostek, but with Intel, which pioneered DRAMs. Instead of relocating to Texas or Silicon Valley, the company raised money locally, most notably from potato tycoon J.R. Simplot, who made a fortune selling frozen french fries to McDonalds. Micron's chips quickly found their way into the first wave of personal computers, such as the Commodore 64, and Micron went public in 1984. The timing wasn’t great. Japanese companies were flooding the market with cheap chips, leading seven North American semiconductor companies, including Intel, to exit the DRAM business by the end of 1985. In response to Japan's aggressive moves in the semiconductor industry, the Reagan administration imposed tariffs on Japanese computers, power tools, and televisions. But additional competition from Taiwanese and South Korean companies brought more chips, pushing DRAM prices down. Analysts say Micron survived largely because of its ability to hone its manufacturing technology, reducing its costs even when chip prices are low. Memory chip prices tend to soar when new technologies are developed, which slows down the manufacturing process and decreases supply, explains IDC analyst Shane Rau. Once the manufacturing kinks are worked out, prices drop as chip makers increase supply. ""The most important thing is that they're willing to stay in the market even during downturns,"" Handy says. ""Micron sees downturns as an opportunity to buy competitors for pennies on the dollar."" In 1998, for example, it bought Texas Instruments' memory business for $800 million; in 2012, it bought Japanese chipmaker Elpida Memory for $2.5 billion. ""One thing is we were willing to take some pretty significant risks and bet big on our technology,"" says Micron executive VP of technology development Scott DeBoer. ""The Elpida Memory acquisition looks brilliant in hindsight, but at the time it was controversial."" Snapping up competitors also helped the company improve its technology and its manufacturing processes. ""We consolidated all the best memory talent in North America,"" DeBoer says. Looming Threat Micron's tenacity has paid off, at least for now. There's a shortage of both flash and DRAM, so prices have been high. With only three significant companies vying for the DRAM market, prices are less volatile. And thanks to the rise of smartphones and other mobile devices, Micron's sales are no longer dependent on trends in the personal computer business. Thursday, Micron reported record quarterly revenue of $7.4 billion and net income of $3.3 billion. But Handy warns DRAM is still a cyclical business, and another downturn is inevitable. ""When things are bad, people think they will never be good again, and when things are good they think they'll never be bad again,"" he says. China is the biggest looming threat to the memory industry’s established players. Today, China imports the majority of its chips and exports very few. But the country is trying to change that through through its $20 billion Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund. If China can flood the US with cheap chips, it could be the 1980s again for the memory industry. Competitors like Samsung and SK Hynix can subsidize losses from their memory divisions with sales from other divisions, but Micron has nothing else to fall back on. But DeBoer says its focus on the memory market is also an advantage. ""When our backs were against the wall, we had to make memory work because there was nothing to fall back on,"" he says. That’s going to mean developing new memory technologies, such as 3D Xpoint. The new technology comes with a catch: Even if 3D Xpoint is successful, it could cannibalize Micron’s DRAM sales, because applications wouldn’t have to depend on as heavily on short term memory. DeBoer says that's a risk Micron is willing to take. ""We're a memory company, if something is going to disrupt DRAM, we need to be the ones to do it,"" he says. In the Chips The Turing Award, computing's Nobel Prize, was awarded to two men who helped pioneer and popularize a new chip architecture.

ANDREW R. CHOW,"A rescue team arrived at the scene, between the towns of Mullins and Nichols — about a half mile from the rising Little Pee Dee River — and took the deputies to safety. Mr. Richardson described the two women who died as patients who were being taken from McLeod Loris Hospital to a mental health center in Darlington, S.C. The authorities did not specify why the women were being moved. As of late Tuesday night, the bodies had not been recovered or identified. “It’s so rough over there with the high current, and dark, that we’d figured it would be safer to do the retrieval in the morning,” Mr. Richardson said. Unrelenting rain in the Carolinas has caused rivers to overflow and spill out over roads, prompting officials to issue flash flood advisories issued across the states. The storm has been blamed for more than 30 deaths.

"Kelly Murray, CNN","(CNN)As if one winter storm around the holidays wasn't enough, a new one is taking shape for New Year's Eve, bringing more heavy rain and a renewed flood threat.
It comes on the heels of the deadly storm system that plagued much of the Midwest, South and East over Christmas. 
The worst is over as that storm pushes offshore into the Atlantic. But it killed at least six people in the Midwest and South and brought blizzard conditions, a foot of snow, and winds exceeding 55 mph to the Great Plains and Upper Midwest on Thursday. It then ripped across the East with heavy rainfall and winds.
On Friday, more than 50 million people were under the threat of floods, with flood watches and warnings stretching from the Gulf Coast to New Jersey. 
Flash flooding affected Southern Mississippi and Alabama, triggering dangerous situations and high-water rescues. Up to a foot of rain fell in less than a day.
The rough weather made holiday travel even more of a headache. There were nearly 9,000 flight delays into, within or out of the country Friday, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware.
As of Saturday, flood watches have been largely discontinued, but there are still warnings for some rivers in the South, particularly across southern Mississippi and Alabama, according to CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera.
""I'm not expecting the foot of rain some areas in the Southern US received,"" Cabrera said. ""An additional 1 to 3 inches may renew flooding concerns due to saturated soils. Some areas in the South will in fact make a run for wettest year on record with the last few storms filling rain gauges to record levels.""
Forecast radar images for Saturday show rain persisting in coastal areas of the Southeast, but it should clear out for inland cities, including Atlanta and Charlotte.
The letup won't last long, however. On Sunday, moisture emanating from the Gulf of Mexico will bring a band of showers to southeastern Texas and then stretch across southern Louisiana, all the way up through the Carolinas.
Then, on the last day of 2018, another storm will bring rain, although less heavy, to the North and East, Cabrera said.
Conditions will be wet, but temperatures will be mild in much of the Southeast -- in the 60s and 70s -- and in the 40s in the Northeast as New Year's Eve revelers welcome 2019.","As if one winter storm around the holidays wasn't enough, a new one is taking shape for New Year's Eve, bringing more heavy rain and a renewed flood threat.

Reuters,"Flash flood warnings were raised on the Hawaii island of Kauai on Tuesday County of Kauai Flash flood warnings were issued on Tuesday for the Hawaiian island of Kauai, with residents on the north coast told to evacuate and others left stranded by high water as remnants of Hurricane Lane drenched the archipelago and a new storm brewed in the Pacific Ocean. Hawaii was spared a direct hit from a major hurricane as Lane diminished to a tropical storm as it approached and then drifted west, further from land. But rain was still pounding the island chain, touching off flooding on Oahu and Kauai. ""It has been a steady rain since after Lane but I got up 2:30 a.m. (Hawaiian Standard Time) to the National Weather Service flash flood advisory and that's when we put out the release as well as an island-wide telephone call,"" County of Kauai spokesman Alden Alayvilla said. The advisory urged residents near Hanalei Bridge on the north side of the island to evacuate their homes due to rising stream levels. A convoy that had been used to escort residents over roads damaged by historic floods in April between was shut down, leaving many cut off. ""Heavy pounding and hazardous conditions are being reported island-wide. Motorists are advised to drive with extreme caution. Updates will be given as more information is made available,"" the Kauai Emergency Management Agency said. A flash flood watch also remained in effect for Oahu, home to the state capital Honolulu and 70 percent of Hawaii's 1.4 million residents. Micco Godinez, who lives on the north side of Kauai, said he found the only road out of Hanalei, where he lives, barricaded by police vehicles when he tried to leave for work on Tuesday morning. He expected to be stranded for at least another day. ""I can't get out at all,"" Godinez said. ""Our little community of Hanalei is isolated and then west of us is even more isolated,"" he said. Even as Hawaii residents sought to recover from Lane, they kept a watchful eye on Tropical Storm Miriam, spinning in the Pacific Ocean some 2,000 miles to the east and expected to become a hurricane by the time it approaches the islands. ""Miriam is supposed to go north and dissipate in the colder waters and drier air, so I'm not really worried about it,"" Godinez said. ""But it is hurricane season, and there's another one behind that.

Even in an age of ubiquitous mobile phones and social media accounts, tracking down missing people has proved arduous. It took months to track down the more than 2,200 people unaccounted for in Sonoma County after the fires incinerated thousands of homes in October last year. The death toll was finalized at 24. The town of Paradise, which had a population of 27,000, has remained evacuated since the fire.

That's not going to stop New Yorkers from getting where they need to be. In case you thought ducking into a subway station would provide some relief from the rain, we regret to inform you that is not always the case. In fact, sometimes the rain is just as bad underground, if not worse, since you're basically trapped underground and soaking wet. Plus, there's no telling what that water has been through before making it into the subway. It's not just the stations that are flooding, but the entrances and stairs as well, leaving commuters soaked both from the bottom and the top. It's almost like an avant-garde fountain display that absolutely no one asked for. People likened the indoor downpours to natural wonders, like waterfalls and oases.

US astronaut Ricky Arnold shared images of the hurricane, now a category-4 storm, on his Twitter. He said he took them early on Wednesday morning, which could mean it was still at the more dangerous category-5 level when pictured. ""The crew of the @Space_Station sends much aloha to everyone there,"" he wrote. The hurricane's path is unpredictable and meteorologists say it isn't yet clear whether it will make landfall. But officials are still warning of devastating effects. The National Weather Service warned of ""life-threatening impacts"" in some areas. Governor David Ige told residents to prepare two weeks worth of food and water and to find shelter, according to Hawaiian newspaper the Star Advertiser. But local media reports say that shops on the island are running out of food and supplies. Ige signed a Presidential Disaster Declaration from the state, which means it can get financial and physical assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The hurricane had risen to a category-5 storm — the strongest that can form on planet — on Wednesday. But it has slowed as it got closer to Hawaii.

Bill Chappell,"Ellicott City, Md.'s Main Street was turned into a raging river on Sunday, in a catastrophe that followed another flash flood in 2016. The water wrecked storefronts and left cars strewn amid debris on Monday. Katherine Frey/The Washington Post/Getty Images Fast-moving flood waters caused mayhem in Ellicott City, Md., on Sunday, triggering an emergency declaration and urgent messages for residents to seek higher ground. One man remains missing, as crews work to clear the area. Howard County Police say Eddison Hermond, 39, of Severn, Md., is unaccounted for; they're asking the public to help find him. Washington-area radio news outlet WTOP describes Hermond as ""an Air Force veteran and a member of the National Guard."" A friend of Hermond's told WTOP that the veteran had been in a restaurant in downtown Ellicott City on Sunday; witnesses said he was swept away after trying to help people. Swiftwater rescue teams searched for Hermond last night, both on foot and in all-terrain vehicles – but the search was suspended and resumed on Monday, according to the Arbutus Volunteer Fire Department. Founded in 1772, Ellicott City's Main Street and downtown have been designated a historic district. The same area suffered massive flooding in 2016, when the city barely avoided having to tear down any buildings in a long and expensive rebuilding effort. In that catastrophe in July of 2016, two people died in what was called a ""once in a 1,000 years"" event. But in 2018, it has happened again, devastating an area that, due to its valley setting, had endured other floods in the past. ******* MISSING PERSON ALERT IN ELLICOTT CITY ******* this is eddison hermond. he was swept away in the ellicott city flooding yesterday around 5pm trying to help people and hasn't been seen or heard from since. if you have any news, please contact me #EllicottCityFlood pic.twitter.com/moxxJm1Sjj — Kenneth Josepha (@Kdogcony76) May 28, 2018 Rain storms have been seen growing more intense in recent years – but part of the difference, at least one expert says, also lies in how the area's land surface has changed. Discussing Ellicott City after the 2016 flash flood, Jeffrey B. Halverson, a geography professor at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, told member station WAMU : ""It's heavily paved, there's lots of narrow streets that act as very rapid conduits of water – so the flood was as much about the nature of the underlying land surface as it was the large amount of rain falling from the sky."" Intense flooding hit the town's Main Street in at least two waves on Sunday, shoving cars down the street and bursting through storefronts – including at several buildings where people found themselves suddenly trapped in stores and restaurants. Images and video from the scene are striking, showing fast-moving water rising nearly as high as the bottom edge of the streets' stop signs and obliterating anything in the torrent's path. One day after the flooding hit, people are reaching out to help. The Howard County government says anyone who wants to volunteer can register at its website – but that for now, the downtown area remains off-limits. The Visit Ellicott City organization says a local non-profit called the Ellicott City Partnership is taking donations to help the community recover from the flood, as it did in 2016. On Monday, conditions had dried out enough that salvage crews could begin towing vehicles that had been caught in the disaster.","Less than two years after what had been called a ""once in a 1,000 years"" flood in 2016, Ellicott City, Md., sees its historic downtown ravaged anew.

Associated Press,"(LOS ANGELES) — Officials say about 21,000 people have been evacuated from neighborhoods beneath hillsides laid bare by California’s largest-ever wildfire and other recent blazes as a storm raises fears of flash floods and debris flows. Robert Lewin, director of the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management, is urging residents of Summerland, Carpinteria and Montecito to leave by mid-Monday. The hillside communities were evacuated last month as the massive Thomas Fire raged. Evacuations also include homes near other burn areas dating to 2016. Lewin says flash floods can turn normally dry creeks into destructive rivers of mud and debris that can wash out roads and destroy homes. The first significant storm of the season is walloping much of the state with heavy rain, snow and strong winds.

The dam is near the town of Ali Chuk, which is less than 1 mile from Mexico. The National Weather Service said a flash flood warning for the town would expire Wednesday night. More than 30 people were evacuated from another area on tribal land where high water was close to overtopping berms. Rosa brought several inches of rain to areas of Arizona.

Sinéad Baker,"A map showing the approach of Hurricane Lane to Hawaii, the islands of which are partly obscured by the cloud formations. National Weather Service/Business Insider A category-5 hurricane with winds of up to 160mph (257 kmph) is barrelling towards Hawaii, prompting emergency services to issue urgent warnings for people to protect themselves. Authorities say devastating flooding could accompany Hurricane Lane making landfall, and have warned residents to prepare for potential evacuations. Hurricane Lane was updated to a category-5 storm — the strongest level that can form on planet — by the National Hurricane Center early Wednesday. In a statement, they said ""preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion."" Winds are expected to slow as the hurricane gets closer to the island, so may not be 160mph on land, though they still pose a risk. Official hurricane warnings have been issued for a number of islands including Hawaii's Big Island. Hurricane watches, a less serious category of warning, are in place for other islands. Flash flood warnings and high surf warnings are also in place. A hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected, and is issued 36 hours in advance to allow people to prepare. See the warnings issued by the National Weather Service as of 11 p.m. Tuesday (5 a.m. Wednesday EDT) here: Warnings in place across Hawaii's islands issued by the National Weather Service. National Weather Service A flash flood warning for the entire state is in place from Wednesday to Friday, according to the Department of Emergency Management. ""A Flash Flood Watch means that conditions may develop that lead to flash flooding. Flash flooding is a VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION,"" the department warned. The National Weather Service told citizens to prepare for possible emergency evacuations. ""Failure to adequately shelter may result in serious injury or loss of life,"" the service said. The warnings cautioned against heavy rains that could result in flooding even outside of designated zones, and warned that rods could become ""impassible."" ""The risk of flooding will only increase as hurricane Lane approaches, the National Weather Service tweeted on Tuesday, before the storm was upgraded to category 5. The storm is likely to make landfall on Hawaii's islands later this week according to the National Hurricane Center. Only four named storms have made landfall there, a series of small targets in a large ocean, since 1959, according to CNN. As of early Wednesday, the storm was south-southeast of Kailua-Kona, according to the center. It has become the second-ever category 5 storm to pass within 350 miles of the island, according to the National Weather Service in Honolulu. The only other category 5 storm to get this close was Hurricane John in 1994.

Local authorities say several months' worth of rain fell in just a few hours overnight, leaving roads blocked in some areas. One woman was swept away by the River Aude, local broadcaster BFMTV reports. Alain Thirion, the prefect of Aude, said people were stranded on rooftops and would have to be evacuated by air because it was too dangerous by boat. One person was injured, he added, when a house collapsed in the locality of Cuxac. Residents have been urged to stay inside their homes by emergency services and local authorities, who have issued a red alert. The floods are the worst the Aude river has seen in more than 100 years, according to the weather monitoring service Vigicrues.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by AJ Dellinger to Gizmodo","Just an extremely normal radar loop of a tropical cyclone over Indiana. GIF: National Weather Service The early start to hurricane season continues with what could be the first landfalling tropical cyclone to make it to Lake Michigan on record. Tropical Depression Alberto has been the weird storm that could, improbably moving from the Gulf of Mexico to Indiana. The last advisory the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued for the storm, which came at 4 p.m. Central Time, noted that flash flood watches associated with the storm extend across the Appalachians from Georgia to Virginia. The storm already triggered flooding in North Carolina earlier on Wednesday. But the real weird part is where Alberto is centered, 70 miles south of South Bend, Indiana where the outer bands are already bringing rain to the city. South Bend itself is about 25 miles southeast of Lake Michigan, and the storm’s current track could clip or even make it all the way to the lake. That would make Alberto the first tropical system to ever hit Lake Michigan’s shores (h/t hurricane expert Brian McNoldy ). Beyond Lake Michigan, only seven tropical systems have ever made it to the Great Lakes according to data on historical hurricane tracks maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. All have struck Lakes Huron, Erie or Ontario, the three easternmost lakes. Of the tropical systems that have made it that far north, three even managed to hit the lakes as full blown hurricanes. In comparison, Alberto is quite a bit weaker. It’s currently a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph. But its present status just adds to Alberto’s strange tale. The storm has been a meteorological oddity since its inception in the Gulf of Mexico. It spun up there as a subtropical storm, borrowing elements from tropical weather like hurricanes and extratropical weather like nor’easters. The storm made landfall along the Gulf Coast over the weekend in its subtropical form. But rather than petering out or going full extratropical, the storm made a bizarre transition to a tropical system over land. On Tuesday, the NHC began calling the storm Tropical Depression Alberto. Since then, it has chugged through the Midwest with heavy rain bands swirling around its center. The storm could be maintaining its tropical nature through “brown ocean effect,” a gross-sounding meteorological phenomenon where waterlogged soil can mimic the ocean and provide fuel to storms (Marshall Shepherd, the atmospheric scientist who helped coin the term, has a great primer on it if you want to geek out). Regardless of whether it makes landfall ( or is it waterfall ?) on the shores of Lake Michigan, Alberto has been a whacky kickoff to hurricane season.",The early start to hurricane season continues with what could be the first landfalling tropical cyclone to make it to Lake Michigan on record.

The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning to parts of the coast from northern New Jersey to southeastern Massachusetts as “low pressure moving across the Southeast” brings with it “widespread precipitation and windy conditions” along the coast. The residual weather conditions from Hurricane Willa, which was a Category 5 hurricane over the eastern Pacific before making landfall as a tropical storm, are helping to fuel the nor’easter, which could deliver gusts from 40 to 60 mph, AccuWeather reported, citing senior meteorologist Dave Dombek. The worst of the storm is expected to hit between early Saturday and Saturday afternoon.

KHMER TIMES,"JAKARTA: Dozens of tourists were evacuated on Sunday from a waterfall site hit by landslides in the Indonesian holiday island of Lombok, where two people died, authorities said.
Two moderate earthquakes struck Lombok on Sunday afternoon, triggering the landslides when tourists were visiting the Tiu Kelep waterfall, north of the island, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster agency, said in a statement.
The disaster agency said the two people who died were both Malaysians, but state news agency Antara reported only one was a Malaysian.
Fourteen Indonesians and 22 other Malaysians were rescued from the waterfall site, Nugroho said.
In Indonesias easternmost province of Papua, flash floods and landslides triggered by torrential rain had killed at least 58 people, injured dozens and displaced more than 4,000, authorities said on Sunday.
A search for more possible victims was under way in the town of Sentani, which was hit by flash floods late on Saturday. 51 people were killed and 74 injured there, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the national disaster agency, told a news briefing.
Heavy rain caused landslides in the nearby provincial capital of Jayapura, killing seven there, Nugroho said.

USA TODAY FILE - In this Nov. 16, 2018, file photo, a firefighter searches for human remains in a trailer park destroyed in the Camp Fire, in Paradise, Calif. The massive wildfire that killed dozens of people and destroyed thousands of homes has been fully contained after burning for more than two weeks, authorities said Sunday, Nov. 25. (AP Photo/John Locher, File) ORG XMIT: NY901 (Photo: John Locher, AP) As if the devastation from the recent wildfires wasn't enough, Northern California had another battle brewing with Mother Nature on Thursday: flash flooding. Three weeks after the devastating Camp Fire began, flooding closed part of California Route 99 in Butte County, stranding some motorists and spurring evacuation orders along multiple roads, according to the National Weather Service and the Butte County Sheriff. Rainfall over the burn scar also forced debris flow in and near the burn area. Residents in the Camp Fire burn area should be on alert for life-threatening flooding of creeks, roads and hillsides, the weather service said. Heavy rain may also likely trigger rockslides, mudslides and debris flows in steep terrain. @CALFIRE_ButteCo Swiftwater Rescue Team deployed to the Butte Creek Canyon along with other firefighters and used one of the team's boats to evacuate people from three homes in the area. pic.twitter.com/re8PAMeINy — CAL FIRE Butte Unit/Butte County Fire Department (@CALFIRE_ButteCo) November 30, 2018 Firefighters used a rescue boat to evacuate people from thee homes in the town of Butte Creek Canyon, according to the local fire department's twitter page. A warning for Central Butte County, which includes the decimated town of Paradise, was in effect Thursday night, the Sacramento National Weather Service said. About two inches of rain fell by mid afternoon near the burn area. The heaviest rain fell between Chico and Paradise, extending west to Durham. Streams flowing out of the burn area were forecast to cause flooding near Chico and Durham, the weather service said. Residents were told to move from recently burned areas and find higher ground if they noticed movement of soil, debris, or large amounts of water. Firefighters contained the Camp Fire, the nation's deadliest fire in a century, on Sunday. It burned 153,336 acres and destroyed nearly 19,000 structures after starting Nov. 8 as a brush fire, according to the the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

Minor debris flow, rockslides and mudslides were possible across Woolsey, South and Stone burn areas. Downtown Los Angeles, Malibu, San Fernando Valley and Santa Clarita valley and mountains, could experience flooding, the weather service said. Travel delays during rush hour were predicted.

 The town of Sentani was one of the worst affected areas
At least 58 people have been killed in flash floods in the eastern Indonesian province of Papua.
Rescue workers are struggling to reach remote parts of the province, and there are fears the number of dead may rise.
Roads have been blocked by landslides and fallen trees, and floodwaters have damaged two bridges and more than 100 houses.
More than 4,000 people have been forced from their homes, and some are sheltering in government offices.
Local residents said torrential rain began on Saturday evening and continued into the night, triggering mudslides and flash floods.

""Our house was flooded with thick mud... we immediately grabbed our valuables and ran to a neighbour's [two-storey] house to seek refuge,"" said mother-of-two Lili Puji Hastuti, quoted by Agence France-Presse.
""It's hard to get out of the area because many roads are blocked... I'm worried, sad and scared all at once.""
The search for victims continues in the town of Sentani, one of the worst affected areas. 
Fifty-one people were killed in the town, national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said, quoted by Reuters news agency.
The other seven confirmed deaths were in the nearby provincial capital Jayapura, Mr Nugroho added.
However, a five-month-old baby was rescued in the city after being trapped under the rubble for hours, according to the military.
Meanwhile a propeller aircraft was partly crushed on the runway of Jayapura airport.
Flooding is common in Indonesia, especially during the October-April rainy season.
In January, floods killed at least 70 people on the island of Sulawesi, and heavy rain in West Java earlier in March displaced hundreds.
Emergency officials say that in recent months they had warned the Papuan authorities of flood risks due to deforestation of mountains surrounding Jayapura.

JESS BIDGOOD,"• Hurricane Lane was expected to bring tropical storm and hurricane-force winds to parts of Hawaii, with up to 30 inches of rain in some areas, according to the National Weather Service. The storm was approaching Hawaii on Wednesday. • President Trump issued an emergency declaration for the State of Hawaii on Thursday morning, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts. • The state’s 15 airports were set to remain open during the storm, barring infrastructure damage. As of Thursday morning, flightaware.com reported some delays at airports across the islands. The approach of Hurricane Lane is the third time in less than a year that Hawaii has braced for potential disaster. In January, an errant emergency alert about an incoming ballistic missile triggered an island-wide panic. In May, the Kilauea Volcano began to erupt, sending lava rolling over roads and homes in the same area that is now under a flash flood watch. Photo Alex Krivoulian, right, stocked up on water in Honolulu. Residents have been advised to gather supplies of food and water that could last them as long as 14 days. Credit Kat Wade/Getty Images And yet, with strong hurricanes rare in this part of the world, the threat of Hurricane Lane felt new and deeply unsettling to some residents, who heeded the National Weather Service’s advice that preparations to safeguard life and property should be “rushed to completion.” “Maui has not faced anything like this before. It’s serious,” Audrey Reed, 76, a resident of that island, said on Wednesday. “We’ve got everything we need: batteries, water, canned and dry foods, medication, first-aid kit, flashlights. It’s just a matter now of hunkering down and trying to ride it out.” Hawaii’s remote geography and mountainous terrain could pose challenges for recovery in the event of widespread damage, and Gov. Ige urged people to have a 14-day supply of food before the storm. Hurricane Lane arrives as other parts of the nation are still recovering from the megastorms of 2017. Hurricane Harvey hit Houston almost exactly one year ago, causing dozens of deaths and catastrophic flooding, and it was followed by Hurricane Irma’s wallop to Florida. Then came Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, which may have killed more than 1,400 people, according to one analysis, and caused massive power outages. Some of the last customers were still getting their power back earlier this month.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Violent storms across swathes of the Southeast have caused several deaths and caused major flooding this weekend, with landslides also reported in several areas. Rain in parts of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee reached an astonishing one to one and a half feet, according to CBS News contributing meteorologist Jeff Berardelli.
Per the Associated Press, a tornado in Columbus, Mississippi killed one woman in a house undergoing renovation, while a man in Knox County, Tennessee drowned after his vehicle was submerged in floodwaters. The tornado resulted in 12 other injuries, but they are not believed to be life-threatening, Columbus Mayor Robert Smith Sr. told the AP. An additional death was reported in Craighead County, Arkansas, after a 76-year-old man and his vehicle was swept away by high water after seemingly driving around barricades, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
Destruction in Columbus included damage at First Pentecostal Church that Rev. Steve Blaylock described as a total loss, while sheds and outbuildings in the citys east side were mostly demolished, the AP wrote. Used-car dealer Lee Lawrence said the storm demolished four buildings on his lot and blew out car windows, telling the AP it will be a start-over deal. I cant say it will come back better or stronger, but well come back.
The AP wrote:
A photographer working for The AP in Columbus said some antique cars on Lawrences lot were parked among the damage and a nearby pet grooming business appeared now to be mostly twisted piles of metal. A printing shop had been speared by a pipe with great force and what seemed to be a vacant commercial building nearby appeared heavily damaged.
Some 300 river gauges across the Southeast remained above flood levels on Sunday, according to CNN.
Tennessees Knox County was put under a flash flood warning on Saturday afternoon, CNN reported, with the National Weather Service advising residents that this is a particularly dangerous situation. Seek higher ground now. Amid the rising floodwaters, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency declared a state of emergency. Officials also implemented regional states of emergency in Alabama and Mississippi.
There were additional reports of rockslides wiping out part of Interstate 40 near the Tennessee-North Carolina border, with all lanes covered by rocks, trees, and dirt. Construction engineer Ted Adams of the North Carolina Department of Transportations District 14 told the Citizen Times it was a small slide with rocks falling from a pretty high elevation, and when they were hitting the road, they were bouncing into the eastbound lanes. The road may be closed for up to a week, the paper wrote.
Mudslides in Chattanooga also wiped out a Subway retail location on Saturday morning. Per the Times Free Press, owner Owen Megahee closed the location on Friday after observing an adjacent hill seemed about to collapse.
If they had it open, and employees and customers had been in there, wed be talking about something much more serious, fire department spokesman Bruce Garner told the paper. People could have been hurt or killed for sure.
Nearby, the Dunlap Fire Department posted a video of rising floodwaters spilling well over the boundaries of a waterway on Saturday.
The city of Nashville broke a rainfall record, with its February the wettest in over a century, CNN reported. In Lynchburg, between Nashville and Chattanooga, the grounds of the Jack Daniels distillery were flooded, though employee Henry Feldhaus IV told CNN that all employees and stores of whiskey were safe.
While the storms are largely over, CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said that many of the floods will not crest until later in the week as rains continue to drain into waterways. According to the AP, tens of thousands of Appalachian Power customers in West Virginia remained without electricity as of Sunday afternoon.

The snow is expected to stop around 8 a.m. Most parts of the state will see between a coating and an inch of snow, but those farther northeast and northwest could expect up to two inches or more, the weather service said. “There is a low risk for some 3 to 4 inch snow amounts if the rain changes to snow earlier than expected,” the NWS said. The temperature on Friday will peak about 2 a.m. in the Hartford area, where the thermometer will read 36 degrees. Most of the day’s temperatures will remain in the 20s before dropping into the teens in the evening. Saturday will be mostly sunny with a high in the upper 20s. But more snow is likely before noon Sunday, followed by rain — setting the stage for a slushy Super Bowl Sunday. The weather service put the chance of precipitation at 80 percent. The rain could to turn back to snow early Monday, when there is a 30 percent chance of precipitation. There will be more chances for snow on Tuesday and Wednesday, the weather service said.","Hartford Courant Watch For Slick Roads Friday Morning; Rain, Snow, Frigid Temperatures In Forecast Hartford Courant With rain and snow falling late Thursday night and early Friday morning, and with temperatures dropping into the 20s, forecasters are warning o…",2018-02-01T23:45:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Courant.com'}","Watch For Slick Roads Friday Morning; Rain, Snow, Frigid Temperatures In Forecast - Hartford Courant",http://www.courant.com/breaking-news/hc-br-friday-morning-snow-20180201-story.html,http://www.trbimg.com/img-5a73a7b7/turbine/hc-br-friday-morning-snow-20180201,,Courant.com,flash-flood,1
Katie Reilly,"Police on Monday morning were still searching for a person who was reported missing in the midst of flash flooding that tore through Ellicott City, Maryland on Sunday, sweeping away parked cars and trapping some residents on the upper floors of buildings. Eddison Alexander Hermond, a 39-year-old active member of the Army National Guard, has been missing since about 5:20 p.m. Sunday, police said, asking anybody with information to call 911. Officials said the damage in Ellicott City already appeared to be worse than flood damage in July 2016, when another flash flood devastated the Ellicott City community. “They say this is a once every 1,000-year flood and we’ve had two of them in two years,” Gov. Larry Hogan said at a press conference Sunday night. “My heart is broken, thinking about what the people are going through here — and the people’s lives who were devastated two years ago, and they rebuilt and now they’re faced with the same daunting task again,” Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said at the press conference Sunday night. “We will be there for them, as we were in 2016. But I have no words to say to you and to them right now. I’m devastated. I’m heartbroken, and I know they are as well.” Ellicott City received nearly 8 inches of rain over a six-hour period on Sunday, most of which fell during an intense three-hour window, creating a “true flash flood,” meteorologist Mike Muccilli told the Associated Press. Law enforcement officials said they were still working to secure the area on Monday morning before allowing residents and business owners to return to their property, reclaim belongings and assess the damage. “We need to ensure the area is safe,” Howard County said in a tweet.","""My heart is broken, thinking about what the people are going through here""",2018-05-28T15:39:53Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","1 Missing After ‘Once Every 1,000-Year’ Flash Flood Tears Through Ellicott City, Maryland",http://time.com/5293180/ellicott-city-flooding/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/ellicott-city-md-flooding-2018.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,flash-flood,1
Associated Press,"Alberto is a still-menacing depression after its Memorial Day landfall on the Gulf Coast, scattering heavy rains around the South and raising risks of flash floods. As the first named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Subtropical Storm Alberto lumbered ashore Monday afternoon in the Florida Panhandle and then weakened overnight to a depression centered over Alabama. Now it's a vast, soggy system dumping the warm water it gathered over the Gulf of Mexico in bursts of rain across the southeast. Forecasters said that rain could still kill people caught in flash floods in the coming hours or days in Alabama and large areas of Georgia, Tennessee and the Carolinas. In North Carolina, a television news anchor and a photojournalist were killed instantly on Monday while covering the weather, when a tree became uprooted from rain-soaked ground and toppled onto their SUV, authorities said. ""Two journalists working to keep the public informed about this storm have tragically lost their lives, and we mourn with their families, friends and colleagues,"" North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said in a statement. ""North Carolina needs to take Alberto seriously. I urge everyone to keep a close eye on forecasts, warnings and road conditions, especially in western North Carolina where even heavier rain is predicted."" Between 2 and 8 inches (10-25 centimeters) of rain could soak Alabama and western Georgia on Tuesday, and isolated deluges of 12 inches (30 centimeters) also are possible as the system heads into the Tennessee Valley on its way to the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region. Alberto dumped between 2 and 5 inches (2 and 13 centimeters) of rain over parts of the Florida Panhandle, according to the National Weather Service. Double-red flags along the white sandy beaches kept most people out of the rough waters, and some low-lying areas experienced minor flooding, officials said. ""Most of the issues we're having right now are downed trees and downed limbs,"" Walton County spokesman Louis Svehla told the Northwest Florida Daily News. ""Our beaches did good. There was not a lot of erosion. The surge was not that large."" Santa Rosa County officials had put out many piles of sand several days ago in case people wanted to mitigate any flooding in their homes. People who took those supplies will be better prepared as the hurricane season gets its official start on Friday, said county spokeswoman Brandi Whitehurst. ""What Alberto has done for us is to have people dust off their hurricane plans and stock up on supplies,"" Whitehurst said. The pelting rain soaked the uniform and socks of Lt. Andy Husar with the Bay County Sheriff's Office, who watched surf get kicked up along Panama City Beach on Monday. ""It's not a good sign, getting hit by a storm before hurricane season,"" Husar told the Panama City News Herald. As a subtropical storm, Alberto had a less defined and cooler center than a tropical storm, and its strongest winds were found farther from its center. The large tree that crushed the TV news vehicle Monday afternoon near Tryon, North Carolina, killed news anchor Mike McCormick and photojournalist Aaron Smeltzer of WYFF-TV of Greenville, South Carolina, the station said. They had just interviewed Tryon Fire Chief Geoffrey Tennant as they covered storms in North Carolina. ""Ten minutes later we get the call and it was them,"" Tennant said at a news conference, his voice cracking. Tennant said the roots of the large tree tore loose from ground saturated by a week's worth of rain. The men died instantly, their vehicle's engine still running, he said. ____ Kay reported from Miami Beach, Florida. Associated Press writers Kate Brumback in Atlanta and Jeffrey S.

Alexander Nguyen,"A flash flood watch went into effect for San Diego County mountains and deserts on Monday as the first of two storms made its way across the Southern California region. Rain from the now downgraded tropical cyclone Rosa started falling in parts of Chula Vista and La Mesa on Sunday evening but more rain was expected overnight into Monday and again on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. The NWS watch will be in effect through Wednesday for areas including southern Nevada, southeastern California, southwestern and central Utah and the western two-thirds of Arizona. In San Diego, that included Julian, Pine Valley and Borrego Springs. The weather service warned that during that period downpours have the potential to flood and cause landslides and debris flows from recent wildfire burn scars. Rainfall from the first storm is expected to be less than a tenth of an inch, the agency said. On Monday, the chance of showers would diminish as the day progressed, clearing to partly cloudy skies with hot and humid conditions before returning again in the evening. The same pattern was expected to repeat Tuesday, though the bulk of the storm will move into Arizona on Monday. The National Weather Service issued a beach hazards statement Sunday because of the elevated surfs from Rosa. The highest surf is expected late Sunday through Monday evening, the NWS said. “Strong longshore currents and rip currents will occur,” the agency said. The beach hazards statement expires at 6 a.m. on Tuesday. On Wednesday, a Pacific storm will move into the Southern California region, bringing with it a chance of showers and a slight chance of thunderstorms from the coast to the mountains, the NWS said. Coastal San Diego is on the western periphery of the storm and will experience scatter to numerous showers, according to the NWS.

Katie Reilly,"New York City’s notoriously troubled subway system fell victim to unexpected flooding and waterfalls inside subway stations on Monday, as New York weather brought heavy rain and flash flood warnings. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for New York City through 2:15 p.m. Monday, and maintained a flood advisory after that. Many commuters witnessed the New York City subway flooding first hand. “As happens during heavy storms like today’s, water is entering some stations from the street. We’re sending emergency maintenance teams and customer service staff to locations where they’re needed,” New York City Transit tweeted about the subway flooding on Monday morning. “We’ll keep staircases and other station areas open as long as it’s safe to do so, but please be careful as you enter and exit trains.” The subway flooding frustrated passengers, who shared photos and videos of water pouring from the ceiling during their morning commute. The flooding appeared to be particularly bad in one subway station in Harlem, at 145th Street and Broadway, where water cascaded down a set of stairs. “Thank you to our crews who are clearing a considerable amount of water that entered the system from the street this morning and are helping to keep New Yorkers moving,” the New York City Transit tweeted later.",Commuters shared videos of water cascading from ceilings and down stairs,2018-04-16T20:24:10Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",People Are Sharing Crazy Videos of New York City Subway Stations Flooding,http://time.com/5242077/new-york-city-subway-flooding/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/new-york-weather-subway-flash-flood.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,flash-flood,1
"Judson Jones, CNN","(CNN) A significant winter storm is taking shape Friday over the Southern Plains and Texas and will spread this weekend through the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. How far south freezing air will reach remains an open question, making it difficult to precisely forecast ice and snow accumulation. Where it happens, dangerous travel conditions and power outages are possible. Winter storm watches and advisories already are in place for more than 12 million people in portions of states from New Mexico to North Carolina. As the storm develops, forecast models will more accurately predict the freezing line and thus the type of precipitation places will experience, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. Here is what CNN meteorologists expect, where and when: Timing: Friday morning through Saturday evening Precipitation begins with freezing rain and drizzle in the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma and possibly into central Oklahoma. Main winter weather impacts occur late Friday, with a quick transition from a wintry mix to snow after midnight for the Texas Panhandle and West Texas and several inches of rain through Friday night across much of southeast Texas. If precipitation makes it into eastern Oklahoma, it won't turn to snow until later Saturday. Impacts: Snow, ice and f looding rain Snowfall in Texas will likely be in the 2- to 4-inch range but could reach 6 inches. Southern and eastern Texas can expect a lot of rain impacting major cities, including Dallas, Austin, San Antonio and Houston. Nearly 20 million people are under a flood or flash flood watch or warning in eastern Texas. San Antonio and Houston could see flash flooding, as rainfall total could reach 3 to 6 inches, with as much as 10 inches in isolated spots. Oklahoma City may end up being on the line between dry and wet air. Still, there is a chance for some wintry weather in central Oklahoma, with snow accumulation of 1 to 4 inches and possibly one-10th of an inch of ice from Lubbock, Texas, to Oklahoma City. Tulsa, Oklahoma, will see some ice, as well as snow of 1 to 2 inches. Arkansas and western Tennessee Timing: Friday afternoon through Saturday Most Arkansans won't feel precipitation until later Friday, with winter weather beginning in the overnight hours and moving east Saturday morning toward Tennessee. Impacts: Flooding rains, wintry mix, mountain snow The southern half of Arkansas will get caught up in a similar situation as East Texas, with 4 to 5 inches of rain and flash flooding possible. Central Arkansas looks to only pick up, at most, 1 inch of snow. Meantime the higher elevations of the Ozark Mountains will likely see 2 to 6 inches of snow on top of a glaze of ice up to a quarter of an inch. Snow totals will be lower in northeastern Arkansas and northwestern Tennessee, where a trace to 1 inch of snow is possible. Eastern Tennessee, northern Georgia and the Carolinas Timing: Saturday morning through Monday morning Precipitation creeps in early Saturday, with rain in Georgia and some light, wintry precipitation in the mountains. It picks up Saturday afternoon, when blizzard conditions are possible in the higher Appalachians, with larger accumulations Sunday into early Monday morning across the zone. The storm on Monday probably will move out to sea, but it also could turn and climb up the East Coast, bringing heavy snow to major metro areas. Impacts: Record snow, blizzard conditions, wintry mix Significant snow is expected -- but not certain -- across the mountains of northeast Georgia and North and South Carolina. Estimates range from 1 foot to almost 2 feet in the mountains and foothills west of Interstate 85. Parts of North Carolina could see record snowfall, described by the National Weather Service called a ""once-in-a-generation event."" That includes Winston-Salem and Asheville, which could get a foot of snow; Raleigh, with 1 to 2 inches possible; and Charlotte. Greenville, South Carolina is likely to get 1 inch of snow. While most forecast models keep the winter precipitation tucked into Carolinas, one shows possible freezing rain reaching down the I-85 corridor on Sunday night into Monday to Atlanta, which also could get a dusting of snow Monday afternoon. Snow totals east of I-85 will on depend on a regional weather phenomenon called ""cold-air damming"" or ""the wedge"" -- when cold air pushes in from the northeast against the Appalachians. The mountain range acts as a dam, keeping the cold air pooled like a lake. Warmer air in this scenario would reduce snow accumulation. There's another phenomenon called a ""warm nose"" that would allow warmer air to mix in above the ""'wedge,"" bringing a more wintry mix Saturday evening and overnight into Sunday morning before snow moves in northwest of I-85.

ABC News,"Evacuations are in effect this morning in McDowell County, North Carolina, which is experiencing its worst flash flood emergency since September 2004 after Hurricanes Frances and Ivan. Some areas saw as much as half a foot of rain over the last 24 hours, on top of soggy conditions that have persisted for weeks. This rainfall isn't from Alberto but rather a moist, tropical flow coming up from the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. But as much as 10 inches fell in Northern Alabama on Tuesday because of Alberto, remnants of which are moving over the Tennessee and Ohio valleys. Remnants of Alberto have lead to flood watches in at least two regions today. Remnants of Alberto will make their way toward the Great Lakes this afternoon and evening, bringing heavy rain to Chicago, Milwaukee and Grand Rapids, Michigan. Remants of Alberto will begin approaching the Great Lakes this afternoon. Rainfall totals are expected to be the heaviest from the Ohio Valley and into the Great Lakes, with some regions receiving more than 3 inches. After today, whatever's left of Alberto likely will migrate north to Canada. Six tornadoes reported on Tuesday were among at least 180 reports of damaging storms from Minnesota to Texas. Grapefruit-sized hail was reported in Kansas as winds topped 80 mph in Oklahoma. Similar conditions are expected to persist today from the Rockies into the southern Plains. Severe weather will again stretch from the Rockies into the southern Plains.","Evacuations are in effect this morning in McDowell County, North Carolina, which is experiencing its worst flash flood emergency since September 2004.",2018-05-30T13:44:26Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",Eastern flooding continues as Plains see more severe storms,https://abcnews.go.com/US/eastern-flooding-continues-plains-severe-storms/story?id=55526398,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/flooding-8-gty-er-180529_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,flash-flood,1
DANIEL MANZO,"An active weather pattern across the U.S. will bring several weather events over the coming days, including a multi-day heavy rainfall event, possible severe weather in the Plains, the season's first widespread snow in parts of the Northern Rockies and a drastic difference in temperatures across the country. Additionally, there is the potential for a tropical system to become more organized and move toward the Gulf. Heavy rain and isolated severe storms have fired up early Saturday along a slow-moving frontal system from Texas to Michigan. Already there have been reports of 2 to 3 inches of rain in parts of eastern Iowa with rainfall rates of 1 to 1.5 inches of rain per hour. Flash flood watches are in effect for parts of Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin through much of Saturday. A flash flood watch is in effect in northern Illinois on Saturday morning. Rainfall totals of over 4 inches locally on Saturday are possible. Further south in parts of Kansas and west Texas, winds of 60 mph have been reported. Storms will continue to fire along this frontal system Saturday, sliding slightly east. Numerous strong storms with locally heavy rainfall are possible from northern Texas to Ohio. Unfortunately, this frontal system is slow to move out this weekend, and another system is quickly moving in behind it. Heavy rain is expected in the Plains on Sunday, while snow will fall in the Rockies. This will cause even more rounds of heavy rain across the central U.S. By Sunday morning, more heavy rain will fall in the Plains, especially from Wichita Falls, Texas, to Kansas City, Missouri. Yet another system is coming in quickly from the west and much of the central U.S. could see impactful weather by Sunday evening. Locally strong to severe storms will affect parts of Texas and New Mexico. The main threat will be damaging winds and hail. The severe weather will then slide toward western Texas and Oklahoma on Monday. The main risk on Monday will be damaging winds, large hail and tornadoes. Meanwhile, rain and some heavy snow move into the Northern Rockies and Northern Plains. As much as 6 inches of rain could fall through Monday in northern Texas, Oklahoma and eastern Kansas. The rainfall forecast shows 4 to 6 inches of rain locally in parts of the central U.S. just through Monday. There is more rain on the way for this region on Tuesday and Wednesday as well. Over a one-week period, it is possible that rainfall totals could reach 7 to 10 inches in the central U.S., especially from Texas to Kansas. Unfortunately, due to repeated rounds of heavy rain, the flash flood threat will persist through this region through much of the upcoming week. As the storm deepens over the central U.S. by Monday and Tuesday, colder air behind it will also possibly bring the first widespread snow of the season to parts of the northern Rockies and Plains. Nearly 6 to 10 inches of snow is possible across parts of the northern Plains from Saturday through Monday. Potential tropical system A cluster of thunderstorms near Honduras is being monitored for potential organization into a tropical system. It is likely that this system will become a tropical depression this weekend. If the disturbance were to become a named tropical system -- which happens if it becomes a tropical storm -- it would be titled Michael. Thunderstorms near Honduras on Saturday morning could form into a tropical depression. The spaghetti models do show this system moving into the Gulf of Mexico over the next three to five days. The two global forecast models Saturday morning are showing the system becoming more organized and moving toward the Gulf Coast by midweek. However, there is a lack of agreement in terms of intensity and organization for this tropical system. Also, the timing of a highly amplified, upper-level pattern over the U.S. will ultimately decide where this tropical system may track. Spaghetti models show the possible tropical depression moving north, though there is little agreement on where it will land along the Gulf Coast. At this time, it is too early to determine what, if any, impact this tropical system will have on the U.S.","As much as half a foot of rain could fall in north Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas.",2018-10-06T10:05:05Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",Flash flood concerns increasing as heavy rain targets central US,https://abcnews.go.com/US/flash-flood-concerns-increasing-rounds-heavy-rain-target/story?id=58323406,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/snow-montana-ugc-mo-20181006_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,flash-flood,1

By Thursday, multiple counties were reporting record rainfall amid chaotic road closures and unprecedented flash floods.
A highway in Riverside County outside of Los Angeles was completely eroded by flooding in staggering footage shared by the California Department of Transportation on Thursday. As of early Friday morning, road closures were still in effect throughout the region, and authorities cautioned drivers against attempting to drive through flooded areas.
Palm Springs also saw significant flooding, with the Palm Springs Desert Sun reporting that several people needed to be rescued after floodwaters left them stranded. According to the National Weather Service San Diego, Palm Springs was walloped by its third all-time rainfall in a 24-hour period and its wettest Valentines Day on record.
San Diego reported record moisture in the atmosphere, according to the National Weather Service, and San Diegos Palomar Observatory was hit with a historic 10 inches of downpour for its rainiest day since it began keeping a record. Road closures were reported throughout the area as the result of fallen trees and debris as well as other issues related to the storm.
Up north, a mudslide in Sausalito resulted in one home sliding down a hill and smashing into another house, the Associated Press reported, and more than four dozen properties needed to be evacuated as a result of the storm.
During the incident, a woman was reportedly buried under mud and debris for two hours while a rescue crew worked to free her. According to the Los Angeles Times, rescuers found her after noticing her hand poking out from under part of the wreckage.
Surprisingly, she was in great condition, Southern Marin Fire District Captain Doug Paterson told the Los Angeles Times. She was talking to us. She was alert. She was able to tell us exactly what had happened.
In neighboring San Francisco, the torrential downpour resulted in the cancellation or delay of hundreds of flights. According to the National Weather Service Bay Area, several flood warnings and advisories remained in effect as of early Friday morning.

Tropical Depression Rosa made landfall in Baja California on Monday and is crawling into the Southwest, bringing with it the threat of flash floods from southern Arizona to Idaho. All told, 9 million people are under a flash flood watch or warning as of Tuesday morning Mountain Time as Rosa lumbers inland. The storm attained Category 4 status at its peak late last week, but has lost steam since then (at least in the wind department). It made landfall as a tropical storm in Baja California late last night and has since become Rosas lowly remnant low. But the winds were never the biggest concern for the Southwest. Instead, its the threat of torrential rain as the storm brings tropical moisture to an arid landscape. More than half an inch of rain has already fallen in and around Phoenix, making this one of the heaviest rain events to hit the city since 1990. Phoenix is already up to its seventh-wettest October on record despite it being just Oct. 2. With the heaviest bands of rain to come in the afternoon, the storm is likely to continue climbing the record books. All told, up to six inches of rain are expected in Arizonas mountains. That may not sound like a lot, especially after Florences recent deluge in the Carolinas, but the parched soil ups the risk of runoff. The scenic slot canyons and dry washes that cut across the desert landscape are disguised highways for water, waiting for rain events like this to send torrents rushing downstream. A recent drought has hardened soils even further, which could help accelerate the runoff process. Large portions of the Four Corners area are in exceptional or extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Rosas rain will certainly help alleviate that drought, but it will also exact a toll on the desert landscape and those living in it. Indeed, footage from Phoenixitself chock full of impervious pavementand the surrounding area shows that roads are already becoming inundated as the aforementioned dry washes fill up with frothing, muddy water. The Utah National Guard has already been activated according to CBS News, and we could see more resources mobilized as flooding continues to unfold. Its weird but not unprecedented for tropical systems to amble into the Southwest. Tropical Depression Storm Newton reached Arizona in 2016, the last tropical system to hit the region. Rosas remnants are just the latest example of a growing problem: Heavy rain events are on the rise owing to a warmer atmosphere. Were seeing that trend driven by named storms like hurricanes Harvey, Lane, and Florence as well as random rain events like the one that hit Kauai in April. The Southwest has seen a five percent increase in heavy downpours since 1958 even as the region becomes drier, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment. This type of weather whiplash poses a huge infrastructure challenge as city and state planners have to figure out how to prepare communities both for downpours and water conservation in increasingly dry times.","In a year of wild heat waves, wildfires, and record-setting hurricanes, why not add one more weird weather phenomenon to the list?

Mandatory evacuations have been extended as more than 1,200 emergency workers continue to search mud as deep as 15ft (4.6m) in places. Drones, military vehicles and search dogs have been brought in to help with rescue and clean-up efforts. ""We've got a window that's closing, but we're still very optimistic.

,"At a Glance Severe thunderstorms will rumble through the Midwest and Southeast through Friday. At least one tornado struck towns east of Des Moines Thursday afternoon. Strong winds, hail and perhaps a few tornadoes are possible Friday. Locally heavy rain may also trigger flash flooding in some areas. Severe thunderstorms will be more widespread than usual for late July in the Midwest and Southeast through Friday as the jet stream carves out a pattern change that will be in place into next week. Severe weather is already happening in parts of the Midwest. Current Radar, Watches and Warnings Tornadoes ripped through the central Iowa towns of Bondurant and Marshalltown Thursday afternoon. The first tornado was a long-track tornado that potentially scraped more than 40 miles of real estate from Bondurant east and southeast to near the towns of Colfax, Monroe and Pella, Iowa. (MORE: Tornadoes Strike Iowa Towns ) The National Weather Service is reporting catastrophic damage in Marshalltown including missing vehicles, ripped off building tops, and downed trees and powerlines. Several injuries occurred in both tornadoes. Wind gusts as strong as 80 mph swept through Manhattan and Topeka, Kansas, Thursday afternoon and even brought dust to parts of eastern Kansas. Wind gusts up to 78 mph blasted Whiteman Air Force Base, about 60 miles southeast of Kansas City, late Thursday morning. At least one tree was downed and a flag pole was bent near the central Missouri air base. This round of severe weather is due to a sharp upper-level disturbance carving into the Midwest and Southeast. On the southern end of that upper-level disturbance is a vigorous jet stream punching over warm, humid air near the surface.

Abigail Abrams,"At least nine teenagers were killed and one is missing after a flash flood interrupted their hiking trip in southern Israel near the Dead Sea on Thursday. The group of 25 young people had been on a trip organized by Bnei Zion, a pre-military academy in Israel, the New York Times reported. They were hiking in the Nahal Tzafit riverbed, which is typically extremely dry. However, heavy rainfall over the last two days flooded the area. Police, volunteers and military teams set out searching for the missing student but the search was suspended as night fell, according to Reuters. The remaining 15 students from the group were rescued, and two of them were treated for hypothermia, according to the Times. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the incident a “terrible disaster” in a statement on Twitter and praised the first responders. “We are all praying for better news,” he added. Police said they would open an investigation into the incident to understand why the group proceeded with their hike in such intense weather conditions, the Times reported.

MICHAEL MARTZ  Richmond Times-Dispatch,"RICHMOND Tropical Storm Michael swept across Virginia with surprising speed and fury, leaving at least five people dead and another missing in a flash flood caused by torrential rains. The remnants of a hurricane that hit the Florida Panhandle with Category 4 winds, Michael spun off five suspected tornadoes in Virginia as it sliced northeast through the middle of the state Thursday night and early Friday. The storm carried wind gusts of more than 50 mph, dropped 4 to 8 inches of rain more in places and left nearly 600,000 Virginians without power. It arrived less than a month after the remnants of Hurricane Florence touched off 10 tornadoes in Virginia nine in the Richmond metropolitan area, where one man died after a tornado demolished the Chesterfield County warehouse where he was working. As we have seen each time these storms hit, these storms are unpredictable, Gov. Ralph Northam said at a news conference Friday afternoon at the state emergency operations center in Chesterfield. And its not over yet, even though the skies are now clear. Richmond officials warned Friday that a flood warning will remain in effect until 5 p.m. Sunday, and the James River will be closed to recreation until water levels subside. The officials urged people attending the Richmond Folk Festival or other events close to the James to exercise extreme caution while participating in weekend festivities. Damage estimates wont be available for a week to 10 days, according to Jeff Stern, director of the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. The five confirmed fatalities from the storm include a Hanover County firefighter who was killed when a tractor-trailer collided with his firetruck on Interstate 295. Four other Virginians drowned after their vehicles were caught in flash flooding two in Danville, one in Pittsylvania County and one in Charlotte County. State police and local law enforcement released these details of the five confirmed fatalities: » Bradford Clark, 43, of Mechanicsville died after a tractor-trailer rammed a Hanover firetruck that had stopped along I-295 on Thursday night to assist in a two-vehicle crash. Two other firefighters were taken to VCU Medical Center with life-threatening injuries, and a fourth was treated for minor injuries at the scene. The driver of the tractor-trailer, Lester Labarge, 49, of California, Maryland, was hospitalized with serious injuries and charged with reckless driving and defective brakes, state police said. » A man drowned and a woman remains missing after their vehicle was stranded in high water on a bridge on Mount Harmony Road in Charlotte shortly before 7:30 p.m. A 17-year-old and his father and grandmother were clinging to the bridge railings when local and state police arrived. The Charlotte Sheriffs Office pulled the teen to safety, but the adults were swept away in floodwaters. Authorities recovered the fathers body, but the grandmother had not been found and was presumed dead, officials said. Rescuers continued to look for her late Friday. » James E. King Jr., 45, of Dry Fork, drowned after being swept away from his vehicle about 3:30 p.m. on Thursday in the Mount Hermon community in Pittsylvania. A Pittsylvania sheriffs deputy and local resident tried to rescue him, but were unable to reach him. State police and local firefighters found his body downstream about 10:30 p.m. » In Danville, 53-year-old William Lynn Tanksley was swept away from his vehicle by flash flooding near the 100 block of Colonial Court on Thursday afternoon. His body was to be taken to Roanoke for an autopsy. » A second fatality occurred in Danville on Goodyear Boulevard about 10:20 p.m. Police said the victim, 60-year-old Jennifer Bjarnesen Mitchell, was stranded inside of a vehicle that was overrun floodwaters. At least seven tornadoes hit Virginia during Tropical Storm Michael: » James City County, an EF-1 in Norge and Toano; » Middlesex County, an EF-0 near Jamaica; » Gloucester County, an EF-0 near Pampa Road and another EF-0 near Cuba Road; » New Kent County, an EF-0 at Colony Trail; » Amelia County, an EF-0 at Jennings Lane; and » Nottoway County: EF-0 at Burkeville. (The Nottoway tornados classification could change based on additional surveys.) Anyone with additional information about any tornado damage can report it to the National Weather Service by sending an email to akq-report@noaa.gov or submitting a report at weather.gov/akq/reportWX. The tropical storms rainfall generally ranged from 3 to 7 inches around Central Virginia, with isolated areas in Charlotte, Caroline and Middlesex reporting more than 9 inches. The rainfall prompted 30 separate flash flood warnings to be issued across the state, along with 12 tornado warnings. The state of emergency declared by the governor on Thursday remains in effect, Northam said Friday. We still have flooding, downed trees, closed roads and a lot of debris, he said. The storm affected up to 1,500 roads across Virginia, prompting hundreds of emergency calls for traffic accidents and blocked roadways. The Virginia National Guard sent eight soldiers and two rescue vehicles to the Danville area, where one of two emergency shelters opened for the storm held about 30 people. Additionally, 16 residents of adjacent Pittsylvania were housed in a hotel. The second emergency shelter, in the Salem area, held about 50 people. Unlike Hurricane Florence, which initially appeared headed for southeastern Virginia, the governor did not order emergency evacuation of residents for Tropical Storm Michael. Northam said he ordered the evacuations of low-lying areas for Florence because of concerns about potentially catastrophic storm surge, while Michael stormed across the middle of the state with heavy rain and high winds. There was plenty of warning, said the governor, reminding Virginians to never attempt to drive through high water and to adjust their driving to weather conditions.","The Daily Progress Storm leaves 5 people dead across Virginia; spawns 7 tornadoes The Daily Progress RICHMOND — Tropical Storm Michael swept across Virginia with surprising speed and fury, leaving at least five people dead and another missing in a flash flood…",2018-10-13T03:18:06Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Dailyprogress.com'}",Storm leaves 5 people dead across Virginia; spawns 7 tornadoes - The Daily Progress,https://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/weather/storm-leaves-people-dead-across-virginia-spawns-tornadoes/article_9be9e6ae-ce95-11e8-b8d9-dbe51ca151da.html,https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dailyprogress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/e2/fe20a150-ce95-11e8-9b42-87868040a792/5bc1634901ea5.image.jpg?resize=1039%2C630,,Dailyprogress.com,flash-flood,1
"Amy Pollard, Amy Pollard","The Netflix logo on a tablet screen. Future Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society. Your Netflix-and-chill could one day be interrupted by a flash-flood warning. A new Senate bill would explore adding emergency alerts to online video and audio streaming services. The Reliable Emergency Alert Distribution Improvement (READI) Act, introduced on Wednesday by Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, and Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, would create a commission to research the feasibility of sending emergency alerts through online streaming services. No platforms are name-dropped in the bill itself, but a press release announcing the bill mentions Netflix and Spotify as possible participants. Netflix, Spotify, and Hulu did not immediately respond to Slate’s request for comment. The idea of interrupting your Netflix binge with an emergency alert isn’t exactly new. But it takes on a new urgency after a false missile alert in Hawaii early this year exposed flaws in the emergency alert system, with some people never receiving the alert. That misfire prompted bipartisan legislation that would give the federal government sole responsibility for alerting the public of a missile threat. The READI Act has some other ideas for improving emergency alerts. The bill would bring more alerts to people on their smartphones, TV, and radios. It would also disable the option to opt out of emergency alerts on mobile phones, tighten procedures for reporting false alerts, and require alerts issued by the president or FEMA to be repeated on air. “Emergency alerts save lives but management mistakes can erode their credibility and effectiveness,” said Thune in the press release. “The READI Act implements lessons learned from past incidents and recognizes that emergency protocols must change along with communication technology.” The national emergency alert system requires TV and radio broadcasters, cable television systems, and other providers to allow the president to communicate to the American public during a national emergency. The system—which is managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Communications Commission, and the National Weather Service—can also be used by state and local authorities for AMBER alerts and emergency weather information targeted to a specific area. But change to the system, which was developed during the Cold War, has been slowgoing—it wasn’t until 2007 that satellite TV networks were added. And it took until 2011 for the system to run its first nationwide test.

ABC News,"Residents of the central U.S., brace yourselves. A major storm system is developing in the central U.S. and it will bring several high impact weather events across much of the region, including the potential for a major flash flood event Saturday. Flood watches Saturday morning have been posted from northern Texas to western Pennsylvania, and includes many metropolitan areas such as Dallas, Little Rock, Nashville, Louisville and Pittsburgh. On the colder side of this system, winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings have been posted for snow and ice accumulation. Minneapolis is in the path for the brunt of this developing snow event. There's a series of flood watches and warnings across the Midwest. Parts of Minnesota will experience snow on Saturday. There will be severe storms in parts of the South on Sunday. The storm will really start to develop Saturday morning before bringing widespread impacts by mid-day and into the evening. Accumulation, heavy rain, and dangerous thunderstorms will develop in the Mississippi River Valley from Little Rock to Memphis, as well as along parts of the Midwest from Paducah, Kentucky to Cincinnati. On the northern side of this storm, snow will develop and intensify as it heads towards Minnesota. Low visibility and blowing snow will be likely be an issue Saturday evening. By Saturday night or Sunday morning, the storm will slide eastward with very heavy rain and thunderstorms from Louisiana all the way to Pennsylvania. A wintry mix and some snow will be likely for parts of New England including Hartford, Connecticut and Albany, New York. The storm will clear the U.S. by Sunday night. Cities such as Louisville, Kentucky, and Little Rock, Arkansas, will experience heavy rainfall this weekend. There's a high risk of flooding in parts of Arkansas, Kentucky and Ohio. The storm will tap into high moisture content across parts of the South and Midwest. A high risk of flash flooding has been issued by the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center, and covers Little Rock, Paducah, Louisville and Cincinnati. Locally, over 4 inches of rainfall is expected through Sunday in the region. However, this will be on top of the rain that has already fallen in some areas. Nearly 10.5 inches of rain has been reported in parts of Arkansas this week. This means that any excessive rain that falls will cause flash flooding The heavy rain, however, will miss northern Indiana, Michigan and northern Illinois, the latter of which has been dealing with ongoing major river flooding from rain over the last week. An area stretching from Texas to Kentucky will experience rain Saturday. Parts of the South will experience tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds on Saturday. Strong severe storms will develop across the South and mMidwest today. Intense storms will develop by mid-day and into Saturday night. An enhanced risk for severe weather has been issued for parts of Louisiana up through parts of Kentucky. Tornadoes, perhaps a couple of strong ones, could develop later Saturday across the enhanced risk region. Damaging winds and large hail will also be possible. The severe weather threat is not expected to remain intense through the day on Sunday. The central U.S. will experience stormy weather this weekend. On the colder side of this storm, there is some freezing rain and light snow moving across northern Missouri and Kansas on Satiurday morning. The snow will expand and intensify as it heads towards the upper Midwest. Heavy snow, low visibility and blowing snow will be likely in Minnesota and parts of Wisconsin by Saturday afternoon and evening. Nearly 6 inches to 10 inches of fresh snow is likely across parts of Minnesota and northern Wisconsin. Some snow and ice makes its way towards New England on Sunday. Accumulations will be light, but could catch some people off guard considering how warm the Northeast was all week. Many rivers in northern Indiana and Southern Michigan are still running high on Saturday morning. Some rivers still have a few days before they will begin to recede, and some have time before they crest. With more heavy rain on the way, widespread river flooding is expected on the Ohio River next week. The Ohio River at Parkersburg, West Virginia, will rise into moderate flood stage, even near major flood stage by Monday or Tuesday. The Ohio River at Racine Lock is forecasted to reach major flood stage by Monday night and Tuesday. A 48 inch crest could flood the town of Racine, West Virginia. In parts of Louisville and Cincinnati, the rising Ohio river is expected to be the highest it has been in 20 years, but only moderate impacts are expected. This could change based on the how much rain the region receives this weekend.","Residents of the central U.S., brace yourselves.

"Henry Grabar, Henry Grabar","Flooding is seen in Ellicott City, Maryland, on May 27 in this still image from video from social media. Two years ago, Ellicott City, Maryland, was hit by a debilitating flash flood that turns the town’s historic Main Street into a raging muddy river. Scientists said the July 2016 rainstorm was a once-in-a-thousand-year event. But on Sunday it happened again: 7 to 9 inches of rain fell in the area, 10 miles west of Baltimore, and another torrent swept cars and trees through town. More than 1,000 911 calls were recorded on Sunday afternoon, more than 300 residents were evacuated, and a National Guard sergeant died trying to rescue someone. This is outside right now. pic.twitter.com/IBeikcijKo — Max Robinson (@DieRobinsonDie) May 27, 2018 “This is worse,” said Howard County executive Allan Kittleman, compared with the 2016 storm, which caused tens of millions in damages and lost business. Ellicott City isn’t some post-war boomtown built inside a reservoir or a vacation community playing chicken with the ocean waves. It’s a 250-year-old river town, and like many river towns, it’s known flooding, chiefly from the rising waters of the Patapsco, the river at the foot of town that drains into Baltimore Harbor. But these past two storms—as well as September 2011 flooding from Tropical Storm Lee—have worked differently. Instead of the water rising from the river at the base of the town, it’s come roaring in down two tiny tributaries, the Tiber and the Hudson, which merge just before entering the Patapsco. According to a Baltimore Sun investigation, prior to 2011, it had been 60 years since runoff on the Tiber stream produced a flash flood. Now it has happened three times in seven years. It’s a reminder that heavy rain, rather than rising seas, may be the earliest severe consequence of climate change. We’ve prepared for it in the worst way possible. Between 1958 and 2012, according to the 2014 National Climate Assessment, the amount of rain falling in “very heavy events”—those at the top 1 percent of all rainstorms—has risen by 27 percent in the Southeast, 37 percent in the Midwest, and a whopping 71 percent in the Northeast. The most extreme downpours are getting more extreme. (Coincidentally, this weekend also saw just the ninth classified storm to make landfall before hurricane season since 1851 when Alberto hit the Florida panhandle, and a virtually unprecedented Category 3 Tropical Cyclone in Oman.) In nog geen 24 uur valt er in Oman de hoeveelheid regen die het anders in drie jaar tijd ziet. Krankzinnige beelden. Tientallen mensen vermist pic.twitter.com/vHnjpO7fqi — Olaf Koens (@obk) May 27, 2018 But climate change isn’t the only reason these disasters aren’t quite natural. Unchecked sprawl has built a concrete funnel around Ellicott City. “All this natural vegetation that would act as sponges is being replaced by concrete and impervious surfaces,” explains Stephen Strader, a professor at Villanova who studies environmental risk. Nearly one-third of the Tiber–Hudson “sub-watershed” was covered by hard surfaces 10 years ago, according to the Chesapeake Bay Trust, and sprawling development hasn’t stopped since. The result, Strader says, is a flash-flood scenario more reminiscent of the American West, where naturally impervious land creates the conditions for sudden, dramatic floods that, over time, have carved out slot canyons. The sprawling, asphalt-based model of American post-war planning has permanently altered the way the landscape drains water. FEMA bases flood maps on elevations and channels but ignore the impact of the built environment. Doing so, Texas A&amp;M professor Samuel Brody told me a few months ago, is a critical mistake. “The bigger issue is that we’ve completed misconceptualized what flood risk is,” he argues. “We’re not baking in the human element that’s driving some of these flood problems.” How urban floods form and move owes as much to parking lots, soundwalls, highways, railroad tracks, and sewer backups as to natural topography. Going back to 1972, about half of all flood insurance claims in Harris County—home of Houston—have been made outside the FEMA flood plain, according to Brody’s research, and the rate was even higher after Hurricane Harvey dumped dozens of inches of rain there last summer. That’s in part due to the increased severity of modern storms, but also to the category error by which FEMA plans without accounting for the postwar landscape. In Cook County, Illinois, more than $773 million was paid out for urban flooding damage between 2007 and 2011. There was no correlation between ZIP codes with FEMA floodplains and those with damage payouts. To further complicate matters, new development can change flooding patterns miles away. In the 1960s developers built Meyerland, one of the Houston neighborhoods that flooded for the third year running during Hurricane Harvey last year. At the time, only a sliver of it was in the flood plain along the bayou. Since then, the booming exurbs of Harris County have thrust more and more of the neighborhood into flood territory, leading to hundreds of millions in federal insurance payouts.

(Photo: Chris Donahue/Special to the Register) Larry Cotlar, the longtime Des Moines sports radio personality and Drake men's basketball broadcaster, was killed during Saturday's flash flooding in Des Moines, police said. Around 8:50 p.m. on Saturday, Des Moines police were called about a stalled van with people inside in the flooded streets at 50th Street and Twana Drive. As officers headed there, it was reported that the occupants had left the van, and that one person had been swept away. Officers and rescue personnel from the Des Moines Fire Department immediately began a search of the area. Around 12:39 a.m. on Sunday, first responders found Cotlar, 66, deceased, several blocks away from the original call. Cotlar's biography on his website says his professional career began in 1974 and he started doing talk radio in 1981. He was the 2007 Iowa Sportscaster of the Year. His ""Cotlar and Company"" show ran on KXNO-AM 1460 from 2001 to 2009; he's also appeared on 1700 and 1350 AM.

Gina Martinez,"Tropical Florence has broken rainfall total records in North Carolina and it still has a way to go. Preliminary reports from the National Weather Service say that as of noon on Saturday, over 30 inches of rain has fallen in Swansboro, N.C. Florence’s 30 inches of rainfall has broken the statewide rainfall record set by Hurricane Floyd in 1999 of 24.06 inches. Florence made landfall on the North Carolina coast Friday morning with wind speeds of 195 mph. As of Saturday morning, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) downgraded Florence to a tropical storm with maximum wind speeds of 45 mph and said heavy rains and catastrophic flooding will continue across portions of North and South Carolina. NHC said wind speeds are expected to continue to slow down during the weekend but rainfall will increase in certain areas. The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings all across the Carolinas, including Moore County and Lee County. NWS warns residents living in areas with flash flood warnings to avoid roads. “Turn around,” the advisory said. “Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Stay away or be swept away. River banks and culverts can become unstable and unsafe. Flash flooding is extremely dangerous. If you are experiencing flooding or live in a flood prone area, move to higher ground.” According to a 2014 study from the American Meteorological Society, storm surge and rain are the cause of 76% of direct deaths from hurricanes. The study found that from 1963 to 2012 90% of deaths occurred in water related incidents, mostly drowning.",Tropical Florence has broken rainfall total records in North Carolina and it still has a way to go.,2018-09-15T18:51:17Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Florence Shatters North Carolina’s Record for Most Rain Fallen from a Single Storm,http://time.com/5397241/florence-breaks-rainfall-records-in-north-carolina/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/gettyimages-1033304484.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,flash-flood,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption Riverside communities are at risk of flooding after a string of emergencies at the hydroelectric project ""I was in Puerto Valdivia when the first alarm sounded. It was very chaotic. No-one knew whether to run for the hills or along the road, whether to grab the children or grab the elderly. Everyone was going crazy,"" says Teresa Jaramillo recalling the moment on 12 May when flash flooding hit her small riverside community. Puerto Valdivia is just one of the communities affected by a series of emergencies which have hit Colombia's largest hydroelectric dam project, Hidroituango. Tens of thousands of people living downstream from the dam have been evacuated and the emergencies just keep coming. Rising water The Hidroituango dam over the river Cauca, about 175km (110 miles) north of the city of Medellín, was just months from completion when on 28 April a landslide near the site blocked a tunnel built to divert the river's flow while construction was going on. As the project was almost finished, two other tunnels built for the same purpose had already been sealed by the company building the dam, Empresas Públicas de Medellín (EPM). This meant that the tunnel blocked by the landslide was the only remaining outlet. Image copyright Nicolas Bedoya Image caption The project was due to be finished by the end of the year Image copyright Nicolas Bedoya Image caption Supporters of the dam say it will eventually account for 17% of Colombia's power capacity Further landslides followed and with water levels rising and all outlets now blocked, EPM decided to flood the dam's turbine rooms on 10 May to release the river's increasing pressure on the structure. While the move caused irreparable damage to transformers and other systems which had already been installed in the turbine room, it did reduce water levels. But only two days later, one of the sealed tunnels naturally unblocked, causing water to gush through it and creating flash floods further downstream. Cut off Puerto Valdivia lay in the path of the flash foods. Fifty-nine homes, a school and a health centre were destroyed and more than 600 people were displaced. Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption Dozens of homes were destroyed in the flash floods on 12 May Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption Almost 25,000 people have been displaced and many had to seek shelter in gymnasiums León Taborda is one of them. ""The Cauca river took my house. What do I do?"" he asks. ""My wife doesn't want to return to Puerto Valdivia anymore, even if we could. The peace of mind I had there, I won't ever be able to regain it, not living there or anywhere else."" And Hidroituango's troubles seem far from over. Experts have warned that there is a renewed risk of landslides from nearby mountainsides which could block the water-intake tunnels for the turbine room, as well as the spillway, potentially compromising the integrity of the entire hydroelectric project. Image copyright Nicolas Bedoya Image caption The risk of landslides from the steep mountainsides remains Almost 24,000 people living downstream of the dam have already been evacuated due to this risk. Another 380 people living upstream have been displaced by the premature filling of the dam's reservoir. And the residents of Ituango, the town nearest the dam, have been left cut off after the only bridge connecting it to the rest of the country was submerged by the rising waters on 4 May. Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption Some bridges were submerged while others were destroyed by the force of the water Lack of food Community leader Teresa Jaramillo says the situation is particularly critical in rural communities which have been isolated for three weeks now. Even the areas not directly at risk of landslides or flooding have begun to feel the effects of the mass evacuation of the riverside communities and the lack of trade. Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption With many communities cut off,,locals are worried about a lack of supplies ""We only produce plantain and yucca. Everything else is beginning to run out, all other goods,"" rural leaders say. Many have so far ignored calls for them to evacuate their land but they say the lack of food is becoming an issue. ""If we have to go to the camps, well, we will have to, but Valdivia is also collapsing with so many people,"" one man said. Continuing risk At a recent news conference, EPM's CEO Jorge Londoño said that communities near the dam would continue to be at risk until the company had figured out a permanent solution. He suggested that in order to fix the problem, EPM would have to construct a new tunnel to reduce the levels of the flooded river in a controlled fashion, a process likely to take several months. Environmental activists, who have long opposed the hydroelectric project because of what they say are the inherent dangers in damming Colombia's second-largest river, complain about a lack of oversight. ""How can it be that the same company that is causing so much damage is the one pretending to provide the solutions?"" asks Isabel Zuleta, leader of local environmental organisation Ríos Vivos. ""What does that tell us? That in Colombia there is no one that controls the big corporations,"" she says. Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption Isabel Zuleta has long been opposed to the hydroelectric power project Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption She says residents no longer trust EPM to fix the problems With the entire workforce evacuated from the site again on Tuesday because of new warnings of landslides, many people living both up- and downstream from the megaproject are in a state of fear. Ms Zuleta says trust has been eroded. ""They said there was no problem, that there was no danger, that everything was under control."" Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption After the flash flooding of 12 May, people living in riverside communities fear for their future She says that people do not want quick fixes but a river which is allowed to flow freely. But with the project far advanced - it was due to be completed by the end of the year - and its backers maintaining that it will account for about 17% of Colombia's power capacity, that is unlikely to happen.

Royal Thai Navy Facebook Page via AP It would be unsafe to rescue the 12 Thai boys and their soccer coach from the Thailand cave they're trapped in, a Thai Navy SEAL told CNN, because they're too weak to survive the rescue. The same SEAL, who is not authorized to officially speak to the media, told the outlet that oxygen is being pumped into the chamber of the cave where the team is currently trapped. According to a separate doctor's report obtained by CNN, two of the boys and the coach are exhausted and malnourished. The group has been underground for 12 days after becoming trapped in the cave during a flash flood. Rescuers have been working to drain the water out of the cave as rain looms on the forecast. Currently, 20 pumps are draining flood waters from the cave. As a result, water levels have been reduced by about 40% in some areas. But challenges remain with 1.5 miles of the tunnel full with water and heavy monsoon rain expected this weekend. If this works, rescuers hope that so much water will be drained that the boys will be able to walk out of the cave. If not, it seems that there are three other ways to get the group out of the cave : teach them to swim with scuba gear, they could be ""packaged"" and pulled out by divers, or kept with supplies for the remainder of monsoon season — which is expected to last four more months.

Chris Hockman,"Will bring heavy rainfall to the Southwest. It may have been downgraded, but Tropical Storm Rosa is still going to have a big impact on northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, reports USA Today. At one point, Rosa was classified as a Category 4 hurricane, but it is now listed as a Tropical Storm, and is expected to make its first landfall in Baja California — Mexico’s far western peninsula. The storm is expected to touch down on Monday night, with residents of Baja California already reporting heavy rainfall. Flood watches have been issued by the National Weather Service in the states of Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah. That puts more than 12 million people at risk of the flooding that the storm will bring, with a flood warning being issued for almost all of Arizona. Arizona will see the worst of the storm, where rain is expected to reach at least six inches in some areas. The National Hurricane Center warns that the floods will be life-threatening and could also trigger landslides in the path of the storm. Flash flooding is not unusual for Arizona, with a sudden flood turning a swimming hole into a virtual raging river in Payson last year, killing 10 people after heavy rain came through the area. Rain is starting to push into Southern AZ this afternoon beginning several days of flash flood concern as moisture from TS Rosa streams into the region. Water can quickly rise in normally dry creek beds. Avoid low water crossings and turn around, don't drown. pic.twitter.com/2MAhYbedcY — NWS (@NWS) October 1, 2018 With so many desert areas in the path of the storm, the expected rainfall is expected to have a significant impact in some parts of the state. One of the towns in the path of the storm, Yuma, Arizona only sees 3.6 inches of rain a year on average. That number could be doubled in the coming days, which will cause serious issues for residents of the city. Some of the rain will be useful in the southwest which could, at least temporarily, relieve drought conditions. Approximately 40 percent of Arizona is considered to be experiencing a drought at this time. With drought conditions, the rains will sweep away dry soil much quicker than would normally happen under heavy rains, raising the chance for potential flash floods. Several schools in Baja California were closed today, with the storm sitting 75 miles west of Punta Eugenia this afternoon, with wind speeds of 45 miles per hour. Cities throughout the area have been making various preparations, on top of helping residents who wish to evacuate the area for their own safety.

Associated Press,"(ELLICOTT CITY, Md.) — Roaring flash floods struck a Maryland city Sunday that had been wracked by similar devastation two years ago, its main street turned into a raging river that reached the first floor of some buildings and swept away parked cars, authorities and witnesses say. News outlets showed photos and video of sudden and violent floodwaters surging down Main Street in Ellicott City, some 13 miles (20 kilometers) west of Baltimore. The community, set along the west bank of Maryland’s Patapsco River, was also stricken by deadly flash flooding in July 2016. This time, witnesses say, the flash flooding came with a roar of onrushing water amid a pelting rain that had soaked the region around Baltimore. After the floodwaters receded, emergency officials had no immediate reports of fatalities or injuries. But by nightfall first responders and rescue officials were still going through the muddied, damaged downtown, conducting safety checks and ensuring people evacuated. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who declared a state of emergency for the flooded community, traveled there late Sunday for a firsthand look at the destruction. Footage of Sunday’s flash flooding showed the seething floodwaters engulfing cars and pickup trucks. The Howard County Fire &amp; EMS agency tweeted that water was above the first floor of some buildings at the height of the disaster. Flash floods struck a Maryland community wracked by similar flooding in 2016, authorities said, and water rescues were being carried out as raging brown waters surged through the streets Sunday. (May 27) Some residents of Ellicott City told The Baltimore Sun the flooding appeared to be worse than the 2016 flooding that killed two people and destroyed local businesses. Jessica Ur, a server at Pure Wine Cafe on the city’s Main Street, told the paper she watched as gushing waters swept three or four parked cars down the street. She had been around the last time the area flooded, but said this time it appeared worse. “It’s significantly higher than it was before,” she told the newspaper, comparing the floodwaters to those of 2016. Some reported a blaring alarm had sounded. Others said they gathered in the second story of a building to anxiously watch the seething waters. One sight during the flood: a handmade, white flag hung from an upper story of a Main Street building bearing the letters SOS. “If you are trapped, we are coming,” the Howard County Department of Fire and Rescue Services tweeted at one point. It added that multiple rescues were carried out, and rescue swimmers were called in to help. The department also said swift water units from as far away as Northern Virginia were summoned. There were no reports of fatalities, said Howard County spokeswoman Karen Spicer. Meanwhile, some roads were also flooded in neighboring Baltimore County. A spokeswoman in Baltimore County said the fire department has received dozens of calls about cars stuck in high water and flooded basements. Ellicott City has been rebuilding since the 2016 flooding damaged and destroyed businesses. Local officials recently said that 96 percent of the businesses were back in operation and more than 20 new businesses had again opened in the Main Street area. Just two weeks ago, Hogan announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had awarded the state and county more than $1 million to pay for projects aimed at reducing the flood risk in areas around Main Street. On Sunday, officials opened a shelter at a community center in Ellicott City for the victims. The disaster came on a day when the National Weather Service said a flash flood warning had been issued for what it described as an “extremely dangerous situation.” A meteorologist said about 8 inches (20 centimeters) fell in Ellicott city in a 6-hour period.",There were no immediate reports of fatalities or injuries,2018-05-28T02:04:31Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",A State of Emergency Has Been Declared as Flash Floods Strike a Maryland City,http://time.com/5292877/maryland-ellicott-flash-floods/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/8004.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,flash-flood,1
Robin Epley,"Exactly three weeks after the Camp Fire flattened the town of Paradise, floods Thursday afternoon caused road closures and evacuations in the same area that burned. Lower Butte Creek Canyon was evacuated because of rising water, Highway 99 was closed south of Chico for a couple of hours, and the Chico Police Department issued a flash flood alert for southeast Chico, east of Bruce Road from Chico Canyon Road to Skyway. Nearly 100 cars were trapped for at least an hour on Honey Run Road, as two separate debris flows and flooding blocked cars from evacuating safely. At one point, officials from the Butte County Sheriffs Office confirmed the backup was two miles long. Paradise, at one point, received more than an inch of rain in an hour. Later, water rescuers were called out to Honey Run Road, in the lower area of Butte Creek Canyon, after a white Jeep Cherokee was reported floating down Butte Creek. Crews were mobilizing and being asked to prepare for additional rescues or other flood-related issues. The U.S. Army mobilized 19 high water vehicles that could hold 20-30 people for evacuations. Evacuation warnings are in place for the Hamlin Canyon and Lower Neal zones, and on the west side of the county at Hegan Lane south to Highway 162 to the Sacramento River. There were two debris flows across Honey Run Road, and about 50 people are stuck in their homes above the second debris flow. At least 3 families were rescued by boat and evacuated out of the area. An evacuation alert was issued for the 200 block of Honey Run Road to Skyway including Horse Run Lane due to flooding. With lower Honey Run Road closed, rescuers evacuated people up the canyon and Honey Run Road to Paradise, which is still under evacuation orders. Highway 99 south of Chico was temporarily closed in both directions but reopened at 3:40 p.m. When Highway 99 was closed and traffic was being routed to Midway and Durham, flooding was reported on the Midway near Jones Avenue. The National Weather Service in Sacramento issued a flash flood warning in the burn scar area of the Camp Fire. Locations under warning include Paradise, Magalia, Pulga, Concow, the Skyway, Highway 70 and Pentz Road. The warning, originally set to expire around 3 p.m., was extended to at least 9:15 p.m. and the weather service is warning people in these areas to be careful of debris flows, including possible rock and mudslides. Meanwhile a power outage affecting the Oroville and Thermalito areas started at 12:11 p.m. and impacted 2,500 customers. Crews found a failed electrical connection near Highway 70 and Oro Dam Boulevard and were working to troubleshoot.","The Mercury News Camp Fire: Fire, then floods: Evacuations and road closures The Mercury News Exactly three weeks after the Camp Fire flattened the town of Paradise, floods Thursday afternoon caused road closures and evacuations in the same area that burned. …",2018-11-30T14:35:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Mercurynews.com'}","Camp Fire: Fire, then floods: Evacuations and road closures - The Mercury News",https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/11/30/flash-flood-warning-issued-in-camp-fire-burn-area-butte-county/,https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/FLOOD21.jpg?w=1024&h=677,,Mercurynews.com,flash-flood,1
Jennifer Calfas,"Flash flooding and heavy rainfall have inundated Houston and surrounding neighborhoods as officials urge Texans to stay off the roads during the Fourth of July holiday. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the Houston area through the late afternoon Wednesday and warned residents to avoid flooded streets. Short bursts of heavy rainfall amounting to three to four inches within an hour hit Houston and flood the area, Ken Clark, an expert meteorologist at AccuWeather, tells TIME. The significant flooding comes as a result of these flash floods and heavy downpours — not overflowing water from nearby rivers and waterways. “You can’t just drain that much water that quickly,” Clark said. The rain is expected to lighten up later in the evening — which could make it possible for residents to view the planned Fourth of July fireworks. As of Wednesday afternoon, most of the city’s Fourth of July festivities were canceled, but officials were holding out hope they could still launch the fireworks display. Prompted by heavy rainfall, the immense flooding closed down parts of the I-10 Katy Freeway in Houston — a major freeway that spans six to eight lanes wide, according to ABC 13. Local media captured videos of firefighters, police and residents saving vehicles stalled in the high flood waters. Videos shared on social media showed cars driving the flooding and people navigating through them knee-high waters. Local businesses and popular destinations for Independence Day activities in the area appeared closed up shop as a result of the flooding. The Houston Zoo tweeted it would close and bring its animals inside for the remainder of the day, and a number of parades in the area were cancelled, too. While Clark said this kind of flooding isn’t necessarily common, it’s to be expected for a city based in tropical and moist climate during the summer months. Houston has a history with flooding — and the events on Wednesday were for some an eerie reminder of the devastation caused when Hurricane Harvey hit the city last August. Harvey caused catastrophic flooding, took more than 80 lives and destroyed homes and communities in the nation’s fourth-largest city. The devastating event shed light on the city’s vulnerability to flooding, as it sits on a clay surface, near a number of waterways and along the Gulf Coast.","""You can't just drain that much water that quickly""",2018-07-04T19:15:45Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Flash Floods Rain Out Fourth of July Festivities in Houston,http://time.com/5330436/flash-floods-rain-out-fourth-of-july-festivities-in-houston/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/houston-harvey.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,flash-flood,1
"Eliott C. McLaughlin, CNN","(CNN) After the deadly flooding of 2016, Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said Ellicott City was reduced to a ""war zone"" and likened it to the scene of disaster movie set. On Monday, Kittleman said the flooding of 2018 was much nastier. Authorities were still in the assessment stage on a soggy Memorial Day, trying to determine exactly how much worse. Particularly worrying, Kittleman said, is a 25- to 30-foot-wide hole just north of Main Street, where the ground appears to have buckled under the weight of the flooding. ""There are a lot of people whose lives are going to be devastated again, and they've been working so hard to come back and we just need to be there for them and to tell them... all of our resources are there to help them,"" Kittleman said. ""I can't imagine what they're going through. I couldn't imagine what they went through two years ago, and now it's even worse."" The first concern is people. Emergency responders conducted 30 rescues Monday morning as they continued their search for a missing man, identified as Eddison Hermond. Sarah Lopez was at a restaurant, attending a birthday party with Hermond when the flooding began, she told CNN. Hermond left to help a woman rescue her cat from a pet store. Witnesses returned and said Hermond slipped into the river and was carried away, said Lopez, whose husband met Hermond 20 years ago in the US Air Force. As rescuers continue searching for Hermond, there were no reports of deaths or major injuries as of early Monday, Kittleman said. The 2016 flood killed two people, when floodwaters swept away their vehicles. Gas and electricity have been shut down on Main Street, where water ran through buildings as if it were a tributary of the nearby Patapsco River, which swelled to record levels during Sunday's storms. The river is a major waterway that feeds into the Chesapeake Bay. Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric said it will need to survey the damage to its infrastructure before providing a timeline for restoring service. Flooding claimed the old courthouse, Kittleman said, and there are homes on the west end of downtown whose foundations and basements are gone. ""A lot of the businesses, the first floors are gone, like they were two years ago,"" he said. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency Sunday in Howard County. Marked by quaint shops in the bottom floors of brick, stone slab and siding-clad buildings, the historic downtown is a major draw in this community of about 66,000 people located about 12 miles west of Baltimore. Main Street, also known as Frederick Road, was transformed into a waterway over the weekend, as brown water sluiced through town, destroying shops and upending cars. In some areas, the water rose above the buildings' first floors. To understand what authorities were surveying Monday, it's perhaps helpful to understand what happened fewer than two years ago. After 6 inches of rain fell on the flood-prone community in about two hours, residents say the flooding came from nowhere in 2016. In addition to the two people killed, more than two dozen buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed. Residents formed human chains to pluck their neighbors from the rushing waters. Kittleman said at the time that it was the worst devastation in Howard County in 50 years, but the town rallied around the slogan ""Ellicott City Strong"" and got to the arduous work of putting their community back together again. When the rain came Sunday, many residents remained in the throes of recovery. The county was working on stormwater retention ponds and preparing to install additional piping. Money from a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant had just arrived and was slated for repairs and construction, Kittleman said. ""There are things that we are doing. It just can't be done in less than two years,"" he said. ""After the flood in 2016 and working on the recovery there, you can't get things done in a year or two. It just can't happen. And you saw, we get the money from FEMA two years later. That's how it works."" More than 8 inches in 15 hours The river rose 17.8 feet in two hours Sunday afternoon, to 24.1 feet, a record from the previous high of 23.6 feet. The National Weather Service, which issued a flash flood warning for southeastern Howard County through early Monday, reported that parts of the greater Baltimore area got isolated rainfall of more than 9 inches. Three to 6 inches was common throughout the metro area. In parts of Ellicott, more than 8 inches fell between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. Sunday, the weather service said. The eastern portion of the community saw more than 7 inches in that timespan, while the southwestern side of town received more than 5 inches of the wet stuff. There are possibilities that another inch could fall, the NWS said, and though that doesn't sound like much rain, it means trouble for the already saturated ground and burgeoning rivers. Aside from the Patapsco River, there are four other smaller waterways running through and around the Ellicott. The Howard County Department of Fire and Rescue Services urged residents to evacuate downtown or move to higher ground while rescue teams fanned out through the area. They're being asked to stay away from Main Street until authorities can ensure buildings are safe to enter. The Roger Carter Community Center is open for those who need a place to shelter. Gov. Hogan toured the area Sunday with Kittleman. He lamented the destruction, noting that just two weeks earlier, he had visited the historic downtown and spoken with business owners about rebuilding efforts. ""The place looked terrific,"" he said. ""It's just devastating because people have their lives tied up in this and went through a heck of a lot and came back and now they're starting all over again."" Kittleman expressed confidence Monday that Ellicott could make another comeback. ""This is where we're one Howard again, and we'll be one Ellicott City,"" he said. ""We will be stronger in the future. We really will, folks. This is not a place that gives in. We didn't give in in 2016. We're not going to give in in 2018."" Asked what he'd say to downtown business owners who have their doubts about reopening after being hammered twice in 22 months, Kittleman said he sees their side of things. ""I can totally understand what they're saying. If I was in their shoes, I'd probably be reassessing that myself."" CNN's Paul P. Murphy, Lindy Royce, Emanuella Grinberg and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","After the deadly flooding of 2016, Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said Ellicott City was reduced to a ""war zone"" and likened it to the scene of disaster movie set.

http://www.facebook.com/pix11news,"NEW YORK An early season Noreaster will make a mess across the Tri-state region this weekend. All of the ingredients are there for one heck of a windstorm that brought heavy rain, inland and coastal flooding, and power outage, disrupting any pre-Halloween activities as the holiday will be this upcoming Wednesday. The worst of the Noreaster is expected to last through noon on Saturday. High Wind Warnings have been issued for the Jersey Shore and Eastern Long Island will get the brunt of the storm as the system makes its pass just off shore on Saturday. Gusts to 60 mph will be possible along with a lot of rain that could total two inches or higher. The strong onshore winds will also pile up water along the coast. Coastal Flood Warnings have been issued through noon as tides could go three feet above astronomical during Saturday mornings high tide. This will lead to widespread moderate flooding, and in some cases major flooding for the most vulnerable spots like the back bays of Nassau. The shore surrounding Long Island Sound wont escape the flooding either. Expect additional moderate flooding during the midday high tide cycle affecting vulnerable coastal locations. Those areas could see road closures and flooding of low-lying properties. [8:15am Saturday] - Rain will continue through much of the day. However, we no longer anticipate any flash flooding so the flash flood watch has been cancelled. Strong winds are still expected this morning and afternoon. pic.twitter.com/hrEJDKJzEr — NWS New York NY (@NWSNewYorkNY) October 27, 2018 Though rain continues through the day, flash flooding is no longer anticipated, the flash flood watch has been cancelled, according to the National Weather Center. In addition to coastal flooding, the beaches will get a beating. An intense storm like this will kick up the surf allowing waves of 8 to 12 feet high to pound the shore. That will create a good deal of beach erosion along the Jersey Shore and South Shore of Long Island. Closer to the city, conditions are not expected to be as bad, however over 1 inch of total rain will occur with wind gusts to 50 mph during the morning. A storm watch also remains in effect until 6 p.m. Saturday, evening with wind gusts up between 25 and 35 mph along Long Island and coastal Connecticut. Winds offshore on the ocean and across the Long Island Sound have reached up to 50 mph. Regardless of whoever gets to torrential downpours or worst winds, this storm will produce scattered power outages especially through Saturday morning. The heavy rain will weaken the ground and strong winds could toppled down trees onto power lines and area roadways. Conditions improve further Sunday salvaging the back half of the weekend, but the day will still have a good deal of clouds.","WPIX 11 New York Nor'easter slams New York area with drenching rain, winds, coastal flooding WPIX 11 New York NEW YORK — An early season Nor'easter will make a mess across the Tri-state region this weekend.

"Ari Phillips on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","It’s been less than two months since mudslides tore through Southern California’s Santa Barbara County, killing 21 people and destroying at least 100 homes. Now, Montecito and Carpinteria, small coastal towns that suffered the bulk of that devastation, are under new evacuation orders as a strong rains are forecast. As of 8 a.m. Wednesday morning, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office has issued a Recommended Evacuation Warning for areas in the country that were recently hit by the Thomas, Sherpa, and Whittier wildfires. The burned areas clear a path for rocks and debris that otherwise would have probably have been contained during a flash flood. According to the warming, a winter storm arriving Thursday night and continuing through Friday could drop one-third to two-thirds of an inch of rain per hour. The National Weather Service informed officials that this heavy rainfall may be enough to trigger mud and debris flows near burn areas, according to KEYT news. Tree roots are also crucial in holding soil together along steep topography, and with that natural support removed, the land becomes much more susceptible to mudslides. This is especially the case in drought-ravaged regions where the soil is too dry to take in large amounts of water very quickly. This interactive map identifies the areas of Goleta, Santa Barbara, Montecito, Summerland and Carpinteria most threatened by the rains. Kathy Hoxsie, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard, told the Los Angeles Times that the “very moist system...goes right over” the Thomas Fire burn scar. The Thomas Fire, which ignited in early December, eventually became the state’s largest wildfire on record, burning about 281,900 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. Many were also forced to evacuate when the Thomas Fire threatened the region. The back-to-back natural disasters have forced local officials to reconsider how they warn residents about threats and how to distinguish between voluntary and mandatory evacuation zones. “The problem is, sometimes the focus is on the word ‘voluntary,’ rather than the word ‘evacuation,’”Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown recently told The Washington Post. “The reality is, it’s still an evacuation area...Had we known what we now know, we would have evacuated the entire area.” Additional evacuation information will be provided later on Wednesday and if any Mandatory Evacuation Order is issued, everyone must least the designated areas by Thursday, March 1 at 9 a.m. “If at any time people feel threatened, take immediate action,” states the release. “Do not wait for a notification. Those with access and functional needs and those with large animals should leave.” When evacuated Montecito residents started returning to their homes in early February after the devastating January mudslides, they were met with a host of new problems, including unhealthy layers of mud containing everything from sewage to petrochemicals, according to local reports. And now, another decision about evacuation.","It’s been less than two months since mudslides tore through Southern California’s Santa Barbara County, killing 21 people and destroying at least 100 homes.

(Photo: Brian Powers, Rodney White/The Register) Buy Photo For a few minutes Saturday night, sweaty Des Moines-area residents savored the sudden temperature drop that provided a respite to the day's nearly unbearable heat and humidity. Their enjoyment was short-lived. In a flash, the skies burst, deluging parts of Polk County with nearly 9 inches of rain in less than four hours. The flooding resulted in the death of 66-year-old Larry Cotlar, who got out of a stalled van and was swept away by the fast-moving water. Emmert: Larry Cotlar was a Des Moines radio icon who had a story for every occasion More: Outpouring of grief after Des Moines broadcaster Larry Cotlar dies in flash flood Peterson: Drake Bulldogs radio personality Larry Cotlar 'almost too nice for sports radio' The wash of water caused widespread chaos: A duplex exploded in Urbandale ; flooding displaced dozens of people, including patients in hospice care; businesses were inundated with water ; and first-responders were scurrying throughout the night rescuing people stranded in vehicles and flooded buildings. “The speed and how long that rain fell caught us by surprise,” Des Moines police spokesman Paul Parizek said during a Sunday news conference. The onslaught resulted in “catastrophic flooding” throughout Polk County, said Kelsey Angle, a National Weather Service meteorologist. Areas near Fourmile Creek and Walnut Creek sustained the most damage, said A.J. Mumm, director of Polk County Emergency Management. Both creeks set record-high crests. Last Slide Next Slide What's next for the Des Moines area Saylorville Lake is expected to crest at about 888 feet by the end of the week, Mumm said — about 4 feet below record levels. The reservoir, managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is about 11 miles north of Des Moines and was built to provide flood protection to the capital city. Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie on Sunday said he didn’t anticipate that water released from Saylorville will cause problems for cities downstream. “But that is all contingent on the weather,” he said. In 2008, Des Moines and other parts of Iowa experienced historic flooding caused by melting from the winter’s heavy snowfall and above average rainfall that began Memorial Day weekend. The weather prompted flooding and levee breaches in Des Moines. Since then, more than $20 million has been spent rebuilding the levees, and millions more have been spent buying properties, tearing down buildings and relocating residents. “I was thinking what could have been if those houses and people hadn’t been removed from those floodways,” Mumm said. More: Speed of rain, heavy amounts 'caught us by surprise,' police say Sudden cooling brings a torrent By Sunday afternoon, about 100 people had taken shelter at Hoyt Middle School because of flooding in or around their residences. Polk County officials, however, could not immediately say how many people were displaced by the flooding. Also unavailable is a monetary amount of the damage done by Saturday night’s storm. Rain began falling on the western edge of the Des Moines-metro area between 4 and 5 p.m., when the temperature was still 90 degrees, said Brooke Hagenhoff, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The temperature had dropped slightly by 7 p.m., to 88 degrees. By 7:54 p.m., it was 77. “That’s when the heavier precipitation began,” Hagenhoff said. Rainfall amounts ranged from 2.1 inches at the Des Moines International Airport to 8.7 inches in Ankeny, Hagenhoff said. Urbandale received 7.6 inches; Altoona, 6.5 inches and the weather service’s Johnston office, 3.8 inches. The rain came quick, and in bucket fulls. “These long lines of storms had pockets of heavier rainfall embedded in it,” Hagenhoff said. “These types of high-end events are rare but not completely unheard of.” Storm sewers were inundated, causing water to back up onto streets and turning some residents’ yards into ponds.

(Photo: Kelsey Kremer/The Register) A wash of water results in a fatality In Des Moines, a van stalled in the water-swollen intersection of 50th Street and Twana Drive at about 8:50 p.m. Saturday. The van’s occupants got out of the stalled vehicle and one man — sports radio personality Larry Cotlar — was swept away by floodwaters. His body was found around 12:30 a.m. Sunday, several blocks from the van. The heavy rain prompted record flood levels at two metro area creeks. Walnut Creek at 63rd Street crested at 19.1 feet, slightly higher than the previous record of 18.7 feet. Fourmile Creek at Easton Boulevard crested at 17.5 feet, more than a foot above the previous record of 16.1 feet set on Aug. 11, 2010. “It’s a little scary to think that we hit high-water marks last night in one downpour,” Cownie said.

(Photo: Kelsey Kremer/The Register) Widespread evacuations result from flooding Fourmile Creek’s flooding prompted the evacuation of Parkside East Apartments, located just east of the creek on East Douglas Avenue. Water rushed into ground-floor units, ruining residents’ belongings. “I lost everything,” said Ellen James, 58, who spent the night at Hoyt Middle School. “It’s horrible.” Vehicles in the apartment’s parking lot were also damaged. Fourmile Creek’s flooding also prompted the evacuation of Taylor House, which provides care for terminally ill people, and Pleasant Valley Mobile Home Park in Pleasant Hill.

(Photo: Brian Powers/The Register) In Clive, dozens of residences and businesses were damaged by flood and storm waters. Roads near Walnut Creek were closed and residences and businesses evacuated. Most were allowed to return by midday Sunday. At University Photo, at 78th Street and University Boulevard, the water “filled up like a bathtub,” business owner Sheri Bever said. It came too fast to save the business’ expensive photo printers and equipment, she said. “The choices are: Stand here and bawl, or (say) 'Hey, this is life,'” Bever said. “We’re alive.” In Urbandale, a duplex exploded after a breached gas line was ignited by an unknown source. No one was injured because flood waters had driven out the structure's occupants, two of whom escaped their basement after it quickly filled with water. Last Slide Next Slide In Ankeny, the city’s main water tower on Ash Drive drained in a matter of minutes on Saturday night after a major water main break. City officials issued a boil order for water around 2 a.m. By 4 a.m., the order was lifted except for an area near the break. City employees were still working to fix the break at midday Sunday, but water service was normal for the rest of the city. The weather forecast calls for mostly dry weather in the coming days, which allow for clean-up to continue. “We have a lot of work ahead of us,” Mumm said.

Reuters,"(Reuters) ― The U.S. Southern Plains and Midwest braced for more flooding on Thursday as snow-melting temperatures and heavy rains swelled waterways after claiming the lives of at least two people, including a child, and forcing hundreds of people to evacuate. Flood advisories were in effect until at least Sunday for low-lying parts of eastern Texas northeast across the region into southern Ohio and in Michigan, Indiana and Illinois, the National Weather Service said. The flooding forced hundreds of people to place sandbags around their property and flee their homes in small communities like Niles, Indiana and Marseilles, Illinois that sit on rivers, already beyond their flood stages, that were not expected to crest for days. “We just got to wait for it to go down,” Terry Teeter said to WOOD-TV after installing pumps around his house in Mattawan, Michigan. “It’s going to be a couple of days like this.” A one-year-old girl died when she wandered into standing water in a backyard in Central Michigan and a 52-year-old woman was found dead in her car that was submerged in a ditch in Illinois, local media reported. Rising waters also forced some 19 people to evacuate their homes in Elkhart, Indiana, a community about 110 miles (175 km) southeast of Chicago, the local newspaper reported. “This city has not seen flooding like this in the last 45 years,” Elkhart Mayor Tim Neese said during a news conference, the Elkhart Truth reported. More rain was expected to fall on Thursday in the Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas where as much as 8 inches (20 cm) fell on Tuesday and Wednesday, closing roadways and schools. “We are still expecting heavy rain and flash flooding at least through the end of the week,” the National Weather Service said in a Tweet regarding the region.

Amanda Curran,"MONTGOMERY, AL (WSFA) - The WSFA First Alert Weather Team has declared a First Alert Weather Day in anticipation of widespread heavy rain and strong to severe thunderstorms. The risk for severe weather runs from now through early Sunday morning across far east Alabama. As the band of thunderstorms progresses eastward, heavy rain and strong to severe thunderstorms will develop across our entire region into the overnight hours before exiting east Alabama Sunday morning. Earlier this afternoon a Tornado Watch was issued for western counties across both central and south Alabama; that expired at 7 p.m., and now there is a new Tornado Watch for far south and west Alabama counties. This new watch will last until 2 a.m. on Sunday morning. A few models have hinted at a weak low developing to our southwest. Should this occur, some enhancement of thunderstorm activity would result in a slight increase in the overall severe weather potential. As the line of storms continues east, pockets of damaging winds and isolated tornadoes will be possible. Flash flooding remains a big concern as well due to the slow moving nature of this system; Flash Flood Watches and even a few warnings have been issued, and they are concentrated in western portions of Alabama as of right now. We encourage you to stay up to date with the latest updates into the weekend as new information becomes available.

It was particularly difficult to locate them because the cave system consists of dark, narrow bends that had become partially flooded due to the sudden influx of water. The boys are currently being taught how to swim and dive as part of authorities' plans to extract them from the cave as soon as possible.

Travis Fedschun,"Heavy rains from the outer bands of Hurricane Lane are pounding Hawaii's Big Island on Thursday, spawning flash flood warnings and landslides as residents across the state braced for the most powerful storm to hit Hawaii since 1992. The National Weather Service's Central Pacific Hurricane Center said in its 11 a.m. ET advisory that Lane is still a Category 4 storm with winds of 130 mph and is located about 305 miles south of Honolulu, traveling northwest at 7 p.m. ""On the forecast track, the center of Lane will move very close to or over the main Hawaiian Islands later today through Friday,"" the CPHC said. ""Some weakening is forecast during the next day or so, with more significant weakening thereafter. Lane is expected to remain a hurricane as it approaches the islands."" The location and forecast track of Hurricane Lane as of Thursday morning. (Fox News) The storm is already dropping heavy rain on the eastern side of the Big Island, with as much as 8-inches of rain being reported so far, according to Fox News Meteorologist Adam Klotz. The Hawaii Police Department said Highway 19 has been blocked in ""multiple areas"" due to landslides. ""Roadways extremely hazardous due to debris and water on the roadway,"" Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency tweeted. ""As much as 20 inches of rain is expected on the Big Island,"" Klotz said Thursday. ""The outer rain bands will spread across all of the other islands on Thursday. Winds will increase for residents as the storm approaches on Thursday, however strong upper level winds will weaken the storm overall."" Lane is expected to weaken to a Category 1 storm with winds between 74 and 95 mph by late Friday, but the track is still uncertain. Klotz added that landfall on any island is ""not yet out of question."" HURRICANE LANE THREATENS HAWAII: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE RARE STORM'S PATH Heavy rain has been falling on the Big Island of Hawaii since Wednesday. (AP) The hurricane has already triggered flash flood warnings on the Big Island, closing several roads and causing several rivers around Hilo to rise close to overflowing their banks. Mia Carter, who lives in Orchidlands Estates south of Hila, told KHON2 that the rain bands are more severe than what the area typically experiences. ""Right now the rain bands are very pronounced as they hit,"" she told KHON2. ""One minute it's torrential downpour with almost zero visibility and the next it is dry with clear skies. It's intensifying as the evening carries on."" Officials opened shelters on the Big Island and on the islands of Maui, Molokai and Lanai on Wednesday, but said the limited shelter space should be a ""last resort."" They urged those needing to use the Molokai shelter to get there soon because of concerns the main highway on the south coast of the island could become impassable. This image provided by NASA on Wednesday, Aug. 22, 2018 shows Hurricane Lane as seen from the International Space Station. (NASA) On the island of Oahu, which was put on a hurricane warning late Wednesday, shelters were scheduled to open Thursday. Officials were also working to help Hawaii's sizeable homeless population, many of whom live near beaches and streams that could flood. HAWAII BRACES FOR HURRICANE LANE, AS OFFICIALS SAY THERE ARE NOT 'ENOUGH SHELTERS FOR EVERYONE' Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim told KHON2 flash flooding is a major concern, as Lane is expected to slowly move northwest and bring heavy rain to the island. ""When there's rain, there's obviously problems, but surf and surge, because we're a tourist industry here and people live by the beach, hotels all by the beach, we have thousands of people along the coastal area and this hurricane has a potential of generating some very huge surf and surge,"" he told KHON. The National Weather Service's Central Pacific Hurricane Center expects Lane to move very close to over Hawaii from Thursday through Saturday (NOAA) The Federal Emergency Management Agency has several barges with food, water and supplies that it moved into the region ahead of Hurricane Hector, which skirted past the islands more than a week ago, according to FEMA Administrator Brock Long. President Trump approved an emergency declaration for Hawaii on Thursday, which allows FEMA to coordinate all disaster relief efforts. The U.S. Navy said Wednesday it was moving its ships and submarines out of Hawaii, adding all vessels not currently undergoing maintenance were being positioned to help respond after the storm, if needed. The central Pacific gets fewer hurricanes than other regions, with about only four or five named storms a year. For Hawaii, the ""big one"" came in in 1992 when Hurricane Iniki struck the island of Kauai as a Category-4 storm, causing $3.2 billion in damage and killing six people, according to Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean. Iniki is still the costliest and deadliest storm to hit the islands in recorded history, and only two other hurricanes -- an unnamed storm in 1871 and Dot in 1959 -- have hit a Hawaiian island in that time period.

ABC News,"Heavy rains pounding Southern California for a second day caused flooding and loosened hillsides as officials in fire-ravaged communities warned people to stay off roads over fears of destructive mud flows. Water and debris in lanes shut down coastal U.S. 101 and traffic accidents on rain-slicked roadways across the region slowed the Tuesday morning commute to a crawl. Several inches of rain fell in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, where thousands of residents evacuated over fears of mudslides in areas where the state's largest-ever fire raged last month. ""Creeks that normally would be dry would turn into raging rivers of mud and debris and large rocks and trees,"" said Robert Lewin, director of the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management. ""These can be quite damaging. They'll destroy roads, they'll take out homes."" Forecasters issued flash flood warnings and predicted that the cold front with powerful winds could bring higher rain totals to downtown Los Angeles than seen in the past 10 months. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for about 700 homes in former burn areas of Los Angeles County. A winter weather advisory was in place for mountain areas, where officials warned motorists to prepare for difficult travel conditions, including gusty winds, low visibility and snow-covered roads Flash flood watches were also issued for parts of Sonoma and Mendocino counties north of San Francisco, warning that the rains that were saturating the area Monday night could trigger mudslides in areas devastated by October wildfires. The blazes leveled entire neighborhoods, killing 44 people and destroying more than 8,900 homes and other buildings. A yearslong drought eased in the state last spring, but Northern California had a dry start to winter and hardly any measurable rain fell in the south over the past six months. The extremely dry conditions and high winds last year led to some of the most destructive blazes on both ends of the state. Now, the storm coming in from the Gulf of Alaska could dump up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain on Northern California areas still recovering from fires before clearing up by Tuesday evening, National Weather Service meteorologist Steve Anderson said. In the foothills just northeast of Los Angeles, residents placed sandbags outside houses that survived a December fire that scorched more than 24 square miles (62 square kilometers), destroyed 60 homes and damaged 55 others. The weather service also issued a winter weather advisory for portions of the Sierra Nevada above 7,000 feet (2,134 meters), forecasting about 4 to 7 inches (10 to 18 centimeters) of snow and up to 1 to 2 feet (30 to 61 centimeters) on higher peaks Tuesday. ——— Associated Press writers Christopher Weber and John Antczak in Los Angeles, Olga R.

AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE,"SYDNEY: Thousands of Sydney homes were without power Saturday after severe storms hit Australias largest city, causing transport hold-ups, inundating vehicles with floodwater and delaying a national football match.
Heavy rains and lightning storms lashed parts of Sydney late Friday, with close to 60 millimeters (nearly two and a half inches) of rain falling in some areas.
In Sydneys west, which experienced some flash flooding, one suburb saw nearly 42 millimeters fall in a short downpour lasting just 30 minutes.
It was a slow-moving storm with that warm humid air moving along the coast that allowed for that increase of moisture, Byron Doyle from the New South Wales Bureau of meteorology told AFP.
Images of cars submerged in floodwaters on main roads, broken traffic lights and fallen trees circulated on social media.
Energy companies reported that more than 40,000 customers were affected by power outages at the peak of the storm overnight, with more than 5,000 still without power early Saturday.
Emergency services fielded over 1,000 requests for assistance, including nine flood rescues in the Sydney area.
The rescues were all for vehicles in flood water, a New South Wales state emergency services spokesperson told AFP.
Flights were delayed at Sydneys airport, while the storm caused havoc on some of the citys train lines.
The start of a national Australian rules football womens match was delayed twice, pushed back 45 minutes as heavy rain and lightning pummelled the oval.
Several light towers then went out mid-match during the live television broadcast, temporarily stopping the game during a reported blackout.
The Sydney storm comes as recovery efforts continue in Australias flood-ravaged northeastern state of Queensland, which over the past week has seen record-breaking rainfall, forcing hundreds of evacuations and thousands of requests for help.
Extreme heatwaves during the southern hemisphere summer have also led to temperature records being broken in some towns.
Eastern inland areas have been experiencing a severe drought, while firefighters in the countrys southern states have been recently battling bushfires.
High temperatures are not unusual in the Australian summer, but climate change has pushed up land and sea temperatures and led to more extremely hot days and severe fire seasons, scientists say.

Michael Mcgough,"An atmospheric river is sending rain Sacramento’s way this week, dropping as much as 4 feet of snow in the Sierra and giving a little bit of relief to Californians concerned about another drought. A wet March so far has aided the Sacramento Valley in inching closer to the average totals for the water year. The atmospheric river will no doubt help, but you’re probably wondering: What is an atmospheric river, anyway? The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration defines them as “relatively long, narrow regions in the atmosphere – like rivers in the sky – that transport most of the water vapor outside of the tropics.” For California, this means that streams of moisture are being pulled by wind from the tropics to the West Coast. Here are five other things to note about atmospheric rivers. Good news, bad news... The good news: Atmospheric rivers help provide much-needed rainfall, can give major boosts to snowpack in areas like the Sierra, and National Weather Service forecasts can accurately predict and map them in advance. The bad news: They also bring heavy rains, sometimes posing significant flood risks to Western states. Always be on the lookout for flood and flash food warnings. In some Southern California counties, mudslides are a risk. Like any moderate to severe storm, atmospheric rivers can lead travel problems and delays, as well as to power outages. Most are weak systems Despite sometimes being nicknamed “ horizontal hurricanes, ” the NOAA notes that many rivers don’t cause significant damage. Winds from the approaching system in inland Northern California are expected to see winds top out at 20 mph, but the Bay Area could see gusts reach 35 mph by midweek. How big are they? Atmospheric rivers span anywhere from 250 to 370 miles, according to the NOAA. How about some examples? Pineapple express is one of the better-known types of atmospheric river. It takes moisture streams from Hawaii to California and nearby states, and is one of the stronger AR systems. That's the type heading for the Bay Area, as well as parts of Southern California, this week. Other quick facts As explained by NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory : Atmospheric rivers are an important part of Earth’s water system, and must exist somewhere on earth at any given time. A handful of them account for as much as half of some West Coast states’ annual rainfall totals; therefore, they are critical to California’s water supply.","Sacramento Bee What is an 'atmospheric river,' anyway?

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON/FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (Reuters) - Deeper flooding loomed in the hours and days ahead from rivers in the Carolinas swollen by Tropical Depression Florence, which has killed 23 people, even if rain-weary residents got a brief glimpse of sunshine on Monday. The slow-moving storm, a hurricane when it hit the North Carolina coast, has dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain on the state since Thursday, displacing thousands. The flooding could persist for several weeks in some areas. The coastal city of Wilmington remained cut off by flood waters from the Cape Fear River on Monday. Further inland, the same river, running through Fayetteville, a city of 200,000, was expected to reach major flood levels later on Monday, and would not crest until Tuesday. Florence was headed through Virginia and toward New England and flash flood watches extended from Maryland through New York and southern New England. In the Carolinas, the National Weather Service continued to warn people the floods were worsening. “The worst is yet to come,” as river levels rise to historic levels, said Zach Taylor, an NWS meteorologist. “The soil is soaked and can’t absorb any more rain so that water has to go somewhere, unfortunately.” Major rivers are expected to remain flooded for the next two to three weeks, said Steve Goldstein, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration liaison to the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The death toll from Florence, which came ashore in North Carolina on Friday, rose to 23 on Monday. The dead included a 1-year-old boy who was swept away from his mother as they tried to escape their car amid floodwaters. The woman had driven around barricades to get on a closed road, the sheriff’s office in Union County, near North Carolina’s border with South Carolina, said on Facebook. North Carolina officials reported 1,200 road closures, including a stretch of Interstate 95, a major transportation artery running the length of the U.S. East Coast. About 509,000 homes and businesses were without electricity on Monday in North and South Carolina and surrounding states. POWER OUTAGES, BLOCKED ROADS The sun appeared in some areas for the first time in days, allowing some people who had been forced to leave their homes to return home to assess damage. Eric Tryggeseth, 59, found his home in Leland, North Carolina, without power and with a tree lying in his front yard. He had been evacuated a day before by troops in a truck. “The floodwaters were rising so I figured I better get out of there,” he said. “I can’t thank the first responders enough.” There were currently 2,000 federal workers working on storm response, supporting state efforts, said Tom Fargione, FEMA Federal Coordinating Officer, during a press conference. Sean Adams, 29, a contractor from Leland, said his home suffered only minor damage but he had no idea when power might be restored. With so many roads in and out of the region flooded, he could not access supplies to help start rebuilding. “We really can’t get much done right now. It’s getting frustrating,” he said. The storm killed 17 people in North Carolina, including a mother and child hit by a falling tree, state officials said. Six people died in South Carolina, including four in car accidents and two from carbon monoxide from a portable generator.

Jennifer Calfas,"Rescuers and volunteers used jet skis and helicopters to evacuate hundreds of people in Hawaii this week and over the weekend after heavy rain caused massive flooding and triggered mudslides and power outages. More than 340 people were evacuated with the help of rescuers and volunteers who helped retrieve people from flood-stricken areas in Kauai, according to Hawaii News Now. Photos and videos shared by the news outlet show homes standing in murky flood water and mud and debris blocking highways and roads. Similar damage could be seen on the island of Oahu, where mud filled homes and flood water lined streets. The damage comes after several Hawaii islands saw flash flooding and severe thunderstorms over the weekend. Hawaii Gov. David Ige issued an emergency proclamation for Kauai, where the flooding endangered “the health, safety and welfare of the people,” he wrote. Hawaii’s department of water issued a “do not drink” advisory for residents in the towns of Hanalei and Wainiha in Kauai.

Rob Schumacher, Arizona Republic | azcentral.com Havasu Falls is in the remote southwestern reaches of the Grand Canyon along Colorado River tributary Havasu Creek on Havasupai tribal land. (Photo: Pat Shannahan/The Republic) About 200 tourists visiting the remote Havasu Falls area of the Grand Canyon were being evacuated via helicopter Thursday because of flash flooding overnight. The area is expected to remain closed for 7 to 10 days, and the road leading to the trailhead was closed. Everyone was accounted for and no serious injuries have been reported, said Abbie Fink, spokeswoman for the Havasupai Tribal Council. Visitors were moved Wednesday night from the campground that sits between Havasu Falls and Mooney Falls, south of Grand Canyon National Park, to the village of Supai, Arizona, about 2 miles from the campground. They spent the night in the community center and school, Fink said. Brian Volk, a member of a Facebook group for hikers headed to the Havasupai area, said his wife, who works for the tribe and is in Supai, told him some hikers stayed behind to help. ► July 12: 9 epic hiking trails to tackle before you die ► Jan. 30: Havasupai falls fever: Why some people are taking Feb. 1 off ► Jan. 17: Price of permits to visit Havasupai falls soars for 2018 ""The hiking community has me speechless,"" Volk noted in a Facebook post.

Imagine scrambling in fear for your life, losing your wallet, clothes, packs, sleeping in cramped conditions with only the clothes on your back. Then offering to stay and help."" The tribe said recent monsoon storms in northern Arizona caused two waves of flooding. About 7 feet of floodwaters hit Supai shortly before dark Wednesday and campers were moved then. A second wave hit at about 3:30 a.m. MST Thursday. Eric Kremer of Auburn, California, posted four photos in his Facebook feed of brown waters spilling into what is usually a blue-green swimming hole. Tara Brewer of New York City posted video in her feed. The waves of flood waters did not hit the village of Supai though some buildings have water damage, the tribe said. The Havasupai Tribal Cafe has electricity and has been open as usual. Grand Canyon Caverns, a hotel on the way to the Havasupai trailhead, was providing breakfast to evacuees and use of showers and telephones, the tribe said.

Alex Lockie,"President Donald Trump appeared to raise the level of alarm over the coming Hurricane Florence on Twitter on Thursda, saying the storm had gotten ""even larger and more powerful"" despite it being downgraded from a category 4 to a category 2 storm. Trump on Wednesday warned US citizens in the path of Florence to evacuate immediately. Overnight the National Hurricane Center downgraded the storm based on deteriorating wind speeds, which are now around 110mph rather than previous highs of 130mph. However, the National Hurricane Center tweeted not to focus on the wind speeds. ""Life-threatening storm surge flooding, catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding are still expected,"" it said. Experts have said the the rain and flood waters from Florence, rather than its speed, are the real source of danger. While the storm has expanded in area, and still holds a tremendous amount of water capable of flooding and doing damage, it is less powerful than it was on Wednesday. The latest track of the storm suggests that it will strike close to the North Carolina-South Carolina border before heading further inland. As of 8 a.m. Thursday, the storm was 170 miles from the North Carolina shore. 10 million people live in the storm's path.

Chris Jones,"On August 24 at 8:20 pm, a 44-year-old moonlighting meteorologist named Eric Berger was nearly finished writing a post for his Houston-centric blog, Space City Weather, titled “ Harvey Late Night: Some Final Thursday Thoughts.” He was in his home office. He had just poured himself a glass of cabernet. He had been looking at the online forecasts from the National Hurricane Center and agreed with their essential conclusions: Harvey was a well-­organized storm that would land with hurricane force on the Texas Gulf Coast somewhere between Corpus Christi and Port O’Connor. Berger also backed the center’s belief that the winds would be strong in Houston that weekend, perhaps more than 40 miles per hour. But he was far more worried about the rain. The unanswered question is what happens to Harvey once it reaches the coast, Berger wrote. Where will it go, and will it go fast enough? Houston’s rainfall totals over the next five days depend on this, and we just don’t know. The considerable majority of modern weather forecasting is aided by computer algorithm. Most hurricane tracking relies on data crunched by various public and private computer models, and the models, which take different variables (temperature, moisture, mass) and consider them in different ways, are not always in agreement. The National Hurricane Center takes input from several models to make its predictions, averaging out their differences, in part because it faces the tallest order in hurricane forecasting: It must say that the hurricane will go here. So must television meteorologists, one of the center’s principal conduits to a concerned public. TV, too, demands a singular answer. Berger doesn’t have to draw a line. He is a certified meteorologist, but the weather is just a particularly absorbing hobby of his; his primary paying gig is writing about aerospace for Ars Technica (a site owned by WIRED Media Group), and he blogs about the weather in his free time. That gives him two luxuries that most front-line meteorologists don’t have: He can value certain models and their ensembles much more heavily than others, untangling as many as 50 different versions of each forecast, and he can also admit doubt. He can explore the subtlety of the weather, marveling at its mysteries, the way he has for his small but loyal community of readers for years, but especially since he established his site in October 2015. Berger does not generate his forecasts from scratch, pointing his licked finger into the wind and taking readings from the Galileo thermometer on his windowsill. He really does have a Galileo thermometer on his windowsill, but he works out of a home office that he hasn’t otherwise bothered to decorate, with a basic PC and a single monitor on which he toggles between tabs, from forecast to conflicting forecast. In Houston that evening, the US government forecast called for about 15 inches of rain. By then Berger had already begun to wonder. There is one model he has come to trust and rely on more than any other: the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’ Integrated Forecasting System, more popularly known in the US as the European model. Funded by 22 EU members and 12 cooperating states, the European model is sometimes shockingly accurate, in part because it’s so well financed and its computing power is stronger than most. With Harvey, it suggested that the storm would stall over Houston, dumping 25 inches of rain or more before eventually moving on. That synced with Berger’s own analysis of the weather patterns in the atmosphere. He detected a troublesome absence of steering currents, the forces that push hurricanes to wherever they’re headed next, and without those currents, the European model’s forecast of a stall made a lot of sense. Given the sum of the evidence before him, Berger felt confident in one fearsome prediction, and he wrote as much: Big-time floods are coming to Texas. It was, at its essence, an informed gut call, and Berger thought carefully about what he would write next. He had made his reputation, such as it was for a leisure-­time meteorologist with a city-specific weather blog, by refusing to submit to the hysterical frenzies that competent weather observers dismiss as “storm porn.” He is by nature a fairly skeptical person. His twin passions, space and the weather, share long histories of broken promises and unmet expectations. His site’s motto is “Hype-free forecasts for greater Houston,” mindful of the chaotic and ultimately unnecessary evacuations prompted by Hurricane Rita in 2005. I am not going to sugar-coat this, my friends, he had written in advance of that storm. As a Houston resident and property owner, I am truly mortified right now. Rita and Berger had both missed. But underplaying weather of dire consequences could lead to a different kind of calamity for his readers. James Spann, Alabama’s longtime weather forecaster of choice, had infamously botched that state’s ice storms of January 2014. Spann had predicted a “dusting” of snow, and unworried commuters headed out on the roads; when that dusting turned out to be a thick layer of ice, Spann shouldered much of the blame for the thousands of people who ended up stranded in their cars, schools, and workplaces overnight. Berger despises alarmism in all its forms. He also didn’t want to bear responsibility for children drowning in their attics. Berger’s wife, Amanda, was getting their own two daughters ready for bed in their League City apartment, temporary accommodations while the family builds their dream home in nearby Clear Creek. His dog, Bonnie, a Maltese-­poodle cross who dislikes all men but him, kept her usual vigilant watch. Berger can be painfully shy. Now he felt possessed by an unusual authority, exercised remotely through the digitally transmitted written word. He took another sip of his wine and returned to his keyboard. Certainly the Corpus Christi area and points immediately north and west of there will get too much rain, he wrote. Flooding will spread to other parts of Texas too, quite possibly Houston. But right now we can’t say that for certain. As I’ve said, it’s either going to be pretty bad, or really really bad here. He posted his piece. His site normally averaged somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 views a day. That particular entry received 207,334 over the next 24 hours. A shocked Berger surmised that his core readers were recommending him to their suddenly weather-concerned friends. He had become the center of a kind of storm within the storm. In the comments, one reader asked what Berger thought the rainfall totals might be in San Antonio, 200 miles to the west. Someone else asked about Colorado County, and another about the neighborhoods near Ellington Field. Another reader wondered whether her husband’s flight out of Hobby Airport on Saturday morning might be delayed. A man named Petey James pointed out that Saturday night was the night of the big fight between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor, and he wanted to know whether he should risk going to the local bar or pay to watch it at home. A woman named Deb Walters asked whether she should still have the party she had planned to host near Dacus on Saturday afternoon. I’d press ahead at this point, Berger wrote to her. Obviously if things turn ugly Saturday morning, you’ll have to cancel. The following morning, Friday, August 25, it started to rain, a few drops at first, and then a fairly steady shower. Harvey’s leading edge had come to town, and the models, constantly updated, began to align: Harvey was nearly laser-precise in its construction and massive, and it was also a slow mover. The rain was going to be measured in feet, not inches. Berger sat down at his desk, no wine this time, and wrote another post. “ A very serious flooding situation is coming, ” he wrote. He wrote it two more times for emphasis. “ A very serious flooding situation is coming. A very serious flooding situation is coming. ” It was 3:15 pm. He hoped Deb Walters had canceled her party. Millions turned to Berger’s Space City Weather blog during the storm. Since 1980, there have been more than 200 weather and climate events in the United States that have each caused more than $1 billion in damage. Three principal national bodies are charged with predicting their arrivals and effects. The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, keeps watch for tornadoes. The Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, monitors heavy rains. And the National Hurricane Center in Miami minds hurricanes. They have been busy. In the case of Harvey, all three were involved, funneling their best information to the Houston branch of the National Weather Service, one of its 122 field offices across the country. Each helps turn national forecasts into finely tuned local ones. The Houston office is the only one that shares space with its home county’s Office of Emergency Management—Galveston County in its case—better to coordinate their shared response. It is no accident that their building sits atop a mound and that their offices are on the upper floor. Over the past few decades, greater Houston has grown exponentially from a mosquito-­plagued oil port into the fifth-largest metro area in the United States, home to nearly 7 million people. That population explosion, combined with a certain regional antipathy toward civic oversight, has seen former swamps turned into sprawling, unregulated developments. Houston has been built to flood. Dan Reilly, 52, is the local Warning Coordination Meteorologist, part of the National Weather Service’s round-the-clock professional staff. In a catastrophe-prone city like his, the job is twofold. The first is the forecast. “When something bad is coming, that’s really when we need to be at the top of our game,” he says. Of the three most damaging effects of hurricanes—wind, storm surge, and rain—rain is one of the most difficult to quantify in advance. The heaviest rain typically falls in small pockets, and that level of precision is difficult to attain more than six to 12 hours ahead of its arrival. Houston’s physical size also makes rain forecasts challenging: Each side of the I-10, for instance—one of several highways that serve as boundaries in an otherwise endless city—might receive a substantially different amount. A good meteorologist is almost always, by definition, skilled at pattern recognition. Weather, like the law, is built on a foundation of similar cases. Veteran meteorologists—Reilly has been in the job for 24 years—mine their memories for analogues. In the early hours of Harvey, Reilly’s team began upping the National Weather Service’s rain forecast to amounts that no one had ever seen: 25 inches, 30, and eventually 50, over a widespread swath of Houston. Reilly set aside everything he knew about the weather and decided to obey the combination of awe and dread he felt in his chest: A killing flood was on its way. Somehow the warnings sounded different coming from him. The next part of the job, and perhaps the more important one, is getting the word out. At a time when the weather can be more extreme than ever, and trust in government is low, convincing people to heed your warnings, especially the most severe of them, might now be the weather forecaster’s harder task. The most serious warning when it comes to rain is called a Flash Flood Emergency, and before Harvey, the Houston office had issued that warning on only three occasions. It would soon be used for a fourth. Berger, sitting behind his Spartan desk that afternoon, anxiety beginning to weigh on him like heat, was first among those who might listen—and to whom others might listen about the coming storm. He wasn’t the government; he was a human being, and somehow the warnings sounded different to their ears coming from him, the kind of measured voice that shines through in a crisis. After he had written his ominous flood forecast three times, he looked out his office window at one of the two garages he keeps. One of them was bursting with new things for his new house, and he began ferrying boxes upstairs to his office, filling the space in front of his desk with new light fixtures, a microwave, and a tub. In between trips, he heard Amanda making arrangements to take shelter, with their daughters, at her sister’s house, built on pilings and tucked away from the wind. Berger would stay. He would hunker down behind his wall of boxes with his PC and his readers, now numbering in the hundreds of thousands, for the duration of the storm. He knew that his city was in serious trouble, and he felt an almost spiritual need to convince his neighbors that it was time for them to share his fears. The weather started making an impression on Berger in 2001, when Tropical Storm Allison came to town. Berger is from Michigan but had gone to the University of Texas to earn his astronomy degree. He moved to Houston for a girl, first working weekends at the Houston Chronicle before becoming the paper’s designated “SciGuy,” writing mostly about physics, chemistry, and astronomy. He also wrote a little about the weather. He had just bought his first house near White Oak Bayou. On June 8, a Friday night—what was it about storms and Friday nights?—he went out with some friends to see a Bob Schneider concert. Allison had passed through Houston once already, but now it returned to take a second run at the city. Berger remembers that the sound of the rain on the roof drowned out Schneider, as though there was too much percussion in the mix. After the concert, he and his friends left to wander around midtown, gawking at the water rising on the empty streets. Berger wrote about the storm. One of his stories, about the drowning deaths of tens of thousands of research animals in the basement of the Texas Medical Center, drew massive national readership. He began having visions—he saw a place for thoughtful written analysis of the weather online. His discussions could be more timely and interactive than the forecasts printed in the paper itself. And unlike TV meteorologists, he needn’t worry about ratings or being available to viewers only at certain designated times. In June 2005, he started his own blog on the Chronicle ’s site. He didn’t yet have any meteorological training; he was just someone who liked talking about the weather. (His colleagues called him “Weather Boy.” It was not a compliment.) Three months later came Katrina. Then came Rita. And three years later, Hurricane Ike. Berger’s life could seem governed by storms; even his first meeting with Amanda, whom he married in 2002, came only a few weeks after Allison’s transformative rains. He convinced the newspaper to put him through a distance learning program at Mississippi State to earn his certification as a professional meteorologist. Modern technology and information dissemination have led to a democratization of weather forecasting, and that could mean compounding disaster in the wrong hands. Berger wanted to make sure his hands were the right ones. When he left the Chronicle to join Ars Technica in October of 2015, he started Space City Weather. The day after he opened up shop, the remnants of Hurricane Patricia began clouding the skies of Houston. He was supposed to go out for dinner with Amanda. He worried his readers would feel he’d abandoned them in a time of need, and he couldn’t help writing a post. His first forecast on Space City Weather was for a flood. Now in August 2017, the rains on Harvey’s opening night shocked even him. They were biblical. Rain falling at a rate of 2 inches an hour would force most drivers to pull over. Harvey would sometimes drop 5. It didn’t look like water; it looked like milk. Worse, Berger studied the models and the satellite imagery, and if he knew anything in that moment, listening to the rain against his window, he knew that there was so much more to come. On Saturday, August 26, an hour after sunset, the evening’s first band of precipitation, which on radar resembled the longest tentacles of an angry squid, opened up over Houston, slowly crossing the city from west to east. As predicted by the European model, it stalled. Additional bands trailing behind it intensified and merged with the first. This created what meteorologists properly call a seething nexus of hate, Berger later wrote. The now-combined band extended more than 400 miles over Galveston and deep into the too-warm waters of the Gulf, creating a superhighway for rain to be delivered directly to Houston. By very early Sunday morning, Harvey’s enormous size began to tell, and another band prepared to make its assault on the already flooded southern suburbs. The Houston branch of the NWS had issued its special emergency bulletin, and in the adjacent Office of Emergency Management, the walls were being papered with calls for water rescues. People were drowning in the rain. A sleepless Berger sat down at his desk and began writing a new post. Amanda and their daughters had been at her sister’s house for several hours, and she texted him to ask if he thought the latest band would be the end of it. He inserted the scene into his piece, which went up at 2:10 am on Sunday morning. I wanted nothing more than to fall in her arms and tell her yes, this was it. By God, yes. Let’s go to bed and forget this ever happened. It had to be it, surely. It would not be it. Harvey would make true Berger’s most pessimistic projections and refuse to leave. He would tell his readers that the rain would continue, especially at night. He would later hear that administrators at the Houston Methodist Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine were among those looking to him for guidance. He would harbor a guilt for delivering bad news for so many. At 12:03 pm on Sunday, Berger finished writing a post that he titled: “Houston, We Will Get Through This.” With the prospect of more rain, you may feel hopeless or helpless, or both. From a mental health standpoint, the uncertainty this brings adds a considerable amount of stress to an already stressful situation. I wish we could tell you when the rains will end, but we can’t. Here’s one thing we are sure of, however. The rains will end. After that the sun will come out. More than a million people would visit Space City Weather on Sunday alone. Hurricane Harvey already had a name. Now it had its face. Harvey’s unrelenting rain left so much underwater—like these orchards in Pecan Grove. On Tuesday evening, more than four days after the rain first started to fall, Berger would finally write: It’s over. He had been nearly perfect in his forecast. It hadn’t been all that windy, so there weren’t many roofs blown off or trees toppled, except in those few cursed places that were also visited by tornadoes. And there wasn’t much local storm surge. The water didn’t come rushing through Houston. It didn’t arrive in walls the way it did in New Orleans with Katrina, one of the reasons Harvey directly killed 68 people, many in their cars, instead of an estimated 1,833 people, many in their beds. Harvey was a cataclysmic rain event, just as Berger had feared. He could have been wrong and his readers would have moved their furniture back downstairs and grumbled about the wasted effort. But he had been right, and thousands of his readers didn’t have a downstairs anymore. A month after the storm, Berger dropped into his Hyundai hybrid and went for a drive. He wanted to see the terrible reality that had accompanied his forecasts, as though he could use the reminder that Harvey really did do what it did, to Houston and to him. By then the last part of weather analysis, the accounting of the aftermath, was nearly complete. It had rained so hard for so long that Houston’s swamps and reservoirs and drainage canals filled up, which meant that the city’s kitchens and living rooms and dens filled up next. Then the water drained away. In the time in between it made an estimated $75 billion in property irreparably wet. He headed south toward Dickinson, one of the worst-hit areas. On some streets, every house had an enormous pile of debris out front—everything that had been inside the house was now outside of it, rotting in the sun. Other streets had been picked clean, and they looked almost normal, except that through their windows, Berger could see that the otherwise pristine-­seeming houses had been stripped down to the studs. There was a photograph that had made the rounds during the storm. It was of the flood-soaked residents of a nursing home, sitting on their loungers and walkers, water up to their chests. It seemed like a macabre piece of surrealist art. On his tour, Berger decided to visit that nursing home, La Vita Bella. Nearly everything that wasn’t human in that photograph was now sitting out in the yard. The lamps, the chairs, and the popcorn machine from that haunting image melted in the piles of sodden sheetrock and carpet, relics of a viral infamy. They were joined by smaller but perhaps more significant losses: a stuffed animal, a deck of playing cards, a broken mirror, a lipstick and a rouge, a large-print copy of Marley &amp; Me. At 12:03 pm on Sunday, Berger finished writing a post titled: ""Houston, We Will Get Through This."" Berger had also lost a book in the flood. Before dawn on Sunday, lightning had lit up the sky, and he could see that water had reached his garages. He had mostly emptied one but not the other—not the one that contained his old things, his diplomas and his Appetite for Destruction poster and his boxes of books. He raced down and lifted up a box from the floor and its bottom fell out. A book titled From Dawn to Decadence by Jacques Barzun dropped into the water and disappeared. Berger had treasured that book, a massive 500-year history of Western civilization. Its French-born author had died in Texas in 2012. Barzun was 104 years old, and the book had been his life’s work. Something about losing that particular book hit Berger harder than it might have. It was a metaphor for how easily even our monuments can be erased. He had written about the loss of that book and other things in a post that went up on Ars Technica early in the morning on August 30, the Wednesday after the storm. The post was titled “This Is Probably the Worst US Flood Storm Ever, and I’ll Never Be the Same.” The cardboard box had failed, he wrote, and the book had dropped into the murk. Almost immediately, a current from the rushing water beyond the garage door pulled the tome away, forever. Damn, I loved that book. An indescribably bad night had just gotten that little bit worse. Berger started receiving emails and notes from his grateful readers. They had saved some of their own treasures because of his warnings, and they felt they had a debt to settle. A copy of From Dawn to Decadence was eventually put into his hands by a stranger, a woman who had attended a talk he had overcome his nerves to give after the storm. That book now sits high and dry on a shelf in his office, a tiny reminder of the things that Harvey had taken, but also a reminder of the things it had delivered. The National Weather Service is part of a necessary and effective meteorological bureaucracy. It is staffed by thousands of people—by good and competent forecasters who care deeply about the weather and its effects on their communities. The NWS can offer its best daily guess, informed by their forecasters’ computer models and professional experiences. It can give warnings and sound alarms. But the NWS can’t talk about the weather the way human beings talk about the weather. It can’t explore each of its uncertainties, almost reveling in the sweeping possibilities of hurricanes and their animal behaviors. It can’t riff. More important, when the weather is at its worst: The National Weather Service can’t comfort. Even though Dan Reilly and his colleagues live and work in greater Houston, even though they were plenty concerned during Harvey for their own families and homes, they can’t issue a bulletin that says, We’re sick and tired of the rain, just like everyone else. They can’t write: The rains will end. After that the sun will come out. Only someone like Eric Berger can do that, providing a weather forecast that includes words like hope or sorry or maybe. Only someone like Eric Berger can employ our best technology in a way that still feels intimate and human-scale, applying the wisdom of satellites to Deb Walters and her doomed party. Only someone like Eric Berger, looking out his window at the rain and willing for it to stop even though he knows that it won’t be stopping anytime soon, can speak to a family watching the water on its torturous rise to their door, the winds threatening the entirety of their lives, and make them feel a little less alone in the storm. Update: After this article went to press, we heard from Deb Walters, one of the many people who sought Berger’s advice just before Hurricane Harvey. Thanks to Berger’s forecasts, Walters decided to cancel a house party she hosts every year for some members of Alcoholics Anonymous and ex-cons. It turned out to be a good call. Although Walters’ house was spared, the surrounding streets flooded, which would have stranded the guests there for three days. “These folks are hysterical,” she said (as in funny and lovable), “but the type of people you invite to a party aren’t necessarily the type of people you want to spend three days with.” She finally hosted the shindig three weeks later, for a smaller crowd. —The Editors Chris Jones is a longtime magazine writer.

Associated Press,"(LYNCHBURG, Va.) — Heavy rains have prompted authorities to evacuate parts of a central Virginia city in case a dam fails and floods the area. A failure of the College Lake Dam near Lynchburg could flood the city with 17 feet (5 meters) of water in seven minutes, news outlets reported Thursday evening, citing statements from the National Weather Service. The service said county officials reported the dam’s “imminent failure” at around 9:30 p.m. The Lynchburg Water Resources Department says up to six inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Thursday, causing College Lake to fill beyond its capacity. It said that up to 18 inches of water from the lake overflowed onto a road and into a nearby creek. Lynchburg has a population of about 80,000. The Lynchburg Department of Emergency Services said areas near the dam were being evacuated Thursday night. It is unclear how many people were being evacuated. Several roads already were flooded or closed at that time, with local fire and police departments sending out boats and squads to rescue people. The NWS issued a flash flood watch for the area that lasts until early Friday.",The dam's failure could flood the city with 17 feet of water in seven minutes,2018-08-03T03:33:27Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",A Virginia City Is Being Partially Evacuated as Heavy Rains Could Cause Dam Failure,http://time.com/5357050/lynchburg-virginia-college-lake-dam/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/time-logo.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,flash-flood,1
Andrew Liszewski,"Before the Super Nintendo, and even before the original NES arrived in North America, I cut my gaming teeth on the Commodore 64. It was sold as one of the first personal computers, but to many kids of the ‘80s, it was instead their first gaming console. I have many fond memories of the C64, but thanks to the C64 Mini, I’m also reminded that pre-NES gaming was kind of terrible. C64 Mini WHAT IS IT? A tiny replica of the Commodore 64 bundled with a collection of retro games. LIKE Without having to hack the hardware, you can load your own ROMs. DISLIKE The included joystick is the stuff of gaming nightmares. Aging gamers have been emulating their favorite titles for years, but Nintendo’s NES Classic Edition made retro gaming accessible for those who didn’t want to dance around the legalities of downloading ROMs. It also opened the flood gates for miniaturized, game-packed clones of other retro hardware, including the Commodore 64 that the UK’s Retro Games Ltd. has turned into the C64 Mini. Like the NES Classic Edition, the SNES Classic Edition the tiny C64 Mini is easy to squeeze into your entertainment center—which is good because it’s starting to really get crowded in there. Roughly the size of a VHS cassette tape ( go look it up ), the C64 Mini includes a joystick controller, an HDMI cable, and a USB power cable—but no power adapter. Presumably you’re supposed to plug the console into one of your TV’s powered USB ports, but mine doesn’t have one of those, which required me to repurpose an old phone charger. Is a tiny USB wall wart really that expensive to include? I was disappointed to discover that the C64 Mini’s keyboard is completely fake, because I desperately wanted to mash those adorably tiny keys when I first took it out of the box. The keyboard’s also missing all of those weird symbols that represented the Commodore 64's alternate character sets, but otherwise the C64 Mini is a lovely recreation of the first real gadget I ever used, and even if I never play it again, the tiny console is a welcome addition to my entertainment center for looks alone. It also features some modern upgrades. Gone is the original Commodore 64's cartridge slot on the back, it’s been replaced with a microUSB port for power, and a standard-sized HDMI port. Long-extinct peripheral ports on the side have also been replaced with a pair of standard USB ports on the C64 Mini. They can be used to attach flash drives, USB keyboards, and the C64 Mini’s included joystick. 1 / 2 Speaking of which, if there’s one feature that’s really a let down, it’s the included joystick. To the best of my memory, it functions almost exactly like the early controllers I used with my original Commodore 64, which is to say it’s not great. The stick itself has a lot of wobble and feels loosely connected to the base, but still requires you to push hard to register movements—and occasionally it will simply refuse to recognize those movements at all. The controller’s (many) buttons definitely work better than the joystick does, but they don’t feel great, and they’re laid out in an uncomfortable configuration. The C64 Mini’s menu makes it clear which ones you need to push to quickly navigate the UI, but once you load a game, it’s up to you to figure out which button does what. I know I’ve been spoiled by 36 years of video game controller refinement, but Commodore 64 games are already notoriously difficult, and including a better controller option with the C64 Mini, instead of striving for authenticity, would have yielded a more satisfying experience. I do the C64 Mini’s menu system. It’s a pleasantly retro experience where you navigate through the pre-loaded games using a carousel of boxart on the bottom, with descriptions and screenshots accompanying your current selection. It is also nice to see memorable titles like Impossible Mission and California Games included, but a good three-quarters of the bundled games I have never even heard of. The selection definitely isn’t as impressive as what you get with Nintendo’s tiny consoles. 1 / 2 What isn’t included are instruction manuals for each game. Back in the day I remember giving a friend a box of blank disks, which he returned filled with random Commodore 64 games, but no instructions. Half my time playing was spent figuring out how each game worked, and Retro Games Ltd. has managed to perfectly recreate that frustration. The experience is slightly improved here, however, as the C64 Mini offers up to four save states for each game, so you don’t need to start from scratch every time you hit the wrong button and die. One notable software inclusion is the original Commodore 64 version of Basic. It’s fully functional, but you’ll want to attach a USB keyboard to the C64 Mini to do any serious coding, thanks to the bizarre layout of the on-screen keyboard, and the frustrating joystick that makes it a nightmare to navigate. The Basic app is also crucial to one of the C64 Mini’s best features: the ability to load your own ROMs. Sadly, the current process involves copying the ROM onto a FAT32-formatted flash drive (no larger than 64GB), renaming the file ‘THEC64-drive8.d64', connecting the drive to one of the C64 Mini’s USB ports, and then using proper Basic syntax to load the game. It’s the same process I used to load games from the Commodore 64's floppy drive 30+ years ago, and it’s still a pain, particularly when juggling peripherals on only two USB ports. Retro Games Ltd. promises to improve the process in a future firmware upgrade, but for now it’s almost not worth the effort. Thanks to the C64 Mini, in addition to all the fond memories I have of my old Commodore 64, I’ve managed to dig up all the not-so-fond ones as well. Frustrating controllers, complicated user interfaces, and games that left me feeling more stressed than relaxed were also all part of my C64 experience growing up. I’ve come to realize that I don’t actually want the authentic Commodore 64 experience; I still want to revisit the games of my youth, but with all the conveniences and polish of modern gaming. The C64 Mini’s authentic experience might appeal to some, but ‘authentic’ translates to frustration for me, and I’ve already got enough of that now that I’m a grownup. README $100 is a tough sell for a selection of classic games you might have never even heard of, but there are a few C64 standouts included. The ‘authentic’ included joystick is loose, unresponsive, and adds an extra layer of frustration to revisiting classic C64 games. The console comes with 64 games, but not a single manual, so half your time playing will be spent figuring out what to do. The C64 Mini itself is a lovely hardware homage to the original Commodore 64, but that tiny keyboard is sadly, completely fake. The on-screen keyboard is almost unusable, you’ll need to plug in a real keyboard if you want to do some Basic coding. You’re able to load your own game ROMs without having to hack the hardware, but it’s a little complicated, and you’ll probably want to wait for a future firmware upgrade that streamlines the process. Thanks to Firebox.com for providing a C64 Mini sample unit for review.","Before the Super Nintendo, and even before the original NES arrived in North America, I cut my gaming teeth on the Commodore 64.

"USA TODAY, John Bacon, USA TODAY","It's deja vu for the small Maryland community in Ellicott City where devastating flash flooding has struck again, just two years after raging floods decimated the town and killed two people. USA TODAY Rescue personnel examine damage on Main Street after a flash flood rushed through the historic town of Ellicott City, Maryland, on May 27, 2018. (Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo, EPA-EFE) Rescue personnel in Ellicott City, Md., were searching Monday for a man missing after rampaging waters roared like a river through the quaint, historic downtown, swallowing cars and flooding stores and homes. The town was pounded by almost eight inches of rain Sunday. When the flash flooding receded, first responders walked through the ravaged downtown area, the main street strewn with debris. ""There are no words to describe the devastation,"" Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said. Residents and shop owners were asked to stay away due to safety concerns and told to monitor social media for updates. ""We understand that you are anxious to claim your belongings and assess property damage,"" Howard County government said in a statement Monday. ""But while shoring operations continue we cannot safely allow you in the flood area.""

""Eddison Hermond is my friend and fellow comrade,"" tweeted a woman with the Twitter handle Simply Ebony. ""Praying that he is found safely."" One witness says water was coming in through the walls. Witnesses are describing the chaos in Ellicott City, Maryland, where torrential floods left downtown buildings heavily damaged and filled with mud on Sunday. (May 28) AP Ellicott City is no stranger to the destruction of flooding — two people died when a similar flash flood disaster blasted the town two years ago. Storefronts were torn off buildings and cars were swept away. But the town rebuilt. Meteorologists dismissed that carnage as a 1-in-1,000-year event. A 1-in-1,000-year rain event is a statistical way of expressing the probability of such a massive rainfall occurring in any given year in a given location, according to the National Center for Environmental Information. But Sunday the flooding was back, with stunning video showing a brown wall of water sweeping through the downtown, high as roofs on some cars. We know #EllicottCityMD residents, biz &amp; property owners want access to their properties, but be4 we can allow u to safely reclaim ur belongings &amp; assess property damage, we need to ensure the area is safe.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who declared a statewide state of emergency, walked through the streets shortly after the waters receded to assess the damage. ""Praying for the brave veteran who has been reported missing following yesterday's terrible flooding in Ellicott City,"" Hogan tweeted Tuesday. ""My heartfelt thanks to all those assisting in the search."" During the worst of the flooding, the Howard County Department of Fire and Rescue Services urged residents to evacuate early — and not drive through the fast-rising waters. But the department also reassured residents that help was on the way. ""Rescue swimmers across all 3 shifts are being recalled,"" the department tweeted. ""Swift water units from as far away as Northern Virginia are en route. If you are trapped, we are coming.""

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Officials have told evacuated residents: ""We want you home, but you can't come yet"" The coastal city of Wilmington, North Carolina has been completely cut off from the rest of the state because of deepening flood waters. Officials say all roads in and out are now impassable and have warned evacuated residents to stay away. Reports describe the city, which has a population of about 120,000, as an island within the state. About 400 people there have been rescued from flood waters, and most of the city remains without power. The National Weather Service has warned of at least two further days of possible flash flooding in the area before conditions are forecast to improve. ""Do not come here,"" New Hanover County Commission Chairman Woody White said. ""Our roads are flooded, there is no access into Wilmington...We want you home, but you can't come yet."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some businesses, including the famously resilient Waffle House chain, have remained open in the 'marooned' city Two of the first known fatalities - that of a mother and her seven-month son - were reported in the city on Friday morning. The area is usually best known as a filming location for US dramas One Tree Hill and Dawson's Creek. US basketball legend Michael Jordan - who is fundraising to help residents affected by the storm - also grew up in the city. Many roads inside Wilmington are still passable for residents who defied evacuation orders to ride the storm out. But a city-wide curfew has been extended after five people were arrested on suspicion of looting from a store in the city on Saturday. What is the latest on the storm? At least 17 people are now reported to have died in storm-related incidents in North and South Carolina since Florence made landfall as a category one hurricane on Thursday. It has now weakened into a tropical depression with winds of 35mph (55km/h), according to the National Hurricane Centre. Media caption Gusts &amp; floods: the impact of the storm Some parts of the Carolinas have seen up to 40in (100cm) of rain since Thursday - and officials have warned river levels are yet to peak in places. ""The storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now,"" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Sunday. ""Wherever you live in North Carolina, be alert for sudden flooding."" The governor also warned of the potential danger of landslides once the weather system reached more mountainous areas. The US coast guard and volunteer boats have been helping people left stricken by rising flood waters across the states. Officials in North Carolina have said about 900 people have been rescued from floodwaters there, and about 15,000 people still in emergency shelters. US President Donald Trump has declared a disaster in several North Carolina counties - a move that frees up federal funding for recovery efforts. He has praised federal and local law enforcement response to the storm on Twitter several times and the White House has indicated he may visit the affected area in coming days. Power companies are working to restore power to the almost 650,000 homes and businesses that are still without electricity. The centre of the storm is still over North Carolina but is expected to accelerate north on Sunday night local time before turning to head toward New England on Tuesday. What do we know of the victims? Eleven deaths were reported in North Carolina, and at least six have been reported in South Carolina. A mother and her seven-month child who died when a tree fell on their house in Wilmington were the first known deaths reported. Among the other fatalities were two men in their 70s who died in Lenoir County - one had been connecting extension cords and another was blown by high winds when checking on his dogs. Four road deaths in South Carolina have been blamed on the storm, and two people died from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a generator inside their home. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged. Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h Houses suffer damage, severe flooding Storm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h Some roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.

Omar Akour / AP,"(DEAD SEA) — Flash floods unleashed by heavy rains swept away middle school students and teachers visiting hot springs near the Dead Sea on Thursday, killing 18 and injuring 35 as the torrent carried some for several kilometers, a civil defense official said. Thirteen people escaped without injuries, said Brig. Gen. Farid al-Sharaa, speaking after nightfall as large spotlights illuminated the flooded area. Some survived by clinging to rocks, he said. A dramatic rescue operation involving helicopters and divers continued into the night. Israel’s military said it dispatched a search and rescue team at the request of Jordan’s government. Al-Sharaa said 37 middle school students, seven teachers and other visitors were at the hot springs near the Dead Sea on Thursday afternoon, some eating lunch, when they were taken by surprise by the flooding. “It swept away the students for 4 to 5 kilometers,” some as far as the Dead Sea, he said. The spokesman said the students were from a middle school. The low-lying Dead Sea area, part of the Jordan Valley, is prone to flash flooding when rain water rushes down from adjacent hills. In April, 10 Israeli students were killed when they were surprised by a flash flood during a hiking trip near the Dead Sea. Prime Minister Omar Razzaz rushed to the scene and later visited the wounded in a hospital. As the death toll continued to rise, Jordan’s King Abdullah II announced that he canceled a visit to Bahrain, which had been scheduled for Friday.","Flash floods unleashed by heavy rains swept away middle school students and teachers visiting the Dead Sea, killing 18 and injuring 35",2018-10-26T02:25:32Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Flash Floods Near the Dead Sea Swept Away a School Group Visiting Hot Springs, Killing 18",http://time.com/5435603/dead-sea-flash-flood-students-killed/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/ap18298839560044.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,flash-flood,1

Gina Martinez,"A series of photos of a rising North Carolina river over three days shows the historic scale of the flooding in parts of North Carolina – even as the storm formerly known as Hurricane Florence moves slowly out of the Carolinas. The Cape Fear River in Fayetteville was at 60.1 feet and still rising as of noon Tuesday. It’s projected to crest at 61.6 feet, which is far from the 1945 record of 68.9 feet, but higher than the 58.9 feet it reached after Hurricane Matthew, according to the National Weather Service. The Cape Fear River expected to spread to a width of up to 2 miles, with several thousand homes and business threatened. As the city of Fayetteville begins to flood, up to 150 homes will be threatened, according to the National Weather Service. The flood waters aren’t expected to recede to normal levels until late Friday – one week after the hurricane made landfall. The Cape Fear River is just one of several major rivers that are spilling over their banks after Hurricane Florence brought massive storm surge and record rainfall to North and South Carolina. More than 25 inches of rain fell on inland parts of North and South Carolina – deluging streams and rivers with vast amounts of water. Lumber River in Lumberton is also at a Major Flood Stage with 21.9 feet of water, breaking the previous record of 21.8 feet, the National Weather Service said. The floodwaters are inching closer to the local Pepsi plant and dozens of homes will be isolated and inundated. Several roads will be closed near the river. Flooding is expected to continue there for the next few days. As of Tuesday, the death toll from Florence was at 32 and rising, with 24 of those deaths taking place in North Carolina, according to the Associated Press. The National Hurricane Center downgraded Florence to a tropical depression, but warned that catastrophic flash fooding, river flooding and landslides are still expected in western North Carolina and southwestern Virginia. On Sunday, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper warned residents at a press conference to steer clear of flooded areas in the upcoming days. “Never drive through flooded roads. Just a few inches of water can wash your car away,” Cooper said. Last week Mike Doll, Senior Meteorologist at Accuweather, warned that residents near the Cape Fear River and other low-lying areas next to streams, creeks and rivers, should prepare for river flooding. “Once the last drops of rain [have] occurred doesn’t mean problems are over,” he said. “People that live in flood-prone areas near creeks and rivers need to be prepared. Even after the rain has ended, residents should still pay attention.”",A series of photos of a rising North Carolina river over three days shows the historic scale of the flooding in parts of North Carolina – even as the storm formerly known as Hurricane Florence moves slowly out of the Carolinas.

"USA TODAY, Trevor Hughes and Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","The National Weather Service forecasts that a slow moving storm will drop heavy rain and possibly cause flash floods along the Texas coastline. Some cars were stuck on flooded roads in Corpus Christi on Tuesday night. (June 20) AP Residents of a McAllen, Texas, neighborhood walk down a flooded street that trapped an ambulance during a second day of heavy rains and street flooding, on June 21, 2018. (Photo: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY) McALLEN, Texas — Days of torrential rain have led to widespread flooding in southeastern Texas, the state's worst floods since Hurricane Harvey last year. Since Tuesday, 5 to 10 inches of rain has fallen along the Texas coast from the border to around 125 miles south of Houston, with over 15 inches in some areas, the National Weather Service said. ""The latest Texas rainfall totals are astounding,"" said Weather Channel meteorologist Greg Diamond. In McAllen, Texas, intense rainstorms caused widespread flooding for a second day, stranding vehicles in intersections and low-lying parking lots. The small city near the border with Mexico has been in the spotlight this week amid global outrage over the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy for criminally charging immigrants who try to enter the U.S. illegally. The U.S. Border Patrol’s McAllen Station is the busiest for apprehending and detaining immigrants suspected of entering the country illegally, and protests have erupted around the area in recent days. At the Doubletree Hotel near McAllen's airport – one of the tallest buildings in the area – several apparent lightning strikes disabled elevators and set off fire alarms while water leaked through the atrium nine stories above. City officials urged drivers to stay off the roads, while young men in big pickups gleefully gunned their way through puddles and flooded intersections. In coffee shops and restaurants, a chorus of cell phones sounded each time the weather service issued a new flash flood warning. We’re under a flash flood reality here in #McAllen, Texas. Tough driving around the city, including for this stranded ambulance. pic.twitter.com/XWOy5VeN66 — Trevor Hughes (@TrevorHughes) June 21, 2018 Rain also sparked flooding this week in the Beaumont-Port Arthur area. Chris Jenkins’ home in Orange County flooded with about 6 inches of water. He and his family had moved back into the home in March after it flooded during Harvey. “Just coming and seeing everything floating on the floor, nothing can prepare you for it,” Jenkins told KHOU. The rainfall was fueled by an upper-level low-pressure system parked over Texas, the Weather Channel said. The low is interacting with widespread tropical moisture, leading to the numerous showers and thunderstorms. The weather service said the slow-moving storm is expected to finally move away Thursday. Downpours are likely to become much more spotty in nature over southeastern Texas to end the week, AccuWeather said. Deadly floods near Pittsburgh, extreme heat in West A separate weather system brought rounds of heavy showers and thunderstorms around Pittsburgh Wednesday evening, prompting destructive flash flooding. At least one person was killed. Video posted on social media showed cars floating down flooded streets, while swift-water rescue teams in Allegheny County took part in at least 66 rescues. The biggest flood threat in the next few days will be in the Ohio Valley and the Deep South. Meanwhile, excessive heat warnings have been posted in the Southwest. High temperatures will reach the 110 to 120 degree range in some areas, the weather service said. The usual hot spot should be Death Valley, California, with readings in the 120 to 125 degree range.

Numerous to widespread thunderstorms are expected in the same regions through Saturday. Rain will be widespread across the East Coast on Wednesday afternoon. Rainfall totals by the end of this week could exceed 4 inches across parts of northern Georgia, western North and South Carolina. Widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches are possible from Florida to Vermont. This wet pattern for the first few days of August comes after a record-breaking July across the east. Baltimore; Cape Hatteras, North Carolina; Elmira, New York; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania; State College, Pennsylvania; Washington, D.C.; and Williamsport, Pennsylvania, all saw their wettest July on record. Rainfall rates will be very heavy in the Southeast. Still hot and dry in West There are over 63 uncontained large wildfires burning in 14 states across the western U.S. from Texas to Alaska. Since July is now over, several observing locations in Southern California recorded their warmest July on record, including Palmdale and Long Beach. Burbank and Los Angeles Airport recorded their second warmest July on record. Fresno recorded its 26th day of temperatures over 100 degrees, extending their ongoing record. Temperatures will be over 100 degrees in much of California. Another hot day is ahead for much of the West with triple-digit temperatures likely for much of interior California and into parts of eastern Oregon and Washington. For parts of California, including Redding, it is seasonable to have temperatures near 100 degrees in early July. New fire weather alerts have been posted for parts of the Northwest. A frontal system approaching from the west will kick winds up. The gusty winds and combined hot and dry conditions could ignite new fires and worsen existing ones.",The area will see heavy rain over the next few days.,2018-08-01T11:09:18Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}","Much of East Coast under flood watch as wet, stormy pattern threatens region",https://abcnews.go.com/US/east-coast-flood-watch-wet-stormy-pattern-threatens/story?id=56959634,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/rain-rainbow-ap-mo-20180801_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,flash-flood,1
Megan Borowski,"Overcast skies and strong showers are expected across the Northeast this weekend. Winds will be off of the Atlantic Ocean, allowing for the formation of scattered thunderstorms. Heavy downpours with flash flooding are possible, with flash flood watches already issued for parts of Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. A flash flood watch is in effect for parts of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Massachusetts, while Connecticut and Rhode Island is entirely under a watch. Rainfall accumulations of up to 3 inches are forecast for Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York. Parts of New York state, north of the city, and Connecticut, in the New Haven area, could see up to 6 inches through Sunday night. Rainfall totals in the Northeast could be over 2 inches across much of the region this weekend. Strong storms over Texas, Arizona Strong thunderstorms with heavy downpours were reported across much of Texas on Friday. Over 4 inches of rain fell in about eight hours in Emhouse, Texas, just northeast of Waco. A low over northern Mexico and a high over the Gulf of Mexico have been and will continue to work in tandem and steer humid air over Texas. Scattered thunderstorms are likely for much of central Texas through Sunday evening. Some areas, like Del Rio and Waco, could see over 6 inches of rain the next two days. Flash flooding is likely in these areas, especially in locations that experienced soaking rains Friday. Rainfall will be especially high in central and western Texas through Sunday. Another round of monsoon storms hit Arizona overnight Friday. Phoenix was under dust storm, severe thunderstorm and flash flood warnings, and more than 13,000 were without power at one point Friday evening. Rain totals exceeded an inch in some locations; Phoenix set a daily record with 0.56 inches on Friday. Heat in the Northwest Relief from neither the record-high temperatures nor fire danger are expected in the West and Northwest on Saturday as winds continue to flow from the south, bringing hot and dry air into the region. Winds in this area will gust up to 35 mph, leading to a dangerous and rapid spread of wildfire. Red flag warnings extend from California to Montana. High temperature records were smashed in the west on Friday, including in Boise, Idaho (110 degrees); Havre, Montana (105); and Glasgow, Montana (107). Red flag warnings are in effect across Northern California, as well as parts of Washington, Idaho ad Montana. Temperatures this weekend will reach into the 100s in the Northwest.

Felicia Fonseca and Alina Hartounian / AP,"(FLAGSTAFF, Ariz.) — Torrents of water rushed Thursday through an Arizona canyon famous for its towering blue-green waterfalls, sending tourists scrambling to benches, trees and caves as they sought higher ground. Rescue workers evacuated most of the 200 tourists after two rounds of flooding hit the Havasupai reservation, deep in a gorge off the Grand Canyon. All the tourists were accounted for and no one was seriously injured when heavy rain began falling Wednesday evening and before dawn Thursday, swelling a shallow creek that runs through a reservation campground, said tribal spokeswoman Abbie Fink. Tourist Benji Xie said people were swimming at the base of waterfalls when the flash flooding struck. He and his friends ran up to a bathroom with other campers to wait out the rain. “The sky opened up. Winds started blowing, sand was blowing everywhere and rain was coming down in sheets,” he told The Associated Press on Thursday. Water sloshed up around people’s tents, and Xie said he his friends warned other campers to flee. Some were stranded on islands that formed in the water, while others climbed trees, stood on benches or took shelter in caves, he said. The tribe used ATVs, rope and manpower to get dozens of tourists from the campground below the village of Supai to a school, where they spent the night Wednesday and were given food and supplies. A single helicopter flew about five tourists at a time out of the village to a parking lot at the head of an eight-mile trail to Supai, Fink said. Several were still waiting their turn early Thursday evening, she said. Officials will start assessing the damage Friday to determine when it’s safe for tourists to return. Fink said the reservation will be closed to visitors for at least a week. Posts on social media showed muddy water roaring through the canyon that is prone to flooding. During monsoon season, rain can fall heavy and fast. Flood waters often rush unexpectedly through normally dry canyons and washes, sometimes with tragic consequences. Ten members of an Arizona family were killed last July when a torrent of rain water rushed through a swimming hole in a canyon northeast of Phoenix. In another incident, seven people died at Utah’s Zion National Park in September 2015 when they were trapped in a flash flood while hiking at a popular slot canyon. On Thursday, rather than panicking, Xie said most of the campers were in a state of disbelief about what had happened. Still, he said he would not hesitate to return to the pristine waterfalls. Tourism is the lifeblood of the tribe’s economy, with many residents making a living by working in the area’s lodge, cafe and small store, or packing camping gear onto the backs of mules headed up and down an eight-mile trail. Spots in the campground sell out quickly every year. The canyon is accessible only by foot, helicopter or mule ride, making it crucial to have as much of a heads-up as possible when floods are approaching so people can seek higher ground. Brian Klimowski of the National Weather Service in Flagstaff said the agency contacted the tribe around 6:30 p.m. Wednesday with a flood advisory for the area. The hard rain hit about 45 minutes later and a stream gauge noted a four-foot rise in Havasu Creek, he said. Another gauge downstream of the Colorado River showed an eight-foot rise in water levels, he said. The creek rose again at 2 a.m. Thursday. In both cases, water receded within two hours, he said. “That’s a steep-walled canyon with a relatively flat bottom on it,” he said. “When the water rises, it can engulf a significant part of the canyon area, and that’s what happened down in the campground.”",Rescue workers evacuated most of the 200 tourists,2018-07-13T01:36:04Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Flash Flooding in the Grand Canyon Sends Tourists Scrambling for Higher Ground,http://time.com/5337810/grand-canyon-flash-floods-tourists/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/800-4.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,flash-flood,1

Anna Driver,"HOLDEN BEACH, N.C. (Reuters) - Mass evacuations were ordered along the U.S. Atlantic Coast as Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 storm and the most powerful to menace the region in nearly three decades, barreled toward the region on Tuesday. Governor Ralph Northam issued an evacuation order for about 245,000 residents in flood-prone coastal Virginia beginning at 8 a.m. local time while South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster has ordered more than 1 million residents along his state’s coastline to leave starting at noon on Tuesday. “This is a serious storm and it’s going to effect the entire state,” Northam told a news conference. “Everyone in Virginia needs to prepare.” Florence, packing winds of 140 miles per hour (220 kph), was expected to grow even stronger before making landfall on Thursday, mostly likely in southeastern North Carolina near the South Carolina border, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference his state was in “the bull’s eye.” At least 250,000 more people were due to be evacuated from the northern Outer Banks in North Carolina on Tuesday after more than 50,000 people were ordered on Monday to leave Hatteras and Ocracoke, the southernmost of the state’s barrier islands. North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland governors have declared states of emergency. Authorities warned of life-threatening coastal storm surges and the potential for Florence to unleash prolonged torrential rains and widespread flooding, especially if it lingers inland for several days. NHC Director Ken Graham warned of “staggering” amounts of rainfall that may extend hundreds of miles inland and cause flash flooding across the mid-Atlantic region. Forecasts expect 10 to 15 inches (25-38 cm) of rain in the hardest-hit areas, possibly more if the storm stalls over land, as expected, Graham said. Mindful of devastation wrought by a string of deadly U.S. hurricanes last year, residents in the Carolinas began the rituals of disaster preparation - boarding up windows and stocking up on groceries, water and gasoline. [nL3N1VX1NZ] Classified as a Category 4 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane strength, Florence was the most severe storm to threaten the U.S. mainland this year and the first of its magnitude to target the Carolinas since 1989, when Hurricane Hugo barreled over Charleston, South Carolina. In Holden Beach, North Carolina, in the storm’s path, longtime residents were busy securing their homes and possessions. “It’s scary to all of us. We know we can’t play around with this,” said Jennifer Oosterwyk, who owns the Sugar Britches boutique on Holden Beach and lives in nearby Wilmington.

Eli Meixler,"Flooding from Hurricane Florence, which battered the Carolinas this month, is so severe that NASA was able to spot darkened, contaminated rivers flowing into the Atlantic Ocean. Nearly 8 trillion gallons of rain fell on North Carolina during the storm, according to the National Weather Service in Raleigh. That deluge took a devastating toll, swelling rivers and inundating homes. NASA satellite images released this week reveal just how engorged, and polluted the rivers and other waterways became. One image, captured on Sept. 19, indicates that “soils, sediments, decaying leaves, pollution, and other debris have discolored the water in the swollen rivers, bays, estuaries, and the nearshore ocean,” according to NASA. The discoloration is visible as navy blue and black tributaries spilling from the coast in unsettling plumes. A second image from NASA’s Landsat 8 combines visible and infrared imagining to trace the amount “ colored dissolved organic matter ” (CDOM). CDOM, which includes detritus like leaves, roots and bark, appeared in “high” concentrations even in the ocean around North Carolina’s Cape Lookout. NASA also released an image of the Trent River, which swelled to an all-time high of 29 feet on Sept. 17, according to the National Weather Service. The river more than doubled “flood stage,” or the height at which a river overflows its banks and causes damage nearby. Hurricane Florence crashed into the Carolinas on Sept. 14, shattering rainfall records and causing “catastrophic flash flooding” that claimed dozens of lives. By Sept. 18, sixteen rivers had breached their “flood stage”, according to the North Carolina Department of Public Safety. Rivers swollen by Florence also poured into industrial facilities like coal ash dumps and hog farm manure pits in North Carolina, raising environmental concerns that the floodwaters could spread pollution across the state. This week, lawmakers began considering a $1.7 billion relief package to fund recovery efforts after the storm.","Flooding from Hurricane Florence was so severe that NASA could see darkened, contaminated rivers flowing into the Atlantic Ocean",2018-09-26T08:16:34Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",NASA Captures Polluted Carolina Rivers Spilling Into the Ocean After Hurricane Florence,http://time.com/5406624/nasa-carolina-river-pollution-hurricane-florence/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/rts21drj.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,flash-flood,1
,"At a Glance Tropical Storm Gordon has developed near South Florida. Soaking rainfall and gusty winds from Gordon are currently spreading across southern Florida. Tropical storm warnings are posted for south Florida and the northern Gulf Coast. Heavy rain, storm surge flooding and strong winds are likely impacts from Gordon on the Gulf Coast. A storm surge watch is in effect for a part of the northern Gulf Coast Tropical Storm Gordon has developed near southern Florida where it will continue to bring heavy rain and gusty winds on Monday before heading for a northern Gulf Coast landfall on Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) has issued tropical storm warnings for south Florida, from Golden Beach on the southeast coast to Bonita Beach on the southwest coast as well as the Keys from Craig Key to Ocean Reef. Tropical storm warnings are also posted from the Alabama-Florida border westward to east of Morgan City, Louisiana, including Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas. A tropical storm warning is typically issued when tropical-storm-force winds (39-plus mph) are expected in 36 hours or less. (A tropical storm watch means tropical storm conditions are possible within 48 hours. A warning means those conditions are expected within 36 hours.) ( MORE : Hurricane Central ) Current Status and Forecast Gordon is currently centered near Key Largo, Florida, and is producing numerous showers and thunderstorms in southern Florida. (The highest cloud tops, corresponding to the most vigorous convection, are shown in the brightest red colors. Clustering, deep convection around the center is a sign of a healthy tropical cyclone.) Localized flooding is possible and the National Weather Service has issued a flood watch for south Florida into Monday night. In addition, tropical-storm-force winds (39 mph or greater) are possible in the tropical storm warning area in southern Florida on Monday. A wind gust to 51 mph was reported at Miami's Opa-Locka airport on Monday morning. An isolated tornado threat cannot be ruled out in southern Florida, as well. Current Radar, Watches and Warnings (Watches and warnings are issued by the National Weather Service.) Conditions should begin to improve Monday night in south Florida. Steered by high pressure aloft parked over the eastern United States, Gordon will move through the eastern Gulf of Mexico Monday night through Tuesday. Gordon is forecast to be at tropical storm strength when it makes landfall on the northern Gulf Coast Tuesday night, most likely in southeast Louisiana or southern Mississippi. (The red-shaded area denotes the forecast path of the center of Gordon. Note that impacts (particularly heavy rain, high surf, coastal flooding) from Gordon may spread beyond its forecast path.) Regardless of how well organized Gordon becomes, there will still be impacts on the northern Gulf Coast. Northern Gulf Coast Impacts Here's a look at the current forecast impacts for Gordon but keep in mind changes are possible based on future adjustments to track and intensity. Rainfall Parts of the northern Gulf Coast could see 3 to 6 inches rainfall Tuesday-Wednesday, from southeast Louisiana into far southern Mississippi and far southern Alabama. Localized totals of 6 inches or more are possible in some areas. As a result, there could be flooding in this region, including the New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama, metro areas. A flash flood watch has been posted by the National Weather Service for parts of southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi. Separate flash flood watches are in effect in southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana due to heavy rain from another weather system affecting that region on Monday. (This should be interpreted as a broad outlook of where the heaviest rain may fall. Higher amounts may occur where bands or clusters of thunderstorms stall for over a period of a few hours.) Storm Surge, Rip Currents and High Surf A storm surge watch has been issued from the Mississippi-Alabama border westward to the mouth of the Mississippi River. Storm Surge Watches and Warnings The NHC said water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide: Destin, Florida, to the Mississippi-Alabama border: 1 to 2 feet Mississippi-Alabama border to the mouth of Mississippi River: 2 to 4 feet Mouth of the Mississippi River to the Louisiana-Texas border: 1 to 2 feet High tide this week on the Louisiana and Mississippi coastline is in the early morning hours. Tuesday morning through Thursday evening is the timing for potential coastal flooding in the storm surge watch area, according to the National Weather Service. The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves, according to the NHC. An onshore wind flow will continue a risk of dangerous rip currents on the northern Gulf Coast into midweek, and swimmers are encouraged to stay out of the water. Seas are expected to build to 6 to 10 feet by Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service in Mobile, Alabama. Wind Tropical-storm-force winds (39-plus mph) are possible in the tropical storm warning area in south Florida on Monday. By late Tuesday, tropical-storm-force winds could arrive on the northern Gulf Coast. Some downed trees and scattered power outages in the above-mentioned areas.

Lydia O'Connor,"Hurricane Lane dumped so much water on Hawaii this past week that it has earned a spot among the most extreme weather events on record in the U.S., according to preliminary rainfall totals the National Weather Service issued Sunday. About 51.5 inches were measured between last Wednesday and Sunday at a weather station near Hilo. Lane’s downpour is expected to be the country’s third-highest rainfall total from a tropical cyclone since records began in 1950, just behind Hurricane Harvey last summer and Hurricane Hiki nearly 70 years ago. The rainfall has been “torrential,” the NWS reported. It triggered significant flash flooding across the Big Island, which bore the brunt of the storm before Lane bombarded Oahu and Maui. Lane has passed and the NWS ended its flash flood advisories on Sunday, but Hawaii is not in the clear. Models show that another powerful weather system could pummel the state sometime in the next two weeks. It’s rare for hurricanes to hit Hawaii but scientists warn that warmer ocean temperatures linked to climate change could make such events more common. Waters just south of the archipelago are currently about 1 degree Celsius warmer than average.

ABC News,"Subtropical Storm Alberto is delivering heavy rain and gusty winds to Florida on Sunday morning with current projections showing the storm making landfall in the Panhandle as a tropical storm tomorrow. Mississippi, Alabama and Florida all preemptively declared a state of emergency on Saturday. Alberto is about 330 miles south of Apalachicola, Florida, on Sunday morning at 5 a.m. The storm is moving north-northeast at 13 mph with winds at 40 mph. Winds of 40 mph extend outward from the center of the storm up to 150 miles. The storm is producing winds and rains over southern Florida early Sunday. On Saturday evening, a wind gust of 47 mph was reported by the National Weather Service in Key West, Florida. Alberto was located about 330 miles south of Apalachicola, Florida, early Sunday morning. Tropical storm warnings and watches have been issued for parts of the Mississippi coast all the way to the western Gulf Coast of Florida. Tampa, Florida; Sarasota, Florida; and Fort Myers, Florida, are under a tropical storm warning for tropical storm conditions arriving today. Tropical storm watch and warnings are in place for Alberto along the Gulf Coast. Alberto will move further north in the Gulf Of Mexico, passing west of the peninsula of Florida. Alberto's heavy rains and and gusty winds remain predominantly on the right side of the storm, and therefore heavy rain and some gusty winds are expected across much of Florida Sunday. Additionally, some of the strong tropical thunderstorms east of the center of circulation could spawn brief tornadoes. There is a threat for a few tornadoes for much of the southern half of Florida, including Tampa, Fort Myers, Miami and West Palm Beach. The strongest tropical thunderstorms could also have rainfall rates exceeding 2 inches per hour, which could trigger flash flooding. Flash flooding and even tornadoes are possible due to the storms hitting Florida from Alberto. On Monday, Alberto is forecast to make landfall somewhere along the northern Gulf Coast -- likely somewhere along the coastal region of the Florida Panhandle or southern Alabama. Regardless of exact landfall location, additionally strong tropical downpours are expected for much of the Gulf Coast on Memorial Day, with heavy rain causing flash flooding across much of the Gulf Coast region. The track for Alberto shows it aiming for the Florida Panhandle on Monday. Alberto, or what remains of it, will move into the Tennessee Valley on Tuesday. Rainfall remains the most widespread threat from Alberto. Isolated parts of the Gulf Coast could receive up to a foot of rain. Locally over 8 inches of rain is possible in parts of the Florida Panhandle, southern Alabama and southwest Georgia. In the Florida Keys, and southern Florida, a widespread 3 to 6 inches of rain is likely, with locally up to 10 inches possible. Rainfall from Alberto will be heaviest in Florida, Alabama and Georgia. Flash flood watches have been posted for much of Florida, and along the Gulf Coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and southwest Georgia. Additionally, Alberto is pushing tropical moisture north. New flash flood watches have been issued for parts of the Carolinas, where 2 to 6 inches of rain is possible. Heat comes to central US While the Southeast deals with Alberto, Sunday will be another day of very hot temperatures throughout the central U.S. Widespread 90-degree temperatures are expected across the region. Chicago saw its first 90-degree day on Saturday -- a little more than a week ahead of average. Tomorrow the heat will slide just slightly to the east, but many spots -- including Minneapolis and Des Moines, Iowa -- will see another day of temperatures in the 90s. While the Southeast deals with Alberto, it will be hot in the central U.S. on Sunday and Monday.","Subtropical Storm Alberto is delivering heavy rain and gusty winds to Florida on Sunday morning with current projections showing the storm making landfall in the Panhandle as a tropical storm tomorrow.

The National Weather Service said the wintry precipitation and strong winds will continue to impact the Great Lakes and Northeast on Monday, bringing significant snow and freezing rain. Heavy rain is also possible in parts of the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England on Monday, along with coastal flooding. The storm will finally weaken late Monday, the weather service said. The unrelenting wild weather saw as much as two feet of snow dumped on the Upper Midwest on Sunday, leading to dangerous driving conditions and the cancellation of many flights. Farther south, powerful winds and tornadoes downed trees and power lines. At least four people have died because of the storms. At Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, where more than 13 inches of snow had fallen, 230 flights were canceled Sunday. Two runways were open, but winds were still strong and planes were being de-iced, spokesman Patrick Hogan said. On Saturday, the storm caused the cancellation of nearly 470 flights at the airport. The wintry grip on the Twin Cities continued to keep the boys of summer off the diamond, forcing the postponement of the third straight Minnesota Twins-Chicago White Sox game. The New Yankees and the Tigers were rained out Saturday in Detroit and had planned to play a doubleheader on Sunday, but those games also were postponed. The Los Angeles Angels at Kansas City Royals, Atlanta Braves at Chicago Cubs and Toronto Blue Jays at Cleveland Indians games also were rained out Sunday.

Ordal, who grew up in South Dakota, said he is used to the cold, snowy weather “but I’m certainly ready for some warmth.” Dangerous conditions continued in the Milwaukee area, where snow and freezing rain wreaked havoc on roads, caused power outages and made roofs collapse. The storm, on track to become the biggest to hit northeastern Wisconsin in April, could dump an additional 8 to 15 inches of snow on the Green Bay area, which got nearly a foot of snow on Saturday, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Two northeastern Wisconsin communities, Tigerton and Big Falls, received more than 2 feet of snow over the weekend, the National Weather Service in Green Bay reported. Parts of the state that were already blanketed were getting a second helping of snow on Sunday. The heavy snow caused part of a hotel roof to collapse over a pool at a hotel in Ashwaubenon, which is next to Green Bay. No one was hurt. In Michigan, freezing rain that began falling overnight had left roads treacherous and cut power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses by midday Sunday even as heavy snow was forecast to dump a foot or more of snow on parts of the state’s Upper Peninsula by early Monday. In North Carolina, authorities declared a local state of emergency in the city of Greensboro after an apparent tornado caused damage Sunday afternoon in several locations. Greensboro police said in a tweet that there also was one storm-related. Media reports prior to the police tweet said high winds damaged at least seven homes, destroyed a mobile classroom at an elementary school, and toppled trees and power lines.

EditorDavid,"On that day, astronomers bore witness to the titanic collision of two neutron stars, the densest things in the universe besides black holes. In the collision's wake, astronomers answered multiple major questions that have dominated their field for a generation. They solved the origin of gamma-ray bursts, mysterious jets of hardcore radiation that could potentially roast Earth. They glimpsed the forging of heavy metals, like gold and platinum. They measured the rate at which the expansion of the universe is accelerating. They caught light at the same time as gravitational waves, confirmation that waves move at the speed of light. And there was more, and there is much more yet to come from this discovery... ""Now it's a question of, do we have the right instrumentation for doing all the follow-up work?"" said Edo Berger, an astronomer at Harvard who studies explosive cosmic events. ""Do we have the right telescopes? What's going to happen when we have not just one event, but one a month, or one a week -- how do we deal with that flood...?"" The August 17 gravitational wave gave astronomers a glimpse at an entirely different universe. For most of history, they've studied stars and galaxies, which seem static and unchanging from the vantage point of human timescales... But GW170817 revealed a universe alive, pulsating with creation and destruction on human timescales... [T]he event itself unfolded in less than three human-designated weeks. This faster timescale is ""pushing the way astronomy is done,"" Berger said... In space, the Fermi space telescope glimpsed a burst of gamma radiation. Within an hour, astronomers made six independent discoveries of a bright, fast-fading flash: A new phenomenon called a kilonova... Nine days later, X-rays streamed in, and after 16 days, radio waves arrived, too. Each type of information tells astronomers something different. Richard O'Shaughnessy, an astronomer at the Rochester Institute of Technology, describes the discovery as a ""Rosetta stone for astronomy."" ""What this has done is provide one event that unites all these different threads of astronomy at once,"" he said. ""Like, all our dreams have come true, and they came true now..."" Thanks to the August 17 event, astronomers now know what to look for. Soon, they will be able to sift through an embarrassment of neutron-star mergers and other phenomena... And they are talking about how to turn their eyes to the sky, at a moment's notice, the next time the universe throws something big their way. ""It's a wonderful time, it's a terrifying time,"" O'Shaughnessy said.

Coastal regions are likely to experience some flooding, with areas near the Mississippi River potentially dealing with water up to four feet deep, according to the NWS. Some affected areas could see up to eight inches of rain, though most will experience between two and six inches of rainfall. Flash-flooding is also possible, the NWS warns. Tropical Storm Gordon comes just a few weeks after Tropical Storm Lane brought heavy rains and flash-flood warnings to Hawaii, after at one point being categorized as a Category 5 hurricane.",Winds have reached 45 miles per hour,2018-09-03T14:05:41Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Warnings Issued As Tropical Storm Gordon Hits Florida.

Reuters Editorial,"MANILA (Reuters) - Rescuers in the Philippines searched on Sunday for survivors of a storm that triggered floods and landslides and killed about 200 people, left scores missing and thousands homeless, most of whom apparently ignored warnings to move to safety. Residents are transported on a makeshift raft after a bridge was destroyed during flash floods in Salvador, Lanao del Norte in southern Philippines, December 23, 2017. REUTERS/Richel V. Umel Misery in the largely Christian Philippines was compounded by the death of at least 37 people in a shopping mall fire, officials said on Christmas Eve. The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons a year and warnings are routinely issued, but the level of destruction wreaked by tropical storm Tembin on the southern island of Mindanao from late on Friday came as a surprise. “It happened very fast, the flood waters quickly rose filling our house,” farmer Felipe Ybarsabal, 65, told Reuters by telephone, saying he and his family had to run to higher ground. “We weren’t able to save anything from the house. There was no help from anyone because it was so fast. Everything was two to three meters under water in less than an hour.” Police and disaster officials said they expected the toll of about 200 dead to rise with more fatalities likely to be discovered in remote farm communities and coastal areas, as rescuers reached them and restored communication and power links. Disaster officials said 159 people were listed as missing while about 70,000 had been forced from their homes. Soldiers and police joined emergency workers and volunteers to search for survivors and victims, clear debris and restore power and communications. Disaster officials said many villagers had ignored warnings to leave coastal areas and move away from riverbanks, and got swept away when flash floods and landslides struck. The storm was moving west on Sunday, over some outlying Philippine islands and the South China Sea toward southern Vietnam, at a speed of about 20 kph (12 mph). It intensified into a typhoon with winds of 120 kph (75 mph) as it moved out of the Philippine area of responsibility, the national meteorological agency said. FIRE KILLS 37 The United Nations was ready to help the Philippines, a spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. Last week, 46 people were killed in the central Philippines when a typhoon hit. In 2013, super typhoon Haiyan killed nearly 8,000 people and left 200,000 families homeless. The south of the Philippines has been plagued by insurgencies by communist rebels and Muslim separatists for years, as well as often bearing the brunt of tropical storms roaring in from the Pacific. The region was hit by another disaster on the weekend when fire swept through a shopping mall in the city of Davao, killing at least 37 people, most of them workers at a call center, city government officials said. The vice mayor of the southern city of Davao, Paolo Duterte, said the chance of survival for any of the 37 people missing at the NCC Mall was “zero”. The fire broke out on Saturday at a furniture shop on the mall’s third level and quickly engulfed an outsourcing business on the top floor, said a spokeswoman for the city government, Ma. Teresita Gaspan. The cause was not known but an investigation was being launched as authorities searched for the bodies of the victims. President Duterte, and his daughter, Sara Duterte, who is mayor of the city, visited the scene late on Saturday to meet anxious relatives of the missing and survivors.

Brian Stelter,"Michael Cohen's guilty plea came within minutes of the verdict in the Paul Manafort trial on Tuesday afternoon. Just before 4:30 p.m. ET, phones lit up with successive news alerts about two felons who had been in President Trump's inner circle. Cable news channels had to interrupt breaking news coverage of one for breaking news about the other. ""If someone wrote the last hour as a chapter in a piece of Trump fan fiction, it would seem too over the top,"" New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman said on Twitter. ""If this last hour was the plot of a 'West Wing' episode, you would roll your eyes and say 'Yeah, right,'"" CNN's Chris Cillizza tweeted. The Drudge Report dubbed it ""TRUMP HELL HOUR,"" citing Manafort and Cohen's guilt in bold red letters. In between filing updates to stories, journalists marveled and laughed at the news overload. CNN contributor Ana Navarro -- who's been on vacation this week -- said, ""There's still 9 days left in August!"" And they're typically some of the quietest days of the year. But not in the Trump era. There had been reporting -- accurate, it turns out -- that federal prosecutors were likely to move ahead with the Cohen case before Labor Day. There has also been speculation that Robert Mueller could complete a report about alleged obstruction of justice by Labor Day, although that remains to be seen. MSNBC host Chris Hayes quipped on Twitter : ""Really glad I took vacation last week!"" It took a few minutes to recover from the flood of news. But it quickly became clear that the Cohen guilty plea was the most important story of them all, because of the potential consequences for Trump. ""If there was a movie script about what happened today,"" CNN commentator Jen Psaki said, ""you wouldn't believe it."" Members of Paul Manafort's defense team speak with the media. Anchor Anderson Cooper responded: ""This is like one of those movie montages where several things happen all at once, and you're like, 'Oh, it's getting to the end of the movie, because this is the montage.'"" At 8 p.m. ET, The New York Times website went with a banner headline: ""COHEN PLEADS GUILTY, IMPLICATING PRESIDENT."" The Washington Post used a double-barrel headline to incorporate both guilty counts: ""Cohen, ex-Trump lawyer, pleads guilty as jury convicts Trump's former campaign chief Manafort."" CNN's homepage read, in all caps, ""COHEN PLEADS GUILTY AND IMPLICATES TRUMP."" The homepage used an unusual format that also highlighted the Manafort verdict, Trump's rally in West Virginia, the indictment of Republican congressman Duncan Hunter, and the arrest of an undocumented immigrant in the death of 20-year-old Iowa student Molly Tibbetts. Fox News' homepage, on the other hand, led with the Tibbetts case, pushing the bad news for Trump further down the page. About that Hunter case, Politico's Eric Geller observed on Twitter : ""A sitting member of Congress is indicted and it's like the fourth biggest story of the day. Oh also he was the second lawmaker to endorse Trump. The first, Rep. Chris Collins, has also been indicted. This is real life.""

A failure of the College Lake Dam could flood parts of Lynchburg with 17 feet of water in just seven minutes. USA TODAY The National Weather Service says up to 6 inches of rain fell within hours, filling College Lake near Lynchburg, Virginia beyond capacity. A failure of the College Lake Dam could flood parts of Lynchburg with 17 feet of water in just seven minutes. (Photo: AP framegrab) Officials in Lynchburg, in south-central Virginia, warned that a local dam faced ""imminent failure"" and its collapse would inundate parts of the city with 17 feet of water in just seven minutes. Most at risk were some 124 houses in the city of 80,000. Lynchburg is located in the Blue Ridge Mountains, about 50 miles from Roanoke. It is host to several institutions of higher education, including Liberty University. County officials, who reported the College Dam was near collapse late Thursday, were looking for signs of structural failure early Friday as water continued to spill over the structure. Local fire and police sent boats to rescue people to area shelters late Thursday as some creeks were already feeling the overflow from the dam. The fear of widespread flooding was triggered by a deluge in rain-soaked Virginia that brought up to three inches of rain in one hour alone to the Lynchburg area Thursday. The National Weather Service, warning of the ""dangerous situation,"" said early Friday that ""runoff from Thursday heavy rainfall will continue to cause flooding across the area.... Any additional heavy rainfall may create new flooding."" The NWS said a flash flood watch would remain in effect through Friday evening because of the possibility of additional showers and thunderstorms.

Max Golembo,"Severe storms moved through the Deep South on Thursday bringing flash flooding, damaging winds and hail -- mostly to Louisiana.
The National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency on Thursday in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where a whopping 6.42 inches of rain fell, making it the fourth-wettest April day the city has ever seen. Some areas in southern Louisiana got up to 7 inches of rain.
The same storm moves into the Northeast on Friday with rain, wind and even some mountain snow in New England. It's going to be a raw and nasty day for the Northeast.
A new storm system and energy from the west will combine in the South later Friday and into Saturday to bring more severe weather to the area.
Severe storms will bring hail, damaging winds and maybe an isolated tornado to parts of central and western Texas later Friday.
The storm system will barely move Saturday as it expands into eastern Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi.
The biggest threat Saturday will be damaging winds, large hail and a few isolated tornadoes.

https://www.facebook.com/zezimak,"Florence continues to inch across the Carolinas, spurring a widespread emergency across all of North Carolina, from the ocean east to mountain west. Floodwaters are expected to push many rivers to all-time highs and could spur life-threatening landslides as the storm’s remnants move west. The storm has been linked to several deaths, according to authorities. Follow the storm’s projected path here and read the latest forecasts here. Key updates: Death toll rises to 17 | Flash floods in Mecklenburg County 1:01 a.m.: ‘It don’t look good’ – North Carolina county orders mandatory evacuation in preparation for potential dam breach Hoke County (N.C.) officials announced on late Sunday night a mandatory evacuation for people living near McLaughlin Lake due to a concern that a dam could be breached as heavy rains continue to fall on the area. Hoke County is located about 25 miles west of Fayetteville, N.C. “It is seriously damaged and we’re just getting prepared for the worst,” Scott Locklear of Hoke County’s Office of Emergency Management told The Washington Post. “It don’t look good,” Locklear said, adding that water is already coming over the dam. According to the county’s announcement, both the Coast Guard and units from Fort Bragg are on the scene to assist with evacuations. The National Weather Service in Raleigh, N.C., also issued an update at 11:30 p.m. Sunday on the status of six rivers in North Carolina. Officials said two of these rivers, Little River and Rocky River, are in “major flood,” meaning there is “extensive inundation of structures and roads” in certain areas along the waterways.

Neuse River at: Goldsboro – Currently in Moderate Flood and rising Smithfield – Currently in Moderate Flood and nearing crest Clayton – Recently fell Below Flood Stage and falling pic.twitter.com/wRknhAgh6p — NWS Raleigh (@NWSRaleigh) September 17, 2018 — Allyson Chiu 11:59 p.m.: As heavy rains continue, multiple flash flood and tornado warnings issued The storm is expected to continue producing “widespread heavy rains over much of North Carolina and northeastern South Carolina,” the National Hurricane Center announced Sunday at 11 p.m. An additional two to five inches of rain is predicted to fall on parts of the Carolinas, the Mid-Atlantic states and southern New England. Some areas could receive as much as eight inches. The center reported that as of Sunday night, Florence had dumped a total of 40 inches of rain in southern North Carolina and 20 inches in northern South Carolina. Due to the unceasing rain, officials warn that “flash flooding and catastrophic/historic river flooding” is still a concern for “large portions of the Carolinas.” The warnings also extend to the Mid-Atlantic and New England states, and there is a risk of landslides in affected areas. Throughout Sunday evening, multiple flash flood warnings were issued for North Carolina and southwest Virginia, the National Weather Service tweeted. Many of these warnings are in place until Monday morning. Tornado warnings were also issued for several cities in North Carolina. Parts of North Carolina and South Carolina were also put on a tornado watch until 5 a.m. Monday. A couple tornadoes remain possible in the area through Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is moving north at 10 mph with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph. — Allyson Chiu 7:27 p.m.: Storm death toll rises to 17 Officials in Gaston County, N.C., said a 3-month-old was killed Sunday when a tree fell through the family’s single-wide mobile home. The infant and the mother were taken to a hospital, where the baby died, said Maj. Jamie McConnell with Gaston County EMS. At least 11 people have died as a result of the storm in North Carolina, and six in South Carolina. — Katie Zezima 6:42 p.m.: At least 16 people have died in the storm At least 16 deaths are now attributed to the storm. A woman in Lexington County, S.C., lost control of her car, hit a tree and was ejected from the vehicle, according to the South Carolina Emergency Management Division. At least six people have now died in South Carolina. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said at least 10 people have died in that state. — Katie Zezima 6:10 p.m.: ‘Looks like we’ve got a new lake in Charlotte’ The National Weather Service declared a rare flash flood emergency for parts of Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, because streams and creeks were running unusually high, in some locations reaching record levels. Tim Habershaw and his roommate, Zachary Finley, walked in their Carolina Panthers jerseys down Central Avenue in Charlote to view swollen Briar Creek, a normally placid brook that had turned into a torrent. “I drove by earlier on my way home from work, and I was like, ‘Whoa, looks like we’ve got a new lake in Charlotte,’ ” said Habershaw, 51, a restaurant server who lives two miles away with Finley, 25, a line cook. “I went home and took a nap, and when I woke up, I told [Finley], ‘We’ve got to go see this.’ ” About 3,000 miles’ worth of creeks, the vast majority little more than unnamed trickles, crisscross Mecklenburg County in a vast lacework that flows to larger rivers and, eventually, to the Atlantic Ocean. Charlotte’s rolling topography tends to funnel floodwaters into low areas that usually correspond to creek beds. Habershaw has lived in Charlotte for 30 years and said he had never seen Briar Creek as high as it was Sunday afternoon. “It’s kind of scary,” he said, “but beautiful.” The heaviest rain fell in southeastern Mecklenburg County. Some places received 10 inches of rain this weekend. — Greg Lacour 5:30 p.m.: Hundreds of dialysis patients rescued from their homes Late Sunday afternoon, Tom Cotter, North Carolina team leader for the relief group Americares, was waiting in the parking lot of a shelter in Wilson, N.C., for the arrival of 105 dialysis patients who were on their way by bus after having been rescued from their flooded homes in Jacksonville, N.C., 90 miles to the south. Many of them had been rescued by boats from their homes, and some had not received treatment for as many as five days. Cotter had brought health screening devices, essential medicine, adult diapers, cleaning supplies and more. A dialysis center across the street will deliver care. “This is very much an ongoing disaster,” Cotter said. “People are still coming into these shelters.” — Steven Mufson 4:27 p.m.: Warily watching the rivers in South Carolina Renee Matthews has been walking to Lynches River at least once every day, checking how far it has risen. Two days ago, the river that surrounds her family’s property in rural Florence County, S.C., was dry and barely rose past her nephew’s knee. By Sunday, the river bank was nowhere to be seen. The boat landing that leads to the bank was buried in debris, and the four-foot concrete barrier next to it was nearly submerged. “It’s probably come up two to three feet,” she said, aiming her phone to take a picture. “You could walk right there two days ago. You could walk all around that tree two days ago,” she said, pointing at a submerged tree. And the deluge of rain has barely started. Flooding happens every few years in this wooded riverfront neighborhood of mobile homes and big houses, some of which were built several feet above the ground. “The water goes all the way to the top of that house,” Matthews said, pointing at an empty vacation home that stands at least six feet from the wet, grassy land. There has been no flooding yet in the county that shares a name with the storm. But officials are monitoring the Lynches River and other bodies of water inland as rain continues and rainfall from the north flows downstream, said Dusty Owens, director of the county’s emergency management division. Here in Florence County, several bodies of water – the Great Pee Dee River to the east, Lynches River to the south, and Black Creek to the north, are all expected to rise. Lynches River, for example, has risen by more than five feet since Friday. The Great Pee Dee could rise to 27 feet by Thursday, surpassing the flood stage by eight feet. “Next week, it’ll be our problem,” Matthews, 48, said. “This river’s going to keep rising.” — Kristine Phillips 3:47 p.m.: At least 15 people dead due to the storm At least 15 people have now died as a result of tropical depression Florence, which slammed into the Carolinas as a hurricane on Friday. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R) said five people were killed in the storm: Amber Dawn Lee of Union County; Mark Carter King and Deborah Collins Ryan, who lost their lives in a generator-related incident on Saturday; Michael D. Prince, who died this morning when he lost control of his car in Georgetown County; and Jeffrey B. Youngren, who died Sunday morning in Kershaw County after driving into a support beam. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said 10 people in the state have died due to the storm. — Felicia Sonmez 3:17 p.m.: An aging levee system holds, while a temporary barrier weakens As the swollen Lumber River in Lumberton, N.C., rose ever higher in Sunday’s pouring rain, the aging levee system in Robeson County held strong, said county spokeswoman Emily Jones. But a temporary sandbag barrier built by volunteers and National Guardsmen amid pouring rain this week had been “compromised” by the rising water levels, Jones said. Water had broken through that section of the river, which passed by railway tracks on the west side of town, during Hurricane Matthew in 2016, flooding businesses and homes. Sebastian Milton, a volunteer with the Cajun Navy who came to Lumberton from Covington, La., to help with rescue operations, said it’s a matter of time before the levee fails as well. [ Cajun Navy races to the Carolinas; citizen rescuers pull people from rising waters ] “That’s a man-made structure,” he said, “it can’t keep holding back the river.” Milton and fellow volunteers were posted on a bridge overlooking the Lumber River and a flooded section of Interstate 95 on Sunday afternoon. Their boats at the ready, they waited in pouring rain for the next emergency call to come in. “There’s still people out there,” Milton said, gesturing toward the expanse of dark water and trees that hid flooded homes. — Sarah Kaplan 2:49 p.m.: In Pembroke, N.C., ‘We’re having problems already.’ In Pembroke, N.C., emergency officials conducted about 120 evacuations and 20 rescues – complicated procedures like pulling people out of submerged cars – since the storm began. Charles Gregory Cummings, the town’s mayor, said officials had been working all week to make sure that the most vulnerable people in the community were safe from the storm. Police officers gave homeless citizens rides to the local shelters and conducted daily drives through public housing complexes, using a bullhorn to inform people about the coming deluge. Pamphlets were posted at every mobile home park bearing information about the forecast and where to seek shelter. Officers checked in daily at a local senior home to make sure their generators were working and they had enough food. On a drive through town to examine flooding “trouble spots,” Police Chief Ed Locklear noted that most of the public housing in Pembroke is located in the low-lying north side of town. There, canals and underground systems that drain water into the nearby swamp are easily overwhelmed by downpours. Several officials said that these canals were still clogged with downed trees and debris from Hurricane Matthew – the town hadn’t had the resources to fix the problem earlier, and only just received recovery funding from the federal government. Now Locklear cruised past a street to one of those housing complexes; it was submerged beneath what looked like a foot of muddy brown water. Sandbags rested against the homes’ front doors. “These are places that always flood,” Locklear said. “And you can see we’re having problems already.” — Sarah Kaplan 2:34 p.m.: Trump monitoring ‘the preparedness and response efforts’ The White House, in a statement, said President Trump is monitoring the storm and its effects: “Today, President Trump continues to monitor the preparedness and response efforts for Hurricane Florence. He was briefed again this afternoon by Sec. Nielsen, Admiral Schultz and Administrator Long. Yesterday, he spoke with Mayor Brenda Bethune of Myrtle Beach, SC and Mayor Dana Outlaw of New Bern, N.C. They discussed the rescue and response efforts in those communities and the President offered the full support of Federal government. Mayor Outlaw thanked President Trump for immediately authorizing the emergency declaration.” 2:31 p.m.: Mandatory evacuations in Fayetteville City officials in Fayetteville, N.C., said at an emergency meeting of the city council on Sunday that the Cape Fear River is expected to crest at 62 feet on Tuesday and recede sometime after 8 p.m. Friday. The river is already above flood stage, and there continues to be flash flooding and critical river flooding in the area, they said. Officials have been notifying residents that there is a mandatory evacuation order for those living within one mile of the Cape Fear and Little rivers. For other neighborhoods there is a voluntary evacuation order. There is also a curfew in effect until further notice. Thirteen roads in the city are closed so far due to high water or flooding, 50 to 60 traffic lights are out, and the city is closely monitoring the levels of nearby dams. Currently there are fewer than 10,000 people without power. Officials also said they have been pushing back against rumors that the city’s water supply is going to be shut off later Sunday afternoon; there are no plans for water to be shut off, they said. One official said that 160 people were transported from a nursing home to shelters last night. The city is working with EMS and others to provide transport to people in wheelchairs and those who need help getting out of bed. Officials are also working to open up more shelters for as many as 7,500 people who may be displaced. — Felicia Sonmez 1:46 p.m.: The storm is spawning an array of safety and environmental hazards Federal officials described an array of life-safety and environmental hazards spawned by Hurricane Florence in a Sunday afternoon teleconference. Among them: The floodwaters are potentially contaminated and could present a health hazard. “If you can avoid contact with floodwaters, do so,” said Reggie Cheatham, director of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Emergency Management. He said there are an estimated 3,300 “hog ponds” in North Carolina that hold manure. There is concern that heavy rainfall could cause them to overflow and send hog manure into waterways. Officials so far are “fairly confident” that farmers prepared adequately in advance of the storm to prevent the ponds from overtopping, Cheatham said. “But we’re not out of the woods yet.” Cheatham said that, at last count, there had been 28 boil-water orders issued by local water systems. Meanwhile there has been a significant spill of coal ash from a storage pond at a closed Duke Energy plant near Wilmington, N.C. Cheatham said 2,000 cubic yards of coal ash spilled into a ditch after floodwaters eroded a portion of the pond wall. That ditch leads to a cooling pond that has an outflow into the Cape Fear River, but he said there’s no evidence so far that the coal ash has reached that cooling pond. Duke Energy said in a statement Saturday that the company “does not believe this incident poses a risk to public health or the environment.” Federal officials are urging evacuees to stay where they are and not attempt to return home. “Don’t feel a need to rush home to file a claim” said National Flood Insurance Program chief executive David Maurstad. Coast Guard Adm. Meredith Austin said three major ports in the Carolinas remained closed, including the Cape Fear port near Wilmington. That closure is significant because the Cape Fear water utility has put out an urgent plea for fuel. “Cape Fear is the number one priority of getting a port open,” she said. “We are aware of the need to get fuel into the port.” FEMA associate administrator Jeff Byard provided the big picture: “This is a long event. We are definitely likely to have isolated communities.” — Joel Achenbach 1 p.m.: ‘This storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now.’ North Carolina officials said floodwaters continue to rage and residents across nearly the entire state are in danger from torrential rainfall, rising rivers, floodwaters and, in the mountains, mudslides. “This storm has never been more dangerous than it has right now,” in many areas of the state, Gov. Roy Cooper (D), said at a midday news conference. “Wherever you live in North Carolina, be on alert for sudden flooding.” Cooper said numerous rivers throughout the state – including the Cape Fear, Lumber, Neuse – are still rising and not expected to crest until later Sunday or Monday. The storm has dumped nearly two feet of rain in many places, and some places are being pummeled with to three inches of rain an hour. Flooding is getting worse in parts of the state, including Pollocksville, Lumberton, Kinston and Goldsboro. The danger is growing in North Carolina’s western mountains, where rains could lead to dangerous mudslides. Officials urged North Carolinians to stay off the roads. Many are closed; at least 171 primary roads are closed throughout the state, including portions of Interstates 95 and 40. People are urged not to drive east of Interstates 73/74 or U.S. Route 64 South. Many secondary roads are closed because of flooding. Cooper estimated that between 750,000 and 1 million people have evacuated certain areas, a figure that will rise with expected mandatory evacuations in some places as rivers rise. About 15,000 people are staying in about 150 shelters across the state, he said. Four medical shelters are open in North Carolina, serving at least 170 patients. More than 900 people have been rescued from floodwaters, Cooper said. At least 700,000 people remain without power and residents should expect to be without for days because so many roads are impassible. “People need to understand that some areas are likely to be without power for a while,” Cooper said. The governor said food, water and high-water vehicles are being delivered to hard-hit areas. The Coast Guard has rescued at least 50 people via helicopter. — Katie Zezima","Washington Post Florence dumps torrential rain, raises floodwaters across the Carolinas Washington Post Florence continues to inch across the Carolinas, spurring a widespread emergency across all of North Carolina, from the ocean east to mountain west.

AFP,"Beira (Mozambique): More than a thousand people are feared to have died in a cyclone that smashed into Mozambique last week, while scores were killed and more than 200 are missing in neighbouring Zimbabwe.The city of Beira in central Mozambique bore Cyclone Idai's full wrath on Thursday before the storm barrelled on to neighbouring Zimbabwe, unleashing fierce winds and flash floods and washing away roads and houses.
""For the moment we have registered 84 deaths officially, but when we flew over the area... this morning to understand what's going on, everything indicates that we could register more than 1,000 deaths,"" Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi said in a nationwide address. 
 ""This is a real humanitarian disaster,"" he said. 
""More than 100,000 people are in danger"".Survivors have taken refuge in trees while awaiting help, the president added.
Aerial photographs released by a Christian non-profit organisation, the Mission Aviation Fellowship, showed groups of people stuck on rooftops with flood waters up to window level.
""The scale of damage... (in) Beira is massive and horrifying"", the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said.
Ninety per cent of the city of some 530,000 people and its surrounding area has been ""damaged or destroyed,"" it said in a statement.
""The situation is terrible. The scale of devastation is enormous,"" the IFRC's Jamie LeSueur said.
""Almost everything is destroyed. Communication lines have been completely cut and roads have been destroyed. Some affected communities are not accessible."" 
A large dam burst on Sunday and cut off the last road to Beira, he said.
Sofala province governor Alberto Mondlane warned that the ""biggest threat we have now, even bigger than the cyclone, is floods because it's raining more and more"".
Emma Beaty, coordinator of a grouping of NGOs known as Cosaco, said: ""We've never had something of this magnitude before in Mozambique"".
""Some dams have broken, and others have reached full capacity, they'll very soon open the flood gates. It's a convergence of flooding, cyclones, dams breaking and making a potential wave: everything's in place so we get a perfect storm."" 
Nyusi said the Pungwe and Buzi rivers in central Mozambique ""have burst their banks and engulfed entire villages."" 
""Communities are isolated and bodies are floating"" on the waters, he said.
Beira international airport was closed because of cyclone damage but later reopened.
In neighbouring Zimbabwe, Idai left 98 dead and at least 217 more missing, according to the information ministry.
Families started burying their dead on Monday in damp graves, according to an AFP photographer.
The storm swept away homes and ripped bridges to pieces, leaving destruction that acting defence minister Perrance Shiri said ""resembles the aftermath of a full-scale war"".
Some roads were swallowed up by massive sinkholes, while bridges were ripped to pieces by flash floods.
""This is the worst infrastructural damage we have ever had,"" Zimbabwe's Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Joel Biggie Matiza said.
The eastern district of Chimanimani was worst-hit, with houses and most of the region's bridges washed away by flash floods.
The most affected areas are not yet accessible, and high winds and dense clouds have hampered military rescue helicopter flights.
Two pupils and a worker at a secondary school in the area were among those killed after a landslide sent a boulder crashing into their dormitory.
Soldiers on Sunday helped rescue the surviving nearly 200 pupils, teachers and staff who had been trapped at the school in Chimanimani.Joshua Sacco, lawmaker for Chimanimani, told AFP that ""150 to 200 people"" are missing.
The majority of them are thought to be government workers, whose housing complex was completely engulfed by raging waters. Their fate was unknown because the area was still unreachable.
Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa cut short a visit to Abu Dhabi, returning home on Monday.
""With every hour and day that passes, our worst fears become increasingly real,"" he said in a statement. 
""Many drowned while others were killed in their sleep from swift and unexpected rockfalls which demolished their homes"".
His government has come under fire for failing to evacuate people in time.

,"At a Glance Residents within a quarter mile of the Llano River in the city of Llano were urged to evacuate. Water rescues were reported Tuesday morning in Segovia, Texas. A bridge has collapsed after heavy rain in parts of south-central Texas triggered major flooding along several rivers and creeks, where evacuations and water rescues are underway. A section of the FM 2900 bridge collapsed in Kingsland on Tuesday morning, sending chunks of the bridge down the Llano River, according to a tweet. Residents within a quarter mile of the river in the city of Llano were urged to evacuate on Tuesday, according to a Civil Emergency Message. Authorities in Marble Falls told residents in several neighborhoods along the river to evacuate. The city is also asking residents to limit activities including laundry, washing dishes, using the toilet and taking showers because flooding was putting the city's wastewater plant under stress. The river rose to its second highest crest on record Tuesday morning in the city about 75 miles northwest of Austin and home to more than 3,000. According to the National Weather Service, many homes from Castell to below Llano are typically damaged by floodwaters when the river rises to that level. As much as 10 inches of rain had fallen in western Llano County in the 30 hours ending Tuesday morning, weather.com meteorologist Chris Dolce says. Farther west, water rescues were reported Tuesday morning in Segovia, prompting a flash flood emergency to be issued. The emergency will expire at 11 a.m. CDT. Eight rescues because of high water were completed in Gillespie County on Monday night, John Culpepper of the county's Office of Emergency Management told KXAN. The Lower Colorado River Authority announced Tuesday that it was closing several lakes to the public, including Travis, Marble Falls, LBJ, Inks and Buchanan. Water from the Johnson Fork Creek was flowing over Interstate 10 in Kimble County on Tuesday morning, according to the NWS.","The Weather Channel Texas Flooding Triggers Bridge Collapse; Evacuations, Water Rescues Underway The Weather Channel A bridge has collapsed after heavy rain in parts of south-central Texas triggered major flooding along several rivers and creeks, where evacua…",2018-10-16T14:44:32Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Weather.com'}","Texas Flooding Triggers Bridge Collapse; Evacuations, Water Rescues Underway - The Weather Channel",https://weather.com/news/news/2018-10-16-texas-flooding-evacuations,https://s.w-x.co/floodingkingsland_0.jpg,,Weather.com,flash-flood,1
ABC News,"The Latest on a storm that has forced evacuations in California (all times local): 9:25 a.m. The National Weather Service has issued a flood advisory for southern Santa Barbara and western Ventura counties in California as a strong Pacific storm moves through. The weather service says rainfall rates with a band of rain at midmorning Wednesday have been close to a half-inch (1.14 centimeters) an hour and recent wildfire burn areas will likely experience mud and debris flows. During a January storm, Montecito on the south coast of Santa Barbara County was devastated by massive debris flows that killed 21 people and left two others missing. ——— 6:45 a.m. Rain from a powerful Pacific storm is falling across areas of central and southern California at risk of mudslides but there are no reports of problems like significant flooding or debris flows. The storm was being closely watched Wednesday in Santa Barbara County, where a January storm unleashed debris-laden flash floods that ravaged the community of Montecito, killing 21 people. County spokeswoman Suzanne Grimmesey says debris catch-basins that filled up in January were completely cleared and have so far been fully functioning in the current storm. Grimmesey says that forecasters expect rainfall to intensify through Wednesday morning. Many California communities are at risk of storm runoff damage because of large wildfires that have left barren landscapes. ——— 11:06 p.m. A powerful Pacific storm is moving across central and southern parts of California, drenching communities previously ravaged by wildfires and mudslides. Thousands of residents evacuated their homes ahead of the storm while others were waiting it out and hoping for the best. Late Tuesday, Los Angeles County authorities told thousands more to be ready to evacuate from neighborhoods in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, which have also been badly hit by wildfires. Many residents in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have faced repeated evacuations or advisories since December, when a wind-driven fire grew into the largest in recorded state history and destroyed more than 1,000 buildings. A January storm unleashed mudslides that inundated hundreds of homes in their community of Montecito and killed 21 people.","ABC News The Latest: No initial reports of flooding, debris flows ABC News Andrew Joos-Visconti protects his home from the upcoming rains with sand bags in the Sun Valley area of Los Angeles Tuesday, March 20, 2018.

Associated Press,"(COLUMBUS, Miss.) — The full extent of the damage was coming into view Sunday after a tornado smashed into a commercial district in a small Mississippi city, killing at least one person and shattering businesses as severe storms raked the South on a weekend of drenching rains and a rising flood threat.
The tornado Saturday afternoon in Columbus was confirmed on radar, said meteorologist Anna Wolverton with the National Weather Service in Jackson. She told The Associated Press that experts would be headed Sunday to the east Mississippi city of about 23,000 people to gauge the tornado’s intensity.
A woman died after a building collapsed on her and three other people, the Columbus mayor’s office said Sunday in a statement on Facebook, citing information from Lowndes County Coroner Greg Merchant. The statement said 41-year-old Ashley Glynell Pounds of Tupelo was with three other people in a building that collapsed in the storm Saturday evening. The statement gave no information on the condition of the other three people.
Lee Lawrence, who said he has been selling used cars for decades in Columbus, told The AP that four buildings on his car lot had been destroyed. He said trees toppled across vehicles and car windows had been blown out. And he said he had no idea about how badly his collection of antique cars fared. A 1923 Studebaker and a 1930 Chevrolet were among the cars parked amid wind-tossed building debris.
Lawrence said he was at home getting ready to take a bath when the storm struck.
“The wind all of a sudden just got so strong and it was raining so much you could hardly see out the door, and I could hear a roaring. Evidently it came close,” he said, speaking with AP in a phone interview. He said someone called him soon after about the damage to his business and he rushed over.
“It will be a start-over deal,” Lawrence said. “I can’t say it will come back better or stronger, but we’ll come back.”
A photographer working for The AP in Columbus said some antique cars on Lawrence’s lot were parked among the damage and a nearby pet grooming business appeared now to be mostly twisted piles of metal. A printing shop had been speared by a pipe with great force and what seemed to be a vacant commercial building nearby appeared heavily damaged.
Firefighters and law enforcement officers had cordoned off the area, making it difficult to determine the extent of damage after nightfall. Power was out in the area.
Elsewhere around the South, homes, highways, parks and bridges were flooded or put out of commission amid the heavy rains and severe storms. News outlets report that water rescues have been performed in some Middle Tennessee counties. Flash flood warnings and watches remained in place throughout the South and one Mississippi community reported large hail.
Interstate 40 near the Tennessee line with North Carolina was closed by a rockslide, one of the dozens of roads and highways shut down throughout the region, transportation officials said.
Tennessee Department of Transportation spokesman Mark Nagi said on Twitter that a “full scale detour” was in place, with traffic being diverted to Interstate 81 and Interstate 26.
High water threatened property in Tennessee, which, like many other areas of the South, has been soaked by several inches of rain over the past week. Officials said a mudslide destroyed a Subway restaurant in Signal Mountain, Tennessee. No injuries were reported.
In Bruce, Mississippi, rivers broke flood stage and flash floods poured into homes and businesses. News outlets report that officials in Grenada, Mississippi, declared a local state of emergency after dozens of streets and homes flooded. A 6-mile (9-kilometer) stretch of the Natchez Trace Parkway was closed in Mississippi after water covered part of the road.
The National Weather Service had issued a flash flood warning for northwestern Lafayette County in Mississippi after emergency officials reported that a local dam was at risk of failing. Meteorologist Kole Fehling says emergency officials reported the threat involved the Audubon Dam, which blocks a creek on the north side of Oxford and a subdivision.
Weather officials said the storm’s impact stretched from eastern Arkansas to northern Georgia and beyond. Alabama’s governor declared a state of emergency in several counties, hoping to speed recovery in event of damages.
Kentucky announced Friday that it was closing the U.S. 51 bridge over the Ohio River to Cairo, Illinois, because of flooding on the southern approach. The bridge, which carries 4,700 vehicles a day, is likely to stay closed until Thursday, and possibly longer.
Near Jamestown, Kentucky, the Army Corps of Engineers said it was increasing releases from the Wolf Creek Dam on the Cumberland River. Areas downstream of the dam, from Rowena to Burkesville, could be affected by flooding as a result, officials said.
The Ohio River at Cairo is predicted to crest Sunday at its third-highest level ever recorded, and stay that high into next week. The Tennessee River near Savannah, Tennessee, also is forecast to crest at near-record levels.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON/WILSON, N.C. (Reuters) - Deadly storm Florence moved across western North Carolina early on Monday and continued to dump rain that has nowhere to go except to swell rivers, flood highways and homes, and threaten more lives as it heads towards Virginia and New England. For the water-logged Carolinas, “the worst is yet to come” as river levels rise to historic levels, said Zach Taylor, a meteorologist with the U.S. National Weather Service. “The soil is soaked and can’t absorb any more rain, so that water has to go somewhere, unfortunately,” he said. “Those rivers are going to start to crest later today and Tuesday and maybe longer.” Flash floods, landslide warnings and “prolonged significant river flooding” throughout the region will continue for the next few days, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. The coastal city of Wilmington remained cut off by high flood waters early on Monday, tens of thousands of homes were damaged and at least 17 deaths were reported in North and South Carolina. Florence, a onetime hurricane that weakened to a tropical depression by Sunday, is expected to decline in force again on Monday before re-intensifying on Tuesday and Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. It has dumped up to 40 inches (100 cm) of rain on North Carolina since Thursday and continued to produce heavy rain over much of North Carolina and eastern South Carolina, the NWS said. An additional 2 to 5 inches of rain is expected with isolated areas of 8 inches possible through Tuesday in the Carolinas and Virginia. “The storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference. More than 900 people were rescued from rising floodwaters and 15,000 remained in shelters in the state, Cooper said. Many rescues took place on swift boats in Wilmington, a coastal city of about 117,000 people on a peninsula between the Cape Fear River and the Atlantic Ocean. Rescue crews negotiated downed trees and power lines to reach stranded residents, Mayor Bill Saffo told WHQR radio. “There are no roads... that are leading into Wilmington that are passable because of the flooding that is taking place now inland,” Saffo said. Officials urged people who had been evacuated to stay away. “Our roads are flooded, there is no access into Wilmington,” New Hanover County Commission Chairman Woody White told a news conference. “We want you home, but you can’t come yet.” UNPRECEDENTED FLOODING In Leland, a low-lying city north of Wilmington, homes and businesses were engulfed by water that rose up to 10 feet (3 meters) over Highway 17 in what local people called unprecedented flooding. The sheriff’s department and volunteers rescued stranded residents by boat, extracting families, infants, the elderly and pets. Gas stations were abandoned and fallen trees made many roads impassable. More than 641,000 homes and businesses were without electricity in North and South Carolina and surrounding states, down from a peak of nearly 1 million. Florence set a state record for rain from a hurricane, surpassing the previous high of 24 inches (61 cm) from Hurricane Floyd which killed 56 people in 1999, said Bryce Link, a meteorologist with private forecasting service DTN Marine Weather. The storm killed at least 11 people in North Carolina, including a mother and child hit by a falling tree, state officials said. Six people died in South Carolina, including four in car accidents and two from carbon monoxide from a portable generator. South Carolina’s governor urged anyone in a flood-prone area to evacuate. “Those rivers in North Carolina that have received heavy rainfall are coming our way,” Governor Henry McMaster told a news conference. “They have not even begun (to crest). But they will. And the question is how high will the water be, and we do not know.” By 5 a.m. on Monday, Florence’s winds had dropped to about 30 miles per hour (45 kph), the NWS said, with weakening forecast over the next 24 hours before intensifying again as an extratropical low-pressure center.The center of the storm was about 125 miles (200 km) west southwest of Roanoke, Virginia and moving northeast at 13 mph (20 kph), the weather service said.

Sean Collins Walsh,"Built in 1969 and designed to withstand a 50-year storm, the two-lane causeway in Kingsland that succumbed to a raging Llano River was the third Central Texas bridge to be destroyed by floodwaters in recent years. Experts say it likely won't be the last as climate change and construction exacerbate the natural factors that led meteorologists to name the Hill Country ""flash flood alley."" With more than 53,000 bridges, Texas has more than any other state, and many were built in the mid-20th century based on federal weather data from the 1950s. Intense rain events are now more common, and rapid exurban development has created more impervious cover, leading to more runoff. ""It's inevitable that we will see more major bridge damage in the future, likely sooner rather than later,"" said Bruce Melton, an Austin-based civil engineer and founder of the nonprofit Climate Change Now Initiative. ""The 100-year storm is now the 25-year storm in Austin. PHOTOS: Major flooding throughout Central Texas on Tuesday"" The river crested at 39.9 feet Tuesday in the city of Llano, the closest flood gauge upstream from Kingsland, according to the National Weather Service. That was the highest flood level recorded in Llano since the record-setting 1935 mark of 41.5 feet. Most bridges on Texas Department of Transportation-constructed roads are built to withstand 25- or 50-year storms, while interstate highways are designed to withstand 100-year storms, said Travis Attanasio, a civil engineer in the Fort Worth area and an officer with the American Society of Civil Engineers. Some large Texas cities in recent years have started requiring bridges to be designed to withstand 100-year floods. A 100-year storm is a rain event that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year based on federal weather data. Those data, however, are being re-evaluated to reflect higher rainfall totals in recent years. Texas, for instance, has seen 500-year floods in each of the last three years. TxDOT spokesman Chris Bishop said the RM 2900 bridge was built with the assumption that the water levels in the Kingsland area, where the Colorado and Llano rivers meet at the top of Lake LBJ, are expected to stay stable. ""That section is considered to be for the most part a constant-level lake, so it’s not expected to do this. It normally would handle that, and it has for 50 years,"" Bishop said. TxDOT will not be able to estimate the reconstruction cost until after its inspectors evaluate the damage, Bishop said. Replacing a bridge of that type and size typically costs about $20 million, Attanasio said. In 2015, the deadly Memorial Day weekend flooding along the Blanco River destroyed two bridges between Blanco and Wimberley. As the state took a year to rebuild them, the Army Corps of Engineers constructed a temporary span for the Fischer Store Road Bridge upstream from Wimberley. Austin bridges The city of Austin maintains six bridges over Lake Austin and Lady Bird Lake, including the Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge and the Pleasant Valley Road bridge at Longhorn Dam. Most of those bridges are at or near the 100-year flood plain, said Pirouz Moin, interim city engineer. Redbud Trail downstream from Tom Miller Dam at Lake Austin is one of the bridges in the 100-year plain, but it is slated to be replaced if voters approve a $160 million transportation bond on Nov. 6. The city also is updating its flood plain maps, which could place several city bridges under the specification. Moin said new bridges are built to withstand 100-year floods. However, it is impossible for many of Austin’s roughly 1,700 bridges to be built at that height because they are in low-lying areas and could not serve roads that feed into them or provide access to surrounding properties. Requiem for a causeway The opening of the RM 2900 bridge came during a golden age for Kingsland, as the tiny town saw a population boom and a series of major construction and transportation projects. Local merchants bought a newspaper ad encouraging residents from nearby Sunrise Beach, Sandy Harbor and Blue Lake Estates to ""cross the bridge and save in Kingsland,” according to Highland Lakes Weekly. The unincorporated city now has about 6,000 residents and is home to the Antlers Hotel, where 1973's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" was filmed. The bridge has become a vital connection between the town and smaller communities on the other side of the Llano River. Each day about 5,600 drivers use that stretch of RM 2900, according to TxDOT traffic estimates. Although video of the bridge breaking apart seems to show that the flood's wall of water simply overpowered it on Tuesday, Attanasio said the bridge likely met its end because of debris that accumulated underneath it. ""More than likely it was some kind of debris that hit the support columns, whether it be a large tree or a boat that broke away,"" he said. ""Weird stuff washes down the creek when it rains.""

(Libby Solomon/The Baltimore Sun via AP) (Photo: Libby Solomon, AP) ELLICOTT CITY, Md. — Flash floods struck a Maryland city on Sunday that had been wracked by similar devastation two years earlier, prompting emergency rescues as raging waters engulfed cars and rose above the first floor of some buildings, authorities said. News outlets showed local photos and video of the turbulent floodwaters cascading down Main Street in Ellicott City, some 13 miles west of Baltimore. The community set along the west bank of Maryland's Patapsco River, was stricken by deadly flash flooding in July 2016. Authorities said they had no immediate reports of fatalities or injuries. But information was still preliminary and even Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who declared a state of emergency for the flooded community, was headed there late Sunday for a firsthand look. Footage of Sunday's flash flooding showed water surging around cars and pickup trucks and coursing over the top of their wheels. The Howard County Fire &amp; EMS agency tweeted that water was above the first floor of some buildings. Some residents of Ellicott City told The Baltimore Sun the flooding appeared to be worse than the 2016 flooding that killed two people and destroyed local businesses. The National Weather Service said a flash flood warning has been issued for the area through Sunday evening, calling it an ""extremely dangerous situation"" and urging motorists not to attempt to navigate flooded roads. The Howard County Department of Fire and Rescue Services tweeted that multiple rescues were carried out, and rescue swimmers were called in to help. The department also said swift water units from as far away as Northern Virginia were coming to help. ""If you are trapped, we are coming,"" tweeted. Officials opened a shelter at a community center in Ellicott City. There were no reports of fatalities, said Howard County spokeswoman Karen Spicer. Meanwhile, some roads were also flooded in neighboring Baltimore County. A spokeswoman in Baltimore County said the fire department has received dozens of calls about cars stuck in high water and flooded basements.

Kieran Corcoran,"Hawaii has been hit by landslides, torrential rain and thousands of power outages by the Tropical Storm Lane, which is wreaking havoc despite a downgrade from hurricane status. Lane, which was previously a fearsome category-5 hurricane, slowed and weakened as it made its way south of Hawaii's islands. According to forecasters, the storm will not make landfall. Its predicted track can be seen in this map: A map from the National Weather Service showing the likely track of Tropical Storm Lane. National Weather Service At around 5 p.m. Friday local time it was reclassified as a tropical storm, but has still proved capable of slamming the island with strong winds, rain, and flooding This photograph posted at 11:17 p.m. local time shows a flooded road with rain still falling. In an update around 10 p.m. Hawaii time, the National Weather Service said that Lane had brought three and a half feet of rain to parts of Hawaii in two days. Two stations in Hilo on the Big Island experienced 42 inches of rain between midday August 22 and 9 p.m. August 24. Parts of the town had to be evacuated due to the surging waters, with flash flood warnings still in place at midnight. This video, from Thursday, shows the extent of the flooding even before much of the rain had fallen. Hawaii officials also reported landslides on roads around the Big Island and the island of Maui. Hawaii's Department of Transportation said more than a dozen landslides had taken place, and posted photos of some online. It urged people not to use the roads unless totally necessary. Damage to power lines from the storm also brought widespread power outages on the island of Maui. A statement Friday from Maui Electric said that 4,800 people were without power and should not expect it back until the next day. At least 1,800 more had shorter outages before having power restored. Federal Emergency Management Agency officials said about 2,000 people were in shelters, mostly in Oahu, according to the Associated Press. The danger from the storm is due to remain into Saturday.","Hurricane Lane was downgraded to a tropical storm on Friday evening.

Jeremy Berke,"Hurricane Lane, captured by a NOAA satellite. NOAA Hawaii may face a direct hit from a Category 5 hurricane later this week. The National Weather Service on Tuesday night said that Hurricane Lane had been upgraded to a Category 5 storm, meaning it has the potential to bring winds in excess of 157 miles-per-hour and cause severe damage to Hawaii's islands. ""Major Hurricane Lane is passing to the south-southeast of the Big Island tonight and is expected to begin a turn northwest toward the islands later today,"" The National Weather Service said. ""The center of Lane will track dangerously close to the islands Thursday through Saturday."" The National Weather Service issued a hurricane warning for the storm, which is the most severe alert level. A hurricane warning means a hazardous weather event is ""imminent or likely."" The weather service further warned that ""life-threatening impacts are likely"" as the hurricane makes its closest approach to Hawaii, and issued a hurricane watch for Oahu, Maui, and other Hawaiian islands as meteorologists closely track the storm. Beyond wind damage, the National Weather Service warns that powerful hurricanes like Lane can cause intense rain, tidal surges, flooding, and even localized tornadoes. Even if the center of the hurricane doesn't make landfall, rough surf, rain, and wind could still cause flooding and severe damage to communities in Hawaii. The probable path of Hurricane Lane. Central Pacific Hurricane Center Hawaii Governor David Ige issued an emergency proclamation on Saturday to ""provide relief for disaster damages, losses and suffering"" associated with the storm. The state's Department of Emergency Management issued a flash flood warning throughout the state and said flooding associated with the hurricane could become a ""very dangerous situation."" Hawaii residents have rushed to prepare for the oncoming hurricane, stocking up on non-perishable foods, bottled water, and life essentials like toilet paper, according to the Associated Press. Schools in Maui and Oahu will be closed starting Wednesday, and all non-essential government employees on those islands will be put on administrative leave, according to the AP. Hurricanes rarely make landfall in Hawaii as the central Pacific sees fewer storms than the Atlantic, and Hawaii is a ""small target"" in the Pacific Ocean, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. Earlier this year, the Kilauea Volcano erupted on Hawaii's Big Island, causing widespread damage to property in communities across the eastern side of the island.

Associated Press,"(MIAMI) — A storm kicking up in the Caribbean Sea is threatening to bring heavy rainfall and flash floods to parts of Mexico, Cuba, Florida and the eastern U.S. Gulf Coast this weekend and possibly beyond. Subtropical Storm Alberto – the first named storm of the 2018 hurricane season – was roiling parts of coastal Mexico and Cuba with rip currents and dangerous surf on Friday. Both countries issued tropical storm watches. At 11 a.m. EDT, Alberto was located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) south of Cozumel, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph). It was moving north-northeast at 6 mph (9 kph). The U.S. was expected to start feeling Alberto’s effects Saturday. The National Weather Service said a flash flood watch would be in effect from Saturday evening through Tuesday evening for southeastern Mississippi, southwestern Alabama, and the western Florida Panhandle. A subtropical storm has a less defined and cooler center than a tropical storm, and its strongest winds are found farther from its center. Subtropical storms can develop into tropical storms, which in turn can strengthen into hurricanes. Alberto comes ahead of schedule: the six-month hurricane season doesn’t begin until June 1. Parts of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana have already seen heavy rain this week, and further deluges could leave those areas vulnerable to flash flooding and river flooding. Some beachfront and riverfront communities are already handing out sandbags. The downpours could dampen Memorial Day, the unofficial start of the summer tourist season along Gulf beaches. Along with heavy rains and high winds come rough seas and a threat of rip currents from Florida to Louisiana that can sweep swimmers out to sea. Red flags warning of dangerous surf conditions are already flying along some beaches. Jordan Sawmiller of Ohio tells WALA-TV that he was approaching the water with caution in Gulf Shores, Alabama. “It will hit you pretty hard. and it sucks you right back out. So, I don’t like getting in there very far,” Sawmiller said. A hotel owner in Panama City Beach, Florida, tells the Panama City News Herald that her family’s five hotels are normally full on Memorial Day weekend. But Julie Hilton said people are cancelling because of the weather and room reservations are down about 20 percent. Heavy rain could also be bad news for farmers. Georgia Peanut Commission Chairman and farmer Armond Morris and Tyron Spearman with the National Peanut Buying Points Association inspected a south Georgia peanut field Thursday. They told WALB-TV that farmers are worried about already-soaked young plants. “Just hopeful that all the peanut stands will be OK, but we may have to replant some peanuts,” said Morris. Only 65 percent of the 2018 Georgia peanut crop has been planted. “The crop is not growing as well as it should be,” said University of Georgia Tifton peanut agronomist Scott Monfort. “So we are getting some cases of yellow peanuts just not growing.”","The storm is threatening to bring heavy rainfall and flash floods to parts of Mexico, Cuba and Florida",2018-05-25T18:05:50Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Alberto Is Coming: First Named Storm of the 2018 Hurricane Season Is Aimed at Gulf Coast,http://time.com/5292106/alberto-hurricane-season-2018/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-598590592.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,flash-flood,1
Jolyn Rosa,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Lane, greatly diminished from the major hurricane it once was, drifted away from the Hawaiian coast on Saturday, but lingering showers threatened to trigger more flooding and landslides. The National Weather Service (NWS) lifted all remaining tropical storm warnings and watch advisories for Hawaii as trade winds finally began to nudge Lane off to the west. But a flash flood watch remained in effect for Oahu, home to the state capital Honolulu and 70 percent of Hawaii’s 1.4 million residents, through Sunday morning, emergency management officials said. Civil defence officials on the Big Island said more rain and flooding were also possible there, and a high-surf advisory was posted through the day for south- and east-facing shores of all the islands. Lane’s maximum sustained winds dropped to 50 miles (80 km) per hour, but residual moisture would produce excessive rainfall that could lead to “additional flash flooding and landslides,” a weather service bulletin said. Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas one year ago Saturday, then stalled over the Gulf Coast as it drenched the region in rain for several days, causing devastating floods. BIG ISLAND BEARS BRUNT OF RAIN Ahead of Lane, Hawaii residents had spent days stocking up on food, water, gasoline and batteries and boarding up their windows. The island chain was spared the calamity of a direct hit from a major hurricane as the storm steadily weakened on Friday. However, by then torrential showers had drenched the windward side of Hawaii’s Big Island for more than two days, unleashing severe flooding and mudslides that forced multiple road closures and damaged or destroyed a number of homes and other structures, authorities said. At least two neighbourhoods around Hilo, the largest city on the Big Island, were evacuated on Friday, and emergency teams have rescued more than 50 people trapped by high water since Thursday, Hawaii County Civil Defence spokeswoman Kelly Wooten told Reuters by phone. “I’ve never seen this, so much devastation of the river flowing down off of Komohana,” said one long-time Hilo resident, Tracy Pacheco. “I just came from Pahale Park, and there’s no park.” Rains finally abated on the Big Island on Saturday, she said. Hilo received more than 31 inches (79 cm) of rain from Wednesday through Friday, its largest three-day total since records began in 1949. Some areas received more than 45 inches, the weather service said. Forecasts predicted that Lane, which peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with top sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph) earlier in the week while far from Hawaii, would diminish into a tropical depression by early on Sunday. By Saturday morning the water had receded enough that many residents of Hilo were mopping up several inches of mud. Jillane Bosscher, a 45-year-old chef, and her family spent Thursday night and Friday in a local shelter. By Saturday the water had receded enough that they were able to return home and start cleaning. In another sign of improving conditions, most harbours around the state were reopened or placed on “hurricane preparedness” status allowing shippers to resume operations with caution, a according to the state Transportation Department. On the islands of Maui, Molokai and Lanai, evacuees have returned home from emergency shelters, and those facilities were being closed, local officials reported.

Tom McKay,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will test a system at 2:18pm ET on Thursday afternoon that lets the president send a message to most cell phones across the U.S. following a disaster, terrorist attack, or other serious threat to public safety. Yes, that means Donald Trump can now put your phone on blast. No, he probably won’t use the system to text you throughout the day with rambling bullshit about “ 13 Angry Democrats ” or wishing “the haters and losers” a “special” September 11th, at least according to experts who spoke with NBC News. The wireless emergency alerts (WEA) system was first approved by Congress in 2015 and restricts usage of the system to instances of “a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster or threat to public safety.” According to NBC, those experts say the system is a good idea in a time when people are glued to their phones and the internet: “If you separate this from the politics and personality of any individual president then this is a great idea and an amazing use of technology to reach everybody if they’re in harms way,” said Karen North, director of the Annenberg Digital Social Media program at the University of Southern California. UCLA communications professor Tim Groeling agreed, writing via email, “broadcast-based emergency alert systems... have remained professional and impartial over decades... A system like this seems necessary in an era where most people are disconnected from ‘live’ media like radio and television.” If Trump were to order FEMA to warn the nation of the emergency threat posed by the cowardly Jeff Sessions and the very corrupt and unfair Robert Mueller, he would probably be in violation of the law—which, granted, is something he doesn’t seem particularly concerned about. However, anyone actually attempting to use the system would have to go through FEMA (namely, its Integrated Public Alert &amp; Warning System) and rely on support staff trained in the complicated process necessary to transmit the message. As Vox reported, even those suspicious the president would abuse WEA generally agree it is a good idea: Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, told me that the wireless alert system is a good idea, as is testing it — but having someone as volatile as Trump with control over it is concerning. “I’m not sure that the system would protect us from rogue announcements by a president who has exhibited the kind of behavior President Trump has over the last two years,” Redlener said. “I personally would not give this microphone to Donald Trump.”...“We need to accept the fact that any of these systems can fail, miscommunications can go out when the wrong button’s being pushed. That’s a given for any system of this type,” Redlener said. “What I’m more concerned about is the president of the United States taking control over such a system intentionally to create havoc, to make some sort of highly disruptive, highly political announcement.” FEMA itself noted that the alert system is “only for national emergencies” on Twitter: To the extent WEA has been criticized, it’s mainly been that the system has inherent limitations like a 90 character limit—partially as a result of pushback from carriers and smartphone manufacturers resistant to spending time and money on it. It’s not possible to opt out of the system, and one shouldn’t, unless they like being caught off guard by potentially life-threatening disasters. However, it is possible to tweak an individual phone’s settings to simply ignore it (not recommended). Regional WEA systems are already in place—for example, those AMBER Alert messages advising residents of the details of child abductions as well as flash flood, tornado, and hurricane warnings already go out using the system. Hundreds of agencies have access to the system. As Mashable noted, the national WEA test is new, but there have been three prior national tests of the predecessor Emergency Alert System, which goes out over television and radio. Tests of the system are required every three years or less under the law, according to CNN. The message going out on Thursday will read an English-only message stating “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.” [ NBC News ]","The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will test a system at 2:18pm ET on Thursday afternoon that lets the president send a message to most cell phones across the U.S. following a disaster, terrorist attack, or other serious threat to public safety.

Hanna Krueger,"Forecasters continue to increase the potential for the tropical wave currently near the Bahamas to develop into a tropical depression in the Gulf of Mexico. The disturbance is causing disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the southeastern and central Bahamas and adjacent Atlantic waters, including the Straits of Florida. Forecasters expect the system to move west-northwestward and will likely turn into a depression within the next day or two. In the past 24 hours, the chance of the wave transforming into a depression within the next 48 hours has been increased from 50 percent to 70 percent, according to the latest statement Sunday (Sept. 2) from the National Hurricane Center. The Hurricane Center said an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled to investigate the system Monday. This system will produce locally heavy rains and gusty winds across the central and northwestern Bahamas, southern Florida, and the Florida Keys during the next day or two. Local forecasters are warning of the potential for heavy rain in the New Orleans area starting Tuesday night as the system makes a ""beeline"" for the region. The amount and intensity of rain will depend on the strength of the system, which is still uncertain at this point. Right now, forecasters predict 3 to 5 inches of rain, but changes could happen fast and without warning. Flash flooding is probable, according to the National Weather Center. A tropical storm watch could be issued for portions of the northern Gulf Coast tonight as the storm continues to move northwestward. Within the next five days, the storm has a 90 percent chance of transforming into a tropical depression. In a Saturday statement, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged residents to be vigilant. She said the city is monitoring the weather and is prepared. St. Charles Parish said it has opened locations for residents to get sandbags. Locations are at the East and West Bank Bridge Parks and Louisiana 306 at Badeaux Lane East in Bayou Gauche. Residents are asked to bring their own shovel. The parish's Department of Public Works was putting up HESCO Baskets along Bayou Des Allemands and sandbagging the Des Allemands boat launch.

Stephen Sorace,"Florence was downgraded to a Category 3 storm as it weakened along its path in the Atlantic overnight Thursday, though forecasters say the storm “is expected to remain a strong hurricane for the next several days.” According to the National Hurricane Center, Florence’s sustained winds dropped to 115 miles per hours—down from its Category 4-level winds of 130 mph on Wednesday. Additional weakening was forecast throughout Thursday. The agency said Florence was moving northwest at 12 mph and was forecast to turn west-northwest. The storm was 1,170 miles east-southeast of Bermuda overnight Thursday. While forecasters expect Florence to weaken over the next several days, the storm is predicted to remain a powerful hurricane through early next week. The National Hurricane Center said that swells generated by Florence will begin to affect Bermuda onFriday and will reach portions of the U.S. East Coast over the weekend. It said that “swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.” There are no watches or warnings currently in effect for the U.S. While Florence continued on its path in the Atlantic, the remains of Tropical Depression Gordon spread bands of heavy rain across parts of the South as it swirled over Mississippi Wednesday. Rain spun around the storm's center in the Jackson, Mississippi, area Wednesday afternoon. And bands swept up from the Gulf, dropping more rain on northwest Florida — where 10.48 inches already had fallen at Florida's Pensacola International Airport by Wednesday morning — through the center of Alabama and into Tennessee. What's left of Gordon is forecast to head northeast into Arkansas. By Saturday, what's left of the storm was forecast to hook to the north, then northeast on a path toward the Great Lakes. National Weather Service offices in Missouri and Oklahoma said Gordon's remnants could add to the rain caused by a frontal boundary already causing heavy rains in parts of the Midwest.

The flash flooding only lasted a couple hours, but photographs and videos from the scene will reflect the carnage long after the last of the debris is removed from the battered homes and businesses.

https://www.facebook.com/michael.miller.1466,"Crews were engaged in multiple water rescues and buildings collapsed in historic Ellicott City on Sunday evening as flood waters raged through its streets following torrential thunderstorms, Howard County officials said. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced at 6:40 p.m. he had declared a state of emergency in Howard County and was planning on making his way to Ellicott City to assess the damage. The Howard County fire department warned people trapped on the city’s Main Street to climb to the second floors of buildings as they awaited rescue and said the damage could rival devastating floods that occurred there in 2016. No injuries were immediately reported. “This is an EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC situation and you must move to HIGHER GROUND IMMEDIATELY AND STAY AWAY FROM ANYWHERE WHERE WATER IS MOVING,” the National Weather Service warned in a 5:30 p.m. tweet. Howard County public information officer Mark Miller said a torrent of water was rushing through the streets. Miller said the flooding “appears to be of equal magnitude as the 2016 floods.” “The town is flooding,” Miller said. “All of our first responders are responding.” The Howard County fire department warned people to stay away and said hundreds of rescuers were converging on Ellicott City from as far away as Northern Virginia. Howard County officials announced they were opening an emergency operations center to manage its response. Videos taken on Ellicott City’s Main Street show boiling brown waters flowing down the street, carrying debris and trash. The waters spilled into doors and windows and twisted traffic lights. Abigail Conte, 19, was at the Bean Hollow coffee shop in the historic section of the city when the rains began this afternoon. She said the staff announced they were closing around 3:45 because of a flood warning. She left the shop and began to make her way to her car about a half-mile away. “As I was walking outside, the street was becoming a river,” Conte said. She came to an intersection where it became too dangerous to continue. She eventually sought shelter at Cottage Antiques. As of about 6:30 p.m., she said she was trapped on the second floor of the building and had moved into a backroom because she was afraid a telephone pole might collapse on the shop. She said the owners of the antique shop said the basement of the building had flooded. She said she saw a garbage can and other detritus flowing down Main Street, but nothing larger. “It’s just flooded,” said a woman who answered the phone at A Journey from Junk. “I’m trying to work through my own panic attack.” Before declaring a state of emergency, Hogan activated the state’s emergency response, which sends extra rescue personnel to the scene from various state agencies, said his spokesperson Amelia Chasse. Several nearby counties — including Carroll, Frederick and Washington — sent swift water teams, she said. “The Governor sends his thoughts and deepest sympathies to those impacted, including residents and businesses in Ellicott City,” Chasse said. “He is warning people to be safe. Don’t come out to look at the flooding. There’s still danger out there.” The Capital Weather Gang reported radar indicated 3 to 6 inches of rain has fallen in just two hours in the Ellicott City area and it continues to rain heavily. Just to the south of Ellicott City, radar indicated as much as 7 to 8 inches had fallen. Jeff Halveson, professor of meteorology at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County and a contributor to the Capital Weather Gang, said the storm pattern had essentially stalled over Ellicott City, the same phenomenon that caused massive flooding in the City of Frederick two weeks ago. He said the storm could drop 10 to 12 inches of rain total, before it finally ends between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. He said he thought the flooding could ultimately be worse than what was seen in Ellicott City in 2016. “To say lightning strikes twice is basically what’s happening,” Halveson said. “To have this happen weeks apart and 30 miles apart is extraordinary. Ellicott City sustained severe damage in a July 30, 2016, flash flood that killed two people. During that flooding, houses along Main Street shook as residents filmed the devastation out their windows. Some formed human chains to rescue those stranded in their cars as the rising waters roared through the historic downtown. Emergency workers climbed onto roofs and chopped holes into stores to save those trapped inside. In the 2016 flooding, Joe Blevins, a father of three, was swept away as he climbed with his wife from their flooding car. His body was spotted by a hiker the next morning on the shore of the Patapsco River. The body of another tourist, Jessica Watsula, was found under the Ilchester Bridge.

DANIEL MANZO,"Parts of Hawaii's Big Island have already reported receiving more than 2 feet of rain as Hurricane Lane lurches northward at about 6 mph. Interested in Hawaii? Add Hawaii as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hawaii news, video, and analysis from ABC News. The biggest threat from the Category 3 hurricane remains life-threatening flash flooding that could lead to landslides or mudslides. The storm's wind speeds were last clocked at approximately 120 mph. Hurricane Lane was still a Category 3 as of this morning. The center of the storm is about 165 miles southwest of Kailua-Kona and 215 miles south of Honolulu. Hurricane-force winds extend 35 miles from the storm's center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend 125 miles from the center. The eye of the storm may get very close to or even pass over the islands. Lane is expected to remain a hurricane for the next 12 to 24 hours, but increasing wind shear could weaken the storm more quickly over the next two to three days. The storm is forecast to pull away from Hawaii by late Saturday. Hurricane Lane is expected to veer west Saturday morning. Rainfall rates in the outer bands of the hurricane may reach 1 to 3 inches per hour, meaning flash flood watches will remain in effect through late tonight. Additional rainfall of 10 to 20 inches is possible in some areas. Isolated areas could see 40 inches. The peak wind gust reported so far is 68 mph in Kohala Ranch on the Big Island. Heavy rainfall is expected through Sunday in Hawaii. Elsewhere, intense monsoon storms caused flash floods in Phoenix on Thursday, stranding drivers on roadways. Later today, severe storms are expected from northern Missouri to southern Minnesota, with large hail and damaging winds the biggest Midwest threats.

Reuters Editorial,"MONTECITO, Calif. (Reuters) - The search for survivors from a devastating Southern California mudslide that has killed at least 17 people moved into its third day on Friday, with some 700 rescue workers expecting to find more dead victims. Triggered by heavy rains, the massive slide struck before dawn on Tuesday, when a wall of mud and debris cascaded down hillsides that were denuded last month by wildfires, including the Thomas Fire, the largest blaze in the state’s history. “Realistically we suspect we are going to have the discovery of more people killed in this incident,” Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said at a Thursday news briefing, adding that he was hoping to find “miracle” survivors. Brown said 43 people remain missing, although some may just be out of communication. In one of the hardest hit areas, the affluent seaside community of Montecito, the devastation wrought by the slide and the gruesome undertaking faced by emergency crews was evident. Neighborhoods were littered with uprooted trees and downed power lines, and front yards in homes filled with mud were strewn with boulders. Elsewhere, cars carried away by the flow were perched on mounds of earth and mangled garage doors crushed by the mud rested at odd angles.

REUTERS/ Kyle Grillot The cause of death for all 17 victims who perished will be listed as multiple traumatic injuries due to flash flood with mudslides, the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s office said in a statement on Thursday. The dead victims range in age from three to 89. Josephine Gower, 69, died when she opened the door to her home, her son, Hayden Gower, told NBC station KSBY. Her daughter-in-law Sarah Gower confirmed Gower’s death in a Facebook post. Her body was found that night, near a highway hit by the slide.

REUTERS/ Kyle Grillot “I told her to stay on the second floor, but she went downstairs and opened the door and just got swept away,” Hayden Gower said. “I should have just told her to leave. You just don’t even think that this is possible.” The sheriff’s office also expanded the evacuation zone in the Montecito area on Thursday, as traffic on the already-clogged roads is hindering efforts by rescue and repair crews to access the devastation. Rescue workers in helicopters and high-wheeled military vehicles, some with search dogs, were deployed in the hunt for the missing in a disaster zone littered with the remnants of hundreds of damaged or destroyed homes. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) granted a request on Thursday by Governor Jerry Brown for expanded financial aid that was first allocated for the Thomas Fire, the governor’s office said in a statement. “This declaration ensures that federal funds are available for emergency response and eligible disaster recovery costs,” the governor’s statement said.

(May 29 AP Damage cars displaced by floodwaters along Main Street in Ellicott City, Md. on May 27, 2018. (Photo: JIM LO SCALZO, EPA-EFE) The second ""1-in-1,000"" year flood in two years devastated quaint Ellicott City, Md., on Sunday, leaving residents to ask: Did the city or Howard County do enough after the first flood to prepare for the next one? ""Tremendous progress has been made since the tragic flooding that occurred July 30, 2016,"" a Howard County master plan report said just last week. The county also announced the installation of a new flood warning system, including new stream gauges, which was scheduled to be installed next month. Howard County executive Allan Kittleman, at a Monday press conference, said about 30% of the flood mitigation efforts the county had been tackling since the July 2016 flood had been completed: “We’ve done a lot, but you can’t get that much done in 22 months. It wasn’t like we had not done anything,"" he said. “Ellicott City was as prepared as it could be,"" Kittleman said. ""When you have 8 inches coming down, terrible things can happen.... Something like this is so devastatingly strong it is difficult to handle.” Howard County Public Works Director James Irvin said work was being done. “We have been restricting channels to handle stormwater, and religiously keeping them cleaned out,"" he said. ""They were just cleaned out about two weeks ago. … We are also working on making the culverts bigger.” Some city residents said the county prioritized getting businesses and residents back up and running — but not preventing another disaster. Many think it’s because they had the mindset that it was a thousand-year storm and wouldn’t happen again. Other factors: slow bureaucracy of government, continued development throughout the region and little changes in flood mitigation efforts. Ellicott City resident Ron Peters has been meeting with other citizens and property owners since 2015 on a flood work group that works hand-in-hand with Howard County’s government. He and the other members of the group have come up with dozens of solutions but have been waiting for three years to see any large changes. “It’s study after study after study. That’s all they do is conduct studies,” he said. “It’s just another way for them to not actually do anything.” “We can’t keep losing people to this madness,"" said Jason Barnes, also an Ellicott City business owner. ""These floods go from inches to feet in the blink of an eye. No amount of detection or warnings are going to help. This area isn’t worth saving if it’s going to cost people’s lives.” The city is no stranger to flooding: In fact, Ellicott City has flooded 15 or so times in the past couple of centuries,"" Forbes magazine reported. It sits near the Patapsco River and is in a valley. For this reason alone, the region is prone to flooding. Kittleman said residents and business owners now have tough decisions to make, according to the Baltimore Sun. He said the county would support businesses, whether they decide to rebuild or to move on. For instance, getting flood insurance around old Ellicott City was an expensive proposition before. But now, those who are pondering the next comeback don’t even want to think about how much it might cost. And many business owners are still paying off the debt they incurred after the last flood smashed their businesses and properties. Nathan Sowers, owner of the River House Pizza Co., an outdoor eatery in the old mill town’s business district, said that after all the hard work rebuilding from the 2016 flood, he’s feeling a bit overwhelmed at attempting yet another comeback. “We’ll see. It takes a lot of money and a lot of time, a lot of energy. We’ll just have to assess it,” he continued, speaking near a bridge where several crushed cars were swept into a muddy tributary’s banks. Peters said that “it’s like all of us are screaming to fix it and no one cares. We’re just a little blip here in Howard County. No one seems to care that this is going to keep happening. It’s just red tape and bureaucracy.” The rain on Sunday, about 8 inches in as little as three hours, was exceptional: “In a normal heavy rain … you wouldn’t see this amount of flooding, where you see cars floating down the road,” said Mike Muccilli, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “This was a true flash flood.” Contributing: John Bacon, Christal Hayes, USA TODAY; The Associated Press Last Slide Next Slide : Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2soQLgS","The second ""1-in-1,000"" year flood in two years devastated quaint Ellicott City, Md., on Sunday, leaving residents to ask: Did the city or Howard County do enough after the first flood to prepare for the next one?",2018-05-29T17:41:15Z,"{'id': 'usa-today', 'name': 'USA Today'}",Ellicott City residents wonder: Was enough done after the 2016 flood to prepare for the next one?,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/05/29/ellicott-city-flooding-mitigation-efforts/651082002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable,https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/da99f47194720dc0016a61f87459ac2fa19ab112/c=0-615-5992-4000&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/05/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636631059454249189-EPA-USA-FLOOD-ELLICOTT-CITY.1.jpg,usa-today,USA Today,flash-flood,1
"Associated Press, Associated Press","View of the flooded streets of the town of San Felipe, in the state of Baja California, Mexico, on Oct. 1, 2018. (Photo: EPA-EFE) PHOENIX After soaking northwestern Mexico with heavy rains as it neared the Baja California Peninsula, reportedly claiming at least one victim, Tropical Storm Rosa is expected to drench the U.S. Southwest. From Arizona to Utah, some residents filled sandbags in anticipation of heavy rainfall forecasts and potential flooding. The center of Rosa, which was a hurricane until late Sunday, was expected to hit Baja California and Sonora by early Tuesday, bringing 3 to 6 inches of rain, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Its then expected to move quickly northwestward as it weakens, bringing 2 to 4 inches of rain to central and southern Arizona and 1 to 2 inches to the rest of the desert Southwest, Central Rockies and Great Basin. Isolated areas might see even more precipitation. In southern Arizona, heavy rain Monday flooded streets in Yuma and caused power outages in parts of the city. At least six roads in Tucson were closed because of flash flooding from washes that overflowed. The Utah National Guard was activated Monday to assist in flood mitigation efforts in Utah County. The National Weather Service earlier announced flash flood watches through Wednesday for areas including southern Nevada, southeastern California, southwestern and central Utah and the western two-thirds of Arizona. More: Tropical Storm Rosa reminds Arizona of its history of jaw-dropping flash floods Forecasts call for heavy rainfall in the watch areas, which include Las Vegas, Phoenix and Salt Lake City, with possible flooding in slot canyons and normally dry washes and a potential for landslides and debris flows from recent wildfire burn scars. National Weather Service meteorologists in Phoenix said central and northern Arizona stood to get hit with the heaviest amounts of precipitation. Metropolitan Phoenix, where temperatures were above 100 degrees Fahrenheit only a few days ago, had already cooled to the 80s on Monday thanks to Rosa. Moisture associated with the storm arrived ahead of it, bringing rain Sunday night and Monday morning. Phoenix meteorologist Jaret Rogers said more showers were expected across central Arizona before a weakened Rosa was to arrive in the area Tuesday morning. According to the National Weather Service, the entire Phoenix area is expected to see between 1 and 2 inches of rain. But some areas could see between 2 to 3 inches. All that means is conditions are favorable for flash flooding if it rains, Rogers said. It doesnt mean somethings imminent. Rosas maximum sustained winds had decreased to 40 mph as of Monday afternoon, and the storms center was heading north-northeast at 10 mph. The Civil Defense agency for Baja California state said schools were closed Monday in several communities, including the state capital of Mexicali, across the border from Calexico, California; San Felipe, on the northern Sea of Cortez; and south of Ensenada, on the peninsulas Pacific coast. Federal authorities declared a state of emergency for Ensenada and Mexicali. Various Mexican media outlets reported that a woman was swept away by floodwaters and drowned in the city of Caborca, Sonora, on the Sea of Cortez. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Sergio was strengthening in the Pacific and was forecast to reach hurricane force, though it posed no immediate threat to land. Sergio had winds of 70 mph and was centered about 695 miles southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. The storm was moving west at 14 mph.

Timothy B. Lee,"Enlarge / Ousters's OS-1 (left) and OS-2 lidar sensors. reader comments 2 Velodyne invented modern three-dimensional lidar scanners in the mid-2000s. But in recent years, the conventional wisdom has held that Velodyne's design—which involved mounting 64 lasers onto a rotating gimbal—would soon be rendered obsolete by a new generation of solid-state lidar sensors that used a single stationary laser to scan a scene. But a startup called Ouster is seeking to challenge that view, selling Velodyne-like spinning lidar sensors at competitive prices. In late April, we talked to Ouster CEO Angus Pacala, who has special expertise on the tradeoffs between spinning and solid-state lidars. The reason: Pacala was previously a co-founder at Quanergy, one of the best-known startups working on solid-state lidar. In our conversation, Pacala declined to badmouth his former company. But actions speak louder than words here. We can assume that as a Quanergy cofounder, Pacala became intimately familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of solid-state lidar technologies. And so it's telling that when he decided to create another lidar company, he decided not to do another solid-state one. ""Solid state lidar"" is actually an umbrella term that covers several non-spinning lidar designs. There's an approach called MEMS— microelectromechanical systems —that involves using a tiny mirror to steer a laser beam. Other solid state lidars use a technology called optical phased arrays to steer a laser beam with no moving parts. A third category, called flash lidar, dispenses with beam steering and simply illuminates the entire scene in a single flash, detecting the returned light with a two-dimensional array of sensors akin to a digital camera. Pacala's old company, Quanergy, hasn't explained its technology in any detail. But it has reportedly focused on the phased-array approach. With little or no moving parts, all three of these designs have the potential to be cheap and rugged. In the long run, advocates envision packing almost all of the electronics—including the laser itself, beam-steering circuitry, the detector, and supporting computing power—onto a single chip. Solid-state lidars are likely to be less obtrusive in consumer products than bulky spinning lidar that has to stick up from the roof of the car to work well. This all sounds good in theory, and Pacala presumably thought it was correct when he co-founded Quanergy in 2012. But he has evidently changed his mind, since his second lidar startup uses a more conventional spinning-laser approach. Spinning lidar has some unique advantages One of Google's early self-driving car prototypes. Note the giant roof-mounted lidar sensor, the black radar box on the front fender (one of four), and the ""wheel encoder"" mounted on the back wheel. There were also video cameras inside the cabin. This model had $150,000 worth of extra equipment.[/ars_img]In his conversation with Ars, Pacala pointed out a couple of big advantages of the classic spinning design. The most obvious one is the 360° field of view. You can stick one lidar unit on the top of a car and get a complete view of a car's surroundings. Solid state lidars, in contrast, are fixed in place and typically have a field of view of 120° or less. Hence, it takes at least four units to achieve comparable coverage with a solid-state sensor. Another less obvious advantage, Pacala says, is that eye safety rules allow a moving laser source to emit at a higher power level than a stationary one. ""All class 1 systems must be designed such that if a person were to put their eyes right up to the device without blinking for many seconds, that they still wouldn't be hurt,"" he told Ars. With a scanning solid-state unit, putting your eye inches from the laser scanner could cause 100 percent of the laser light to flood into the eye. But with a spinning sensor, the laser is only focused in any particular direction for a fraction of its 360° rotation. A spinning lidar unit can therefore put more power into each laser pulse without creating risk of eye damage. That makes it easier to detect return flashes, so spinning units may have a range advantage over stationary ones for the foreseeable future. At the same time, most of the leading solid-state designs face significant challenges achieving long range. The tiny mirrors in MEMS systems can only reflect so much light. That makes it inherently difficult to bounce a laser beam off a distant object and detect the return flash. The phased-array approach tends to produce beams that diverge more than other techniques, making it hard to achieve a combination of long range, high scanning resolution, and wide field of view. With flash lidar, the light from each flash is spread over the entire field of view, which means that only a fraction of the light strikes any particular point. And each pixel in the photodetector array is necessarily quite small, limiting the amount of returned light it can capture. ""Solid-state approaches are very challenging,"" Pacala told Ars. He argues that conventional spinning-lidar techniques have unique strengths that will continue to make them relevant for at least another decade—especially at the high end of the market. ""The vast majority of lidar systems will be solid state"" in 10 years, Pacala predicts. ""But there's probably still going to be some spinning lidar sensors that are really high performance and a great value."" Pacala drew an intriguing analogy to the hard drive market. Over the last 15 years or so, solid-state storage devices have become increasingly popular, especially in mobile devices. Yet there are still plenty of conventional hard drives with spinning magnetic platters being sold today. That design offers an unbeatable combination of high capacity and low cost. By the same token, Pacala envisions a future where low-end lidar units are mostly solid state designs, just as most mobile devices today have on-board solid-state storage. But for the most demanding applications—including self-driving cars—he anticipates a significant market for premium spinning lidars that offer long range, high resolution, and a broad field of view. Ouster is putting price pressure on Velodyne While Ouster is using the same basic technology approach as Velodyne, the company is offering transparent and aggressive pricing that could create a headache for the Velodyne. Ouster offers three models—a low-end 16-laser sensor called the OS-1 for $3,500, a 64-laser version of the OS-1 that costs $12,000, and a longer-range 64-laser unit called the OS-2 that costs $24,000. How does this compare with Velodyne's offerings? Velodyne sells its 16-laser ""puck"" lidar for $4,000, which is roughly comparable to Ouster's $3,500 16-laser model. But in an email conversation, I couldn't pin down Velodyne president Marta Hall on the price of Velodyne's more expensive models. As recently as last December, Forbes was reporting that Velodyne's venerable 64-laser model still cost $75,000, only slightly less than its $85,000 price a decade ago. When I asked Hall how the Velodyne's HDL-64E lidar compares to the 64-laser OS-1, price-wise, she responded: ""Velodyne's HDL-64E was developed ten years ago and since then Velodyne has made many improvements. Please compare Ouster's new Lidar product to Velodyne's new Lidar product, the VLS-128. At volume pricing it is $12,000 or less."" It's true that the VLS-128 has more impressive specs than the Ouster's OS-1. Velodyne's high-end unit has a long range that makes it more comparable to Ouster's OS-2, which costs $24,000. How much does one VLS-128 cost? Hall told Ars that it ""hasn’t been priced yet for single sales."" Is that $12,000 price available now for volume customers? She didn't respond. Ultimately, a lidar unit's single-unit price doesn't matter that much. The long-run goal for all of these lidar companies is to sell sensors in units of thousands or even millions for use in consumer vehicles. A carmaker buying lidar units in batches of 10,000 will obviously get a big discount from the single-unit price. But publishing a specific price for immediate delivery, as Ouster does, helps to establish credibility. We're sure Velodyne is going to make every effort to match Ouster's $12,000 price at some point in the future. But aiming to do it in the future isn't the same thing as being able to do it today. We got a similar response last month when we asked Austin Russell, CEO of the lidar startup Luminar, about pricing. He told us that ""for consumer vehicles, this type of stuff does need to get down to low single-digit thousands,"" and promised that this would be ""not an issue"" for Luminar. Reading between the lines, it sounds like Luminar's lidars are not priced in the ""low single-digit thousands""—and indeed might be a lot more than that today. Overall, my conversation with Ouster's Pacala made me less bullish about improvements in lidar costs. Prices are falling, as illustrated by Velodyne's 50 percent price cut for its 16-laser unit this year. And if you're willing to settle for a lidar with lower range and resolution, you can find units that cost a few thousand or even a few hundred dollars. But the best lidar units—and possibly the only ones that are suitable for fully driverless cars—still seem to cost tens of thousands of dollars. It's worth noting that one other major player in lidar technology is Waymo. The Alphabet subsidiary has been working on self-driving cars for almost a decade now, and they've shifted from using Velodyne units to their own home-grown lidar technology. The company is still using the same basic spinning-laser approach, but has reportedly figured out how to lower the cost of its lidar units by a factor of 10. It's hard to translate that into a specific price since we don't know what their original cost was, but it's safe to say that Waymo's units cost no more than $8,500—and possibly less. For companies not called Waymo, this may be a problem that solves itself. There's a natural tendency for complex products to fall in price as they are produced in higher volumes. Today the demand for lidar units is a tiny fraction of what it will be in five to 10 years when companies are rushing to expand their driverless taxi fleets. As lidar production expands, improved manufacturing techniques and economies of scale will inevitably make cheaper lidar possible.",We learned a lot talking to two-time lidar startup founder Angus Pacala.,2018-05-07T14:50:32Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Why bulky spinning lidar sensors might be around for another decade,https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/05/why-bulky-spinning-lidar-sensors-might-be-around-for-another-decade/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ouster-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,flash-flood,1
,"At a Glance Kirk has made a comeback as a tropical storm east of the Lesser Antilles. Tropical storm watches and warnings have been issued. Kirk will arrive in the Windward Islands on Thursday. Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides are the biggest danger. Kirk is then expected to be ripped apart by stronger wind shear in the Caribbean Sea this weekend. Tropical Storm Kirk is now quickly approaching the Lesser Antilles and will bring a threat of flooding rain, mudslides and some tropical-storm-force winds to parts of the Windward Islands beginning Thursday. The National Hurricane Center said convection had become better organized, prompting it to begin reissuing advisories on Tropical Storm Kirk. Kirk had lost its center of circulation Monday in the eastern Atlantic Ocean after first developing Saturday morning south of the Cabo Verde Islands. Data from the U.S. Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters indicated that Kirk has weakened again to a moderate tropical storm. Kirk is now located just over 150 miles east of Barbados, moving rather quickly west-northwestward. Tropical storm warnings have been posted for Barbados, St. Lucia, Dominica, Martinique and Guadeloupe, meaning tropical-storm-force winds (39-plus mph) are expected in these areas within 36 hours. Tropical storm watches are in effect for St. Vincent and the Grenadines, meaning tropical-storm-force winds are possible within 36 hours. (A watch is typically issued when tropical storm or hurricane conditions are possible within 48 hours. A warning is issued when those conditions are expected within 36 hours.) Forecast Steered by high pressure to the north, Kirk will arrive in the Windward Islands Thursday, first in Barbados, then in the rest of the Windward Islands covered by warnings. Little change in strength is anticipated before striking the Lesser Antilles. (INTERACTIVE: Kirk's Status, Forecast Path ) Current Storm Status and Projected Path (The red-shaded area denotes the potential path of the center of the tropical cyclone. It's important to note that impacts (particularly heavy rain, high surf, coastal flooding, winds) with any tropical cyclone usually spread beyond its forecast path.) The most serious threat from Kirk, however, will be from rainfall. Rainfall totals from 4 to 6 inches, with isolated totals up to 10 inches, are possible through Friday from Barbados and St. Lucia to Martinique, Dominica and Guadeloupe. Puerto Rico can expect 2 to 4 inches of rain as whatever is left of Kirk slides by to the south. This heavy rainfall over these mountainous islands will likely trigger life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides. (This should be interpreted as a broad outlook of where the heaviest rain may fall and may shift based on the forecast path of the tropical cyclone. Higher amounts may occur where bands of rain stall over a period of a few hours. ) Fortunately, Kirk is expected to encounter a formidable wall of wind shear the change in wind speed and/or direction with height in the Caribbean Sea this weekend. (MORE: Weird Aspects to the 2018 Atlantic Hurricane Season ) Current Satellite and Wind Shear (Areas of clouds are shown in white. Areas of strong wind shear, the difference in wind speed and direction with height, are shown in purple. High wind shear is hostile to mature tropical cyclones and those trying to develop.) This should eventually rip Kirk apart before it can threaten other areas of the Caribbean, as it did to Tropical Depression Eleven last weekend east of the Lesser Antilles. Just over three years ago, Tropical Storm Erika dumped up to a foot of rain in just 12 hours on Dominica, producing catastrophic flooding and mudslides, killing 30, damaging or destroying 271 homes and damaging roads, bridges and other infrastructure on the island, according to the National Hurricane Center's final report. Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit said Erika's damage set the nation's developmental progress back 20 years. A river overflows, affecting some homes along its banks, due to Tropical Storm Erika in Roseau, Dominica, Thursday, Aug. 27, 2015. Streets across Dominica turned into fast-flowing rivers that swept up cars as the storm pummeled the eastern Caribbean island. (AP Photo/Carlisle Jno Baptiste) The destruction Erika left behind was sufficient to prompt a committee of the World Meteorological Organization to retire the name Erika from use for future Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes. Erika was only the second name retired for an Atlantic tropical cyclone which never reached hurricane status since names were first retired in 1954. Allison in 2001 a multi-billion-dollar flood event in metro Houston was the only other tropical storm whose name was retired. Like Kirk, Erika fought wind shear through its life cycle, but rainfall potential of any tropical cyclone is not a function of the intensity of the storm. The rainfall flood threat from Kirk should be taken seriously.

Matthew S. Schwartz,"A massive spring storm is bringing blizzard conditions to several central U.S. states, leading officials to close hundreds of schools and hundreds of miles of roads.
NASA/NOAA GOES Project
Interstates were closed for hundreds of miles in the Midwest and Plains Thursday, as a ""bomb cyclone"" brought a major winter storm to states in those regions. Some towns that just days ago were experiencing sunshine and temperate weather are now under one or two feet of snow.
Most of Nebraska and South Dakota remained under a blizzard warning Thursday afternoon, as snow continued to cause dangerous conditions. Minnesota, Wisconsin and much of Michigan's Upper Peninsula face a winter storm warning. Eastern North Dakota is under a flood warning.
Parts of South Dakota have seen up to 18 inches of snow, and ""thunder snow"" snow that falls alongside the crash of thunder and the flash of lightning was also reported in the central part of the state. ""It's essentially a thunderstorm, but it's cold enough for snow,"" Mike Connelly, a weather service meteorologist, told the Associated Press.
Minnesota has faced snowfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour. Hundreds of schools canceled classes Thursday. More than 200 accidents were reported throughout the state. A video from the Minnesota Department of Transportation shows every power line down along a strength of Highway 59 near Fulda, in the southeastern side of the state.
In Minnesota, the bad weather will continue through Friday, with winds gusting more than to 50, according to the National Weather Service.
Some of the snow might be tinted orange, the Twin Cities NWS said. ""The color is likely due to dust that was blown by high winds all the way from west Texas.""
Whiteout conditions were reported Wednesday night northeast of Denver to the Nebraska state line, Colorado Public Radio reported. Some major roads were closed for hundreds of miles because of poor visibility and blowing snow. Colorado DOT closed 150 miles of Interstate 76, and Interstate 70 was closed between Kansas and the Denver metro area, CPR said.
In Nebraska, Interstate 80 and Highway 30 were closed on Thursday morning between Lexington and Wyoming a distance of about 200 miles.
AS NPR's Bill Chappell reported, ""the storm came ashore from the Pacific Ocean on Sunday and Monday, bringing heavy rainfall and floods to Oregon"" and leading to evacuations there.
Snow in April is ""certainly not unheard of"" in many of the areas hit by this blizzard, but ""this storm is a big one, and not just for April, but any time of year,"" said Ian Livingston, a forecaster at the Washington Post.",The springtime storm is bringing blizzard conditions to states throughout the Plains and Midwest.

CHRISTOPHER WEBER / AP,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The second in a string of powerful storms battered California on Saturday, bringing down trees, flooding roadways and prompting evacuations in wildfire burn areas where intense downpours could loosen bare hillsides and cause mudslides.
The system could bring 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain in some areas, 10-foot waves in the Pacific and several feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges.
A wind gust in Santa Barbara County topped 80 mph (128 kph) as the storm moved south. Wind and flash flood warnings were issued for the southern part of the state after being lifted in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Evacuations were ordered or recommended for many areas that were hit by wildfires in recent months. Authorities fear that an inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain an hour could send fire debris, mud and boulders sluicing down denuded hillsides.
In Malibu, where the Woolsey fire last year destroyed many homes, residents barricaded their properties with sandbags.
In the Holy Jim fire area southeast of Los Angeles, where an August blaze scoured tens of thousands of acres in the Cleveland National Forest, volunteers using heavy equipment removed debris and deepened a creek bed to help prevent flooding.
“In the last two days we’ve been able to move 19 dump trucks worth of debris from the creek bed and reinforce some of the walls here,” Keith Kothlow of Team Rubicon, a veteran-led disaster response organization, told KABC-TV.
Santa Barbara County ordered evacuations of residents in designated debris-flow risk areas near the Thomas, Whittier and Sherpa fire scars. Nearby residents were urged to also consider leaving.
It has only been a little over a year since a downpour on the huge Thomas Fire burn scar unleashed a massive debris flow that destroyed or damaged hundreds of homes in the seaside community of Montecito. The disaster killed 21 people, and two others have never been found.
The National Park Service warned visitors to Yosemite of possible road closures and strongly advised drivers to bring tire chains in the event of snow or icy conditions.
Winter storm warnings were in place for the Sierra Nevada along with avalanche warnings on the Nevada side of the range. The Sierra is already loaded with snow from a series of storms in January. The weather service said areas could see accumulations of up to 10 feet (3 meters) over the next few days as a series of storms blew through.
Numerous areas of the state were under warnings for high winds.
The weather service lifted flash-flood watches for areas burned by the Mendocino Complex, Camp and Carr wildfires in Northern California.
Two cold weather systems will follow on Sunday and Monday, bringing additional widespread showers and snow, forecasters said.

(Photo: ERIC CABANIS, AFP/Getty Images) PARIS Flash floods tore through towns in southwest France, turning waterways into raging torrents that killed at least 13 people, nine of them in just one town, authorities said Monday. People had to be helicoptered to safety from the roofs of their homes as overnight storms dumped the equivalent of several months of rain in just a few hours. Worst hit was the town of Trebes, east of the medieval walled city of Carcassonne. The rains that swept in from the Mediterranean killed nine people there, Interior Ministry spokesman Frederic de Lanouvelle said. He told BFMTV that the floods in the Aude region also killed four other people in other locations, left one person missing and seriously injured five others. In the town of Villegailhenc, witness Ines Siguet said the waters rose so quickly that people were stranded on the roofs of their homes and had to be helicoptered to safety. She posted video of a ripped-up road where a bridge used to be, torn away by a flood torrent that cut the town in half. Theres nothing left. Theres just a hole, the 17-year-old resident told The Associated Press. It was very violent. Other roads also were flooded, leaving the town cut off, she said. Siguets school was shut down amid the destruction. Two people were killed in the town, according to the Aude regional government. Alain Thirion, the prefect of Aude, said some of the dead appeared to have been swept away by floodwaters. In the town of Conques-sur-Orbiel, the river rose by more than six meters (20 feet), he said.

Television images showed waters coursing through towns and villages, with cars stranded in the floods and piled up on top of each other like childrens toys. The French government rushed hundreds of rescue workers into the flood zone and helicopters buzzed overhead. Schools were closed and authorities were urging people to stay home.

Reuters,"Mexican presidential candidates pose for a group photo during their third and final debate in Merida. Thomson Reuters MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The website of a Mexican political opposition party was hit by a cyber attack during Tuesday's final television debate between presidential candidates ahead of the July 1 vote, after the site had published documents critical of the leading candidate. The National Action Party (PAN) said that its website, targeting front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, likely suffered a distributed denial of service (DDoS) cyber attack with the bulk of traffic to the site nominally coming from Russia and China. Lopez Obrador's Morena party said it had nothing to do with the outage. The Chinese and Russian embassies in Mexico did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters could not confirm the PAN's account of the attack. Although there have been no clear signs of foreign meddling in Mexican campaigns, a US probe into possible Russian interference in the 2016 US election has made Mexicans watchful for possible foreign virtual attacks that could muddy the country's biggest-ever election. US officials have said there were signs of Russian meddling in the Mexican presidential campaign. However, the countries where the traffic to the PAN site were generated could be entirely unrelated to the true source and the attack could be intended to create confusion, cyber-security experts said. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador poses for a selfie with a supporter after a campaign rally in Patzcuaro, Michoacan state, Mexico, May 31, 2018. REUTERS/Alan Ortega Cyber experts said they did not know who was behind the attack, but pointed out that it could have been done by hackers for hire working on behalf of somebody looking to prevent people from accessing the PAN website. ""These could be third-parties offering services-for-hire, proxies or a politically motivated group,"" said Carles Lopez-Penalver, an analyst at cyber security firm Flashpoint. Barrett Lyon, a security solutions executive at US telecommunications firm Neustar, agreed, saying the computers in Russia and China that apparently generated the visits could have been hacked. The site crashed during Tuesday's televised presidential debate, the PAN said, shortly after its candidate Ricardo Anaya brandished a black-and-white placard with the site address. It remained down for hours. The coalition leader, second in most polls, said the site would offer evidence that Lopez Obrador had awarded contracts without public tenders when he was Mexico City mayor. Lopez Obrador denied any wrongdoing. Ricardo Anaya, presidential candidate for the National Action Party (PAN), who leads a left-right coalition, at a rally in Huixquilucan, outside Mexico City, January 20, 2018. Thomson Reuters ""On this website, 185,000 visits were registered within 15 minutes, with the attacks coming mainly from Russia and China,"" PAN said in a statement, citing information from web security firm Cloudflare and Google Analytics. Cloudflare said in a statement that its clients can typically access data showing the locations of site visitors, but declined to comment on Tuesday's incident. The PAN's secretary, Damian Zepeda, suggested Lopez Obrador, known as AMLO, was behind the attack using fake ""robot"" accounts. ""The AMLO bots have been activated to try to crash the page debate2018.mx where there are proofs of contracts worth millions given to AMLO's friend,"" Zepeda wrote on Twitter. Juan Pablo Espinosa de los Monteros, coordinator for the promotional arm of Lopez Obrador's campaign, dismissed suggestions the leftist had backed a bot operation. ""We don't use them,"" Espinosa de los Monteros told Reuters on Wednesday, saying the campaign instead focuses on reaching undecided voters. Lopez Obrador has laughed off suggestions of Russian ties, jokingly calling himself ""Andres Manuelovich."" Like a virtual flash mob, cyber attackers can flood a particular site with thousands of information requests at once, overwhelming capacity and forcing a site to crash.

In the East, the fourth nor'easter of the month will unleash rain, snow, ice and wind across the Ohio Valley, the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Meanwhile, portions of California will see heavy rain, potentially leading to flash floods and mudslides. The heaviest snowfall in the eastern storm will occur across the higher elevations of the Appalachians and into portions of New Jersey, the New York City metropolitan region and southern New England, the National Weather Service said. AccuWeather meteorologist Rich Putnam said that residents from just north of Baltimore to Philadelphia, New York City and close to Boston could easily pick up 6-12 inches of snow, with locally higher amounts possible. Some spots could see up to 18 inches. Airline delays are likely due to deicing operations, poor visibility and a low cloud ceiling. A number of flights may also be canceled, AccuWeather said. A full-fledged blizzard is not expected. Winds will not be as strong as prior nor'easters, AccuWeather said, so coastal flooding will not be as much of an issue. Still, widespread power outages are possible. Officials are cautioning against unnecessary travel Wednesday afternoon and evening, when snow could be falling at a rate of as much as 4 inches per hour. It’s not yet clear where the heaviest snow bands may develop.

The storm will likely dump several inches of rain ton the coastal areas and inland through Thursday. Flash flooding is a concern given recent burn scars from wildfires near the Los Angeles area, the weather service said. Flash flood watches have been posted for areas burned by wildfires last year. Santa Barbara County issued a mandatory evacuation order Monday affecting about 30,000 people, including the community of Montecito, where 21 people were killed by a massive mudslide in January. “There’s a tremendous amount of moisture coming up out of the Pacific,” weather service meteorologist Mark Jackson said, adding that the key to the storm will be its lengthy duration. More: Severe weather spawns tornadoes across the South, rips off roofs in Alabama Heavy rain and possible flooding will also hit low elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Locations higher than 8,000 feet should see very heavy snow, welcome news for the state's snowpack that supplies millions of Californians with water later in the year.

"USA TODAY, John Bacon and Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","Floodwaters took over Spring Street in Tremont, Pennsylvania during a flash flood watch. USA TODAY Floodwater covers North Tulpehocken Street in Pine Grove, Pa., Monday, July 23, 2018, after rain passed through the area. (Photo: David McKeown, AP) Heavy rains were slamming much of the Northeast for a fourth straight day Tuesday, swelling rivers and creeks, flooding roads and forcing emergency declarations. The storms are far from over. And although a reprieve is forecast for the weekend, next week could bring more misery. ""A stubborn upper trough and wealth of tropical moisture will continue to impact the East with heavy rain and flash flooding through mid-week,"" the National Weather Service warned. Paul Walker, a senior meteorologist for AccuWeather, said a smattering of daily and monthly record rainfall totals are likely as the storms roll through the region. He blamed a large high-pressure system for bringing tropical moisture up to North Carolina and Virginia all the way through New York state. He said some areas, already sodden with days of rain, could see as much as five or six inches Tuesday, with another blast Wednesday. But Thursday could see the foul weather slide east, bringing relief for the weekend. More: At least 10 million at risk from life-threatening floods to East Coast More: Rising temperatures from climate change linked to rise in suicides Parts of Pennsylvania were among the hardest hit areas. Some evacuations were reported near Harrisburg, the National Weather Service said. And the town of Tremont, 110 miles northeast of Philadelphia, saw rivers of water rushing through its streets late Monday. ""I am asking all of the community to assist each other in this emergency natural disaster we are facing,"" Mayor Ricky Ney said. ""Our local emergency crews, local police department, and streets crews are working as fast as they can. Please have respect for your neighbors and help out."" Thirty-five miles to the south, tourist destinations Hersheypark and ZooAmerica were forced to close Monday ""due to the excessive rainfall over the past three days and localized flooding."" Hersheypark planned to reopen Tuesday, weather permitting; ZooAmerica remained closed. The heavy rains Monday and Tuesday came following a weekend that saw record-setting rainfall trigger flash flooding in Virginia and Maryland, stranding vehicles and forcing water rescues and road closures. Saturday was one of the wettest July days ever recorded in Washington and Baltimore. Walker said a weekend reprieve was forecast. Then, more rain. ""Unfortunately, looking long range, this pattern may reset itself next Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. More of same,"" Walker said. ""Just what everybody wants to hear.""

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lokoja, where the Niger and Benue rivers meet Heavy seasonal rains are a regular feature of life in Nigeria and towns close to the country's main rivers are particularly vulnerable. This year floods have killed at least 100 people with many thousands displaced, according to the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). A state of emergency has been declared in four of the worst-hit states: President Muhammadu Buhari has pledged $8.2m (£6.2m) for relief efforts. The NEMA has activated five local operation centres to coordinate emergency responses. Flooding regularly wreaks havoc in Nigeria: In 2017, floods affected 250,000 people in the eastern-central region In 2016, 92,000 were displaced and 38 died In 2015, more than 100,000 were displaced, with 53 deaths In 2012, devastating flooding forced two million Nigerians from their homes and 363 died, according to authorities ""Floods have become a perennial challenge with increasing intensity each year, leaving colossal losses and trauma,"" the Nigerian Meteorological Agency says. So why does Nigeria keep flooding, and is it getting worse? Affected areas Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Flooding near Kaduna River Nigeria hosts two of West Africa's great rivers: the Niger which enters the country from the north-west the Benue, which flows into Nigeria from its eastern neighbour Cameroon These two immense waterways meet in central Nigeria and then flow south as a single river on to the Atlantic Ocean. Much, though by no means all, of Nigeria's flooding occurs along these two rivers as their banks overflow in the rainy season. In 2012, hundreds of thousands of acres of land were flooded in Nigeria when the Benue and Niger over-spilled. That year, the Niger River reached a record-high level of 12.84m (42ft). In 2018, levels reached 11.06m, with fears that the heavy rain, expected to continue through October this year, could lead it to approach similar heights. There has also been extensive damage to farmlands, according ACAPS, a humanitarian data-analysis organisation, which is the mainstay of most livelihoods in the affected regions. Flooding is also caused by: the tidal movements of coastal waters, such as in the Delta region of the south-east saturated drainage systems, such as in the country's largest city, Lagos, in the south-west Are Nigeria's rains causing the floods? Heavy rainfall has certainly increased the likelihood of rivers overflowing and flash floods. And there's evidence to suggest increasing rainfall over time. Data from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency from 1981-2017, analysing 13 affected locations, reveals a rising trend in annual rainfall, which it says is likely to be a significant factor responsible for floods. But it's not just rain falling in Nigeria itself. Heavy precipitation upstream on the Benue and Niger rivers - in Cameroon, Mali and the country of Niger - contributes large volumes of water to Nigeria's river system, according to Zahrah Musa at the IHE Delft Institute for Water Education. Troublesome dams Another factor in Nigeria's flood problem are dams. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kainji dam Nigeria's three main electricity-generating dams, at Kainji and Jebba on the Niger river and the Shiroro dam on the Kaduna River, ""have become bloated"" by the heavy rains and excess water has had to be released downstream over the past month, says Hussaini Ibrahim, of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA). The uncompleted Zungeru dam, in Niger state, which is part-funded by the Chinese government, is also believed to be affecting areas once free from flooding. On the Benue River, the main concern is the Lagdo Dam, in neighbouring Cameroon, which has previously caused the river to swell by releasing water. In 2012, water flowing in from the Lagdo dam was blamed for 30 deaths in Nigeria. The Cameroonian authorities have yet to allow water to pour out from Lagdo during the current rainy season - but there are concerns in Nigeria that this might happen. Poor town planning Nigeria's population is expanding rapidly, currently estimated at 186 million, and the lack of proper town planning can make flooding worse in urban areas. ""Town planning in Nigeria is very weak,"" says Aliyu Salisu Barau, of Bayero University. ""These areas are affected by a lack of drainage networks."" The city of Lokoja, for example, at the meeting-point of Benue and Niger rivers, is particularly prone to flooding. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A man in a town near Lokoja, a heavily flooded area ""If you go to Lokoja, you see massive developments along the Niger River,"" says Mr Barau. These developments are almost always unregulated, with people building on floodplains, reducing the surface areas for water to travel, and without constructing drainage systems. Because of the unregulated nature of town planning, there's also limited information on how much land has been built on and therefore little assessment of the impact. In the city of Makurdi, for example, on the Benue river, Mr Barau says, ""one can see all forms of informal activities"" along the river bank. New land developments along the Niger River has more than doubled in Nassarwa and Kogi States, according to estimates. The dumping of waste in the streets can also prevent the steady flow of water and put pressure on the few urban drainage systems. It's also common, after the floods, for people to come back and start rebuilding in the same vulnerable areas. Hussaini Ibrahim, of the NSEMA, also points the finger at deforestation, which he says is happening across Nigeria. It's a resource that people use for fuel or to sell - but trees play an important role in storing rain-waters. Future floods If the impact of flooding is to be reduced in the future, the consequences of rapid urbanisation and poor urban planning need to be addressed. And greater co-operation with Nigeria's neighbours in the control of river levels will need to be achieved in order to avoid dangerous surges in water levels during the periods of heavy rain. The wider issue of the increasing rainfall levels identified by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency is one that some in Nigeria have attributed to climate change.",An estimated 100 people have died in floods.

The major storm is weakening Wednesday morning as it moves into the Rockies with lots of wind and some snow.
Our attention moves east as this western storm combines with a southern storm to bring heavy rain and severe weather from Florida to Maine.
Flood watches have been issued in Florida and Georgia as well as the mid-Atlantic on Wednesday.
Flood watches have already been issued for eight states from Florida to New Jersey.
The southern storm will move north from the Gulf Coast into the Tennessee River Valley and bring heavy rain from the Gulf Coast to the Carolinas.
The storm in the south will combine with one from the west to deliver rain to much of the eastern U.S. beginning on Thursday.
By Friday, the southern storm will finally join the western storm and strengthen enough to bring severe storms from Florida to the Carolinas.
These severe storms will produce damaging winds, hail and a few tornadoes. River flooding and flash flooding are possible along the entire East Coast.
Heavy rain will spread into the I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C., to Boston and into Maine.
Heavy rain will fall along the entire East Coast on Friday.

In the 24-hour period ending Friday morning, Ben Lomond was the top rain catcher, recording 2.7 inches of precipitation, according to the National Weather Service. San Jose collected 0.21 inches, while the Oakland Hills saw as much as 1.36 inches and San Francisco tallied 0.71 inches in the one-day frame. The storm is expected to ease up starting Saturday — though some Bay Area cities could see morning showers — but rains are forecast to return Tuesday. Check out the 24h rainfall totals across the area. Mountains have seen the most but some Bay Area stations and valley spots have picked up 0.5 to 1+ inch of rain.

But new hazards accompanied the current storm: The National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for the burn scar areas of the Camp Fire and earlier Carr, Delta and Mendocino fires. The rains 4 to 6 inches were expected in Paradise through Saturday could spawn ash, mud and debris flows. The area received more rain yesterday and last night. Here are very preliminary values from the last 2 days. Rain will continue most areas today and decrease this afternoon. Area burn scars will continue to be at risk for mud/debris flows. pic.twitter.com/W61QdyXXWd — NWS Sacramento (@NWSSacramento) November 23, 2018 Chico recorded 0.91 inches of rain on Thursday alone.

DANIEL MANZO,"Heavy rain stretches stretches from eastern Texas all the way to New Jersey early Sunday as moisture interacts with a stationary front lingering in the southern U.S. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Heavy rain dropped nearly 5 inches of rain in western Virginia and eastern West Virginia overnight causing numerous reports of flash flooding in the region. Flood alerts are still in effect Sunday for parts of the Southern Plains and Ohio Valley. Flood alerts are in place in the Southern Plains and eastern Kentucky and West Virginia. Widespread strong thunderstorms with heavy rain will develop in much of the Mississippi River and Ohio valleys, eventually spreading into parts of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast by late Sunday and into Monday. Locally, 3 to 5 inches of rain is expected in parts of the Mississippi River Valley through Tuesday, especially from Paducah, Kentucky, to Memphis, Tennessee. There is a chance of some flash flooding in the region through Monday night. Rain will be scattered across the eastern U.S. on Monday night. Parts of the I-70 corridor from Indianapolis to Pittsburgh could see 2 to 3 inches of rain. Localized flash flooding is possible there. On Tuesday, a cold front will finally kick a lot of this unsettled weather eastward, but it will first bring a chance for severe storms to parts of the Midwest. Damaging winds and large hail are the main threats. Rainfall totals could be as much as 3 or 4 inches locally, especially in western Tennessee and Kentucky, through Tuesday. Temperatures dipping Meanwhile, north of the unsettled weather, the cooler air is beginning to spill into northern parts of the U.S. The jet stream is dipping south, allowing the coolest morning temperatures in four to five months for some areas. Low temperatures on Sunday morning will be in the 40s from North Dakota to Maine. Cool temperatures will move into the Northern Plains and Midwest over the week ahead. Temperatures will rebound over the next few days, but another shot of cool air is in the forecast for the end of the week in the Northern Plains and upper Midwest. There is a chance that some of that region could see below-freezing temperatures by the end of the week. All of this is wonderfully on time with the arrival of astronomical fall. No concern yet for Kirk There are still a number of areas that are being monitored in the Atlantic, however, none of them will have an immediate impact to land. Tropical Storm Kirk formed Saturday, Sept. 22, 2018, and continues to move westward. Tropical Storm Kirk, which formed Saturday, has winds of 40 mph and is moving west at 18 mph as of Sunday morning. The storm is located approximately 465 miles south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. The storm will pick up speed over the next few days and likely will strengthen as it moves westward. However, by the middle and end of the week, Kirk will begin to weaken. The current forecast track has Kirk reaching the Lesser Antilles late this week as a weakening Tropical Storm. However, there is a possibility that Kirk will not be able to maintain tropical organization before approaching the Islands.

The USA's weather isn't going quietly into the new year, thanks to a pair of blizzards and a widespread flood threat.
One snowstorm is bringing blizzard conditions to portions of the northern Plains and Upper Midwest and a second is spreading heavy snow from Arizona to the Texas Panhandle.
Meanwhile, drenching rain on the waterlogged southern and eastern United States has prompted flood watches and warnings that are affecting 50 million people. 
At least three deaths have been blamed on the weather over the past couple of days, two in traffic accidents in the central United States and one from a fallen tree in Louisiana. 
Along the nation's northern tier, the National Weather Service forecast more snow from central Minnesota to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and also northern New England on Friday. 
Blizzard warnings remained in effect for parts of South Dakota while winter storm warnings were in effect in Minnesota and Michigan. So far, McGregor, Minnesota, reported 19.2 inches of snow, the highest total so far, according to the weather service.
Although the Weather Channel has named the storm Winter Storm Eboni, no other private weather group, or the federal government, uses that name.
The second winter storm, hitting parts of the Southwest, is expected to continue through Saturday afternoon. Snowfall is forecast to spread from southern Colorado through eastern Arizona, New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle.
Last SlideNext Slide
The heaviest snowfall is likely in central and eastern New Mexico, without up to 2 feet in the highest terrain. The weather service said strong winds will accompany the snowfall, prompting blizzard warnings in central New Mexico, which includes the Albuquerque metro area. 
Temperatures were forecast to plunge as the storm moves across the area. Actual temperatures will fall into the 20s, teens and single digits in some areas. Because of the wind, the temperatures will feel like below zero, AccuWeather said.
The National Weather Services Storm Prediction Center had an Enhanced Risk of severe weather in Texas on Wednesday, Dec 26th.

Drenching rain and flooding not snow were the threats in the southeastern and eastern U.S. Friday.
As of Friday morning, almost 50 million people were under flood watches. The weather service said that widespread rainfall, heavy at times, will continue to spread north and eastward from the Lower Mississippi Valley/Southeast into the Mid-Atlantic. Flooding and flash flooding will be a threat throughout Friday.
Drenching rain soaked the Southeast on Thursday. Portions of Mississippi picked up nearly a foot of rain, leading to flash floods. 
The severe weather turned deadly late Wednesday in Louisiana, where a woman was killed when a tree fell through her camper in the town of Ponchatoula.

Laignee Barron,"As monsoon rains bare down on sprawling Rohingya camps in Bangladesh, the U.N. warns that some 200,000 refugees sheltering on the swampland are at risk from landslides and flooding. Half of those threatened by the rising waters and requiring relocation are children. The first rain of the season poured over the Cox’s Bazar camps and informal settlements last week, inundating most roads. One child reportedly died in a landslide, according to a statement from the U.N. Children’s Fund (UNICEF). UNICEF estimates 900 shelters and 200 latrines were either damaged or destroyed. That toll is only expected to grow as the next few months of torrential rains and high winds lash into the tent city, which is precariously perched on landslide-prone hills denuded of trees or in flood-prone lowlands. After peak monsoon season subsides in August, cyclone season begins. Read More: Myanmar’s Crisis, Bangladesh’s Burden: Among the Rohingya Refugees Waiting for a Miracle Over 700,000 Muslim Rohingya have sought refuge in Bangladesh after the Myanmar military retaliated against alleged insurgent attacks last August, in an operation a U.N. rights investigator described as having “all the hallmarks of genocide.” These refugees joined 213,000 others who arrived in earlier waves of displacement. Already uprooted and traumatized, the families are now “defenseless against the elements,” according to UNICEF. “Thousands of children and their families are living in shelters on hilly areas with no trees, rocks or shrubs to hold sandy ground — much of which has now turned into mud — as the rains continue and the water table rises rapidly,” said Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF representative in Bangladesh. “It’s vital that refugees in the most vulnerable locations are able to move to safer locations, but many families – who have already faced upheavals several times over the last few months – are reluctant to abandon their makeshift homes.” Read More: Championing Rohingya Rights in Myanmar Cost Me 12 Years in Prison.

"USA TODAY, Christal Hayes, USA TODAY","It's deja vu for the small Maryland community in Ellicott City where devastating flash flooding has struck again, just two years after raging floods decimated the town and killed two people. USA TODAY Water rushes through Main Street in Ellicott City, Md., May 27, 2018. (Photo: Libby Solomon, The Baltimore Sun via AP) ELLICOTT CITY, Md. — Dave Callaway tried to retain his anger, frustration and sadness watching crews pile his belongings into a dumpster. It was the second time in two years he'd been forced to trash sofas, rugs and furniture because of floodwaters that crept into his Main Street home. He's watched roads turn into rivers and the rapids wreak havoc and destroy homes and businesses throughout the quaint historic mill town. And he's watched the slow pace of government officials over the years that have yet to solve the community's reoccurring flooding issues that allowed for two ""1-in-1,000-year"" rain events in two years. Local leaders have long known that storms could leave the city, which sits at the bottom of a valley, in shambles. But critics say very little over the years has been done to take on the threat head-on, even though study after study has offered both warnings of disaster and possible solutions. At the heart of the issue is a complicated web of changing threats, inadequate and expensive solutions and red tape that have left many in the town feeling they must fend for themselves to solve the town’s flooding problems or leave before they’re hit again. ""They say they care, they say they'll look at it, but how long do we have to wait to fix this?"" Callaway said. ""People are dying. People are losing everything they own. I can't do this again."" Leaders in Howard County crafted a thorough plan in the aftermath of the 2016 flooding disaster and say large changes to mitigate a flood simply can't happen overnight even though they're moving quickly. But, the downtown area, which is woven with three different rivers, isn't a stranger to flooding and numerous reports over the years, including as far back as the 1970s, have warned that Ellicott City, in particular, was in danger and a flood could devastate the area. Historically, the flood threat to Ellicott City has been from the Patapsco River overflowing. The water moves up Main Street, which was built on a hill and encompasses many of the city’s historic buildings and businesses. It happened multiple times in the 1970s, allowing a river to form throughout the community, a similar scene to what the area looked like on Sunday. More recently, the threat has changed. Water is moving down the valleys and hitting the city hard, almost acting as a bowl to catch all the rain. When Tropical Storm Lee passed through the area in 2011, homes were pummeled due to the changing threat. But little was done after. “To look in hindsight is always interesting. But when we looked at that storm, we saw it as an anomaly,” said Mark DeLuca, the deputy director of public works in Howard County. More: 'No words to describe the devastation' after Ellicott City flooding in Maryland More: In flood-hammered Ellicott City, Md., the question lingers: Do you rebuild once more? DeLuca said after the flood, Howard County commissioned a study that pointed to blocked water channels as one of the primary reasons for flooding. Another study found that the walls along streams that wind through the city needed repairs and wouldn’t hold up against heavy floods. Other studies identified solutions to the threat: The clearest way to help mitigate flooding was through retention ponds. The county rejected the plans because of the high expense and low reward since the fixtures wouldn't be a cure-all for the floods, especially for intense storms like what the area saw on Sunday. The county reversed its decision after the 2016 floods. Four stormwater retention facilities are in the progress of being planned and constructed. Last Slide Next Slide ""It’s study after study after study. That’s all they do is conduct studies,"" said Ron Peters, a property owner who works on a citizen flood group with Howard County. ""It’s just another way for them to not actually do anything."" USA TODAY read through about eight studies and reports on flooding in Howard County dating back to 1976. All highlighted Ellicott City as a high-risk threat for floods. Many offer different solutions, some of which the county implemented. But all of the posed solutions wouldn't completely fix the community's problems since much of it is centers on old structures that don't have to meet current standards for storm water management, such as retention ponds that could absorb rain.

Before, many property owners said they would have been forced to pay for upgrades out of pocket, which many could not afford. ""The county had a chance to take on and try and fix a lot of this after 2011. All of these things could have been implemented then but I don't really think the threat was taken seriously,"" Lori Lilly, another volunteer on the county's flood water group. Lilly said the measures taken up after 2016, while helpful, are coming too late. Disaster struck. Then struck again.

ABC News,"The major storm system that brought flash flooding and a record-breaking blizzard is moving east Sunday morning. The storm will bring another round of severe weather for nearly the entire Southeast -- including several tornadoes -- and will spread more snow and ice from Minnesota to Maine through Monday. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Additionally, very heavy rain is heading to the Northeast for Monday morning when flooding is possible. So far there have been 18 reported tornadoes in five states across the South since the outbreak began. There have been over 290 reports of severe weather from Texas to Wisconsin to Alabama. The storm spreads from Minneapolis south to Pensacola, Florida, on Sunday morning. Heavy snow is still falling Sunday morning across parts of the upper Midwest with 1 to 2 inch per hour snowfall accumulation being reported. An icy mix is now extending across Michigan and into parts of New England. An ice storm warning has been issued for western New York state. In the South, a tornado watch remains in effect for parts of Florida, southern Georgia and southwest Alabama Sunday morning as a line of storm moves through that region. Very heavy rain is falling with this line of storms, including rainfall rates up to 3 inches per hour. The radar is estimating that 7 to 10 inches of rain has fallen near Mobile, Alabama. Therefore, the flood risk continues this morning along parts of the Gulf Coast. Tornadoes pose a threat to the Southeast coast on Sunday. While the storms are losing their intensity, they will strengthen later Sunday as they head toward the Southeast coast. Storms are expected to be widespread from Florida to Virginia. A slight risk for severe weather has been issued from Miami to Roanoke, Virginia, with the threat being damaging winds, large hail and a few tornadoes. Damaging winds, hail and tornadoes are possible along the Southeast coast on Sunday. The tornado threat is locally enhanced in parts of the interior Carolinas and southern Virginia -- including Charlotte and Winston-Salem. A few tornadoes are likely in this highly populated area of the country and the impacts from severe storms could be notable. The Carolinas and Virginia will be most at risk for tornadoes on Sunday. The slow-moving nature of the storms will also re-ignite a flash flood risk across nearly the entire Southeast coast -- with rainfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour likely. Ice, rain in Northeast Dangerous blizzard conditions caused a travel nightmare in parts of Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin on Saturday with multiple counties having to ban travel altogether due to whiteout conditions. Minnesota State Police reported on Saturday night there had been over 400 crashes, 738 spinouts and 16 jackknifed semis. The snow fell so fast on Saturday that motorists all over the region became stranded due to rapidly accumulating snow. With 13.7 inches of snow in Sioux Falls, it is now the snowiest April day on record, and also has pushed April 2018 into the snowiest April on record. Snow and ice pose a threat to the northern U.S. and Great Lakes on Sunday. The storm will move to the east Sunday and Monday spreading snow and ice from Minnesota to Maine. The heaviest snow will move into Wisconsin and Michigan on Sunday. On Sunday and early Monday, rounds of an icy mix are expected to stretch into parts of the interior Northeast. Sleet and freezing rain are expected from Buffalo to Boston. Travel will be treacherous in upstate New York -- especially near Buffalo and Syracuse -- due to icy roads. Icy roads are expected in parts of New England through Monday morning. Locally, half an inch of ice is expected. Heavy rain is likely in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York City on Monday. On the warmer side of this system, heavy rain and isolated strong thunderstorms will move over the Appalachians on Sunday and could bring flash flooding from Pittsburgh to Asheville, North Carolina. Then on Monday morning, the heavy rain will hit New York City and Philadelphia. Localized flash flooding is possible. Some isolated gusty thunderstorms will also be possible with a line of storms from Washington, D.C. to New York late Sunday into Monday. Another temperature drop After reaching the upper 70s on Saturday and 80s on Friday, the wind chill in New York City on Sunday morning is 40 to 50 degrees colder. Wind chill readings will be 30 degrees colder on Monday morning than it was Saturday across the Northeast. Behind the major storm, temperatures are plummeting in yet another return to winter.

Heat index values close to, or in excess of, 100 degrees are possible from Texas to Michigan, including Dallas; Little Rock, Arkansas; Memphis, Tennessee; St. Louis, Chicago and Detroit. The heat index will be over 100 degrees from Wisconsin south to Louisiana on Sunday. On Monday, the heat expands to the east with heat index values nearing or exceeding 100 degrees again for much of the Midwest, including Kansas City, Indianapolis and Detroit. Parts of the Northeast will also get quite warm, with heat index values in the upper 90s in New York and Philadelphia. In the mid-Atlantic, heat index values near or above 100 are possible from South Carolina to Maryland. The heat will spread to the East Coast on Monday, and possibly brings record highs with it. Heat advisories are in effect from northern Arkansas to southern Michigan and excessive heat warnings are in effect in St. Louis, Chicago and Minneapolis. These heat index values can become dangerous. This stretch of heat shows little relief at night, especially in many of the urban areas, such as Chicago and New York. Excessive heat warnings and heat advisories are in place on Sunday for parts of Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Arkansas and all of Illinois. Severe threat in Northern Plains Slow-moving, strong thunderstorms dumped very heavy rainfall overnight in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. There have been reports of over 3 inches per hour just south of Duluth, Minnesota. Radar estimates from the region show possible rainfall totals exceeding 6 inches since late Saturday night. The National Weather Service in Duluth relayed reports of numerous roads washed out in the region due to flash flooding. Flash flood watches have been posted for parts of the region through Sunday due to the threat of strong thunderstorms. Severe weather is moving across the Northern Plains on Sunday. Numerous strong to severe thunderstorms will develop again Sunday from Colorado to northern Michigan. These storms will once again have the potential to dump very heavy rain and bring strong gusty winds, large hail and brief tornadoes. There is a slight risk for severe weather Sunday from eastern Nebraska to northern Michigan, an area that includes Minneapolis. A slight risk for severe weather exists across northeast Nebraska, northern Iowa and northern Wisconsin on Sunday. Locally, 2 to 3 inches of rainfall is expected in this region by Monday evening, with pockets of flash flooding possible.

Even though development is not likely, this tropical wave will gradually move toward Texas and northern Mexico over the next few days. The system will bring numerous rounds of heavy downpours and thunderstorms to the region during the upcoming work week. Over the course of the next three to four days, there is increasing potential for rainfall totals to exceed 4 to 6 inches in parts of southern Texas, including Brownsville, Corpus Christi and Port Lavaca. Heavy rain will move onto the Texas coast on Tuesday morning. There is some computer guidance suggesting rainfall totals could be higher than what is currently forecast.

Anna Mehler Paperny,"WILSON, N.C. (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Florence was likely to weaken on Sunday as it swept through the Carolinas but dozens of communities are devastated and “epic” amounts of rain could still fall, officials said. The storm is expected to become a Tropical Depression as it trudged inland early Sunday, knocking out power and causing at least eight deaths as flood waters kept rising. North Carolina officials have reported at least seven storm-related fatalities with unconfirmed reports of a further three deaths. South Carolina authorities reported one death. “This is still a catastrophic, life threatening storm,” said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Center’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. Winds have dropped to about 40 miles per hour (65 kph) since it roared ashore along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast on Friday as a hurricane and it is crawling west over two states at 6 mph (9 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said early Sunday. Taylor said the storm already dumped 30 inches of rain on some parts of the N.C. “This storm is still deadly and dangerous and it’s expected to turn northward later today into Virginia and the mid-Atlantic,” he said. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said: “This system is unloading epic amounts of rainfall, in some places measured in feet and not inches.” Rivers will continue to rise days after the rain has stopped, he said. Around 50 stranded people were airlifted by helicopter in North Carolina, said Petty Officer Michael Himes of the U.S. Coast Guard. More than 26,000 hunkered down in shelters. Roads were closed and authorities warned of landslides, tornadoes and flash floods, with dams and bridges in peril as rivers and creeks swelled. As of Saturday, about 676,000 homes and businesses were without power in North Carolina, along with 119,000 in South Carolina. The White House said President Donald Trump approved making federal funding available in some affected counties. Trump, who plans to visit the region next week and he tweeted his “deepest sympathies and warmth” to the families and friends of those who had lost their lives. WORST YET TO COME Florence was drifting westward over South Carolina, reaching about 25 miles southeast of Columbia S.C. at 2 a.m. Sunday, the NHC said. Up to 40 inches (102 cm) of rain are expected along coastal areas of the Carolinas and up to 10 inches in southwestern Virginia, it said. In Fayetteville, a North Carolina city of about 210,000 people about 90 miles inland, authorities told thousands of residents near the Cape Fear River and Little River to get out of their homes by Sunday afternoon because of the flood risk. “If you are refusing to leave during this mandatory evacuation, you need to do things like notify your legal next of kin because the loss of life is very, very possible,” Mayor Mitch Colvin said at a news conference. “The worst is yet to come,” he added. The storm made landfall on Friday near Wilmington, a city of about 120,000 squeezed between North Carolina’s Atlantic coastline and the Cape Fear River. Near the Sutton Power Plant in Wilmington, coal ash leaked from a Duke Energy landfill. The site lost enough material to fill around two-thirds of an Olympic-sized pool, the company said in a statement, adding that it did not believe the incident posed a risk to health or the environment. Officials had warned before the storm rains could taint waterways with murky coal ash and toxic hog waste. Florence has already set a North Carolina record for rainfall totals, exceeding that of Hurricane Floyd, which struck in 1999 and caused 56 deaths. Floyd produced 24 inches of rain in some parts of the state, while Florence has already dumped about 30 inches in areas around Swansboro. In New Bern, about 90 miles northeast of Wilmington at the confluence of two rivers, Florence overwhelmed the town of 30,000 and left the downtown area under water. Some area residents described a harrowing retreat as the storm hit. “It was pitch black and I was just scared out of my mind,” said Tracy Singleton, who with her family later drove through torrential rain and high winds from her home near New Bern. South Carolina authorities said law enforcement officers were guarding against looting in evacuated areas, while Wilmington set a curfew on Saturday evening in response to looting in one area. As the United States dealt with Florence, a super typhoon swirled towards Hong Kong and the Chinese coast on Sunday, gaining in strength over the South China Sea after hurtling through the Philippines, where it wreaked havoc that killed at least 25.

https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=742186908,"LUMBERTON, N.C. — The storm known as Florence is creating a slow-motion natural disaster for the Carolinas that could prove deceptively lethal as swollen rivers and streams spill over their banks and continue to rise. The hurricane, now downgraded to a tropical storm, was blamed by authorities for at least five deaths as of late Friday. Though Florence did not arrive with winds as violent as once feared, forecasters got the storm surge and rainfall correct. They have made clear that this event is all about the water — which the storm has delivered in devastating quantity. The storm made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., in the gloom of dawn Friday as a Category 1 hurricane. As the storm sat along the edge of the Atlantic, some stretches along the coastal Carolinas received close to 20 inches of rain. Florence is projected to migrate at barely more than a walking pace across northern South Carolina, passing close to the city of Florence — truly — on Saturday. The great danger now, experts say, is river flooding and then, once the remnants of the tempest reach the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians, flash floods, mudslides and debris flows. Relief will not come quickly. The National Weather Service said the floods are likely to last for weeks. This is a perilous moment for the hundreds of thousands of people who took to the roads to escape the storm’s fury. The rivers are in most cases several days from cresting. The parts of the country still in the storm’s path have been saturated by summer rains and cannot soak up any surplus from Florence. More than a dozen major rivers in the Carolinas and Southern Virginia are forecast by the National Weather Service to reach flood stage, and some — including the Neuse, Pamlico, Lumber, Waccamaw, Northeast Cape Fear and Pee Dee rivers — are expected to set flood records. There is really nowhere for the water to go. “We’re in God’s hands,” said Rick Foreman, pastor at West Lumberton Baptist Church, as the Lumber River steadily rose Friday and local residents filled sandbags. “We all know that.” The Weather Service forecast the Lumber to reach major flood stage Saturday and to keep rising through Sunday. State Sen. Danny Britt (R) put out a call on Facebook for volunteers to fill the sandbags and, with the help of 40 members of the National Guard, dam a railway channel that has been problematic during floods. “Pretty soon I had a hundred of my closest friends out here helping us out,” Britt said. “Sixty mile-per-hour winds, shingles flying off their own homes, and they’re here working for everyone else.” The river swamped the town after Hurricane Matthew came through two years ago: One church parishioner drowned during that storm, more than 700 families were displaced from their homes, and two of the city’s largest public housing projects were destroyed, Foreman said. And so as a pelting rain fell Friday, residents worked in soaked T-shirts and shorts to try to stave off another disaster. Usually hurricanes this far north deliver their punch and quickly leave town. Florence has been a strange tropical cyclone since it materialized in the distant Atlantic and took an unusual path toward the mainland United States. On Friday afternoon it was traveling at just 3 to 5 mph, still near the coast. “There’s nothing to steer it. It’s all about the steering currents. We don’t have any right now,” said Ken Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. “It’s like a bubble with no wind, it just floats. You don’t want slow, but that’s what we have.” South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R) urged patience, emphasizing that his state has never seen “a hurricane staying on top of us for this long.” The coast has been battered, and the mountains appear to be next. The remnants of Florence are expected to hit the peaks of western North Carolina in a couple of days. National Hurricane Center meteorologist Joel Cline said the mountains will wring water out of the moist tropical air: “It’s like running into a wall, and that moisture has to go somewhere, and it goes up, creates rain, and you have torrential rain in that area.” Cline said July was the wettest ever in that part of North Carolina, and the water table rose 21 inches higher than normal. Florence could add an additional six to 10 inches of rainfall this weekend. Flash floods can materialize within minutes of intense rain as the water rushes down hillsides. “You evacuate from water,” Cline said. “That’s why we’ve been preaching to people that you have to get away from the water.” Appalachian State University in Boone canceled its first home football game scheduled for Saturday. “It’s not often that we have to prepare for a hurricane in the mountains, but we are doing so on our campus,” Jason Marshburn, the director of safety and emergency management at the university, wrote in a letter to students and faculty members. Florence’s remnants are expected to keep traveling north and then northeast, and they could drop several inches of rain in eastern Tennessee and eastern Kentucky, southwest Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Flash flooding is a threat in those states as well. The Carolinas know all about hurricane-related flooding, having experienced Matthew two years ago and Floyd in 1999. Floyd, like Florence, hit Wilmington directly and dumped record amounts of rain. Rivers swelled not only with water but also with the carcasses of livestock. A number of motorists died trying to drive through moving water. Hence the refrain Friday from emergency management officials: Turn around, don’t drown. With the center of the storm still at sea early Friday, scores of residents had to be rescued from homes and the tops of cars in New Bern, N.C. Power outages mounted until nearly 700,000 customers were in the dark in North Carolina alone. Duke Energy said late Friday that it anticipates 1 million to 3 million outages in the Carolinas, and that full power restoration could take weeks. “The storm is wreaking havoc on our state, and we’re deeply concerned for farms, for businesses, for schools and even for whole communities that might be wiped away,” said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D). The eyewall of Florence struck the coast before dawn. At 5:30 a.m. a reporter in a downtown hotel in Wilmington heard the signature hurricane sound — a low, heavy humming combined with an almost musical high note. Eight-foot waves, a local record, ruffled the surface of the Cape Fear River. At 6 a.m. the electronics chirped for a moment as the power went out. Buildings swayed for several hours. The wind in Wilmington gusted to 105 mph, the strongest since Hurricane Helene on Sept. 27, 1958, the Weather Service said. The winds became less violent as the eye, no longer well-formed but instead welling with rain, passed over the city after it made landfall at 7:15 a.m. Trees went down, as did power lines, and streets filled with debris. A Waffle House downtown remained open for a few hours — sandwiches only, no coffee — before closing at noon. Metal signs and roof coverings littered the biggest commercial byway, Market Street, and trees blocked many roads. Traffic lights were out. Residents mostly heeded police commands to stay home and off the streets. In Kinston, a city southeast of Raleigh, two people died in the storm. A 78-year-old man connecting extension cords in the rain was electrocuted, according to Roger Dail, the Lenoir County director of emergency services. And a 77-year-old man died when he was knocked over by wind, he said. In Pender County, officials said that a woman died of a heart attack Friday morning as emergency crews tried to reach her; they were delayed because of downed trees and debris in the road. The crews tried to move the debris with a front loader, but a tree went through the windshield, causing further delays, the officials said. “Our hearts go out to the families of those who died in this storm,” Cooper said in a statement. “Hurricane Florence is going to continue its violent grind across our state for days. Be extremely careful and stay alert.” Sullivan reported from Wilmington, N.C. Berman and Achenbach reported from Washington.

ABC News,"Over 20 million Americans from Texas to Alabama are at risk for severe weather through Thursday as a storm system moves through the central U.S. over the next few days bringing several rounds of heavy rain. An additional 20 million Americans are at risk for flooding from Texas to Indiana, where flash flood watches have already been issued. Flooding is possible across the central and southern U.S. due to heavy rain on Tuesday and Wednesday. There were nearly 25 reports of large hail -- 2 inches in diameter -- on Monday across parts of western and central Texas on Monday. Today, the risk of severe threat weather slides toward the major Texas cities in the I-35 corridor: San Antonio, Austin, Waco and Dallas. Damaging winds and large hail are the main threat. The major cities in Texas will be threatened by damaging winds and large hail on Wednesday. And now it is looking like the severe weather risk will return to parts of the Deep South on Thursday, with the potential for strong to severe storms in parts of Mississippi and Alabama. Thunderstorms and heavy rain will develop ahead of the core of this storm system. The storms are expected to become widespread and slow moving over the next few days across the Mississippi River Valley and into parts of the Midwest. Due to the slow-moving nature of the storms, rainfall will be intense and potentially long in duration making flash flooding a serious concern. The greatest risk for excessive rainfall Tuesday will be in northeast Texas and much of Arkansas. Tomorrow, the threat nudges slightly south and east into northern Louisiana, southern Arkansas and western Mississippi. Locally, 4 to 6 inches of rain is expected in parts of this region. Heavy rain through the end of the week will cause a flooding threat in much of the South. Signs of spring in the East Warmth will move in the South on Tuesday. Temperatures on Tuesday are expected to be nearly 10 degrees above average in eastern Texas and Louisiana. By Thursday, some of this mild air makes it to the Northeast. There is some indication, that the core of the mild air will struggle to make it all the way to New England. Nevertheless, more seasonable temperatures will arrive at the end of the week for the Northeast. Temperatures will be in the 50s, 60s and 70s up and down the East Coast on Thursday. The beginning of April is looking a little cooler than average for much of the country. The highest likelihood of below-average temperatures will be in the Northern Plains and upper Midwest.","Over 20 million Americans from Texas to Alabama are at risk for severe weather through Thursday as a storm system moves through the central U.S. over the next few days bringing several rounds of heavy rain.

Anna Mehler Paperny,"WILSON/WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Florence kept dumping rain on North Carolina on Sunday and officials warned residents that “the worst is yet to come” from a storm that has already killed at least eight people, as rivers inland were likely to flood. Florence, which crashed into the state as a hurricane on Friday, had weakened to a tropical depression by Sunday morning but was forecast to drop another 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 cm) of rain in North Carolina, bringing rainfall totals in some inland areas to 15 to 20 inches, according to the National Hurricane Center. The most rain so far from Florence was 33.9 inches (86 cm) in Swansboro, North Carolina, a new record for a single hurricane in the state. The previous record was 24 inches (61 cm), set by Hurricane Floyd, which killed 56 people in 1999, said Bryce Link, a meteorologist with DTN Marine Weather, a private forecasting service. In Fayetteville, a North Carolina city of about 210,000 people some 90 miles (145 km) inland, authorities told thousands of residents near the Cape Fear River and Little River to get out of their homes by Sunday afternoon because of the flood risk. “If you are refusing to leave during this mandatory evacuation, you need to do things like notify your legal next of kin because the loss of life is very, very possible,” Mayor Mitch Colvin said at a news conference on Saturday. “The worst is yet to come,” he added. A total of about 761,000 homes and businesses were without power on Sunday in North and South Carolina and surrounding states, down from a peak of nearly 1 million. In New Bern, about 90 miles northeast of Wilmington at the confluence of two rivers, Florence overwhelmed the town of 30,000 and left the downtown area under water. “It was pitch black and I was just scared out of my mind,” said Tracy Singleton, who with her family later fled her home near New Bern. As authorities rescued people by boat and even airlifted 50 stranded people in North Carolina, there were also reports of looting. Five people were arrested for breaking into a Dollar General Store, said the police department in Wilmington, which has imposed a nighttime curfew. A least seven people have died so far in the storm in North Carolina, including a mother and child killed by a falling tree and three people who drowned, state officials said. A woman died in South Carolina when her car hit a fallen tree. ‘CATASTROPHIC’ STORM “This is still a catastrophic, life threatening storm,” said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center. “It has already dumped 20 to 30 inches of rain on parts of the Carolinas with more to come,” he said. “And many of the rivers will see prolonged flooding, some not cresting for a few days.” Many roads were closed and authorities warned of landslides, tornadoes and flash floods, with dams and bridges in peril as rivers and creeks swelled. The flooding could taint waterways with murky coal ash and toxic hog waste. By Sunday morning the storm’s winds had dropped to about 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. It had picked up pace somewhat, moving west at 8 mph (13 kph), and its center was expected to move across the western Carolinas during Sunday and the Ohio Valley and Northeast United States on Monday and Tuesday. The White House said President Donald Trump approved making federal funding available in some affected counties. Trump, who plans to visit the region this week and he tweeted his “deepest sympathies and warmth” to the families and friends of those who died. As the United States dealt with Florence, a super typhoon made landfall in China’s Guangdong on Sunday after barreling past Hong Kong and Macau and killing dozens of people in the Philippines.

Deputies with the Burnet County Sheriff's Office removed the body from the floodwaters of Lake Lyndon B. Johnson at about 1 p.m. near Kingsland, according to Spectrum News in Austin. Texas Game Warden Search and Rescue teams are now involved in multiple air and water rescues along the river as calls for service come in ""one after the other,"" according to a Tweet from the department. Christy Baught, a floodplain administrator for Llano County, said other local agencies are also assisting with rescue operations, as the flooding has placed residents in serious danger. ""The Llano River has hit major historic flood stage,"" reads a post from the Llano County Office of Emergency Management. ""It is currently at 40' and has almost topped the bridge in Llano. Anyone living within 1/4 mile of the river should evacuate immediately to higher ground.""

Greg Abbott ordered the Texas State Operations Center to a state of increased readiness in response to the ongoing flooding. ""When severe weather strikes, Texas will ensure our responders and local officials have what they need to respond and protect those in harm's way,"" he said. ""I also urge all Texans to take their safety into their own hands by closely monitor changing weather conditions and heeding warnings from local officials."" The flooding has shut down several roadways and bridges in the area, and at about 9:30 a.m., the FM 2900 bridge in Kingsland, Texas, collapsed from the pressure of the raging floodwaters, according to a report from KEYE-TV in Austin. The National Weather Service reported Tuesday morning that more than 10 inches of rain has inundated portions of the Llano River watershed since early Monday. The water has rushed into the river, causing it to rise to almost unprecedented levels. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for Gillespie and Llano counties through 7 p.m. Tuesday and a flood warning along the Llano River in Llano County, Sandy Creek near Kingsland and the Pedernales River at Johnson City. The Llano River is in a major flood stage, meaning there will be ""extensive inundation of structures and roads."" Such a stage calls for ""significant evacuations of people and/or transfer of property to higher elevations,"" according to NWS's website. Baught said the Llano County Office of Emergency management has set up shelters at the First Baptist Church of Llano, Inman's Kitchen an the Kingsland Community Center. She did not know if anyone was missing in the storm. Flooding has also affected other rivers in the Hill County. The National Weather Service said Guadalupe River, Sandy Creek and Nueces River are facing a ""dangerous situation.""

ABC News,"Last year's wildfires in Southern California paved the way for this week's deadly mudslides, which turned roadways into ruinous rivers of mud and debris. Interested in California Wildfires? Add California Wildfires as an interest to stay up to date on the latest California Wildfires news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Heavy rain unleashed flash floods and debris flow in the southern part of the Golden State Tuesday, just weeks after several wildfires torched the area. At least 15 people have died and more than 20 injured from weather-related incidents as of today, according to officials in Santa Barbara County. At least two dozen people in Santa Barbara County were unaccounted for, officials said. Aerial view of Montecito, Calif., where mud and debris covers roads, homes and everything in it's path following heavy rains, Jan. 9, 2018. US 101 Freeway at the Olive Mill Road overpass flooded with runoff water from Montecito Creek and blocked with mudflow and debris following heavy rains in Montecito, Calif., Jan. 9, 2018. The mudslides struck the communities hit hard by the Thomas fire in December, the largest wildfire in California's modern history. That's because burned soil can act as a water repellent like pavement, so rainfall that would normally be absorbed in the ground runs off rapidly after a wildfire. Thus, much less rain is needed to cause a flash flood. As the floodwater gushes downhill through burned areas, it can create major erosion and pick up vast amounts of ash, mud, rocks, sand, silt and scorched vegetation like trees and shrubs. Locations downhill and downstream from the burn scar left by a wildfire are susceptible to flash flooding, debris flow and mudslides, according to the National Weather Service. The force of the rushing water, mud and debris can be catastrophic. It can damage or destroy roadways, bridges, culverts and buildings even miles away from the burned area. Firefighters rescue a 14-year-old girl trapped inside a destroyed home during heavy rains in Montecito, Calif., Jan. 9, 2018. Heavy rains overnight combined with large areas burned by the Thomas Fire combined for flash flooding and mudslide risk. A member of the Long Beach Search and Rescue team looks for survivors in a car in Montecito, Calif., Jan. 9, 2018. The devastating Thomas fire that ignited Dec. 4 burned hundreds of thousands of acres in Southern California. Communities in Santa Barbara County, like Montecito, located below the burned area, are under siege again as mudslides crushed cars and ripped homes from their foundations this week. Highway 101 has been shut down in both directions because of the mud, Santa Barbara County officials announced Tuesday afternoon.

John Antczak,"Flames consume a home on N. Fairview Ave. as the Holiday fire burns in Goleta, Calif., on Saturday, July 7, 2018. Associated Press/Noah Berger California firefighters are struggling in the stifling heat to put out blazes that have prompted the evacuations of hundreds of homes. Firefighters increased containment of a central San Diego County fire that rapidly spread over 400 acres, destroyed 18 structures and damaged eight. Another wildfire in the San Bernardino National Forest was holding at 1.5 square miles and forced evacuation of about 700 homes in the mountain community of Forest Falls. LOS ANGELES (AP) — Firefighters toiled in stifling heat Saturday on the lines of destructive wildfires across the US West, making progress against some blazes while struggling to tame others that have forced evacuations of hundreds of homes. In heat-stricken Southern California, powerful winds that sent an overnight inferno hopscotching through the Santa Barbara County community of Goleta vanished in the morning, allowing firefighters to extinguish smoldering ruins of an estimated 20 structures, including homes. Authorities announced that mandatory evacuation orders were being greatly reduced and many of the 2,500 people who fled Friday night would be able to return home by late afternoon. County Fire Chief Eric Peterson thanked residents for heeding the call to evacuate, allowing firefighters to focus on fire suppression rather than rescues. ""There very likely would have been fatalities last night had those evacuations not occurred,"" Peterson said. The fire's spread was stopped at about 100 acres (40.5 hectares) in a neighborhood where some houses were in ruins while homes next door were intact. Eric Durtschi stood outside his destroyed house, where a burned-out car stood in the driveway and kids' bicycles were strewn about. Durtschi, his wife and six children had left Utah and moved in just a few weeks ago. He said he hadn't yet told his two oldest children their home was gone. He managed to collect his severely burned vintage guns, hoping to salvage them. A neighbor's home across the street was spared. The man had stayed through the night spraying down other people's houses. An epic heat wave A Los Angeles County Fire Department helicopter drops water on a brush fire that erupted on a mountainside above suburban Burbank, Calif. on Saturday, July 7, 2018. Associated Press/Richard Vogel Elsewhere in Southern California, firefighters increased containment of a central San Diego County fire that rapidly spread over 400 acres (162 hectares), destroyed 18 structures and damaged eight, and a wildfire in the San Bernardino National Forest was holding at 1.5 square miles (404 hectares) and forced evacuation of about 700 homes in the mountain community of Forest Falls. Fires also burned on the Marine Corps' sprawling Camp Pendleton base in northern San Diego County. Among new fires Saturday, a blaze erupted on a steep mountain slope just above the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank and helicopters pounded it with water to try to keep it from getting out of hand. Southern California fires began erupting Friday as strong high pressure over the West spawned an epic heat wave that saw parts of Los Angeles broil in temperatures up to 117 degrees (47.2 Celsius). There was little relief overnight. ""Temperatures at 8 a.m. were ridiculously over 100 degrees"" in foothills near Forest Falls and many inland valleys, the National Weather Service said. Forecasters said the region's siege of heat would gradually ease through the weekend, but the unstable air mass unleashed downpours that triggered flash-flood warnings for the mountains northeast of Los Angeles. Further up north and just south of the California-Oregon border, the 34-square-mile (88-square-kilometer) Klamathon Fire in rural Siskiyou County was just 5 percent contained. The body of a resident was found Friday in the ruins of a home, among 15 destroyed structures tallied so far. Authorities described ""extreme fire behavior with movement in multiple directions,"" with threats to the California communities of Hornbrook and Hilt as well as Colestin, Oregon. Ray Haupt, chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, said losses included homes and livestock. Elsewhere in California, the 138-square-mile (357-square-kilometer) County Fire northwest of Sacramento was nearly 50 percent contained. Ten structures were counted destroyed but damage assessments were continuing. With fires occurring statewide, a Colorado-based Boeing 747-400 supertanker was deployed to California. Afternoon storms, flash floods, and mudslides Los Angeles Fire Department firefighters put out a fire on a garbage truck in the San Fernando Valley section of Los Angeles on Saturday, July 7, 2018. Associated Press/Richard Vogel Scott McLean, deputy chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said the supertanker was undergoing checks at an airfield outside Sacramento. Software issues needed to be resolved before the aircraft owned by Global SuperTanker Services of Colorado Springs could be activated under a call-when-needed contract. In Utah, meanwhile, authorities allowed the return of some residents who fled a wildfire near a popular fishing lake 80 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Salt Lake City. The blaze has burned about 75 square miles (193 square kilometers) and destroyed 90 structures, including homes, cabins, sheds and garages, since starting Sunday in the mountains. In Colorado, firefighters took advantage of occasional rainstorms to extend their containment lines at several large wildfires. In the south, crews Saturday contained about 45 percent of a 167-square-mile (433-square-kilometer) fire that has destroyed more than 130 homes, while in Rocky Mountain ski country firefighters from 20 states were battling an 8-square-mile (22-square-kilometer) wildfire above the Roaring Fork Valley. Commanders said they hoped for one-third containment by late Sunday. Crews also had 50 percent containment of a southwestern Colorado fire that has blackened 85 square miles (220 square kilometers) north of Durango. Authorities said Saturday that afternoon storms could produce flash floods and mudslides in burn scars. And in central Colorado's Park County, crews encircled a third of a spotty fire that forced the Buffalo Creek Wilderness to close. A stretch of busy US Highway 285 between Fairplay and Antero Junction reopened Saturday. ___ Associated Press writers Paul Davenport in Phoenix, Jim Anderson in Denver and freelance photographer Noah Berger in Goleta contributed to this report.",Associated Press/Noah Berger California firefighters are struggling in the stifling heat to put out blazes that have prompted the evacuations of hundreds of homes.

"USA TODAY, Adam Shell, USA TODAY","Florence has weakened to a tropical depression but forecasters warn the next few days could bring the most destructive round of flooding in North Carolina history. The National Hurricane Center says the effect is expected to be ""catastrophic."" (Sept. 16) AP epa07023451 Two people in a canoe paddle through a street that was flooded by Hurricane Florence north of New Bern, North Carolina USA, 15 September 2018. Storm surge and heavy flooding from the hurricane has inundated much of Eastern North Carolina. Florence has been downgraded to a tropical storm but is still expected to bring a storm surge with heavy flooding to the Carolinas. EPA-EFE/JIM LO SCALZO ORG XMIT: JJL01 (Photo: EPA-EFE) The drenching rains and massive flooding caused by Florence are expected to inflict a high financial toll on homeowners in North Carolina and other impacted states, as only a small percentage are covered by flood insurance that could help offset the costs of rebuilding their damaged homes. Estimates from insurance analysts and actuaries show an alarmingly high percentage of homeowners — both in coastal towns and those far inland — that are underinsured for a water-driven natural disaster as destructive as Florence. Only 10 percent to 20 percent of coastal homeowners in the hard-hit eastern part of North Carolina, for example, have coverage through the government’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and only 1 percent to 3 percent of homes in inland counties have flood policies, according to estimates from John Rollins, an actuary at consulting firm Milliman. Statewide, roughly 3% of the homes in North Carolina have flood coverage and 8% of homeowners are covered in South Carolina, Rollins said. An estimated quarter of a million homes in North Carolina are projected to be affected by Florence, which has caused flash flooding and record rain amounts across the state, according to CoreLogic, a property analytics company. “Obviously, that leaves a lot of people uninsured,” Rollins told USA TODAY. The numbers are low, he adds, because people think that because their home isn't in a high-risk zone designated by the government that there's ""zero risk"" of a flood. ""But that's not true,"" Rollins says. Many also don't realize their basic homeowners policy doesn't cover flood damage, while others overestimate the disaster aid they will get from the government. Unfortunately, standard homeowners insurance won’t cover any flooding-related issues. The estimated insured losses from Florence are in the range of $3 billion to $5 billion, according to CoreLogic, but could go as high as $10 billion to $20 billion, says Goldman Sachs, a Wall Street bank. Insurers should have no problem being able to pay out claims to policy holders, as the broader insurance industry has cash reserves of roughly half a trillion dollars, according to Matt Carletti, senior insurance analyst at JMP Securities. More Money: What you need to know about flood insurance as Florence dumps rain on Carolinas More Money: How the Waffle House Index will help FEMA determine just how bad Hurricane Florence gets More Money: You don't need perfect timing, just time, to earn big returns in the stock market The problem for homeowners is that insured losses generally only are about one-third of total economic losses, which puts them on the hook financially for a more sizable part of their home rebuilds if losses are due to uncovered flood costs, adds Carletti. To get flood coverage, homeowners must buy a separate policy. Most purchase this extra coverage from the government-backed NFIP program, which is designed to restore your home to its pre-flood condition and replace your possessions. NFIP policies, which carry average premiums of around $600 to $700 but can run into the thousands of dollars in high-risk zones -- cover up to $250,000 for a home's structure and up to $100,000 for personal possessions. Homeowners not covered for flood damage can seek federal disaster assistance in the form of grants from the federal government or apply for a loan from the Small Business Administration, says Steve Bowen, director at impact forecasting firm Aon Benfield. At the end of July, there were 134,306 active NFIP flood policies in place in North Carolina, says Bowen. But that's only 3 percent of the estimated 4.62 million housing units in the state, he adds, citing U.S. Census Bureau data. Damages to homes caused by floods tend to be costly. The estimated potential loss for a 1,000 square-foot, single-story home with possessions worth $20,000 that is inundated with just one inch of interior water can run as high as $11,000, according to FEMA data, and the estimated loss for five inches of water climbs to more than $18,000. Given the fact that many parts of North Carolina have received rain totals of two feet or more, many homeowners will be facing high rebuild costs they may not be able to afford. “You are looking at a lot of homeowners that will have out-of-pocket costs that could easily be five figures, or more than $10,000,” says Cathy Seifert, an insurance analyst at CFRA, a Wall Street research firm.

"Associated Press, Matt Rourke, Associated Press","Floodwaters partly submerge a van in Darby, Pa., Monday, Aug. 13, 2018. Authorities said heavy rains caused flooding and prompted road closures and rescues of people from stranded cars in central and southeastern Pennsylvania. (Photo: AP) DARBY, Pa. – Torrential rains triggered flash flooding in parts of central and eastern Pennsylvania on Monday, closing down a heavily traveled interstate and sending water into homes in the mountainous coal regions. State highway and emergency management officials reported numerous closed roads in a wide swath of the state from Williamsport to the Philadelphia suburbs, and some motorists had to be rescued. Hazel Coles said water rose so quickly at her home in Darby, outside Philadelphia, that she had to evacuate through a window. She said there was about 3 feet of water on her street, and some people had to be evacuated by boat. She said the Red Cross was helping displaced residents. “It’s just crazy,” she said. “I thank God it wasn’t worse.” The National Weather Service in State College said there were numerous reports of 6 inches of rain or more in Schuylkill and Columbia counties. Meteorologist Aaron Tyburski said the latest downpours followed weeks of a stalled weather pattern that is drawing moisture from the Atlantic Ocean, hitting some communities repeatedly. “It’s been quite a rough go for them over the past three weeks,” Tyburski said. In the Benton area north of Bloomsburg, Fishing Creek spilled from its banks Monday, sending out a torrent of chocolate brown water. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency said a helicopter rescue was planned for people on the roofs of homes in that part of northern Columbia County, but weather needed to clear before the helicopter could take off early Monday afternoon. High water in Port Carbon caused some evacuations and prompted firefighters to launch rescue boats and rafts. Parts of Pottsville were inundated, and three shelters were set up. Schuylkill County emergency management director John Matz said water levels were starting to fall by early afternoon Monday and officials were making plans to assess the damage. He said the recent flooding could have caused more damage than the high water that hit the county a few weeks ago and affected several hundred structures. “The difference now is, once we hit the center part of the county, it’s a more populated area,” Matz said. In the Philadelphia area, the Schuylkill Expressway was closed in both directions at the busy King of Prussia Mall exit. The waters affected dozens of stores and a parking garage at the mall. Upper Darby and Montgomery County police reported numerous rescues of people trapped in cars by flooding. The National Weather Service office issued a flash flood warning and urged people not to drive through flooded roads. Gov. Tom Wolf activated the Commonwealth Response Coordination Center on Monday morning and the National Guard was notified to be ready to help, if needed. The forecast calls for storms to continue and cause flooding in the southcentral, north-central and eastern parts of the state through Wednesday.

ABC News,"Some of the hottest weather so far this summer is hitting parts of the West. In the last 2 days, temperatures have been near 100 degrees in the Pacific Northwest. It was 97 degrees in Portland, Oregon, and 99 degrees in Salem, Oregon, on Thursday. This hot, dry and windy weather sparked several fires in the West. One of them was in Silver Falls State Park in Oregon where 185 children had to be evacuated, according to Portland ABC station KATU. Wildfires also forced evacuations in the last few days near Chico, California, where the fire is now 40 percent contained and evacuations have been lifted. The National Weather Service is warning that dry conditions, erratic winds, heat and lightning could start more fires this weekend in Northern California and into the Pacific Northwest. Heat and fire warnings are prevalent in the West. It’s also been very hot from the Deep South into the Midwest where eight states from Alabama to Illinois are under a heat advisory. Numerous fire watches, warnings and heat advisories have been issued from the Midwest into the Northwest. The heat will intensify, especially in the West, where triple-digit temperatures will extend all the way close to Portland and Seattle will be in the 90s. Temperatures will be in the high 90s as far north as Portland, Ore., this weekend. Heavy storms cross country Several weather systems are producing heavy rain across the country on Saturday, including a stalled frontal boundary in the Midwest that caused damage in Iowa and Indiana. There is also a new cold front moving into the Northern Rockies on Saturday, which is expected to bring severe weather today to the Dakotas. A new cold front is moving into the Northern Rockies on Saturday. A flash flood watch has been posted Saturday morning for parts of Colorado scarred by wildfires over the past few weeks. Over the next several days, the cold front will move south and east from the northern Rockies, bringing heavy rain and storms to a large part of the country. Heavy rain will fall in the Midwest and Southwest on Monday afternoon. Rainfall totals will be heavy locally, where some areas could see more than 3 inches of rain. Flash flooding is possible over the weekend and into early next week. And in the Rockies, debris flow and mudslides are possible over the burn scar areas. There could be flooding in areas hit by wildfire, including Colorado, over the next few days.","Some of the hottest weather so far this summer is hitting parts of the West.
