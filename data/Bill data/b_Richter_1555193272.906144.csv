Kate Clark,"After four months “on the beach,” per his LinkedIn profile, Uber’s former global head of business and corporate development has a new gig. Lime has hired David Richter (pictured) as its first-ever chief business officer and interim chief financial officer. Based in San Francisco, Richter will be overseeing the bike- and e-scooter-sharing startup’s business operations. Richter spent more than four years at Uber leading the ride-hailing giant’s global business development, corporate development, experiential marketing, autonomous vehicle alliances and brand relevance teams. He left in May after expressing frustrations with a series of departures in his group, according to The Information. As Lime continues to grow, David will bring in unparalleled expertise, particularly in the realm of business development and corporate partnerships, as well as in managing our overall business strategy and deal flow, Lime co-founder and chief executive officer Toby Sun said in a statement. His leadership experience, coupled with his keen understanding of the fast-moving shared mobility industry will be a huge advantage to our company as we continue to expand our global footprint. Lime is said to be completing the fundraising circuit right now, asking investors for a valuation north of $3 billion. The company, which entered the unicorn club in June, has raised a total of $467 million to date from GV, Andreessen Horowitz, IVP, Section 32, GGV Capital and more. The company is using the buckets of capital to expand beyond bikes and scooters. Last Monday, rumors emerged that it was planning a brick-and-mortar push. The company confirmed that it would indeed build scooter “lifestyle stores” in major U.S. and international markets, starting with Santa Monica, Calif. The next day on stage at the JD Power Automotive Roundtable, Lime announced its official foray into car-sharing. The company has since applied for a car-sharing permit in Seattle and plans to rent out small electric vehicles, which it’s calling “transit pods,” by the end of the year. According to Axios, Lime plans to spend $50 million on the pods, which will cost $1 for consumers to start, plus an additional 40 cents per minute. “You can expect electric vehicles to be an additional micro-mobility option for Lime riders to choose from within the Lime app soon,” a spokesperson for Lime said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “More details on timing, specs of the vehicle, locations for the first rollout, etc. will be announced in the coming weeks.” Lime launched in 2017 and has since recorded 11.5 million scooter and bike rides. https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/lime-scooter-store/","Lime has tapped David Richter, Uber's former vice president, to lead its business operations.",2018-10-30T02:49:02Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Lime hires its first chief business officer amid push into car-sharing,http://techcrunch.com/2018/10/29/lime-hires-its-first-chief-business-officer-amid-push-into-car-sharing/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/David-Richter-headshot-2018.jpg?w=600,techcrunch,TechCrunch,Richter,0

Every morning Flow State emails subscribers a set of background music, mostly wordless, to soundtrack your work day. And theyre pretty good at digging up non-obvious music, some of which isnt even available on major streaming services (though almost all of it is on YouTube). Past artists include Max Richter, Olivier Messiaen, Debussy, Johann Johannsson, Tangerine Dream, Kaoru Inoue, Brian Eno, and William Basinski. (Yep, almost all men, sorry.) Occasionally theres a DJ mix that incorporates several artists.
Until today, this newsletter cost $30 a year. Now its free, and $30 a year will get you access to Monday mixes created in-house, as well as a database of previous featured artists. Most editions of the newsletter include several albums or sets by an artist, plus a recommendation or two for expanding your own search.
Ive found this newsletter helpful in eliminating one of my common work distractions: picking what music to play, then switching two or three times as I find each choice too distracting. (Most of my job is reading and writing, which is hard to do with a lot of popular music, especially if I havent worn it down with a few months of steady listening.) Its nice to have a stream of new work-ready music, like fresh running water.

Credit Andy Richter Given the partisan tumult of 2017, many Americans probably feel like they could use a cold shower or a hot bath. In stressful times like these, it can help to find a relaxation regimen, which might explain the popularity of Eastern traditions like tai chi, qigong and yoga. The photographer Andy Richter, a Minnesota native and former ski patrolman, has been devoted to his yoga practice since 2004. In 2012, he set out on a mission to deeply explore yoga, including visiting with many masters. “The time were living in, there’s a lot of pressure on us that is really nonstop,” he said. “We need tools and ways to be able to control our inner state. I’m not just there trying to illustrate a posture or pose. I’m trying to tune into what’s going on before me, and really transmit this inner experience that the yogi in front of me is having.” Bhandari Baba, a yogi who has been silent over 10 years, meditating in his cave in the foothills above Rishikesh, India.

He spent time in India, where yoga originated, but also photographed in places like Denver, Colo.; Encinitas, Calif.; and a longtime Sikh community in northern New Mexico. Together, the photographs present a diverse look at an ancient practice that has been adapted to our contemporary times. It is also a personal perspective. ""These pictures represent my own walk through yoga,” he said. “They’re not all-encompassing, or representing yoga all around the world in all of its forms. It’s my own exploration, my own contemplation, and where I’ve been led to. I feel grateful for opportunity to have been in the presence of all of these amazing people.” Petals of devotion flow with the Yamuna River near Keshi Ghat in Vrindavan, India.

Whether they show richly-hued cotton robes, vibrant flower petals or light reflecting off the Ganges, the series of photographs is stunning. While yoga has been associated with wisdom for more than 5,000 years, in American society, it has often been co-opted and commodified. But Mr. Richter thinks its greatest benefit is priceless, in more ways than one. “None of this is bought or sold, what we’re talking about here,” he said. “None is even available for any cost. It requires us to slow down, to still our minds, and to find a way to get our senses under control.” He is trying to veer away from this commercial view, which often is a humorously-expected-vision of yoga.

Credit Andy Richter ""Often in photographs, it is a beautiful woman in soft light, in a studio context, with certain branded attire on,” he said. “It’s not representing anything, in terms of what depth of what yoga is.” One image in the series depicts almost the exact opposite of that stereotype. In 2016, during one of his many trips to India, Mr. Richter found himself in a situation that sounds like something out of a storybook. He was in a cave, photographing a silent hermit who lived there, isolated from the world. They’d known each other for years, so he made sure to bring tobacco, fruit, and milk, along with his tripod and cable release. ""It was pretty incredible to be sitting there with this silent yogi, who basically wears a loin cloth, and lives in the forest,” he said. “We’re listening to music from all over world on my phone. I’ve been waiting for a long time for anything like this to happen. He’d never done yoga for me. He’d never meditated. It was amazing, and it happened very fast.” Fittingly, given the almost postmodern nature of this tale, despite yoga’s health benefits, after 15 minutes of practice, the silent yogi was pooped. ""He did all these yoga poses, these headstands, and more dramatic asana, and then he was huffing and puffing,” he recalled. “So he lay down, and lit up a cigarette, and was like, that’s it.” A young devotee blesses pilgrims along the Govardhan Parikrama, a sacred path where the Hindu god Krishna is believed to have spent much of his youth.

TIM HERRERA,"Ive recommended white noise machines before, and always for the same reason: Theyre incredible. (A tweet from a married friend this week joking-not-joking said it saved her marriage.) White noise machines are great because they block out all the noise that keeps you awake and sends you down spirals of wondering why youre still awake and ugh, O.K., if I fall asleep now Ill still get six hours and 33 minutes of sleep, which is still not bad, I can do that, O.K., down to six hours and four minutes, but thats doable, wait, O.K. Anyway. Wirecutters pick for a white noise machine is the LectroFan by ASTI. Sleep tight. If youd prefer to sleep in total silence, however, the right pair of earplugs will do the trick. Wirecutter recommends Macks Slim Fit Soft Foam Earplugs. In a sort of hybrid solution, Bose offers a pair of earbuds that acts as an in-between solution to mask noises while youre sleep: the Sleepbuds. Our consumer tech reporter, Brian X. Chen, tried them out, and had mixed findings. But in the end, he recommends trying the Sleepbuds if you have sleep problems with many caveats. One of the major caveats? The price: The Sleepbuds will cost you $250. Getting hard data to back up or demolish your theories about your own sleep habits can be truly enlightening. A sleep-tracking app like the one I use, SleepCycle provides that and more, showing you when you fall asleep, how you wake up, the duration of each sleep and overall trends about how your habits.

JASON FARAGO,"The Venetian masters hold on the great skeptic of contemporary painting is the subject of Titian/Gerhard Richter: Heaven on Earth, an idiosyncratic and wonderfully challenging exhibition on view at the Palazzo Te, a 16th-century palace in Mantua, Italy, 90 miles west of Venice. (The palace attracts tens of thousands of visitors a year, many drawn to its massive Mannerist frescoes by Giulio Romano, which date from slightly before Titian.) The exhibition includes the 1539 Annunciation that so inspired Mr. Richter, as well as a grander and looser painting of the same subject that Titian made in 1558-59. The show was also meant to include Mr. Richters Annunciations, but loans fell through at the last minute. Mr. Richter stepped in, lending a print on aluminum of Annunciation After Titian that he made in 2015, and a dozen other works some with figurative imagery, many abstract and never before exhibited. The absence of the original copy Mr. Richter made in 1973 is in some ways a lucky accident, as it lets this show escape a one-on-one face-off between the Annunciations and explore deeper, less direct interplays between Renaissance and contemporary art. Mr. Richters pictures of his wife, Sabine, and his daughters, Betty and Ella, are usually treated by curators as intentionally, almost sarcastically banal. Alongside Titians religious paintings, as well as an arresting 1559 drawing of Gabriel melting into a cloud of charcoal, the Richter portraits appear far less ironic. The anachronistic hang lets you see the family portraits as coherent with a Counter-Reformation painterly tradition, in which saints were depicted as recognizable humans on the cusp of divine transformation.",An idiosyncratic exhibition in northern Italy pairs the leading artist of Renaissance Venice with contemporary Germany’s master of the blur.,2018-10-18T13:02:58Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Art Review: Titian and Gerhard Richter: Keeping Faith With Painting, 5 Centuries Apart",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/arts/design/titian-gerhard-richter-palazzo-te.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/18/arts/18richter3/18richter3-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Richter,0

Conan OBrien returned after a long hiatus, sporting a more casual outfit (This is how I dress in real life I call my look hip biology teacher), a new set backdrop (It looks like a strip club in Grand Theft Auto! his sidekick Andy Richter complained), and the same old self-deprecating sense of humor.
The new version of his TBS show which OBrien decided to alter after hitting his 25th year in late night in 2018 is just 30 minutes long. After the crowds welcoming applause died down, OBrien joked, Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. We did not have time for that. Thats it good night, everybody! He then squeezed in a quick monologue, a This Is Us parody skit with Richter as OBriens worried wife, and a long, chummy interview with Tom Hanks.
And OBrien did something sneakily revolutionary in the Trump era of late night: He barely mentioned the president.

JOSHUA BARONE,"Some people stood in the center aisle to pose for photos, with the band — comprising Mr. Richter, members of the American Contemporary Music Ensemble and the soprano Grace Davidson — visible behind them. Spring Studios’ floor-to-ceiling windows offered the cityscape as an alluring backdrop for pajama-clad selfies. For some reason, water wasn’t available at the bar. I put away my notebook and tried to listen to “Sleep” as Mr. Richter intended. For the first half-hour, it was just him at the piano, playing a slow, pulsing lullaby. His rhythmic precision was admirable, given that his score was just stretches of whole notes; he played with the focus of a dyed-in-the-wool Minimalist. Composers from that movement were Mr. Richter’s earliest inspirations. As a boy in small-town Britain in the 1970s, he would get records from his family’s milkman, an artist who was tapped into the music of La Monte Young, Terry Riley and Philip Glass. He fell in love with Satie’s furniture music, and, eventually, the ambient soundscapes of Brian Eno. All of this factored into “Sleep,” which was first released in 2015. But the piece is also a homage to Bach’s “Goldberg” Variations. (The two works have the same number of sections.) While aware that the piece’s origin story is apocryphal, Mr. Richter was intrigued that the “Goldbergs” were supposedly written for a count with insomnia. Bach, it needs be said, this ain’t. “Sleep” is rife with the hallmarks of Mr. Richter’s style: a clarity that can seem like superficiality; an earnestness and emotionality that often come off as more ersatz and manipulative than personal. And it’s difficult to buy into an eight-hour exercise in mindfulness when, against Mr. Richter’s best intentions, it opened itself to being more of a social media sensation. Photo Mr. Richter playing the piano at the performance. Credit Vincent Tullo for The New York Times Asked whether the performance could fall victim to the very thing it was trying to resist, Mr. Richter said, “It’s fraught with ironies.” But he said he also hoped that the piece could help a community build toward “a silence.” Silence did reign in the middle of the night, when the piece reached its enchanting apex. Around me people slept, or lay awake as if in a trance. The lofts and office towers of TriBeCa rested, too. There were no stars in the sky, but the lights twinkled in the choppy waves of the Hudson River. I fell asleep, and dreamed that someone was walking among the mattresses, handing out water. Photo Our reporter, Joshua Barone, asleep on the job. Credit Vincent Tullo for The New York Times Around 5:30 in the morning, the sun began to rise, gradually filling the room with light as the “Sleep” orchestra played obvious music to match it: an increasingly loud, radiant major chord. If the earlier lullaby music had been purposefully low and mantralike, based on scientific research into what puts us to sleep, this gentle reveille also had an experimental basis: Higher frequencies wake us up. As people awoke, they grabbed their phones to capture the sunrise. A couple kissed and said good morning, as if at home and not surrounded by 100 strangers. “Sleep” ended with a fade-out, immediately followed by the voice of a Beautyrest staff doctor, guiding the audience through meditation with the phlegmatic voice “Saturday Night Live” actors use to parody NPR. “Our motivation resets over the course of the symphony of the night,” she said. “What will you do today? What will you achieve today?” It was difficult not to feel cynical as I walked out of the performance — the break from being sold stuff that I’d been promised — to have Beautyrest representatives handing me branded energy drinks. But then I met John Carl and Mary VandeRiet, two thirtysomething filmmakers. They had been awake most of the night, thinking it a waste to sleep through something so transcendental and peaceful. Ms. VandeRiet said she had never seen musicians onstage “so entirely connected to the music.” “It was just perfect,” she said. Indeed, during the performance Mr. Carl had asked Ms. VandeRiet to marry him. “We’ve listened to this album as we’ve slept,” he said. “We’ve listened to it at important moments in our lives. I had to do this.” Follow Joshua Barone on Twitter: @joshbarone.

George Dvorsky,"Archaeologists have uncovered the earliest evidence of bread-making at a site in northeastern Jordan. Dating back some 14,400 years, the discovery shows that ancient hunter-gatherers were making and eating bread 4,000 years before the Neolithic era and the introduction of agriculture. So much for the “Paleo Diet” actually being a thing. Bread-making predates agriculture, according to a new study published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. That’s quite the revelation, given the conventional thinking that bread only appeared after the advent of farming. The discovery means that ancient hunter-gatherers were using the wild ancestors of domesticated cereals, such as wild einkorn and club-rush tubers, to make flatbread-like food products. What’s more, the new paper shows that bread had already become an established food staple prior to the Neolithic period and the Agricultural Revolution. A research team led by Amaia Arranz-Otaegu from the University of Copenhagen analyzed fragments of charred food remains found at a Natufian hunter-gatherer site in northeastern Jordan called Shubayqa 1. The remains of the burnt bread, found in two ancient basalt-stone fireplaces, were radiocarbon dated to 14,400 years ago, give or take a couple of hundred years. This corresponds to the early Natufian period and the Upper Paleolithic era. The Natufian culture lived in the Levant, a region in the Eastern Mediterranean, from around 14,600 to 11,600 years ago. Prior to this discovery, the oldest known bread came from the 9,500-year-old settlement of Çatalhöyük, located in Anatolia, Turkey. Çatalhöyük dates back to the Neolithic era, a time when ancient humans had already settled in permanent villages and developed farming. The bread found at Shubayqa 1 pre-dates the Çatalhöyük bread by around 5,000 years, and it’s now the oldest example of bread-making in the archaeological record. For the study, the researchers analyzed 24 charred fragments of bread from the Shubayqa 1 excavation site using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Using SEM, the researchers were able to obtain the high resolution images required for studying the fine structures embedded within the charred materials. These images were compared to experimentally produced bread, allowing the researchers to identify the archaeological specimens. SEM analysis is quite time consuming, and the researchers only managed to analyze 24 fragments out of a total of 600 pieces that appear to be bread or bread-like remains. Tobias Richter, an associate professor at the University of Copenhagen and a co-author of the new study, said the discovery was surprising on a number of levels. “First, that bread predates the advent of agriculture and farming—it was always thought that it was the other way round,” Richter told Gizmodo. “Second, that the bread was of high quality, since it was made using quite fine flour. We didn’t expect to find such high-quality flour this early on in human history. Third, the hunter-gatherer bread we have does not only contain flour from wild barley, wheat and oats, but also from tubers, namely tubers from water plants (sedges). The bread was therefore more of a multi-grain-tuber bread, rather than a white loaf.” Richter said the method used for identifying the bread fragments is new, and that other researchers should use the technique to re-analyze older archaeological collections to search for even earlier examples of bread production. “I think it’s quite important to recognize that bread is such a hugely important staple in the world today,” said Richter. “That it can now be shown to have started a lot earlier than previously thought is quite intriguing, I think, and may help to explain the huge variety of different types of breads that have evolved in different cultures around the world over the millennia. Dorian Fuller, an archaeobotanist at the University College London and a co-author of the new study, said it’s highly plausible that hunter-gatherers were able to make bread without the benefit of agriculture. “Bread at it its most basic is flour, water, and dry heat. The flour should also ideally include some protein, such as gluten, that occurs in wheat to hold the batter together and provide elasticity,” Fuller told Gizmodo. “So this requires a suitable flour, and wild wheats and barleys contain gluten.” In addition, the necessary equipment to produce flour, like stone tools to pulverize grains, were already in existence by the time this ancient bread was made, as some of the oldest examples date back 25,000 years or more. “So the fact that people would have ground stuff to process it is not surprising,” said Richter. Lastly, the third element to making bread—dry, baking heat—would likely exist in a culture without ceramics, which describes this particular culture at the time. Ehud Weiss, an archaeobotanist at Bar-Ilan University who wasn’t involved with the new study, says the new paper describes a significant discovery. “One of the interesting aspects of reconstructing our ancestors’ diet is the technology they used,” Weiss told Gizmodo. “Here, it is clear these people grinded and mixed several types of foodstuff, cereals, and root food to create a baked product.” Weiss says it’s important to remember that caloric return was a major issue with hunter-gatherers’ diet, especially in challenging environments. Ground and baked foodstuffs have a higher glycemic index (GI) than raw food, where GI is a relative ranking of carbohydrates in foods according to how they affect blood glucose levels. “Today, we use GI as a tool to avoid food that will add too much sugars to our blood stream,” said Weiss. For hunter-gatherers who struggle in hostile environments to gain more energy from their food, the situation is, of course, the opposite. The ability to increase the caloric return from their food is, therefore, an important step in the development of human nutrition.” Francesca Balossi Restelli from the Sapienza University of Rome, also not involved with the new study, wasn’t surprised by the finding, saying a discovery of this nature was expected. “Certainly, finding charred remains of flour products is the much-needed demonstration of what the large quantity of mortars, pestles, and moulders were already showing us,” Restelli told Gizmodo. “If people were cultivating plants, if they had mortars, then they must have been baking ‘bread-like’ foods. The discovery described in the PNAS article is thus certainly extremely meaningful, but not totally unexpected. It is very nice news, as it confirms today’s trend of thought and research.” University of Cambridge archaeobotanist Martin Jones is excited about the new paper, both for what it tells about about the dietary habits of paleolithic humans, and in the use of a new technique to study the bits and pieces of plant material left behind by ancient humans. “If we listen to many of the familiar narratives about how humans ate before the advent of agriculture, we hear a great deal about animals, and a bit about seafood,” Jones told Gizmodo. “We have got nowhere near as far with understanding how they worked with plants, and it is beginning to come clear that plant-based cuisine is very old indeed, and very significant.” “Looking at pulverized plant material is still quite novel,” Jones said. “We archaeobotanists understandably feel more confident about identifying plants before they have been mashed to a pulp. But the SEMs here show how much cellular pattern is still discernible, and how fruitful it can be to persevere and give it a closer look.” As a final note, this study reminds us, yet again, that the so-called Paleo Diet isn’t an actual thing, or at the very least, not a coherent, unified diet that existed across multiple populations of paleolithic peoples. What’s more, this study doesn’t tell us which particular ancestral diet was the “healthiest,” and it’s doubtful that archaeology can tells us anything meaningful in this regard. When it comes to a balanced, healthy diet, you should listen to the experts : Eat lots of vegetables and fruit, choose whole grains, get your protein, and avoid highly processed foods, especially those with added sugar.

KC Ifeanyi,"Max Richter’s work has colored everything from ballets and operas, to TV shows and films including Black Mirror, The Leftovers, and the upcoming period drama Mary Queen of Scots. What’s unique about Richter is the fact that his creative output is matched only by his ambition. Whether he’s rescoring a seminal work like Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, composing an eight-hour lullaby, or using classical music as a form of political protest, there’s a fearlessness that’s come to define his career. “I think of my creative work as a set of experiments, moving from what you do know into a space that you don’t know,” Richter said during an interview for Creative Conversation. “And you explore that space by making work which steps out into it. So you’re in a pool of light and you’re stepping out into the dark and discovering stuff. It’s a process of inquiry, and that for me is really satisfying.” Below are highlights from the episode: Simplify your creative process “When I first went to [legendary composer Luciano Berio] I showed him a piano piece I’d written, which was the classic student composers piano piece: unbelievably hard, insanely difficult, written on like seven staves–really octopus type piano music. And, in a kind of a nice way, he just started making fun of it. It was interesting because a light went on for me. [He was] saying, what is it you’re actually trying to convey here? Why this? Rather than the piece as some sort of proof of a theory, what is it actually? What’s going on here on a human level?” Return to innocence “That childhood passion and involvement and being really submerged in something, that’s the kind of state I’m looking for all the time–and preserving that sense of magical possibility and wonder that children have. I think for artists, if you can stay connected to that, then you are in a good place.” Don’t let creative success pigeonhole you “Our very commercial sort of mindset, we’re used to relating to brands. So we turn an artist into a brand and then suddenly we just want more of that brand. And if they try and change, we get upset, which is crazy because the whole point about [creativity] is it’s unpredictable. It’s free. It goes beyond categories. I just really try to stay focused on what the material is wanting to do. My basic assumption is that no one will ever listen to it anyway. It’s fidelity to the material. That’s my contract–it’s me and the material. And if it connects with other people, I’m thrilled.” Looking to yourself for creative inspiration “We’ve all got stories to tell that no one else knows. We’ve all got this truly unique experience of being. So I would say cultivate that because then also you’re cultivating something which is very natural to you. Often, especially young artists, you feel like you should be doing something. And I think that can be very destructive because creativity is about connecting with the stuff that’s deep inside you and making something out of that.” Subscribe to Creative Conversation and Fast Company ‘s other podcast Secrets of the Most Productive People wherever you get your podcasts.","In the latest episode of Creative Conversation, Richter explains how he’s pushing his creativity to unfamiliar places–and why you should too.

She had a job that took her around the world, working on buzzy tech projects like ordering a soft drink from a vending machine with her cell phone. Then, everything screeched to a halt. A toxic bug bite led to a case of meningitis -- one from which doctors didn’t think she’d recover. She went to bed each night not certain she’d wake up, all the while wondering why the health system around her seemed so archaic and why ordering a soda with her phone was ever on her to-do list. She promised herself if she survived that she’d use her one life to help others. “It made me realize that if I was able to make it, that I needed to have my life be about not just changing my story, but changing other people’s stories,” says Richter. “I never knew what I was going to make it into. I just knew I needed to get started.” Related: Hear How This Woman Coached Herself Through a Near-Death Experience to Become a One-Person Fitness Brand Making this change wasn’t simple or quick. She gave herself space to recover -- and learn. She quit her job, went back to school for an MBA. Later, she’d move to Silicon Valley, to put herself in the home of biotech and get meeting and working with entrepreneurs in the life sciences to understand the gaps and how she could help bridge them. This restart meant living off her savings and downsizing to a small studio. She’d eventually move from a car, to a bike, to taking the bus, almost releasing parts of her old life to breath life into a new one. “It’s very humbling,” says Richter, “But it didn’t feel burdensome. Money, really, does nothing for you. You can let go it and you can get it back and you can redeploy.” Related: Podcast: When PowerPoints Weren't Working, This Powerful Exec Passed Out Comic Books Instead And she found herself tapping into traits she was first exposed to as a child in rural Canada, growing up in a humble household with eight brothers and sisters. “You don’t get stuck long,” she says. ”You figure out how to make it happen even if though you don’t have many resources.” And with no scientific training, she leveraged her upbringing and her tech background to craft a new model for entrepreneurs in the health sciences that would surround them with advisors but give them the freedom to focus on their work and help them innovate quickly. Fueling her was that sense of purpose she found waiting for answers on a hospital bed all those years ago, knowing she could help others going through what she had. “If you’re driven by something that’s very mission-based, very values-based, then you’re willing to buck the system.” Related: Related: Kathryn Minshew of The Muse: Decide Who You Are, or Have it Decided for You (Podcast) Today, Richter runs JLABs, a fast-growing incubator with eight sites locations in two counties, including a new outpost in New York City.

Bryan Menegus,"At approximately 8:30am today, the National Weather Service sent a test tsunami warning to an unknown number of people. It was not immediately obvious to some that the alert of an impending, destructive force of nature was a test—and at least one-third party app, AccuWeather, reportedly pushed it out as a genuine alert in multiple states. All morning, local NWS Twitter accounts have been trying to reduce the confusion their alert—in conjunction with the genuine panic caused by erroneous warnings from AccuWeather—has caused. Accuweather itself has restated that the NWS alert was a test, but has not clarified why it was not sent out as such by its mobile app. For what it’s worth, Tsunami.gov currently shows two earthquakes on the entire planet, and both are more than two Richter points shy of the 7.5 magnitude usually required to cause a tsunami. Historically, tsunamis almost never hit the East Coast of the US. This widespread piece of misinformation follows a false missile attack warning sent to residents of Hawaii last month, and precedes a congressional hearing “on the effectiveness of the emergency alert system” scheduled for 10am this morning.","At approximately 8:30am today, the National Weather Service sent a test tsunami warning to an unknown number of people.

Kellen Beck,"Characters from the Castlevania franchise are finally coming to Super Smash Bros. Simon Belmont and Richter Belmont from Castlevania and Castlevania: Rondo of Blood have entered the fray of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Nintendo revealed in a Nintendo Direct stream Wednesday. Along with those new characters, Nintendo showed off a handful of new and classic stages, items, echo fighters, and in-depth music options coming to the fighting game in December. SEE ALSO: Nintendo's 'Super Smash Bros.' has given me more joy than any other video game Here's the nearly 30-minute Direct in full: First, let's talk about the Castlevania additions. Not only are the two Belmonts coming to Smash with their vampire-hunting skills and whips, they are bringing with them an Alucard assist trophy and new gothic, Castlevania-inspired stage that features the occasional monster including a the rare appearance of Dracula himself. Richter (front) and Simon Belmont. Image: nintendo That new stage will include 34 Castlevania music tracks that you can listen to while you brawl. If you're a video game music lover like me, that's awesome news, but it's even better when you learn that Smash Ultimate will include over 800 music tracks. That's so many songs, and you can even create your own custom stage-specific playlists. And if you're really into video game music, you can plug your headphones into your Switch and listen to tracks while the Switch screen is turned off, kind of like an extra-large MP3 player. Along with the music options and Castlevania additions, Nintendo announced another new fighter: King K. Rool from the Donkey Kong franchise. Image: nintendo Plus, two new echo fighters (which are kind of like alternate skins for existing characters) are coming to Smash Ultimate : Dark Samus from Metroid and Chrom from Fire Emblem. Image: nintendo Stepping aside from new characters, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will contain over 100 new and classic stages, many of which have been tweaked to play a bit better. But don't worry, Nintendo didn't want to take away from that unmistakeable charm of the Nintendo 64 stages. Some of the new stages include a New Donk City Hall stage inspired by Super Mario Odyssey and a Magicant stage from Mother. And if you want to keep a more grounded feel while playing Smash Ultimate, you can change each stage to its omega (flat) or battlefield (flat with three platforms) version. Image: nintendo If you're into items and assist trophies, there were a whole bunch of those revealed too, including a bunch of Pokémon that will fight by your side like Alolan Exeggutor, Mimikyu, Solgaleo, and Lunala. Image: nintendo New items include a banana gun, a terrifying death scythe, an evil mushroom that reverses opponents' control, and a rage gun that does more damage the higher your own percent meter is. Assist trophies include Kapp'n from Animal Crossing, Chef Kawasaki from Kirby, Gray Fox from Metal Gear Solid, and Shovel Knight, who digs up food for you. Nintendo also revealed some new game modes and changes to gameplay, including the ability to charge Final Smash moves during matches and a new tournament mode for large groups of competitive-minded players.

Reuters Editorial,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia’s Cardinal George Pell, a former top adviser to Pope Francis, was remanded into custody on Wednesday after a sentence plea hearing on his conviction for sexually abusing two choir boys more than two decades ago. 
Pell will be formally sentenced on March 13. 
Pell faces a maximum of 10 years in jail for each of five child sex offences, which included indecent assault and one charge of sexual penetration. 
His lawyers have lodged an appeal against his conviction. 
Pell was found guilty of child sex abuse in December. The guilty verdict was revealed on Tuesday after a court suppression order was dropped. 
Judge Peter Kidd revoked Pell’s bail on Wednesday, granted for medical treatment after his 2018 trial, and he was immediately taken into custody at the end of the plea hearing. 
Pell, the Vatican’s former treasurer, is the most senior Catholic clergyman in the world to be convicted for child sex offences, an outcome that shocked the church and his supporters. 
“This offending warrants immediate imprisonment,” prosecutor Mark Gibson told the court on Wednesday. “It involved two vulnerable boys, given their age, 13.” 
Pell’s lawyer Robert Richter argued for a lenient sentence. 
Ten character references submitted for Pell describe him as a man of great passion, with a great sense of humor who could relate to everyone from prime ministers to street beggars, Richter told the court. 
“None of them believe he is capable of this,” Richter said.

Dana Goodyear,"Dear Mr. Richter, the letter began. I have been working on the idea for a feature film, about which I would like to talk to you, if you can make that possible. Could you give me an hour of your time? The author, the German filmmaker Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, had been trying to get in touch with Gerhard Richter for quite some time. Mutual acquaintances had refused to make an introduction; no one wanted to jeopardize a relationship with the man widely considered to be the greatest painter alive. So Donnersmarck, who is full of what Ulrich Mühe, the lead actor in Donnersmarcks first film, The Lives of Others, called implacable friendliness, resorted to mailing a handwritten letter to an address listed on Richters official Web site. A few days later, Richter responded, with an invitation to visit him in Cologne.
It had been almost a decade since The Lives of Others, which explores the Stasi surveillance of artists in the waning days of the German Democratic Republic, was awarded the 2006 Oscar for best foreign-language film. Like many European auteurs before him, Donnersmarck, who was thirty-three when he won, found himself drawn centripetally toward Hollywood. He and his wife, Christiane, a lawyer who oversaw the international operations of Creative Commons and now facilitates Donnersmarcks career, moved to Los Angeles with their three children. The family rented a nineteen-thirties estate in the Pacific Palisades, near the house where Thomas Mann once lived.
In 2009, Donnersmarck, an unabashed admirer of Hollywood maximalismhe heaps praise on The Terminatorco-wrote and directed a hundred-million-dollar studio movie, The Tourist, in which a spy and her lover, played by Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, evade both the Mafia and Scotland Yard in the canals of Venice. Critics had applauded the previous film; now many were dismayed. In the Times, Manohla Dargis was gently damning. It takes an exceptional director to prevent an entertainment as flimsy as this from collapsing under its own weightlessness, she wrote. The Tourist went on to earn two hundred and seventy-eight million dollars worldwide, but Donnersmarck wasnt eager to repeat the experience. It was a bit like you had stayed at a super-luxurious spa, he told me. Its beautiful and objectively great, but it feels hollow. I didnt have that feeling of: Only I can do this. His friends began to worry. I told him he should be careful not to lose too much time, Jan Mojto, who financed The Lives of Others, told me. He said, Between Thomas Manns Buddenbrooks and Royal Highness there are nearly ten years. I thought, Hes losing his mind, so better bring him back. Then Florian tells me, I have an idea. 
Donnersmarck had been looking for a way to illustrate, in film, the healing power of art. Over breakfast in Los Angeles, he explained how Richter had turned a life of profound trauma and loss into creative grist. This man has lived through everything imaginable, he told me. Hes lived through his mother being raped by the Russians, his father committing suicide, his aunt being euthanized, both of his uncles being killed on the Eastern Front, his childhood classmates being killed in the bombing of Dresden, the experience of incredible impoverishment. Yet he manages to take all these things and charge them, in his paintings, with this mystical energy that comes from the suffering. In this way, Donnersmarck said, art becomes an emblem of resilience, even productivity: It gives us that wonderful feeling that our suffering can be of use.
At eighty-six, Richter, known for an astonishingly diverse practice that includes photo-realistic portraits, Romantic landscapes, and conceptual abstractions, hovers numinously over German art, at once omnipresent and nowhere to be found. Born in Dresden in 1932, he lived through Nazism, the Second World War, and the Communist occupation, before defecting to the West in the nineteen-sixties. But, when faced with curiosity about his person and his work, he has often deployed John Cages witty dodge: I have nothing to say, and I am saying it. His life story is a meticulously concocted living text, mediated by his paintings, which tell a story of their own.
In the sixties, Richter started making his photo paintings, recognizable by a characteristic blur. The paintings purportedly represented random snapshots of strangers, and their generic titlesFamily at the Seaside, Mother and Childencouraged this reading. As Richter grew more prominent, he began to refer to cuckoos eggs, biographical truths hidden in his work. Still, when an interviewer asked about the seeming banality of his source material, he replied, Its all evasive action. Sometimes he explained himself by saying, My paintings know more than I do.
I believe that great art is deeply biographical, Donnersmarck told me. Anthony Minghella, the director of The Talented Mr. Ripley, one of Donnersmarcks favorite films, had no direct experience of American expats on the Italian Riviera, but he drew upon the oppressive class consciousness of his English childhood to lend authenticity to Tom Ripleys striving. Studying Richters work, Donnersmarck learned that he had taken unusual pains to control its reception. Since the sixties, Richter has been compiling his own catalogue raisonné, an official list of works usually assembled by scholars and curators. Furthermore, he started the clock on his uvre in 1962, after his arrival in the West, erasing a period as a prominent socialist-realist artist in the East, where he had been commissioned to paint murals extolling the ideals of the republic. He was someone who was quite guarded about his personal things, Donnersmarck told me. Although, on the other hand, its also partly that he just tells us hes guarded about his personal things. Taken together, he felt, Richters feints amounted to a pixelated portrait. Here was someone who never really told the full story, and was steering people in a certain way, he said. Donnersmarck had set out to research a master of visual representation; now he was beginning to view Richter as what he calls a master of narrative.
One painting in particular troubled Donnersmarck. Ema (Nude on a Staircase) depicts a luminous nude, Richters first wife, Ema Eufinger, who, as Richter later noted, bore a resemblance to Brigitte Bardot. Art historians contended that the image was part of Richters dialogue with Marcel Duchamp, who had ostentatiously quit painting after completing his own Nude Descending a Staircase, in 1912. But Donnersmarck suspected that there was something more than the anxiety of influence at work.
Richter typically dates his canvases with only the year; this one is marked May, 1966, as if the month held special significance. Where the previous photo paintings relied mostly on a gray-scale palette, Ema glows with nacreous pink skin and golden hairher body seems to shine from within, as one critic put it. In fact, she was pregnant, with Richters first child, Betty, who was born later that year and would become the subject of some of his most arresting portraits. It was the convergence of two detailsEmas pregnancy and the datethat stuck in Donnersmarcks mind, suggesting a mystery that he was determined to solve. I thought, O.K., Ive now read the major texts on him. Ive researched this thoroughly. Im very familiar with his work. I have to at least throw my theory at him and see how he reacts, he said. I was thinking that Id maybe be thrown out after half an hour.
In January of 2015, Donnersmarck showed up at Richters home. The most extraordinary thing happened, he said. I outlined to him what I planned to do, really just thinking Id glean from his reactionWas I on a completely crazy path, or was there something true about it? Surprisingly, Richter didnt turn him out. That first day, I ended up staying seven hours or so. After several more sessions, Donnersmarck said, I asked him, I have a good memory, but I dont remember everything. Do you mind if I record this? 
Donnersmarck grew up stringently Catholic, a choirboy, and he still attends Mass; as an artist, he frames his goals transgressively. His intention, he says, is to write like Im wiretapping a confession booth. He told me that Richter accepted his presence, though he suspected that Sabine Moritz, Richters third wife and former student, opposed it. Richter went so far as to allow him to accompany the couple on an anniversary trip to Dresden. He told me everythingtruly everythingabout his life, and was amazingly open, Donnersmarck said. I ended up staying for one month and recording this stuff, which really I think makes any biography of his completely obsolete.
During the next three years, Donnersmarck wrote and directed Never Look Away, an epic spanning three decades of German history. (The German title, Werk Ohne Autor, or Work Without Author, is a tag that critics in the seventies applied to Richters art, because of its seeming lack of subjectivity.) The film hews closely to Richters youthful experiences, particularly his first marriage, but leaves room for conflation and outright invention. Donnersmarcks protagonist, Kurt Barnert, is a sensitive and talented painter from the East who marries into a family that, while outwardly conforming to the new postwar politics, privately adheres to the most repulsive aspects of Nazi ideology. I didnt want it to be a bio-pic per se, Donnersmarck told me. Sticking exactly to every fact and chronology tends to weaken something. Citizen Kane would be a lesser film if it were called Citizen Hearst. 
Never Look Away is on the shortlist for a best foreign-language Oscar and opens in New York and Los Angeles on February 8th. When I met up with Donnersmarck this past fall, in L.A., shortly after the films German theatrical run, he was perturbed. A rift had opened between him and his subject. Suddenly, there was this statement from him, Donnersmarck said. Richter had not seen the film, but, hounded for comment by the German press, he had let slip that he found the trailer too reißerisch, or thriller-like. The insult stung, a rebuke of the intimate understanding that Donnersmarck had felt existed between them.
Not long ago, I wrote to Richter, asking if he could tell me about his interactions with Donnersmarck. To my surprise, he wrote back within a few days:
I thank you for your kind letter about the film of Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. To recall all the events, I had a look into the quite hefty folder regarding the case von Donnersmarck. Unfortunately, this visualization of all the facts caused such bad feelings, and my dislike of both the movie and the person grew so much again, that I find it impossible to give you an answer.
I hope for your understanding, but I cant help it.
With best regards,
Gerhard Richter
Donnersmarck is six feet nine, with a baby face and an accumulation of gray-blond curls that look ready to dump raina cherub and his cloud. He has storybook grandeur, and an expansive sense of time. He lets weeks pass between e-mails, then sends novellas. Our first breakfast lasted four and a half hours, and earned me two parking tickets. He was unusually interested in being a subject. Free analysis, he called it.
Courtly manners, a social necessity for a giant living among humans, are also the inheritance of a family that traces its nobility back six hundred years; he says that Donnersmarck, which he translates as Thunder Marrow, is the name that his Saxon ancestor Henckel was given by Kaiser Matthias in gratitude for funding a war against the Turks. Donnersmarck, a count, has a booming laugh. He speaks five languages, including Russian, and has a whippet named Tsarevich. It is hard to find a car that can accommodate his size, but he makes the best of it. For a while, he drove around Los Angeles in a vintage white Rolls-Royce, until the brakes gave out in the hills above Sunset Boulevard. You cant buy a car like that in Germany, Thomas Demand, a German artist who lives in Los Angeles and is close to Donnersmarck, says. You would look like a pimp.
During the Second World War, the bankable part of Donnersmarcks inheritance vanished behind the Iron Curtain, with family castles reduced to ruins. The familywhich Donnersmarck describes as too cultured to have been Naziswas uprooted. His grandfather, a doctor of philosophy specializing in Thomas Aquinas, was drafted at the end of the war, and immediately found an American to surrender to. His father, Leo Ferdinand, had spent his childhood preparing to take over the Donnersmarck mining and agricultural operations in Silesia, an area that was once easternmost Germany and is now largely in Poland. In 1945, notices went up in Silesia: all Germans had to vacate immediately, leaving the keys in their locks, on pain of death. Leo Ferdinand became, at the age of nine, a refugee.
Because of all the terrible suffering Germany caused in World War Two, there wasnt a lot of focus on what the German people suffered, understandably, Donnersmarck told me. But many people were apolitical, and suffered the way Richters family suffered, and the way mine did. Donnersmarcks mother, Anna-Maria, remembers being four, fleeing to relatives in the West. Our mother made it an adventure, she said. Women in that time, they were all heroes. They had the children, their husbands were dead or captive and the women were in Berlin. They cleaned up the whole city with their hands. They made a mountain where people go skiing now, formed from the dirt and stones from the war.
Donnersmarcks father was among the first in the family to need a job. He became an executive at Lufthansa, and when Florian was one and his brother, Sebastian, was three the family moved to Roosevelt Island, as part of a social experiment to establish an economically diverse colony on Welfare Island. Florian was so blond that women in the city would annoy him by touching his hair, and so tall that his mother brought along his passport when they ran errands, in order to prove that he was young enough to ride the bus for free.
Leo Ferdinand was deeply religious, traditional, and intellectual. Walking through a European capital with him was a master class in declinism. Donnersmarck said, He found it hard to remember the names of those who werent from Catholic noble families. Anna-Maria, on the other hand, had been active in the leftist student movement in West Berlin, and collected sophisticated people. Her best friend in New York was John White, an Austrian Jewish émigré who directed the City Opera and was a mentor to Florian. I grew up in a world in which the objective quantification of intelligence and eloquence and erudition was valued above all else, Donnersmarck told me. Sometimes he performed too well for his audiences taste. He was pretentious, Anna-Maria said. When he was thirteen, I took him to the opera in Frankfurt. How did you like it? I asked. He said, I liked it, but I could do it better. 
Anna-Maria had high standards for art, which extended to her sons output. She told me, When they made pictures, I did not put them on the fridge unless they were good, and they were very rarely good. There were not many pictures on my fridge. Florian thought I was too critical, too strict. I said, Florian, do you want me to lie to you? This is my influencethat he wants to prove that he is the best in the world to his critical mother. He got the gift from Leo Ferdinand, and from me the drive to prove me wrong.
Last winter, I went to see Donnersmarck in Berlin, where he was finishing postproduction on Never Look Away. It had been eight months since Id last seen him in Los Angeleswhen he had read me the entire three-and-a-half-hour screenplay, in the course of two daysand he had been working twenty hours a day on the film. (He is a sleepwalker, imperfectly cured. Only the first floor of a hotel is safe for him, and he sleeps with the lights on.) His hair had turned whiter and wilder, and I got the impression that hed been sustaining himself with editing-room chocolates.
In a comfortable sound studio, overlooking the River Spree, Donnersmarck was doing dialogue replacement, rerecording some two hundred lines that hadnt come out well during filming. It is tedious work for most people, but Donnersmarck relishes the chance to tune and polish flaws. Suddenly, you can heal all those little wounds, he says. Its very, very joyful. For a scene in which one character subversively advises another to mutter Drei liter instead of Heil Hitler, Donnersmarck instructed the actor on the precise quality of the stifled laugh he was after. We have to bring up some of your tonality a notch, he said. It needs to be more nasal. It wants it to be more coming from the throat, so its rattling more. Try to do it as if youre just about to clear your throat, a bit more pressure.
Later that afternoon, the actor Sebastian Koch came to the studio. Koch, who played a writer under surveillance in The Lives of Others, returns in Never Look Away as Barnerts sinister father-in-law. In the scene that they were working on, he orders Barnert to paint his portrait. To prepare Koch for the line that needed to be replaced, Donnersmarck said, Du hast ein neues sujet, emphasizing certain words in the way of a choral conductor tweaking the phrasing of a song. Feel in yourself how superior you are compared to Kurt, he said. Be really aloof, almost arrogant: I descend to your pitiful way of life by even talking to you.  Koch told me later, Hes fully formed as a perfectionist. As in, Well do it again. No, well do it again. He believes strongly that, if an actor thinks something wrong, he can read those thoughts.
As Koch got ready for another line, Donnersmarck told him, Youre worried, and it should come through in your whole demeanor, but youre still controlled and that means your breathing is steady, yet there is a certain nervousness about it. Koch, visible through a glass wall in an adjacent sound booth, jumped up and down and fluttered his lips. Fifteen or twenty takes later, Donnersmarck quickly said, Sehr schön, and moved on.
In the evening, as the city turned pale, Donnersmarck and I got into a taxi. Youre best behind the driver, he said, as he claimed the front passenger side for himself, pushing the seat all the way back and reclining it as far as it could go. Its a very ungallant way to ride, but the only way it works, he said. We were going to meet his mother. I asked if I should call her Mrs. Donnersmarck. He said,  Mrs. is wrong. The correct formal address would be Countess Henckel. But shell want you to call her Anna-Maria. My mother is a big all-women-are-sisters kind of woman.
Leo Ferdinand died nearly a decade ago, and Anna-Maria, who has shoulder-length blond hair and vivid blue eyes, lives in a cozy apartment in Charlottenburg, the Upper East Side of West Berlin. Above the coatrack hangs a portrait of an ancestor Anna-Maria calls the family prince, a rake who married a French courtesan and built her a castle in Silesia, which was bombed by the Russians. Its like Gone with the Wind,  Anna-Maria told me. Nobody has any money anymore. They all work.
Anna-Maria showed us to the living room, where Donnersmarcks brother, Sebastian, a physics teacher at a high school in Berlin, was sitting. On a coffee table was a silver tray filled with dishes of macadamia nuts, malt balls, mini-Snickers, and sugary wafers. When Donnersmarck reached for a Snickers, his mother shot him a reproving look. Nicht gut für dich, she said. He ignored her, and took a wafer, too. She brought a board with rye bread and sliced ham. My big child should eat something, she exhorted him.
After leaving Roosevelt Island in 1981, the family moved to Berlin, a jarring experience for the two boys. My brother and I felt like wed been thrown into a harsher, colder, and poorer place, Donnersmarck said. All the American products wed grown up with were sold in stores here that you couldnt access as a German citizen. The American military areas were cordoned off. Those people could buy marshmallows and peanut butter.
American movies offered a reprieve and a way back, even if they were shown a year after release. The brothers, both tall, with long hair, would dress as girls so that they looked old enough to sneak into Clint Eastwood movies. Sebastian said, We grew up on Star Wars and Indiana Jones.  Anna-Maria turned to Florian. I pushed you into exhibitions, opera, theatre, she said. You hated exhibitions. Florian shrugged, and changed the subject. Seeing art with his parents, he later explained, was complicated. For a Catholic boy, the bald eroticism of German art in the eighties was both liberating and confusing. Small wonder if he squirmed in front of a self-portrait of an artist fellating himself. I asked Anna-Maria if he had evinced any inclination toward art. Not a bit, she said. He was always interested in psychoanalysis.
Donnersmarck attended Oxford, and, egged on by his brother, entered an essay-writing contest whose first prize was an apprenticeship with Richard Attenborough. He won. As he walked from the studio to the train station each day, Attenborough would pass in a beautiful Rolls-Royce. I always thought that one day he would pick me up, Donnersmarck says. He never did. I remember thinking, If I ever make enough money, Ill get exactly that car.
After university, Donnersmarck went to film school in Munich. In a book about The Lives of Others, he wrote that, while struggling to come up with movie premises for an assignment, he put on a recording of the Russian pianist Emil Gilels playing the Moonlight Sonata. While listening, he remembered reading that Lenin once said that, until his revolution was complete, he would not permit himself to listen to Beethovens Appassionata, because it inspired him to stroke the heads of people rather than to strike, strike pitilessly. Donnersmarck began to wonder how history might have been different if Lenin had been compelled to hear that music. An image forced itself into my mind, he wrote. A medium shot of a man in a desolate room; he has headphones over his ears through which comes the sound of wonderful music. This imagea listener overhearing something that might make him abandon his deepest beliefsgave rise to The Lives of Others, which became Donnersmarcks thesis project and, eight years later, his first feature.
The Lives of Others centers on Gerd Wiesler, a Stasi surveillance specialist, assigned to eavesdrop on a celebrated playwright and his actress girlfriend, who is the romantic obsession of a powerful Central Committee minister. Wiesler wires the couples apartment and installs himself in the attic of the building. The playwright believes in the basic righteousness of the German Democratic Republic, while his closest friends are punished for their doubts. When one of them commits suicide, he becomes disillusioned, and, convinced that his apartment is the last unbugged place in East Berlin, starts writing a treatise against the government, to be published in the West. Listening in, Wiesler finds his own loyalties shifting, and alters his reports to protect his subject. But, in a skillfully turned plot, the actress, having spurned the rapacious minister, is threatened by the Stasi and begins informing on the playwright, betraying what Wiesler has withheld.
The life story of the poet and songwriter Wolf Biermann echoes through The Lives of Others. Biermann, a Bob Dylan of the G.D.R., was placed under house arrest and banned from publishing. According to Donnersmarck, Biermann was among the first Germans to seek out his Stasi files after reunification. Biermann, who published parts of the files, has written that they contained a plan for how to ruin him, including destruction of all love relationships and friendships and faulty medical treatment. Donnersmarck read the published files, and managed to find and interview at length the agent who oversaw the investigation of Biermann. Like Wiesler in the film, the agent was a model of ideological correctness. Donnersmarck says that even twelve years after the Wall came down the agent was unsure what he was allowed to say about Biermann. He was, like, By what laws am I bound right now? Can I tell you details about this guys sex life? I was sworn to secrecy by a government that no longer exists,  Donnersmarck told me. It was total confusion of information loyalties, but he ended up telling me everything.
Biermann was far less forthcoming. Donnersmarck thought that he might gain entrée through Anna-Maria, who, in her student-movement days, had visited Biermann when he was under house arrest. But Biermann ignored his entreaties. So Donnersmarck, relentless, approached him in the book-signing line after a reading. I know exactly who you are, Donnersmarck recalled his saying. And Ill tell you one thing: If Im going to say something about the Stasi, Im going to say it myself.
The Lives of Others created controversy in Germany. Ulrich Mühe, who played Wiesler, had been a theatre actor in the East. When the film was released, he disclosed that he had read his own Stasi file, and found evidence that his former wife had served as an informant. (The documents, Donnersmarck says, showed that she had even asked the states permission before marrying him.) To critics, the revelation seemed to be part of a cynical marketing campaign. Mühes ex-wife sued him for libel and won, despite the documentation. Mühe, who had developed ulcers as a young man when conscripted as a border guard, died of stomach cancer soon afterward.
Easterners who had been oppressed by the Stasi found the character of the agent too sympathetic; those who hadnt been oppressed said the whole thing was sensationalized. Donnersmarcks experience of the East was limited to teen-age excursions through the checkpoint with his parents, to visit his mothers childhood friends. It embarrasses him now to remember how he and his brother, alert to the injustices suffered by fellow-Germans, would roll down the car windows and call out the lyrics of a popular song, Thoughts are free! No one can ever know them, no one can hunt them down! He was sixteen when the Wall fell, detractors often noted: What could Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck from West Berlin know about the G.D.R.?
I still meet people from the East who say, This is not a good film,  Sebastian Koch told me. But point for point they cant explain why not. The Lives of Others was denied a competition spot at the Berlin Film Festival, at Cannes, and at Venice. It made its première at Telluride, and, after winning the Oscar, became, with Das Boot, the most successful German-language film in history. It was loved everywhere except here, Koch said.
Biermann, however, praised the film. The political tone is authentic, I was moved by the plot, he wrote. But why? Perhaps I was just won over sentimentally, because of the seductive mass of details that look like they were lifted from my own past. Or maybe Biermann had already made his peace with up-close observation. In the seventies, not long before he was exiled while on tour in the West, he wrote The Stasi Ballad. Its refrain, Stasi is my Eckermann, refers to Goethes compulsive assistant, who documented his every utterance. Its an amazing ballad, where he said how incredibly grateful he is to the Stasi for recording everything he ever said for posterity, Donnersmarck told me. Theyre trying to destroy his life, but at least theyre paying attention, in the way that every artist wants people to pay attention.
Richters cuckoos eggs serve as a test of attentiveness: Did you catch that? One of his earliest photo paintings, a tender black-and-white portrait of a teen-age girl holding a baby, was first exhibited with the unremarkable title Mother and Child. It could be any mother and child, Dietmar Elger, the director of Richters archive and the writer of his authorized biography, told me. In the beginning, in the sixties, he was hesitating about making his art too personal. Later, Richter renamed the painting Aunt Marianne, and over time it emerged that the woman it depicted was his mothers younger sister. The baby was the artist himself, at three months old.
Richter, at eighty-six, hovers numinously over German art, omnipresent but resistant to inquiries about his life or his work. When pressed, he has often deployed John Cages witty dodge: I have nothing to say, and I am saying it.

Marianne Schönfelder, Richters aunt, was a delicate, attractive girl, who, by the time she was twenty, had been institutionalized with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Mental illness was a dangerous label to wear in Nazi Germany. Mentally ill and physically and intellectually disabled women were subjected to forced sterilization, and in 1940 the government established a medical-murder program, with six execution centers, equipped with showers, to destroy them. By 1941, when Hitler shut the gassing program down, some thirty-five thousand women had been killed at these sites, in what Donnersmarck described to me as a dress rehearsal for the greatest crime in history. By the end of the war, at least a hundred thousand women deemed unfit for procreation had been exterminated.
In 1938, Schönfelder was committed to a psychiatric nursing home in the eastern state of Saxony, not far from the town where Richters family had moved. While a patient there, she was involuntarily sterilized; later, she was transferred to a psychiatric hospital, where she was deliberately starved to death in 1945, and buried in a mass grave.
In a childhood riven by catastrophe, the tragedy of Aunt Marianne held a special place. According to Jürgen Schreiber, an investigative journalist who wrote a biography of Richter in 2005, she loomed over the household. If Gerd was unruly, Schreiber wrote, his mother would threaten him, Youll end up like Aunt Marianne.  On Richters Web site, where his works are categorized according to subjectClouds, Candles, Families, Aeroplanes, Snowscapes, Nudesthe Aunt Marianne painting falls under the heading Death.
While at art school, in Dresden, Richter met another Marianne, a fashion student nicknamed Ema, whose father was a prominent ob-gyn. The couple, who married in 1957, lived at her fathers house in Dresden. In the course of researching his book, Schreiber visited the house, and made a significant discovery. A woman came to me and said, Here lived a super-Nazi!  he wrote to me in an e-mail. I was highly alarmed. And then I started a new investigation.
In the federal archives, Schreiber discovered that Emas father, Heinrich Eufinger, had served as a lieutenant colonel in the S.S., Hitlers racial élite, a leadership squad entrusted with executing his Final Solution. Eufingers files referred to him as an irreproachable SS-man, who was meticulous about proving his Aryan ancestry. Later, when Eufinger was promoted and assigned to care for future S.S. wives in Saxony, he evaluated them for their suitability for marriage among members of the S.S.; to his superiors, he recommended a more exacting process, including a gynecological exam and, for the prospective groom, a mandatory sperm count. Otherwise, Eufinger wrote, no certainty can ever be obtained as to the effective functioning of the procreative organs.
For nearly a decade, until he was arrested by the Russians in 1945, Eufinger served as the director of Friedrichstadt Hospital, in Saxony, where nearly a thousand women were forcibly sterilized, most of them by him. The youngest victim was eleven years old. Eufinger did not perform Schönfelders sterilizationthat task was carried out by the doctor who had delivered Richter.
As Eufinger would surely have known, sterilization was a station on the road to death. Many of the women sterilized at Friedrichstadt Hospital were subsequently murdered by the state. After the war, other physicians from the regionincluding the doctor who oversaw Schönfelders casewere tried in Dresden for crimes against humanity, and some were sentenced to death. Eufinger, however, went on to have a distinguished career in the G.D.R. and then, after emigrating, in West Germany. Until Schreibers reporting, his portrait still hung on the wall of Friedrichstadt Hospital.
The natural question to ask is: What did Richter know? (Richter told Schreiber that Ema had seen her father preening before the mirror in his S.S. uniform and been appalled.) In Richters case, the more relevant question may be: What did his paintings know? Richter and Ema defected to the West in 1961, shortly before the Wall went up. Among the few possessions Richter took ",,,,,,,,,,0
ith him was an album filled with family pictures, which he soon started to use as source material.,,,,,,,,,,0
Within two years of painting Aunt Marianne, Richter painted his father-in-law, as well as an architect of the euthanasia program, who killed himself rather than face a war-crimes tribunal. The father-in-law painting is Family at the Seaside. Grotesquely, it depicts Eufinger at the beach with Ema, her sister, and one of his patients, all grinning in their bathing suits, around the time that Schönfelder was sterilized. Elger, Richters archivist, told me that the association among the three subjectsfather-in-law,0
Donnersmarck takes literally the idea that Richters paintings know something, and are trying to tell us, in spite of their authors confounding trail of crumbs. The things that are the most obvious and the most clear should never be forgotten, he said. If you look at Richters catalogue raisonné, you will see all the photo paintings. Suddenly, at the end, comes the largest paintingthe one of Ema descending the staircase nude. He says himself that its his wife, pregnant. Then you say, wait a minute, theyre thirty-four, which is very late for that generation,0
According to Donnersmarck, in order to elicit the most candor from Richter, he offered a strategy for presentation. When the time came, Donnersmarck wouldnt say what in the film was true and Richter wouldnt say what wasnt. While filming was under way, Donnersmarck wrote to Richter about his plans: Whenever the conversation turns to you, I will say that it is specifically not a bio-pic of Gerhard Richter but the story of the fictional painter Kurt Barnert. I will call the film something like a spiritual biography of our country, which was enriched by the biographies of other artists as well. I will say that the elements of your biography were merely the starting point for a free, fictionalized, story. He went on, As for things that are shown in the movie because you told me about them and that are not commonly known anyway and matters of public record, I will of course continue to be silent about them. May the journalists speculate over what is truth and what is fiction!,0
To me, Donnersmarck said, Unless he decides to reveal something thats true, which under the arrangement is permissible, he can always hide behind the fact that I invented things, and I can always hide behind the fact that something invented could be true. The understanding was precariousa touchy matter, Donnersmarck saidbut it had implicit safeguards. Richter could disown the film, and Donnersmarck could validate his sourcing. All this information is from Richter, he explained. He knows that I have all this incredibly sensitive stuff on tape. A lot of it involves his first wife, whos still alive, and has a right to privacy. (The former Ema Eufinger now runs a secondhand-clothing store in Düsseldorf and never discusses Herr Richter.) Its changed enough that one can say,0
Donnersmarcks hero, Kurt Barnert, has been profoundly affected by the death of his aunt, a psychiatric patient first sterilized and then murdered by the Nazis. At art school in Dresden, he falls in love with and marries a fellow-student, only to learn that her father, a former member of the S.S., is the doctor who presided over the aunts treatment, condemning her to death with a flick of his red pencil. Terrifyingly, the father-in-law, who sees Barnert as genetically undesirable,0
As a young artist, Richter was interested in the lottery: an everyday example of random elements acquiring unassailable significance. When Schreiber was researching the biography, Richter found his discoveries fascinating. He marvelled at the details of his father-in-laws S.S. past and, in particular, his participation in the sterilization program. Elger, the archivist, told me that Richter had coöperated closely with Schreiber, sharing unseen pictures and private family stories. But after the book came out Richter was not so happy, Elger said. Schreiber made it a crime story, made too much out of it. He made a lot of connections, put everything together. He lived on this street andsurprise,0
Richters provisional acceptance of interlopers, Donnersmarck believes, is rooted in his practice as an artist and in his psychology. He was both thrilled and shocked by Schreibers book, Donnersmarck said. Though he gave him quite a lot of access, he now considers him an enemy. Richter does not generally insist on propriety: he has painted, from magazine and newspaper images, murder victims, suicides, and Jackie Kennedy weeping at J.F.K.s funeral. He himself is so phenomenally indiscreet in his artoverstepping boundaries, overreaching, Donnersmarck said. Theres a German word,0
Donnersmarck knew that he had to tread carefully when he began interviewing Richter. All the factual information I was using was from Schreiber, and he knew that, he told me. But he expressed such incredible anger at Schreiber that I had to pretend that it came to me from the Holy Spirit. I was the Virgin Mary, impregnated by these facts out of nowhere.,,,,,,,,0
For an artist like Richter, whose sources are deeply biographical, inviting others to collaborate on the story of his life may be both irresistible and highly dangerous. Donnersmarck read the screenplay to Richter, as he did to me; in his view, Richter, frailer than when he had sat for the interviews, was profoundly moved. But he refused to go to a theatre to see the finished film. He said, Can you send me the DVD?  Donnersmarck recalled. I said, No, Ill rent you a theatre. Its like me saying I want to see a painting of yours on a stamp. ,,0
The relationship, which started off with such unexpected warmth, chilled as Donnersmarcks project came to fruition. Schreiber, for one, was unsurprised. Richters reactions to my book and to the film are equal, he wrote to me. First, he was happy and told me on the phone that a friend had told him, Now you have a biography like Picasso. Later, he was complaining.,,,0
After receiving Richters letter about the case von Donnersmarck, I wrote to him again, hoping to understand what had happened. He replied:,,,,,,,,,0
What to sayvery soon after his first or second visit I told him clearly that I would not approve of a movie about Gerhard Richter. I also suggested that the protagonist might have another profession, like a writer or a musician for example, as the family history that he wanted to tell did not necessarily need a painter as such. He left all his options open and I gave him something in writing stating that he was explicitly not allowed to use or publish either my name or any of my paintings. He reassured me to respect my wishes.,,,,,,,,,0
But in reality, he has done everything to link my name to his movie, and the press was helping him to the best of its ability. Fortunately, the most important newspapers here reviewed his concoction very skeptically and critically. Nevertheless, he managed to abuse and grossly distort my biography! I dont want to say more about this.,,,,,,,0
Elger told me, I would say, after the Schreiber book, he makes the same mistake twice. He went on, Hes interested in things like this, maybe. Donnersmarck, he knows how to approach people. Hes very smart, hes very gentle, like these film people are. They know how to get people to give them money. Donnersmarck, the Oscar winner, wants to talk to you. He wrote this letter by himself. Gerhard called him. They met. I dont really know why he let that in. He was so charming,0
Sometimes Donnersmarcks children play What superpower would you most want to have? The children wish that they could fly, or walk through walls, or turn invisible. No, he tells them, the only superpower you really need is the ability to read minds.,,,,,,,0
Interviewing Richter, Donnersmarck felt that he was coming close to a profound truth, and also that Moritz, Richters wife, might at any moment cut him off. He wished he could overhear their evening debriefing, in order to understand his prospects for continuing. One night, after leaving Richter, Donnersmarck turned on his phone and found a voice mail from him: a pocket dial. He listened to the sound of Richter walking down the corridor, calling his dog, Leica, and then sitting down with his wife and telling her about the days interview. It was as close to wiretapping the confession booth as Donnersmarck could hope to get,0
When I met up with Donnersmarck for lunch in Los Angeles, in December, and asked what he had heard Richter say, he told me, That is truly fruit of the poisonous tree. He was preparing for the films American release and hunting for a new house. The family had been based in Munich, with the kids accompanying Donnersmarck on location, while he made the film. He looked restedtrim, with his hair now darker and tamed. Even though it was wonderful and very useful fruit, even though it made it possible for me to continue interviews with him for a very long time, because I had a ten times better counterargument against anything his wife was objecting to. Now that he feels Richter turning against him, the recording is a comfort to his conscience.,0
When I told him what Richter had written, that he had explicitly objected to the films being about a painter, Donnersmarck was taken aback. Richter had listened to the screenplay, and even raised the possibility of making the paintings for the film himselfa notion that Donnersmarck, imagining long delays and the nightmare of insuring millions of dollars worth of original art, had declined. (Richter denies making this suggestion.) Instead, Donnersmarck hired one of Richters former assistants to re-create key works. It was a pity, he said, that I had not been able to get Richter to open up to me more, show the real self he had revealed during their interviews. What he was doing now was obfuscating, an octopus in a cloud of ink. I thought he would simply stay quiet publicly,0
At a public event not long ago, Donnersmarck told the audience, Any work that resonates in some way can only be autobiographical. It just comes in different crypto-forms. Only once the film came out was the hazard of the arrangement between Donnersmarck and Richter laid bare. Just as photographs replace and alter memoriesa transubstantiation that Richter complicates in his photo paintingsso, too, do films tend to replace facts. The details that Richter had shared with Donnersmarck, and those he had gleaned from Schreibers biography, made the inventions seem real. So many details were taken from his history, and on the other side there were so many things that were alternative facts, as you say in the States, Elger said. If you have fifty per cent historical details from Richters life, you think the others are true. You cant differentiate between what is true and what is not true.,0
In a Richter-like gesture, Donnersmarck had freighted the film with hidden meaning. I put in a lot of what computer-game programmers call Easter eggs, things only he would be able to decipher, little love letters to him, he told me. Its too bad he didnt see it, but I can understand it a little bit. If I imagine someone taking my life story and putting a spin on it, either it would be super-painful, because it would be so close to these painful chapters in my life, or it would be painful because it was not close enough. Richters story was complex and difficult; Donnersmarck could not truly fault him for wanting to maintain control of it. He said, Maybe the film is for everybody except him.,,0
Donnersmarck and I exchanged many letters in the next few weeks. He wanted to make sure that I had his motivations straightthat his goal was to exalt Richter, not to diminish him. If my film did not portray him as the hero, I would feel on morally problematic territory, he told me. It does portray him as a hero. Wouldnt you say?,,,,,,,,0
Charting the underpinnings of ones own creative impulses is a murky, perhaps counterproductive, business. Thats what interpretersjournalists, biographers, filmmakers, shrinksare for. Its impossible to do it for your own work, Donnersmarck told me at lunch. Even Richter cant do it for his own work. Thats why he wants Schreiber and me. In a certain way, Im being his analyst. And hes the kind of patient who can get super pissed-off at his analysts. In a way, the fact that he gets so super pissed-off at us shows that were pointing toward something correct. I think hes kind of, in a weird way, addicted to this type of analysis.,0
In the course of verifying details of his life for this piece, Richter declined to entertain Donnersmarcks ideas about the significance of the Ema painting. Ill leave that to the art historians to figure out, he said. He did allow that Emas father had been her gynecologist, and that there were mysteries and rumors around the treatment that he provided her. But that, he said, was not his story to tell. As for his time with Donnersmarck, Richter had not enjoyed hearing the screenplay read aloud. The only part of the encounters he took pleasure in was the tactful, penetrating questioning of the interviews. That had touched him deeply. Richter said," He was like a psychoanalyst.""","Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s new movie, inspired by Gerhard Richter, blurs the line between fiction and biography.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"Our city has a long history of attacks involving explosive devices. Here are just a few of them: The Black Tom Explosion. Black Tom is the name of an island near the Statue of Liberty that was a major munitions depot during World War I. On the night of July 30, 1916, there was an explosion on the island that was so forceful it registered as a 5.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale. Five people were killed. The culprits were German agents. The Wall Street Bombing. In September 1920, someone parked a horse-drawn cart loaded with explosives in front of the J. P. Morgan &amp; Company bank headquarters. The blast that went off around noon killed 30 people and wounded hundreds. The police never charged anyone in the attack. You can still see small craters from the shrapnel on the exterior of the building at 23 Wall Street. The Mad Bomber.

Caroline Bologna,"It’s no secret parents are some of the funniest people on Twitter. Indeed, having kids provides endless comedy fodder. Andy Richter knows this to be true. Best known as Conan O’Brien’s sidekick, the comedian has a 17-year-old son, William, and 12-year-old daughter, Mercy. Richter frequently tweets hilarious musings and anecdotes from his adventures in fatherhood. Below, we’ve rounded up some of his funniest and most irreverent parenting tweets from over the years.

Andrew Freedman,"A magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck about 170 miles southeast of Kodiak, Alaska early Tuesday morning, sending residents of the picturesque island fleeing to higher ground to avoid tsunami waves. The quake also prompted tsunami alerts along the West Coast of the U.S. and Hawaii, but those were canceled after data showed damaging waves were not expected. Since the first quake hit there have been several aftershocks, some of which have been strong earthquakes themselves, with a magnitude of up to 5.3 on the Richter Scale. Reports indicated water fluctuating by up to 1 foot in a channel that feeds into Kodiak Harbor, but no large, damaging waves. SEE ALSO: 2017 was one of Earth's top 3 hottest years on record, which should come as no surprise Tsunamis are caused by earthquakes, when sudden shifts in the seafloor displace enough water to set in motion waves at the surface that can travel across an ocean in a matter of hours. The magnitude 7.9 earthquake occurred along a ""strike-slip"" fault, where two plates grind past one another. These earthquakes don't typically give rise to large tsunamis, since they tend to involve horizontal, rather than vertical, motion. This morning's 7.9 earthquake occurred along a strike-slip fault.

Tom McKay,"North Korea’s infamous nuclear test site, a facility in Punggye-ri in Kilju County, has long been reported to maintain the standards one might expect for a pariah government low on everything but zeal and weaponry. Outsiders can only get a limited picture of the country, let alone the test site, thanks to its isolation from the rest of the world. But concerns have included tunnel collapses at the facility and the possibility Mount Mantap, where it is located, could implode under stress from repeated nuclear tests and release large amounts of radiation. Per NBC News, some defectors say that radiation emanating from the Punggye-ri test site could be the cause of “ghost disease” ravaging the area, causing sicknesses like leukemia and birth deformities. Some 30 people who lived in the region are being tested by the South Korean government for signs of radiation poisoning, but so far authorities haven’t publicly released any information indicating the claims are true. “We thought we were dying because we were poor and we ate badly,” defector Lee Jeong Hwa, who fled North Korea in 2013, told NBC News. “Now we know it was the radiation.” As NBC noted, North Korea has only been testing nuclear weapons since 2006, when the country successfully detonated a bomb that registered 4.2 magnitude on the Richter scale. Tales of “trout dying in the mountain streams and the area’s prized pine mushrooms disappearing” began long before then, some as early as the 1980s, suggesting other military activities could be responsible for contaminating the county with some form of toxin. James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies scientist Ferenc Dalnoki-Veress told NBC that neighboring governments maintain equipment to detect the release of radiation, and that nothing particularly abnormal has shown up. He said that one incident in which authorities detected a small amount of xenon gas, a radionuclide, five days after the alleged test of a hydrogen bomb in September was “very, very unlikely” to have arisen from a detonation or leak from Punggye-ri; Dalnoki-Veress also ruled out groundwater contamination from the testing, saying it could have leaked via steam vents. Previous analysis by AccuWeather has concluded North Korean nuclear tests tend to be held when wind conditions are light, which could keep radioactive material from being dispersed outside its borders. At other times, regional newspapers have reported accounts of soldiers being treated for exposure following detonations. Chinese nuclear expert Wei Shijie told the Telegraph some kind of accident was probably “inevitable,” and “It is just a matter of time to detect it, because there are cracks on mountains where radioactive substances will leak.” [ NBC News ]","North Korea’s infamous nuclear test site, a facility in Punggye-ri in Kilju County, has long been reported to maintain the standards one might expect for a pariah government low on everything but zeal and weaponry.

 George Pell is the most senior Catholic cleric to be convicted of such crimes
Reporting on a secret trial can be confronting and confusing. 
For several months, journalists like me have been going back and forth to Melbourne's County Court, unable to broadcast what we'd learnt about George Pell's crimes. 
Now the suppression order on the case has been lifted, those details can finally be made public. 
Outside court, there was at times high drama - all the sound and fury of cameramen jostling and campaigners brandishing placards at the cardinal as he arrived. 
But after the initial hearings, the crowds and the cameras petered out, and the cardinal no longer needed a police escort to sweep him into the building. 
Inside court, things also settled into a predictable routine. 
George Pell would sit in the dock with his notebook, listening, writing, but never really betraying any emotion.
He was excused from standing due to a knee injury, and often sat with his legs stretched out. 
He wasn't called to give evidence, and so we didn't hear a word from him for the majority of the trial.
As the court heard vivid descriptions of how in 1996 he had forced himself upon two victims, pushing his archbishop's robes to one side in order to expose himself, he didn't flinch.
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 Pell's case has drawn huge attention around the world
The jury was told how one young boy had pleaded for Pell to let him go - only to be shocked into a silence that would last for decades. 
Pell's defence barrister is one of Australia's most experienced and expensive lawyers - his speeches focused on areas of doubt. 
Robert Richter QC repeated over and over how highly improbable - if not impossible - it would have been for any of the abuse to have occurred. 
Instead, he insisted that his client had become a scapegoat for the crimes of other Catholic clerics.
At one stage, Mr Richter even referred to Pell as ""the Darth Vader of the Catholic Church"", painting him as a bold leader vilified by the media. 
Pell certainly has his critics - some came to the court to watch and see him in the dock. 
Although the proceedings couldn't be reported, there was nothing to stop members of the public coming in to listen. 
Campaigners and abuse survivors sat mixed in with the media, some sighing as they heard accounts of the abuse.
Some of Pell's supporters attended too, sending sympathetic smiles in his direction, and exchanging small talk as he went in and out of the court. 
After two trials, one hung jury and many months of waiting - the results of this long process are now public. 
The pace of justice has felt slow at times, but it has resulted in one of the Catholic Church's most prominent and powerful figures being held to account.",The high drama of the first days of the case gave way to sighs that had to be contained in a secret trial.,2019-02-26T02:56:36Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",George Pell: Reporting on a secret trial about child sex abuse,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-47353907,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14617/production/_105797438_gettyimages-953254092.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Richter,0
Kristen V. Brown,"Recent advancements in science and medicine have put cures within reach for diseases that have long plagued humankind. In a recent report, though, Goldman Sachs analysts posed an uncomfortable question that quickly sparked criticism. “Is curing patients a sustainable business model?” analysts asked in an April 10 report entitled “The Genome Revolution,” which CNBC first reported. One-and-done cures enabled by gene editing, analyst Salveen Richter wrote in the note to clients this week, are near-miraculous innovations that stand to benefit patients immensely. But they also present a challenge to business. “While this proposition carries tremendous value for patients and society, it could represent a challenge for genome medicine developers looking for sustained cash flow,” he wrote. The trouble is, it’s hard to reap long-term profits when you’re actually curing the patients who would buy your treatment. The report points to Gilead’s treatments for hepatitis C, which cure more than 90 percent of patients. In 2015, at the height of sales, US sales of the drug hit $12.5 billion. But as people have been cured, sales have fallen. Goldman estimates US sales for Gilead’s hepatitis C treatments will be less than $4 billion this year. “[Gilead] is a case in point, where the success of its hepatitis C franchise has gradually exhausted the available pool of treatable patients,” the analyst wrote. “In the case of infectious diseases such as hepatitis C, curing existing patients also decreases the number of carriers able to transmit the virus to new patients, thus the incident pool also declines… Where an incident pool remains stable (eg, in cancer) the potential for a cure poses less risk to the sustainability of a franchise.” Cutting-edge gene therapies, which are often pitched as one-time cures and on top of that often target small groups of patients, present the same risk. The MIT Tech Review points out that that this may have been the impetus behind GlaxoSmithKline’s announcement today that it will sell off its pipeline of gene therapies for rare disease to London gene-therapy upstart Orchard Therapeutics for a 20 percent stake in the company. One of those therapies is Strimvelis, a cure for a rare immune deficiency often called “bubble boy” disease. But even with the hefty price of $665,000, the small patient population means that the cure didn’t look like it would amount to much of a business. It’s a callous calculation, and it shows that bringing to fruition the promises of the gene-editing revolution will take a lot more than mere scientific breakthroughs.",Recent advancements in science and medicine have put cures within reach for diseases that have long plagued humankind.

Kellen Beck,"There are 11 brand new fighters in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and almost all of them kicked my ass. As I spent dozens of hours playing Ultimate in the last week, I unlocked tons of new fighters, including all of the new additions to the game from Chrom to Simon. Some of them gave me a really hard time in our one-on-one duels, and some of them infuriated me as they blasted my fighters off the stage time and time again. SEE ALSO: 'Super Smash Bros. Ultimate' is exceptional in every way Of course some of them were pretty easy. I am, after all, a lifelong Smash player and have the capacity to beat bots on a first attempt. But a surprising number of newcomers forced me into a second round. This is by no means a power ranking of new Smash fighters. No. This is personal. 11. Ken Ken isn't even that good at fighting. Image: nintendo I beat Ken so easily it was honestly embarrassing for him. This Street Fighter legend came at me with basically nothing and I wiped the floor with him. I felt bad. I didn't even take more than like 20% in damage. For someone who has spent his whole life doing martial arts, he sure didn't put up much of a fight. 10. Isabelle She did her best. Image: nintendo Oh Isabelle, when I saw you were going to be participating in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate I was excited. But then when I faced you one-on-one on the Animal Crossing stage and punched you so hard you exploded off-screen I felt bad. Isabelle's attacks involve trying to rope in opponents with a fishing poll and growing a tree in hopes of chopping it down onto people. She was easy to beat and I didn't feel great doing it. 9. Richter If he would've come before Simon he could've been so much harder. Image: nintendo Richter, the echo fighter of Simon from Castlevania, appeared to me after I had already faced and beaten Simon, so I knew all of his moves. He was tough, sure, but it wasn't too difficult to dodge his projectiles and go in for the kill. Richter put up a valiant effort. 8. Inkling The paint is disorienting. Image: nintendo Inklings come from the family friendly world of Splatoon where the name of the game is to cover up stuff in paint. This translates very well into Smash, and I found myself immediately covered in fluorescent, bright paint. The Inklings moves were hard to for me to pin down, and to be honest it was a much closer fight than I would've liked, considering I was playing as one of my favorite fighters, Samus. Good game, Inkling. 7. King K. Rool His gun hurts pretty bad. Image: nintendo Now we're getting into the really tough matchups. King K. Rool is not an easy fighter to take down. In my first round against King K. Rool, the fight was not even close. He blasted me out of the stage by reflecting one of my attacks with his down-B move. My next match up against K. Rool was too close for comfort, but I beat that gross green lizard fair and square. 6. Chrom My handsome son. Image: nintendo My first fight against Chrom hurt because I was playing as Roy, who is basically the same fighter as Chrom. I got my ass handed to me, and I barely got a hit in. It was a match up of two swordsman and this bot defeated me easily, which was particularly tough because I had about 24 hours of playtime under my belt, so it's not like I was still warming up. I came back for round two with Dark Samus, and was getting destroyed all the way up to about 80% before I shifted my strategy and went full-on ranged attacks. I tore him in half with a fully charged neutral-B blast. 5. Ridley Ridley the extraterrestrial dragon packs a punch. Image: nintendo Ridley was an early new challenger in my experience with Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, one of the first new fighters I came across, and I wanted him bad. I fought Ridley using Link, and Ridley literally wiped the floor with me. One of his moves is grabbing you and sliding you across the ground. Ridley tossed me into the lavas of Norfair and KO'd me before I ever got a good hit on him. It felt bad. I went at Ridley again and lost again. I was mad, I'll admit, but I cooled off and got a handle on everything, coming back with Link again to blast Ridley away. 4. Daisy Daisy doesn't mess around. Image: nintendo I've always loved playing as Peach, so getting Daisy felt important. I came at her with Lucina, thinking that some aggressive sword action would take care of her quickly. I was so wrong. She hip-slammed me into oblivion. Young Link was up next, and unfortunately I couldn't get the job done thanks to Daisy's counter-attack where she throws Toad up like a human shield. Finally I got her with Samus, and then I celebrated by playing as Daisy for about an hour. Take that, princess. 3. Simon Simon's whips hurt so bad. Image: nintendo Simon came out swinging in Dracula's Castle, and I had no idea how to fight back. His whips were longer than I expected. His axes hit harder than I expected. He ended the first fight against me so quickly I thought there was no way I would unlock him. I felt that again as I lost to Simon once more, barely getting a hit in. Third time was the charm, I guess, as I killed him with a final smash move. 2. Dark Samus Dark Samus is the cooler, edgier version of Samus, Image: nintendo I love playing as Samus, and I really wanted to play as Dark Samus in Ultimate. In fact, I was playing as Diddy Kong, and despite knowing the ins and outs of Samus's mechanics, I was decimated. She kicked me around, blew me up, and launched my monkey ass to death. I tried again as Samus, my main. I died as Samus against Dark Samus. I was humiliated. I think I almost cried. The next 10-15 minutes between round two and round three were filled with fury. I came back against Dark Samus with anger and I destroyed her with Bowser. I butt-slammed her so hard she evaporated off the side of the screen. 1. Incineroar This is what peak performance looks like. Image: nintendo Incineroar was the most challenging fighter I encountered in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. With most fights I understood where I went wrong when I lost. With Incineroar, I was just getting trounced and there was nothing I could do. I was playing as Corrin in our first encounter, a character I don't really understand and frankly don't care for. Incineroar came prepared with moves that baffled me and grapples that destroyed me. I came back for round two with Young Link, to put a little range between us, but this beefy feline once again slammed me so hard I flew out of the boxing ring and into my death. For round three I handed off the controller to my girlfriend who tried with Shiek, but she too got wrestled into a KO. I tried agin. I just couldn't get any good damage on him. In round five I finally did it, I wrecked Incineroar (barely) with Dark Samus. I did it. It felt great to destroy that cat. It took about an hour to finish off, but I did it. Eat it, Incineroar.","There are 11 brand new fighters in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and almost all of them kicked my ass.

Adrienne Breaux,"Peggy Wang, Buzzfeed's founding editor, decided one day a few years ago she was ready to move out of tiny apartment living. ""It was like a weird sudden existential outburst in my usual lazy put-everything-off-forever mindset,"" she writes. When she purchased this 1100-square-foot home in Queens, it felt like the right fit. But boy it needed a face lift. She worked closely with White Arrow —Keren Richter and her husband Thomas Richter—to remodel this home. Keren shared more information about the renovation in her own words: ""When we first began, the rowhouse had been stripped of nearly all the original period details. The interior finishes were cheap and in bad condition, with a collage of browns and creams and questionable wallpaper. We had a few goals in mind—to bring back the house's character, to make the home feel light and fresh, and to create a refreshing mix of finishes, fixtures and furniture that was youthful and fun. We appreciate historic homes but are equally interested in creating spaces that reflect our clients' tastes and don't feel like time capsules to an earlier era. The play between old and new is what excites us."" ""The floor plan of a rowhouse is long without windows for a large stretch of the interior. If not done right, it can feel quite dark. So we lightened the floors and brought in antique frosted glass and large pocket doors to keep the light bouncing and making interior rooms feel brighter. We also added sconces and dimmers everywhere. We tore down some walls to open up the kitchen and dining room and unified furniture and finishes in the spaces that would now be seen simultaneously. Our initial plan had bathrooms and the kitchen's gas and plumbing in new locations, but the budget was quite tight so we kept things in place and minimized the existing asymmetry of certain architectural elements through a strategic array of cabinetry. We collaborated closely with the owners during the course of renovating a charming old rowhouse in the historic district of Ridgewood, Queens. Peggy Wang, Buzzfeed's founding editor, had all sorts of ideas and cost-cutting strategies. We dove deep to find solutions for the gut renovation of her apartment (and a downstairs rental unit— not photographed ). It was an exercise in resourcefulness and shared creativity. Our goal was to design a home that felt luxurious on a cost-conscious budget. To embrace the house's historic bones, we used a mix of architectural salvage (doors, knobs, fireplace mantel, and lighting), and we created period appropriate millwork. We sourced a fresh mix of vintage and contemporary furniture from the internet and auction houses along with some custom-painted vintage pieces and a few White Arrow -designed furniture. To save money, we refinished and bleached the existing subfloor. What resulted was an airy and light atmosphere that offsets the black painted antique doors and deep blue Shaker cabinetry. The lights are a mix of Schoolhouse Electric, Cedar and Moss, Park Studio LA, and salvaged holophane glass pendants from an old asylum."" ""The kitchen was inspired by simple shaker design. It features Ikea base cabinets and island we clad in Scherrs custom fronts and larder painted in Farrow and Ball's ""Hague Blue."" A copper Watermark faucet and Menu pendant lights play off the deep blues and grays. The top notch appliances (a Bertazzoni oven, panel-ready Bosch dishwasher, and Subzero fridge) we found on Craigslist."" ""The refreshed vestibule features cement patterned tile and simple yet bold paint choices and beautiful antique doors. What results is a cohesive and updated home that is both modern with a lot of warmth."" ""The owner's bedroom features a natural palette—linen and light woods play off the patterned rug and pillows. The bed is from Muji, unfinished shaker nightstands are from Hoot Judkins, the Paul McCobb dresser and 1970s bentwood plywood side chair are from eBay. We made the African mud cloth pillows and sourced the mix of planters from Etsy. The framed artwork is by Michael Ortiz. Throughout the home we used a mix of collages by Keren Richter, a poster by Maurizio Cattelan's Toiletpaper magazine, and various silkscreened posters—all framed with Framebridge."" ""The living room features 1970s Italian leather armchairs by Gae Aulenti and Poltrona with a Warren Platner side table (all from eBay). These complement a Meritalia canvas couch from Aptdeco. The 1980s mirror is from Craigslist—we painted it and the coffee table to make them feel a bit more integrated. The Dhurrie rug is from India and the vintage hanging pendant light and accessories are eBay scores. The TV stands on a White Arrow-designed credenza—we were inspired by pegboard and chose to enlarge the dot pattern so the client could turn on and off their TV when it was closed, and to prevent their electronics from overheating."" ""We designed the shower to accommodate a glamorous extra tall sailcloth curtain and paired their 1930s pharmacy-inspired vanity from Restoration Hardware with Lefroy Brooks bath fittings and a Toto toilet.

Sonali Paul,"(Please note graphic detail in paragraph 4.) 
By Sonali Paul 
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - “Guilty.” 
There was a gasp in the Australian courtroom as the jury foreman read out the first verdict on child sex offences against Cardinal George Pell, the Vatican’s treasurer, then stunned silence as the same word was repeated for each of the four other charges he faced. 
The jury of eight men and four women unanimously agreed on Dec. 11, after a four-week trial, to convict Pell of five sexual offences committed against two 13-year-old choir boys 22 years earlier in the priests’ sacristy of Melbourne’s St Patrick’s Cathedral. 
They reached their decision after hearing lengthy testimony from a victim, who described how Pell had exposed himself to them, fondled their genitals and masturbated and forced one boy to perform a sex act on him. That complainant still lives in Melbourne. The other victim died in 2014. 
The trial and verdict could not be reported until now due to a court-imposed suppression order, as Pell was due to face another trial on older historical child sex offence charges and the judge did not want the next jury to be prejudiced. Those additional charges were dropped on Tuesday and the judge lifted the reporting restrictions. 
Each of the five offences carries a maximum 10 years in jail. Pell is due to be sentenced in early March, following a mitigation plea hearing on Feb. 27. 
Pell, a burly 1.9 meters (6 foot and 3 inches) tall, had sat hunched in the dock at the back of the courtroom throughout the trial. He stared straight ahead when the jury foreman said “guilty” for the first time, then turned away. 
As the next four verdicts were delivered, the man described by his own lawyer as the “Darth Vader” of the Catholic Church sat with his head bowed. 
Pell, the No. 3 official in the Vatican hierarchy, is the most senior Roman Catholic cleric worldwide to be convicted of such offences. His downfall brings to the heart of the papal administration a scandal over clerical abuse that has ravaged the Church’s credibility in the United States, Chile, Australia and elsewhere over the last three decades. 
Pope Francis, leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics, ended a conference on sexual abuse on Sunday, calling for an “all-out battle” against a crime that should be “erased from the face of the earth”. [nL5N20J0AF] 
POWERPOINT DEFENSE 
The December verdict followed a re-trial. Three months earlier, a first trial of the same offences had ended in a deadlocked jury that left some jurors in tears. 
Pell’s lawyer Robert Richter, a theatrical 72-year-old well-known in Australia after taking on the defense in some of the country’s most high-profile criminal cases, had been confident since the pre-trial hearings that this time he had a slam dunk defense. 
Late in proceedings at the re-trial, Richter introduced a new witness, a fellow criminal barrister and former altar server, who had a possible alibi for Pell. The witness said he had served at a mass in late 1996 and afterwards he and his mother had chatted with Pell on the front steps of the cathedral, which the defense said meant he could not have been in the sacristy at the time of the alleged offences. 
But under cross-examination, the former altar server could not remember the exact date, and his recall of other details was vague and partly contradicted another defense witness. 
Richter brought out Pell’s heavy ceremonial robes, trying to demonstrate they could hardly be maneuvered to expose himself to the boys as the prosecution had alleged. 
He had his star witness, a priest who had helped Pell conduct services, demonstrate how elaborately and tightly knotted the robe was around the archbishop’s waist. 
There was also debate over whether the wine that the boys were caught swigging in the sacristy by Pell immediately before four of the offences took place was red, as the accuser said, or white, as the court heard was preferred by the dean of the cathedral at the time, as the defense tried to pick holes in the victim’s account. 
For his closing argument, Richter rolled out a PowerPoint presentation with dozens of bullet points spelling out why, he said, it would have been almost impossible for the alleged events to have occurred. 
He reminded the jury of Pell’s strenuous denials. 
“What a load of absolute disgraceful rubbish. Completely false. Madness,” the jury heard Pell tell police in a recording of an interview in a hotel room near Rome airport in 2016 played earlier in the trial. 
“You could scarcely imagine a place that was more unlikely for committing pedophilia crimes than the sacristy of the Cathedral after mass,” Pell, who did not testify at either trial, said in the recording. 
CLOSED DOOR TESTIMONY 
The jury was unswayed, returning a verdict of guilty on all five charges after hearing a prosecution case based entirely on the evidence given by Pell’s surviving accuser. 
That testimony was the crux of both trials. 
Reporters, Pell’s supporters and abuse survivors who had filled the small court for most of the trial did not see or hear the complainant’s two-and-a-half days of testimony and cross-examination by Richter, which was conducted by video link for the jury behind closed doors. It was later outlined to the court in comments by the prosecutor. 
In his closing argument to the jury, prosecutor Mark Gibson, in a quiet voice, called the accuser’s evidence “powerful and persuasive”. 
“He was not a person indulging in fantasy or imagining things to the point where he now believed his own imaginative mind, but was simply telling it as it was and is,” Gibson told the court. 
Pell had appeared relaxed through most of his trial. Every day he sat in the dock, usually wearing a white shirt with a clerical collar, black pants and a beige jacket, writing on a large notepad and taking occasional sips of water. During breaks in proceedings he would chat with supporters. 
But in the nine months since pre-trial hearings began, Pell’s health had clearly deteriorated. 
Judge Peter Kidd extended bail after Pell was convicted so he could have double knee surgery in Sydney on Dec. 14, which had been postponed after the first trial. 
Pell’s lawyers will now be counting on an appeal filed last week to keep him out of jail.

"AP, AP","NEW YORK (AP) From the moment Mark Messier came to the New York Rangers in 1991, he knew he was expected to lead the team to its first Stanley Cup championship in more than 50 years.
""There was no escaping the pressure of 1940,"" Messier said about the last year the Rangers had won the Cup. ""Coming here and understanding what the Original Six franchise was and this history, there was no escaping it. The pressure was real, from the fans, the organization.""
Messier accomplished the task in 1994 as the Rangers ended their 54-year title drought by outlasting the Vancouver Canucks in seven games in the Stanley Cup Final. Honored with a parade in the Canyon of Heroes in lower Manhattan that June, the players from that team were back at Madison Square Garden on Friday night to celebrate the 25-year anniversary.
""When you are in New York, not a day goes by that you don't run into someone that you get reminded, get smiles,"" Adam Graves said before the ceremony that preceded the Rangers' game against Carolina. ""Back then you never thought you'd be impacting the way we have been, it is very special.""
From general manager Neil Smith, coach Mike Keenan, to stars Messier, Brian Leetch, Mike Richter, Craig MacTavish and Stephane Matteau, each were introduced one by one to a rousing ovation. The only absences from the group were Alexander Karpovtsev, who was killed along with most of the KHL Lokomotiv team in a plane crash in 2011, and Brian Noonan, who was said to have a prior commitment.
Messier said he's been approached by countless people over since who thanked him and claimed to have witnessed the Game 7 win in New York.
""I didn't realize Madison Square Garden holds 2 million people,"" he joked, ""because I've talked to 2 million people over 25 years that were here that night. That's been interesting. It never gets old ... never get tired of speaking with people on the street or in the subway or trains, or taxi drivers that recognize the guys or myself and thank us for the Cup.""
Messier is also remembered for his famous for his declaration before Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals against New Jersey when, with the Rangers trailing 3-2 in the series, he guaranteed the team would win Game 6.
Messier said he was simply trying to let his teammates know he believed in the team.
""I really felt we could go into New Jersey and win, and I wanted the guys to know it,"" he said. ""The papers the next day were what they were. It wasn't going to motivate New Jersey any more.""
Leetch said the team chuckled when they saw Messier's Game 6 guarantee in the papers, and it didn't change anything about their preparation for that game.
""Just was kind of a light-hearted thing to remember that we're in New York, everything gets magnified,"" Leetch said. ""One comment gets turned into a guarantee. It was something for a little bit that we had a laugh about"".
Messier then backed up his words with a hat trick in the third period to rally the Rangers to a 4-2 win.
""He's always done things his whole career,"" Leetch said. ""He's been a part of a lot of big moments and rises to occasions in big games, but the fact he did that here in New York when it was on the front and back pages, we still shake our heads at it that he was the guy to do it in that game.""
The Rangers then won Game 7 on Matteau's goal in double-overtime.
They lost the opening game in the championship series against the Canucks despite having a big advantage on shots, then won three straight to get to the cusp of ending their long drought before being forced to the deciding game.
""I remember saying we should have won this series four straight,"" Messier said. ""Coming back and losing Game 5 and 6 and then we're back in another Game 7.""
Then, Messier came through again, giving the Rangers a two-goal lead that stood as the winner to deliver the franchise and the city the long-awaited title he had been brought in to get.
""When Mark came across the ice to celebrate the Stanley Cup victory and handed it to me and I looked it over, the first thing that came to my mind is I can't believe how difficult this trophy is to win,"" said Keenan, who said he is doing well after his treatment for prostate cancer last year. ""As now time passes, 25 years later, that endorsement of how difficult it is stands even more in my mind.""
Difficult indeed, as the championship in 1994 remains the Rangers' only title in the last 79 years.

WESLEY MORRIS,"Political speeches might strive to nourish us, but lately nobody wants a salad; this president got where he is by slinging red meat. Trump could talk about comity and unity this time, but if you were watching his speech, you were also watching television a dramatically ripe encounter between two people who had just faced off over a historic, harmfully long government shutdown, and over whether this speech could happen in the first place. You would have wanted a moment that captured the conflict hiding behind the pleas for civility an emblem of the anomie sizzling beneath the surface of most politics at the moment. Something small and arguable and maybe a little bit beneath us that alluded to the stratospheric stakes of the discord. And this woman, clapping at this man, was the reddest meat. It was an image that registered on the Richter scale of beef.
The internet is great at rooting out, freeze-framing then fan-ficking this kind of interpersonal drama. It has become downright masterful during the Trump era: the meme-ing of his appearing to stalk Hillary Clinton during a presidential debate, of Melania swatting his hand away. Its a terrible way of following politics. But it might be the only sane mechanism for digesting the politics we have as must-share TV.
Pelosis clap ate both the internet and the national news, which ran endless stories parsing its meaning. Pelosis daughter Christine offered an interpretation: She knows, she tweeted, and she knows that you know. And frankly shes disappointed that you thought this would work. But heres a clap. #youtriedit. The clap became all things to lots of people. Most of them supposed some kind of triumph for Pelosi and humiliation for Trump. The clap was seen as loaded and self-amused and captivatingly sardonic. Saturday Night Live whipped up a 1970s-era action-TV sketch called Women of Congress, in which Pelosi was identified as Madame Clap Back. At a Grammys-weekend celebration for Dolly Parton, Pelosi herself stood between Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom, who got her to do the clap with them. Its possible that was the moment when the image started eating itself.","He tries to drop an anvil on her. She lures him over a cliff.

Fox News,"A string of recent earthquakes off the West Coast of the U.S., ranging from 2.8 to 5.6 on the Richter scale, could help trigger the earthquake colloquially known as ""the Big One."" The map provided by the U.S. Geological Survey highlights 11 recent earthquakes, all occurring on the seabed of the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate, approximately 6 miles below the surface. The plate, which is described as ""small"" by the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN), is fairly active, moving east-northeast at approximately 1.6 inches per year. To date, the USGS has not issued any warnings over this spate of earthquakes, given the fairly common nature of the caliber of quakes, Don Blakeman, a geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information Center told the Daily Mail. QUAKES AND ERUPTIONS SPARK TALKS OF YELLOWSTONE SUPERVOLCANO Part of the concern surrounding the plate is that it is not a smooth motion, but rather a motion described as ""sticky,"" causing strain to build up ""until the fault breaks and a few meters of Juan De Fuca slips under North America in a big earthquake."" PNSN noted that it would take a lot of slip (approximately 10s of meters) over a very large area to generate a M9 (magnitude of 9.0) level earthquake that could hit the region, but noted that it does occur approximately every 550 years on average. The cause for concern is what happens when the Juan de Fuca plate eventually submerges under the much larger Pacific plate. For approximately 330 years, the plate has continuously been pushed down, an activity that will eventually lead it to be pushed under the North America plate, causing the region to sink six feet on the minimum and may result in one of the largest earthquakes in human history. If the entire 650-mile long Cascadia Subduction Zone (which includes the Juan de Fuca plate) were to experience a full rupture, it could not only trigger a 9.0 earthquake, but a tsunami as well. The Juan De Fuca plate stretches from Northern California to British Columbia and the Cascadia Subduction Zone stretches from N. Vancouver Island to Cape Mendicino, California. SCIENTISTS FIND DOZENS OF HIDDEN EARTHQUAKES BURIED UNDER ANTARCTICA'S ICE Recent studies have highlighted how vulnerable we are to the proverbial ""Big One."" Last month, one study detailed that there is a 15- to 20-mile-long stretch of the San Andreas fault ‒ called the Durmid ladder structure ‒ that could result in an earthquake with a magnitude of 7 or greater. ""This newly identified Durmid ladder structure is a voluminous, right-reverse fault zone that broadens across Durmid Hill around rotating domains of regularly spaced, left- and right-lateral cross faults,"" a research article on the study reads. The research put the odds at 75 percent that it would occur in both northern and southern California sometime over the next 30 years. The ""Big One"" has been warned about several times before, with the USGS writing extensively on the topic, including how to use past earthquakes to better predict the future.

Qumulo is pioneering an entirely new category of enterprise storage that addresses the intersection of three important trends: the explosion of digital content impacting every aspect of our lives, the utilization of machine learning and next generation analytics to derive value from that data, and the standardization of cloud architectures in the enterprise. Qumulo helps customers store, manage, and access their file data at scale, on-premises and in the public cloud, anywhere in the world. “Our customers are demanding a fundamentally different approach to managing and storing the large and dispersed data that their businesses rely on. Legacy storage vendors can’t keep up, as they are built on 15- to 25-year-old architectures that optimized proprietary hardware, not software or the public clouds. They simply never contemplated today’s requirements,” said Qumulo CEO Bill Richter, in a statement. “This latest funding round is not only a testament to our team’s vision and accomplishments, but the capital also secures our plans for continued expansion, accelerated product capabilities, and long-term company sustainability. Everything we do is rooted in our commitment to meeting our customers’ growing and evolving data needs while advancing the entire industry through rapid and focused innovation.” BlackRock Private Equity Partners led the round, with participation from Goldman Sachs and Western Digital. The fourth round also included follow-on investments from all major existing investors, including Highland Capital Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB), the Madrona Venture Group, and Valhalla Partners. Above: Bill Richter is CEO of Qumulo. “The incredible expansion of file-based data in today’s cloud era presents companies with the daunting challenge of storing, managing, and accessing their digital content at scale,” said Muhammad Mian, managing director of BlackRock, in a statement. “Qumulo’s disruptive model has defined an entirely new category of enterprise storage, providing many of the world’s leading companies with the most advanced solution on the market.” The company has raised a total of $233 million over four rounds. Last year, Qumulo appointed EMC Isilon veteran Bill Richter as its CEO. Qumulo’s new funding will support the growth of its enterprise-ready, scale-out storage solution, as well as rapid expansion into vertical industries in North America, Europe, and Asia. The company says its Qumulo Core offering stores tens of billions of files with high performance and is the only product with full data management and real-time visibility into storage use at petabyte scale. Storage administrators can instantly see usage, activity, and throughput history at any level of the unified directory structure, no matter how many files are in the file system, allowing them to pinpoint problems and effectively manage how storage is used. Qumulo was founded in 2012 by Peter Godman, Neal Fachan, and Aaron Passey. It has 180 employees. With hundreds of petabytes of data, billions of files under management globally, and triple digit year-over-year growth, the company is positioning itself to be the leader in the next generation of file storage. Qumulo’s customers include 3 out of 5 of the largest companies on earth, 9 of the 10 top Hollywood studios, and many of the most admired Fortune 500 companies.

Helen Quinn,"Credit: Eddie Adams/AP/REX/Shutterstock The burst of scientific activity that began with the discovery of the J / ψ particle in 1974 is known to particle physicists as the ‘November revolution’, because it so radically changed their perspective. Charm quarks, heavier than the quarks that make up protons and neutrons, were predicted by theory that became the standard model of particle physics. Finding particles containing them opened up a new chapter in physics. Burton Richter, who died on 18 July, made that revolution possible by designing and building the positron–electron accelerator SPEAR and an innovative detector facility, both at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in California. Richter received the 1976 Nobel Prize in Physics for the J / ψ discovery. (The double name for the particle is because two experimental groups announced their results on the same day; Samuel Ting, who led the other experiment, shared the Nobel prize.) It has to be said that Burt was not looking for this particle. He agreed to let his colleagues, Marty Breidenbach, Vera Lüth and Roy Schwitters, “waste a weekend” (as he put it) to redo measurements to check an anomaly in their data. They found this new particle immediately — noting in the log book that the data “came pouring in”. Within months, they made further discoveries that confirmed their interpretation of the particle as a charm quark. This breakthrough would not have happened without Richter’s energy and persistence. Most physicists did not see SPEAR as a priority, and the US Congress would not fund it. After years of rejections, Richter redesigned the project to cut costs. He convinced his laboratory director and the Atomic Energy Commission to let him build it using ongoing funding. Once repackaged as an improvement to an existing facility, rather than a new project, it did not need congressional approval. Burton Richter was born in Brooklyn, New York, on 22 March 1931, and grew up in Queens, another borough of the city. Graduating from high school with a passion for science experiments, he enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, where he obtained his undergraduate degree in 1952 and his PhD in physics four years later. He moved to Stanford University and in 1963 to the new Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, where he spent the rest of his career. He was director of SLAC from 1984 until 1999, and remained involved in physics research and policy until the day he died. Particle physicists generally fall into one of three categories: theorist, experimentalist or accelerator physicist. Each requires specialized expertise, and so few people master more than one. Burton Richter was the exception. He excelled at designing and building accelerators, as well as designing and leading experiments that used them. Richter’s enthusiasm for storage rings — accelerators in which particles circulate for hours — began at Stanford. With physicist Gerald O’Neill of Princeton University, in New Jersey, Richter helped to build the world’s first pair of rings to store electrons. SPEAR was his next project, with electrons and positrons held in a single ring. The positron–electron project (PEP), a larger and higher-energy storage ring, came online at SLAC in 1980. Burt was keen to push for ever-higher particle energies. To produce lots of Z-particles, a carrier of the weak nuclear force, he invented the SLAC linear collider. Short pulses of high-energy electrons and positrons, in beams the width of a human hair, travel for miles along the SLAC accelerator. They pass along separate arcs and then collide, occasionally producing Z-particles. The collider yielded, among other results, a tight upper bound on the mass of the Higgs boson and, just as importantly, it demonstrated the viability of the linear-collider concept for future machines. To achieve even-higher-energy collisions, Burt long advocated setting up two linear accelerators head-to-head. He instigated efforts to plan one, but such a machine has yet to be built. Richter recognized that SLAC had to diversify to survive. When SPEAR was under construction, condensed-matter physicists Sebastian Doniach and William Spicer at Stanford University convinced him to add a small window in the vacuum pipe of the storage ring, so that the X-rays produced by circulating electrons or positrons could get out. This created the most intense X-ray source then available, opening the door to X-ray science. Intense X-ray pulses have many applications in materials science, chemistry and in deciphering biological structures. Today, this science is one of the main uses of SLAC. Richter also brought particle astrophysics to the science mix at the lab, and supported a plan to convert the SLAC accelerator into the world’s first X-ray laser (itself a tour de force of accelerator design) to produce pulses of even-more-intense X-rays. Burt served the community in other ways. He was a member of the JASON group, providing technical advice to the US government. He served on countless national and international science-advisory panels, and as councillor and president of the American Physical Society. His interest in energy policy led to his encyclopaedic book Beyond Smoke and Mirrors: Climate Change and Energy in the 21st Century. Burt Richter cared about ideas, not status or recognition. He would share his technical insight and acumen with anyone to improve an experiment. If a postdoc or student had a good idea, he would support it; if he disagreed with a high-status scientist, he made it clear. He argued furiously in the service of getting to the answers, and expected others to do the same. He gave responsibility to those he found most capable, without regard to seniority. Burt loved doing physics, constructing experiments capable of reaching frontiers and breaking beyond them.",Physicist who helped to discover the first particle containing a charm quark.,2018-08-28T00:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Nature.com'}",Burton Richter (1931–2018),https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06036-6,https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-06036-6/d41586-018-06036-6_16060720.jpg,,Nature.com,Richter,0
R.L. Adams,"It's hard to truly grow in business without a mentor. Business mentors provide a sounding board, helping to amplify your results. They help to guide you through the oftentimes-murky waters in the entrepreneurial world while you navigate the storms. They help to mitigate the risks that might occur when you move out past your comfort zone. If you've never considered a mentor in business, then now is the perfect time to do so. Yet, the question that plagues most is the following. How do you actually go about finding a business mentor? How do you locate someone that'll help you avoid pitfalls and navigate your way to success ? It isn't easy. Let's just say that. Especially if you're an introvert. The best way to do it? Get out there. Network. Communicate. Add value to the lives of others. Don't just look to take. Give. And do it wholeheartedly. You see, finding a business mentor isn't something that happens randomly. It happens by connecting with others on a higher level. It involves surrounding yourself with great minds. It occurs at masterminds events or marketing conferences. In hallways and auditoriums. But, it's never random or by chance. And you can't simply ask someone to mentor you. It doesn't quite work that way. No. Never ask. Especially not right off the bat. Think about it this way. Would you ask someone to marry you on the first date? Would you ask someone to be your business partner only after meeting them once? Of course you wouldn't. Keep in mind that being a business mentor takes considerable amounts of effort. It's not just something that most people take lightly. Now, I've been blessed to have some incredible mentors in my life, but they didn't become my mentors out of the blue. I added value first. And so should you. You can't just approach someone and ask them to help you. Instead, look for ways you can help them. Can't think of any? You're not thinking hard enough. Find a way. Find something. A way to add value. To improve their lives. To connect them with someone or give them something they couldn't readily meet or find on their own. What value can you bring to the table? That's the key. Related: Why This Media Entrepreneur Wants You to Rethink Your Definition of Legacy I could likely drill off dozens of reasons why mentors are invaluable in your journey as an entrepreneur. But, there are only 10 that truly matter here. I spoke with Lee Richter, an innovator in business, and CEO of Richter Communications and Design Group. She was recently recognized by the San Francisco Business times as one of the Top 100 Women Business Leaders in 2017. I spoke with Richter to gain more insight into why everyone needs a mentor in business and how particularly to go about finding one. Her thoughts on finding a mentor? Tap into your personal or business network. Don't just reach out to big names out of the blue. That will hardly work. Have someone introduce you. You're more likely to succeed that way. You have to develop a relationship with that person. Whomever it might be, that's going to take time. Remember, don't focus on the short game. This is about long-term gains. If you have it in your mind that you can't succeed without a particular mentor in your corner, you'll likely fail. Keep in mind that this isn't actually about you. It can't be a one-way street of receiving value. Always ask how you can help that person first and foremost. Always. It has to be a two-way street. Richter says that's the best way you'll find a business mentor. Hands down. 1. It shortens your learning curve. The truth is that there's no manual to business success. There's no guide book or road map that tells you that if this plus this happens turn to page 382 and do this. Nope. Nothing like that. You have to roll with the punches. You have to fall down and get up again. And, sure, you learn. But, what if you had a mentor that could help you shorten your learning curve? What if you could lean on someone who's been through the so-called ringer? What would they tell you to do? How would they advise you to act? What things would they tell you to be wary? What type of legal or accounting or employee management advice would they give you? Richter says that mentors can drastically shorten your learning curve. They can tell you what to do and what not to do. And, more importantly, when you do make a big mistake, they can show you how to recover gracefully. Not give up. But, how to pick up the pieces and keep striding forward. That's what matters. That's what counts. Related: Every Entrepreneur Needs a Team of Mentors, and Not Just for Business. 2. Business mentors expand your network. Often, when you're dealing with a mentor who's well connected in business, it offers an extension to your own network. It's a way to skip the proverbial line. A way to connect quickly with others. They know people in business that can be reached far quicker than you could reach them yourself. Why do you think so many people want to do business with the investors in Shark Tank ? Not just for the money. But, for who else they know that they can bring to the table. 3. You gain new insights. How can you approach your market in a way that will set your company apart? What's the best way to position your product or service? How can you create scarcity? What type of copy works best? These are all insights that a business mentor can help you with. They'll give you actionable information that you can use and leverage as you seek to grow and expand and push forward with your efforts. Related: The 4 People Who Will Help You Achieve Your Goals 4. Allow you to test ideas. Mentors bring experience to the table. They can help you test ideas. They can help you look at something far more objectively than you could. They'll help you be honest and straightforward without sugarcoating things. If an idea doesn't make sense, they'll tell you why. If it does, they'll help you test it out. They know how to sample markets and test conversions and understand the cause-and-effects of certain actions in business. 5. Give you someone to ask for help. It's hard to ask for help. Especially when you're struggling to keep your head above water. But, having a mentor gives you a person to reach out to. A person to ask for help when you need it most. And that's what they're there for. It's not something to be embarrassed or ashamed about. Everyone suffers and everyone fails. But, having someone there that can help you could completely change the trajectory of your company and your ability to succeed. 6. Learn from other's mistakes. Most successful entrepreneurs have failed. They've made mistakes. Thus, they can offer advice based on those mistakes. They can tell you what to do and not to do. They can give you sound advice and guidance based on their own personal mishaps. That could help you avoid repeating those same mistakes or even understanding how to fix them should they actually occur. Related: How To Attract The Best Mentors, According to Tim Ferriss 7. Offers an accountability partner. There's nothing like being held accountable to another person. Especially to a person who's achieved success in business. And that's precisely what a business mentor can offer you. Accountability. There's simply no substitute for it. It's like trying to lose weight. Wouldn't you prefer having a trainer or a coach there by your side while you fought the perilous fight? Of course you would. 8. Your own private cheerleader. Your business mentor wants to see you succeed. They're there to cheer you on. I can tell you from personal experience that it's a good feeling. Especially on the days when you feel down and out. When you don't feel like putting in the effort, they're there to remind you why you absolutely should do that. Related: 27 Entrepreneurs Share Their Greatest Influences 9. Offer you more credibility If you do somehow manage to grab a big-named business celebrity in your corner, it will offer you more credibility. Sure. That much is true. While that shouldn't be why you have a mentor, it does help. It does lend credibility to whatever venture you're involved in. Definitely. 10. Provides an avenue for sharing knowledge. You can easily share knowledge with your mentor. He or she can help you make sound decisions based on the information that you offer. That's crucial in this cut-throat world of business that we live in. Sharing that knowledge with others isn't always going to be beneficial to you. But, with a mentor who's genuinely on your side, it will be.

Sam Machkovech,"reader comments 4 Simon Belmont's in-game render. Nintendo revealed the Konami addition through a cute, Castlevania / Luigi's Mansion crossover video. Belmont shows up just in time to see poor Luigi slashed by a demon. And, thus, he lashes out. In addition to his classic whip attack, Belmont will also use holy water, axes, and his throwable cross. The Dracula's Castle stage will include various monsters showing up to pester fighters, particularly Dracula. Richter appears as Simon's ""echo fighter"" variant. Richter, seen here standing next to Alucard, who will appear as a helpful ""assist trophy."" If you thought Nintendo's upcoming mascot-battler game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate couldn't get any bigger, its creators had a Konami-tinged surprise on Wednesday: Castlevania 's Simon Belmont as a brand-new playable Smash fighter. Belmont was arguably the biggest announcement to come in the latest news-filled Nintendo Direct video series. Smash Director Masahiro Sakurai confirmed that the character's classic whip gives him the longest standard melee attack ever seen in the series, at the cost of speed—and that it can be freely waved around, just like in the SNES classic Super Castlevania IV. His other attacks take advantage of classic ""magical items"" like the axe (complete with its thrown arc), ground-burning holy water, and straight-thrown blue cross. He'll be joined by Symphony of the Night hero Richter Belmont, who will appear as an ""echo fighter""— Smash 's term for an aesthetic re-skin with very slight move variations. Both characters will be able to fight in a new Dracula's Castle stage, which will include cameos from monsters like a werewolf and Dracula that pester fighters when they randomly appear. The series' famed Alucard will appear as an ""assist trophy,"" as well, to be used in combat as a temporary helper. Wow, Nintendo isn't messing around when adding fan-service characters to this game. As a slower, larger fighter, Rool's belly-bounce ""reflect"" will be useful to help him counter when he's too slow to dodge certain moves. His cannonball-launching gun returns, as well. Not looking good for Mewtwo. A moment from Rool's flashy reveal video. The video concluded with a ""one more thing"" video reveal of another new main character, as well: Donkey Kong Country 's King K Rool. His move set didn't receive as detailed of a reveal, however, but Rool's revealed attacks include a cannonball gun, a tummy bounce, and a throwable king's hat. Craziest of all, Sakurai says Nintendo is not done adding main characters, and he did not offer an estimate of how big this cast will get, nor how many of the additional characters will appear as ""echoes."" Two more echo fighters were announced, as well: Dark Samus from the Metroid Prime series, who can replace normal Samus, and Chrom from Fire Emblem. The game's main menu. Online modes were not detailed today, nor was anything from that mysteriously blurred green box. (We assume that's some sort of single-player campaign, like in prior games, but we're still waiting for confirmation.) Gosh, that is a lot of confirmed stages. Today's brand-new stage: New Donk City Hall from Super Mario Odyssey. Platforms move and change, and various Donk citizens, particularly the musical band, show up to assist. Hooray! Now any stage's hazards, particularly destructive bosses, can be disabled while still leaving moving and disappearing platforms toggled, should players want something a little wilder than the plain ""Battlefield"" stage for competitive play. Many classic stages will be touched up......but for some reason, they're leaving the game's N64 stages as-is. Hope you like pixels and smeary textures in your Wispy Woods. A better look at the new ""echo"" characters. The video confirmed some, but not all, of the modes coming to the game. A variety of tournament-friendly combat modes will be available, including Squad Strike, which lets players choose a few characters before starting a fight and whittling each side's three- or five-strong roster down. It's not quite a Marvel Vs. Capcom -like team frenzy, as team swaps won't be available mid-combat, but it's a great option for a game with such an enormous character roster. And a new ""Smashdown"" mode will automatically remove characters as available options every time they are used, so when a group of two-to-four players gets into an extended session, they'll all be forced to re-pick fighters after every match. (Sakurai goes so far as to suggest swiping certain prized characters early in this mode to antagonize your friends.) Apparently, one major mode was left off the reveal table today. A flash of the game's main-menu screens included a massively blurred section where you might expect a campaign or single-player mode to appear, and Sakurai made clear that this blurred mode would be revealed at a later date. The screens also hint to ""online"" modes, which have also not yet been detailed. ""We must be crazy,"" Sakurai said when confirming that the game's combat-arena count had grown to 103 as of press time. Those stages will have ""more than 800 songs"" that, like in prior games, players can pick and choose from before going into battle. But should you wish to simply jam to the songs while on the go, Nintendo unveiled a new Switch party trick: a ""handheld music"" mode that continues playing system audio even when the screen is turned off. Should you wish to toss your Switch into a bag like an old iPod, you'll be able to keep rocking to its tunes, so long as you plug headphones in. And, yes, that 800-plus song count includes a whopping 34 songs from the Castlevania series—great news for fans of that series' acclaimed soundtracks. It remains to be seen how many of those are re-recorded orchestral versions (which Smash games get a lot of), as opposed to direct rips from other entries. Today's news follows leaks from months ago hinting to Belmont as part of the roster, but those leaks didn't predict K. Rool's appearance, and they have yet to reveal Nintendo's hand for other characters. Thus, we may still have a few surprises in store ahead of the game's December 7 launch on Nintendo Switch.

Lianne Laurence,"MELBOURNE, Australia, February 27, 2019 (LifeSiteNews) — The Vatican has reversed its earlier position and opened an investigation into allegations against Australia’s Cardinal George Pell, who was taken to jail after a plea hearing Wednesday.
The decision was made by Pope Francis given Pell’s high standing, reported the Jesuit America Magazine.
The 77-year-old Pell will be held at maximum security prison until his March 13 sentencing on five convictions of sexually abusing minors, reported the Guardian.
Pell “will be kept in protective custody and remain alone for up to 23 hours a day,” it reported.
Pell was found guilty by a jury in December of sexual abusing two 13-year-old choir boys in 1996. The formal convictions are one charge of sexually penetrating a child under 16 and four counts of committing an indecent act on a child under 16.
Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail.
A number of commentators, Catholic and otherwise, have condemned Pell’s prosecution as an anti-Catholic witch hunt instigated by police and media.
Pell’s first trial on the charges ended September with a hung jury, with 10 of 12 jurors supporting his acquittal.
Judge Peter Kidd granted Pell bail during the trials so he could have knee replacement surgery, but said he would revoke it Wednesday.
Pell’s lawyers withdrew a bail application scheduled at the Court of Appeal, stating in a release that Pell “believes it is appropriate from him to await sentencing,” reported Australian newspaper The Age.
They have filed an appeal that will “be pursued following sentence,” the lawyers stated.
Pell is the most senior cleric to be convicted of sexual offenses, and as Vatican treasurer and a member of Pope Francis’ Council of Cardinals (C9) was considered the third-most powerful man in the Vatican when he was charged with multiple counts of sexual offenses in July 2017.
Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti initially said the Holy See would wait until Pell’s appeal ended before taking action, according to CruxNow.
The pope “confirmed the precautionary measures which had been imposed by the local Ordinary” on Pell when he returned to Australia in 2017 to answer to the charges, Gisotti said Tuesday.
That is, Pell is “prohibited from exercising public ministry and from having any voluntary contact whatsoever with minors,” he said.
But Gisotti announced Wednesday that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) “will now handle the case following the procedure and within the time established by canonical norm,” reported Reuters.
He also confirmed Pell is no longer Vatican treasurer. Pell’s term expired Sunday and the pope has to yet name a successor, Reuters reported.
The CDF will decide based on its investigations whether to proceed to a canonical trial or administratively, that is, forgo a trial and ask the pope to defrock Pell, an eventuality from which there is no appeal, reported CNN.
The Vatican announced in mid-December that Pope Francis had removed Pell and two other cardinals from the C9 in October, reported CruxNow.
Pell was convicted on the testimony of one complainant who alleged Pell discovered him and another choirboy in the sacristy of Melbourne’s Cathedral drinking sacramental wine after they snuck away from the procession following High Mass on Sunday, and that Pell then orally raped him and sexually molested him and the other chorister — who died in 2014 of a heroin overdose and who denied ever being sexual assaulted.
Pell’s lawyer, Robert Richter, argued that the complainant’s story was “fantasy;” the sacristy would have been a “beehive of activity” after High Mass, Pell would not have been alone at any time, nor would he to have been able to manipulate his robes to expose himself as the complainant alleges.
Richter attempted Wednesday to persuade Kidd to give Pell a lenient sentence.
But his efforts were “disastrous” and have “thrown Pell’s supporters into despair,” according to the Catholic Herald.
Richter maintained he had to make arguments in the context of Pell’s guilty conviction, and so argued that the offense Pell was convicted of, but steadfastly denies committing, was “plain vanilla sexual penetration case where the child is not actively participating.”
That and Richter’s arguments brought gasps from spectators in the crowded courtroom, the Guardian reported.
“Whatever his reasons, his description of a horrific attack on a minor (which Richter was not conceding actually happened) will do nothing to persuade the Australian public of Pell’s innocence,” noted the Herald.
“The situation is therefore a nightmare for the Catholic Church.”
Richter’s arguments also did not appear to convince Kidd, who described Pell’s behavior as “callous, brazen offending” and “shocking conduct,” the Guardian reported.
Pell has steadfastly maintained his innocence, describing the charges as “falsehood and garbage.”",Cardinal Pell sent to maximum security prison before sentencing; Vatican to open investigation Lifesite Australian Cardinal Pell to spend his first night in prison CTV News Cardinal Pell had ‘plain vanilla' sex with victim and that should mitigate prison sent…,2019-02-27T22:29:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Lifesitenews.com'}",Cardinal Pell sent to maximum security prison before sentencing; Vatican to open investigation - Lifesite,https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/cardinal-pell-sent-to-maximum-security-prison-before-sentencing-vatican-to-open-investigation,https://www.lifesitenews.com/images/made/images/remote/https_www.lifesitenews.com/images/local/Cardinal_Pell_leaves_court_1024_512_75_s_c1.jpg,,Lifesitenews.com,Richter,0

Alfonso Cuaron's Netflix epic Roma could become the first ever winner of both best picture and best foreign language film at the Oscars. Its success could change how the category is perceived - and shine a light on the four other worthy nominees.
In the last decade, there have been changes almost annually to how the Oscars arrive at their shortlist for best foreign language film.
The category has existed since 1947 and the number of films involved grows almost every year. There were 87 this year, and no-one could view them all. So in recent years, volunteers would split into three groups to judge a portion each.
But this year there are new bosses and they've changed the system yet again. To boost inclusivity, it was hoped more members would vote, although most will see fewer films each.
For now, the unique fact about the 91st Academy Awards is that the hot tip for winner as foreign language film could well clean up in other categories too - Alfonso Cuaron's Roma has 10 nominations in all.
Strictly speaking, the Academy Award goes to the winning nation. But since 2015 the director's name has appeared on the Oscar statuette too.
This year's shortlist is:
Capernaum
Image copyrightPicturehouse
Country: Lebanon
Language: Arabic with some Amharic
Lebanon's track record in this category: The country's first nomination was last year, for The Insult
Director: Nadine Labaki
Story:
Life among the poorest of the poor in Beirut. Zain is a sparky 12-year-old who's angry at his poor Syrian parents for making his sister go off with a man she dislikes. He runs away and strikes up a friendship with Rahil, a cleaner from Ethiopia who lives in a shack with her young child. This central story plays as an extended flashback as Zain takes his parents to court, suing them for giving him life.
Chances of winning:
There are strong elements - especially the performances of Zain al Rafeea and Yordanos Shiferaw as Zain and Rahil. Neither is a professional actor. The film gives a convincing picture of life for the poorest immigrants in Lebanon - particularly for women and children.
The circumstances Zain grows up in will strike a chord elsewhere. But the framing device feels clumsy and improbable: it undermines a film which otherwise has the power to move.
Cold War
Image copyrightCurzon Artificial Eye
Country: Poland
Language: Polish
Poland's track record: 10 previous nominations. The sole winner was the same director's Ida four years ago.
Director: Pawel Pawlikowski
Story:
The film, shot in black and white, covers some 15 years of Polish history from the late 1940s. Wiktor and the young singer Zula meet and fall profoundly in love - but will they ever get their lives in sync? Wiktor leaves Poland amid the complexities of 1950s politics and the story follows him to Paris. 
Chances of winning:
Modern writers and directors aren't great at constructing grown-up love stories. Pawlikowski, whose career has mainly been in the UK, has shot and co-written a story in which the audience senses that two attractive people were made for one another and wants them to get together.
The film also reveals a lot about post-war Poland, creating other convincing characters along the way. It looks beautiful and it's the film with the best chance of pushing Roma out of the way.
Never Look Away
Image copyrightSony Pictures Classics
Country: Germany
Language: German
Germany's track record: 19 nominations (including one for East Germany) including three wins. 
Director: Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck
Story:
An epic based in part on the real-life German artist Gerhard Richter, who was born in 1932. Kurt (played by Tom Schilling) is born in Dresden in the Nazi era and becomes an artist in post-war East Germany.
He falls in love with Elizabeth, whose father, a hospital administrator, is a former Nazi who conspired in the death of Kurt's aunt. The film (more than three hours long) moves to West Germany for the 1960s.
Chances of winning:
The director took the foreign language Oscar in 2006 for The Lives of Others, which was set in the German Democratic Republic and which many critics loved. It became a big international hit.
But Never Look Away has met less acclaim on US release, with many reviewers considering the running-time excessive. Some praised the film's look and ambition but others found it meandering. Damaging publicity came when Gerhard Richter was sharply disapproving of how the film uses parts of his life. 
Roma
Image copyrightCarlos Somonte/Netflix
Country: Mexico
Language: Spanish, Mixtec
Mexico's track record: Eight previous nominations - no wins.
Director: Alfonso Cuaron
Story:
Cleo is the live-in maid for a prosperous couple in Mexico. She is of indigenous descent. (Colonia Roma is a middle-class district of Mexico City.) The marriage of Sofia and Antonio is clearly under strain and eventually he leaves, although the children are told he's gone away to work. The children at times seem spoiled but are genuinely fond of Cleo. She becomes pregnant and we come to understand her better and see some of the tensions in Mexican society.
Chances of winning:
Many view Roma as the inevitable winner in this category. It's a superb bit of film-making and combines narrative drive with a poetic sensibility that doesn't ignore real-life tensions in the Mexico of the early 1970s. Like Cold War, it's shot in black and white. If it becomes the first winner in this category also to take best picture, it will be a big moment in Oscar history. Or will Academy voters decide that to reward Roma as foreign film would be overkill, depriving other film-makers of the boost an Oscar brings?
Shoplifters
Image copyrightThunderbird Releasing
Country: Japan
Language: Japanese
Japan's track record: 15 previous nominations, four wins
Director: Hirokazu Kore-eda
Story:
Another insight into the harsh realities of poverty. Osamu and Nobuyo are a couple barely getting by financially in a house in blue-collar Tokyo. They're living with an old woman who enjoys their company. They bring a young girl into the home who they think may be a victim of abuse. In some ways the household is a loving one but the group survives only by shoplifting - a skill in which they've become expert. Eventually their survival tactic is uncovered. 
Chances of winning:
The film offers a view of Japan unfamiliar to outsiders. The screenplay doesn't portray the family as caricature loveable rogues but we do come to understand the pressures they face. Both the adults and the children are well played and we care about what happens to them. It's notable that, as with Roma and Capernaum, fault-lines of class, income and ethnicity shape the narrative. But with two strong frontrunners, it's not likely Japan will take the Oscar this year.
The Oscars will take place on Sunday, 24 February.","A foreign language film could win best picture, proving global movie-making is in good health.",2019-02-18T01:12:12Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Oscars 2019: Roma's success shows there's more to movies than Hollywood,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47254707,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0CCC/production/_105667230_index.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Richter,0

Beth Mole,"Enlarge / The Goldman Sachs bank logo is seen reflected on the screen of a mobile phone in this photo illustration on November 15, 2017. reader comments 20 One-shot cures for diseases are not great for business—more specifically, they’re bad for longterm profits—Goldman Sachs analysts noted in an April 10 report for biotech clients, first reported by CNBC. The investment banks’ report, titled “The Genome Revolution,” asks clients the touchy question: “Is curing patients a sustainable business model?” The answer is “no,” according to follow-up information provided.

""They believe variations in the speed of Earth's rotation could trigger intense seismic activity, particularly in heavily populated tropical regions. Although such fluctuations in rotation are small -- changing the length of the day by a millisecond -- they could still be implicated in the release of vast amounts of underground energy, it is argued."" The theory goes that the slowdown creates a shift in the shape of the Earth's solid iron and nickel ""inner core"" which, in turn, impacts the liquid outer core on which the tectonic plates that form the Earth's crust rest. The impact is greater on the tectonic plates near some of the Earth's most populous regions along the Equator, home to about a billion people. Scientists from the University of Colorado looked at all earthquakes registering 7 and up on the Richter scale since the turn of the 20th century. In this timeframe, the researchers discovered five periods of significantly greater seismic activity.

Cory Doctorow,"Wolf Richter's dental insurer sent his family a free ""smart"" toothbrush that records how often and how well you brush, using a set of proprietary consumables to clean your teeth. Richter discovered that not only did his toothbrush rat on him, his insurer was paying attention: when he failed to unbox and start to use his toothbrush, the insurer started unsubtly prodding him to start. The fine-print for the toothbrush and its app is your basic shitty you-agree-to-let-us-spy-on-everthing-and-sell-it Internet of Shit EULA.

Nicole Gallucci,"New year, new political beefs. Of course!
It's only Jan. 2, but 2019 has already kicked off with a political bang. The government remains partially shut down and on Tuesday night a scathing  op-ed written by Mitt Romney, former Republican presidential nominee and current senator-elect, was published in The Washington Post.
In the 13-paragraph editorial, Romney unleashed his brutally honest criticisms of President Trump, saying his ""character falls short"" of that needed to successfully shape the nation. And on Wednesday morning, Trump addressed Romney's words with a single 280-character tweet, saying he should be happy ""for all Republicans.""
Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didnt. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player &amp; WIN!

Naturally, the good and very consistent people of the internet have already taken Romney's quest for political justice to Twitter. Some dove into the inescapable political archives to discuss Romney's acceptance of past Trump endorsements and call him a hypocrite.

It is so easy for people to take shots at Mitt Romney. He has done plenty to deserve that. But while you are stewing in your own cynicism remember that the future of our country is likely to depend on whether a few Republicans step upfor whatever reasonand challenge Trump.

In the op-ed, Romney began by acknowledging that Trump was never his choice for Republican  nominee, but that he hoped after winning, Trump's administration would abandon petty approaches like anger and name-calling. 
""But, on balance,"" Romney concluded, ""his conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.""
The presidency ""shapes the public character of the nation,"" Romney wrote, noting a person with Trump's power should unite the American people, defend the free press, and display honesty and integrity.
""With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring.""

Shawn Langlois,"Finding an affordable place to live in the tech-rich Bay Area isnt easy these days, but it sure seems to be getting easier a lot easier. That is assuming Wolf Richter of the Wolf Street blog has it right. Its high time to unload houses and condos in Silicon Valley and San Francisco, Richter wrote. Sellers are now flooding the market with properties. In fact, according to data provided by the National Association of Realtors, he points out inventory has more than doubled from a year ago. Just take a look at this chart: As the chart shows, the number of active listings has risen in each of the past three months, and now were at levels not seen since 2014. Richter says the red bars signal bubble trouble in the housing market. Now, weve got buyers refusing to participate in the bidding wars that have been a hallmark of the red-hot sector for years. They see the prices and they do the math with higher mortgage rates, and they walk, Richter said. So, motivated sellers have to do something to move the properties. And they started cutting prices. And that brings us to chart #2, which shows the number of properties for sale with price cuts has exploded by over 400% year over year. Which, obviously impacts media asking prices, as chart #3 shows: The median asking price peaked in May was at $1,369,200 and has since fallen by $132,100 or by nearly 10%, to $1,237,100, Richter wrote. After years of blaming the surging home prices in the area on a shortage of inventory for sale, he said, the industry is suddenly faced with all kinds of inventory coming out of the woodwork, just as sales are slowing and as mortgage rates are rising, while the affordability crisis bites the market. Richter warns that whats especially worrisome about this trend is that the tech boom is still, for the most part, thriving. No real signs of hiring slowdowns or layoffs, and the tech start-up market is also going strong, he says. Though share prices of local companies such as Google-parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -4.96% Apple AAPL, -4.40% Facebook FB, -2.62% and many others have taken a big hit since the summer, were still far from a classic tech meltdown, he said. That is yet to come.

Jessi Hempel,"Mark Zuckerberg has never really understood privacy. From Facebook’s earliest days, he figured people would eventually grow comfortable sharing everything with everyone—indeed, his business depended on it. Everytime Facebook rolled out a new feature, a subset of us questioned our ability to control who gets to see the personal information we’d been uploading in the form of pokes and pictures and witty wall posts. But these worries never triggered an insurgency. If the violation was truly egregious, Zuckerberg would just apologize, usually via a Facebook post, and announce a fix. The fix often involved updating its privacy tools. (In 2014, Facebook even introduced a charming blue dinosaur as a privacy instructor.) As the site expanded, these labyrinthian settings became increasingly hard to grok, and often made more information public by default, rather than putting true control in the hands of its users. On March 28, twelve days after The Guardian and The New York Times revealed that Cambridge Analytica had misused Facebook user data (and that the company had known about the violation and done nothing.) Facebook once again announced newly redesigned privacy tools, this time placed at the top of its newsfeed. Maybe these tools will put users in control of our personal information once and for all, and as a result, we will trust Facebook to protect our data better in the future. But if history is any guide, we’ll see this episode again, judging by this not-at-all exhaustive list of the times Zuckerberg has apologized for giving you privacy jitters, and assured you it would all be absolutely fine, eventually. News Feed Nuisance, September 2006 “We really messed this one up.” –Mark Zuckerberg When Facebook first launched Newsfeed, the design that has come to define all social software, its users revolted because suddenly their posts were revealed in one centralized place. Zuckerberg wrote his first apology letter, writing “we did a bad job of explaining what the new features were and an even worse job of giving you control of them.” Eventually, concern died down as people got used to the Newsfeed. The Opt-In Assumption, December 2007 ""We simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize for it."" –Mark Zuckerberg When Zuckerberg announced its first targeted advertising product, Beacon, users were outraged that Facebook was using their information—including information it had gotten from third-party sites, like whether they bought concert tickets from Fandango—to help advertisers target them. Zuckerberg addressed criticism in a post, saying “It took us too long after people started contacting us to change the product so that users had to explicitly approve what they wanted to share.” As a result of complaints, he said the company had made Beacon opt-in, and that Facebook planned to release a feature that let people turn it off completely. (Facebook shut down Beacon on 2009.) Creating Confusion, December 2009 “We're adding something that many of you have asked for.” –Mark Zuckerberg This time, Facebook attempted to get in front of its users’ data concerns. As it stepped up its efforts with advertisers, Facebook launched new privacy tools that aimed to “empower people to personalize control over their information,” according to an announcement from Zuckerberg. Yet critics complained the tools were overly confusing and pushed users to make even more of their personal information public, rather than giving them control. This triggered an Federal Trade Commission investigation. Break Things, May 2010 “Sometimes we move too fast.” –Mark Zuckerberg Reporting in The Wall Street Journal revealed that advertisers were using a privacy loophole to retrieve revealing personal information, like users’ names, from Facebook (and other social networks like MySpace and Xanga). Facebook quickly made a change to its software to get rid of the identifying code, and a few days later, announced plans to redesign its privacy settings. This time, Zuckerberg detailed the changes in an apologetic Washington Post op-ed, writing “sometimes we move too fast,” before posting on his Facebook profile. Privacy Predicament, November 2011 “I'm the first to admit that we've made a bunch of mistakes.” –Mark Zuckerberg After the FTC charged Facebook with deceiving consumers by saying they could keep their information private, and then allowing it to be shared and made public, Facebook agreed to a settlement. Zuckerberg addressed the agreement, which he never explicitly called a “settlement,” in a blog post. The company had made a number of mistakes, Zuckerberg wrote, but he understood “that many people are just naturally skeptical of what it means for hundreds of millions of people to share so much personal information online, especially using any one service.” He then offered up a list of new tools Facebook had made available to help users control their privacy and announced he’d have two chief privacy officers going forward, instead of one. One Version of Control, January 2013 “You control who you share your interests and likes with on Facebook.” –Michael Richter, former Chief Privacy Officer, Facebook In January, Facebook rolled out a search product called Graph Search, designed to let users search any topic inside Facebook. This riled privacy activists, because it allowed people to unearth any information a user hadn’t pro-actively protected. Days later, one of Facebook’s chief privacy officers respond to the concerns, kicking off a trend of the company addressing privacy concerns after the fact. This became a steady coda to nearly every product launch that followed. Facebook Under Fire, March 2018 “We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you.” –Mark Zuckerberg After five days of silence, Zuckerberg finally weighed in on the reports that Cambridge Analytica misused its data, and it failed to protect its users. Less than a week later, the company has promised once again to improve its privacy settings. The announcement reads, as usual, like a mea culpa, headlined: It’s Time to Make Our Privacy Tools Easier to Find. “We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find and that we must do more to keep people informed,” write the two executives who’ve penned the announcement. Superficially, it seems like the company is taking things seriously and working hard to make changes, but review the evidence and it sounds like trite old news. Indeed, It’s a version of something we’ve all heard before. In Facebook We Trust Follow along with all of WIRED’s coverage of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It’s tricky to figure out exactly what data Facebook has accumulated—here’s what to look for in that data. There’s one group that doesn’t get much access to Facebook data: researchers.

Reuters,"A Tesla Model X is photographed alongside a Model S at a Tesla electric car dealership in Sydney, Australia, May 31, 2017. REUTERS/Jason Reed (Reuters) - A Tesla Inc employee organizing a union was asked by a supervisor and company security guards to leave the factory after handing out pro-union flyers, the worker said at a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) hearing on Monday over whether Tesla had violated federal safeguards for employee activity. The NLRB general counsel brought the case before a board administrative law judge after receiving complaints from three Tesla workers and the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW). If Tesla loses, the company could be required to notify its employees that it was found to be committing unfair labor practices, a victory for union organizers. The case comes as Tesla has struggled to ramp up production of the Model 3, a sedan intended for volume production that is key to the company achieving long-term profitability. Edris Rodriguez Ritchie, an attorney for the NLRB, said Tesla asked workers to sign confidentiality agreements that were ""overly broad"" in preventing them from publicly discussing their working conditions. Tesla has denied the allegations and described them as an effort to make Chief Executive Elon Musk look bad. Michael Sanchez, who has worked at Tesla since 2012 and is currently on medical leave, said he was asked to leave by security guards and a supervisor while handing out leaflets to colleagues outside a Tesla facility in February 2017. ""What we see is a very heavy-handed, anti-union campaign that's affected all levels of workers' everyday lives,"" said Margo Feinberg, attorney with Schwartz, Steinsapir, Dohrmann &amp; Sommers in her opening remarks for the UAW, which supports the NLRB counsel in the case. Speaking on behalf of Tesla, Mark Ross of Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton LLP listed about two dozen other allegations against the company that were found to be without merit and dismissed. ""The fact of the matter is that Tesla is a company that values its employees,"" Ross said in his opening remarks. In a series of tweets in May, Musk said he had not done anything to prevent unionizing efforts by workers. ""Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted,"" Musk tweeted on May 20. Hearings for the case are scheduled to continue through Thursday and resume in late September. Judge Amita Tracy is expected to deliver her judgment sometime after that.

But in the early 80s, old-school practical effects were still a Hollywood staple, and using crayons, sculptor Steven Richter demonstrates just how simple it is to make someone look like theyre melting away. Of course simple is a relative term in this case, as Richter is already a very talented sculptor and makes short work of recreating actor Ronald Laceys head using a mixture of melted crayons and clay so that the material can be shaped and moulded. You can certainly try it yourself, but the results might not end up looking quite as Hollywood-caliber. The next step is much easier, however. To recreate the immense powers and awe of the Ark of the Covenant, Richter simply pointed a heat gun and a hair dryer at his completed crayon sculpture and waited. Its a slow process, but the magic of timelapse footage immensely speeds up the final result, which doesnt look that far off from what actually ended up in Raiders.","If made today, the Raiders of the Lost Ark scene with Major Toht’s grisly demise would undoubtedly be created using a digital stunt double and complex CG fluid simulations.

Gabriela Quirós,"Spring is here. Unfortunately for hikers and picnickers enjoying the warmer weather, the new season is prime time for ticks, which can transmit bacteria that cause Lyme disease. How they latch on — and stay on — is a feat of engineering that scientists have been piecing together. Once you know how a tick's mouth works, you understand why it's impossible to simply flick a tick. The key to their success is a menacing mouth covered in hooks that they use to get under the surface of our skin and attach themselves for several days while they fatten up on our blood. ""Ticks have a lovely, evolved mouth part for doing exactly what they need to do, which is extended feeding,"" said Kerry Padgett, supervising public health biologist at the California Department of Public Health in Richmond. ""They're not like a mosquito that can just put their mouth parts in and out nicely, like a hypodermic needle."" Instead, a tick digs in using two sets of hooks. Each set looks like a hand with three hooked fingers. The hooks dig in and wriggle into the skin. Then these ""hands"" bend in unison to perform approximately half-a-dozen breaststrokes that pull skin out of the way so the tick can push in a long stubby mouth part called the hypostome. ""It's almost like swimming into the skin,"" says Dania Richter, a biologist at the Technische Universität Braunschweig, Germany, who has studied the mechanism closely. ""By bending the hooks it's engaging the skin. It's pulling the skin when it retracts."" A tick nymph, or young tick, has dug its mouth into a human arm. Left to its own devices, this western blacklegged tick nymph will stay attached for three to four days, during which time it will drink enough blood to later molt and grow into an adult. Josh Cassidy/KQED The bottom of the hypostome is also covered in rows of hooks that give it the look of a chainsaw. Those hooks act like mini-harpoons, anchoring the tick to us for the long haul. ""They're teeth that are backward facing, similar to one of those gates you would drive over but you're not allowed to back up or else you'd puncture your tires,"" says Padgett. Compounds in ticks' saliva help blood pool under the surface of our skin. Ticks sip it, like drinking from a straw. Ticks need to stay firmly attached because they're going in for a meal that can last three to 10 days, depending on whether they're young ticks or adult females. Compare that to a speedy mosquito, which digs into human skin, sucks blood and leaves, all within seconds. For ticks, the stakes are high because instead of taking small meals they need to gorge themselves each time. A western blacklegged tick, the species that transmits Lyme bacteria to humans along the Pacific coast, lives three years. But in that time it only eats three huge meals, each one necessary for it to grow to its next life stage. It needs enough blood to grow from larva to nymph, nymph to adult and then for females to lay their eggs. An adult female tick drinks so much blood during its one meal that its weight increases 200 times, said Richter. So what's the best way to get rid of a tick? The hooks that make these infrequent but long, banquets possible are what make it hard to pull a tick out. But it's not as hard as you might think. Padgett recommends grabbing the tick close to the skin using a pair of fine tweezers and simply pulling straight up. ""No twisting or jerking,"" she says. ""Use a smooth motion pulling up."" Credit: Josh Cassidy/KQED Padgett warned against other strategies. ""Don't use Vaseline or try to burn the tick or use a cotton swab soaked in soft soap or any of these other techniques that might take a little longer or might not work,"" she says. ""You really want to remove the tick as soon as possible."" Time is of the essence. If an infected tick bites humans, it takes at least 24 hours before Lyme bacteria start swimming out in the saliva the tick drips into its host. So don't worry if the tick's mouth parts — the ones covered in those tenacious hooks — stay behind when you pull. ""The mouth parts are not going to transmit disease to people,"" says Padgett. Once the tick's body is no longer attached, it can't transmit bacteria. And if the mouth stayed behind in your skin, it will eventually work its way out, sort of like a splinter does, she says. In California, adult ticks carry Lyme bacteria less often than nymphs because of a biological quirk in the region. Ticks that carry Lyme bacteria and feed on the western fence lizard lose their infection in the process. The lizard's blood actually clears the infection, said Andrea Swei, who studies ticks and disease transmission at San Francisco State University. Ticks most commonly feed on the lizards when they're larvae and nymphs. If a nymph was infected before it fed on a lizard, it will no longer be infected after it grows into an adult. Experts say a key way to avoid tick bites is to be prepared. Wear long pants and put on repellent next time you're planning a hike or picnic in an area where ticks and their impressive hooks may be lurking.

By 2020, only about 10% of Ford’s F, +2.16% North America portfolio will consist cars, which, according to Wolf Richter of the Wolf Street blog, poses a real problem when oil prices CLM8, -0.04% surge and auto manufacturers are faced with scrambling to meet refreshed demand for gas-friendlier vehicles. Read: Ford says only Mustang, Focus will live on. Meanwhile, prepare for the trend captured in this telling chart to continue: “As auto makers abandon cars, sales will plunge further,” Richter wrote. “No one wants to buy the end of the line. And these plunging sales will be further reason to cut car models. A circularity will set in, sort of a death spiral.” But while the likes of Ford and General Motors GM, -1.85% steer further away from the smaller vehicles, Richter says the foreign brands, like Toyota TM, +0.29% will keep at it, at least in relative terms, and ultimately pounce on pricier gas. “When gasoline costs $7 a gallon, suddenly they’ll have a best-seller on their hands, and the wailing and gnashing of teeth in Detroit will be heard all the way to Washington,” Richter explained in his blog post.

Matthew Milan,"The best innovation teams dont work alone. They bring in partners from different backgrounds, countries, and even industries to help provide fresh thinking and ideas. The process of finding and forging partnerships and collaborations, however, is not easy to do well. The best teams Ive worked with have come up with a clever solution: They develop partnerships in much the same way they develop products. Rather than simply hiring vendors, the most innovative companies establish processes and frameworks that allow them to quickly validate whether a partner will be a good fit. Theyll get to work immediately, and focus together on the smallest tangible outcome that will provide proof that the partnership is actually working. I like to call it a Minimum Viable Partnership model. In this model, the partnership IS the project. The test and learn partnership model Most business partnerships are quid pro quo. An organization identifies a problem, and then sets out to hire a vendor to provide a solution. When it comes to innovation partnerships, however, the traditional model may not always produce the best output. Why? Because innovation teams dont have specific, concrete problems to solve. They have problem spaces to explore. In situations like these, paying another company to help explore the space with you doesnt make sense. Theres too much uncertainty to justify large commitments for an unknown payoff. So, the best internal innovation teams start by testing potential partners first, before getting down to business, so they find the right talent who can iterate on solutions together. Great innovators use this test and learn approach to partnerships no matter how big or small their company is. Using tools like the Lean Startup methodology, these innovators quickly explore and refine different partnership approaches with complementary companies instead of directly hiring firms to do a specific job. My team and I used this approach when we worked with a small healthcare startup. To reduce patient neglect in hospitals, the startup wanted to design an AI-based, wall-mounted device that monitors everything that happens in a patients room to help nurses and hospitals understand how well theyre taking care of patients. The startups founders realized that to build their product they needed outside expertise from technologists and healthcare practitioners to augment their core team. Our first few interactions demonstrated that we could work well together, and ultimately, everybody benefited from this approach. The small healthcare startup got the experts in the room they needed, the technology companies got exposure to a new, lucrative industry, and the healthcare providers got early access to new ways of thinking and technology that changed the way they thought about patient care. The resulting product, iN, is currently being implemented and deployed at a major academic medical center in New York City, and was just recognized by Fast Company as an Innovation by Design award winner. But you dont need to be a startup to use the Most Valuable Partnership model. The best example Ive found of a large company using this approach is Johnson &amp; Johnsons JLABS program. Melinda Richter, the global head of Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation, JLABS, recently told me that the goal of her program is to make it easy for the companys innovation team to start exploring partnerships without worrying about competition, IP, or budget. She said her team starts their partnership process by inviting startups, research labs, granting agencies, and even competitors to events around the world, where they discuss shared scientific challenges. Using these events, the innovation team identifies potential partners, and invites the most promising ones to collaborate even further by inviting them to work at one of its 12 JLABS incubators. These JLABS include shared laboratory equipment that only a company with the scale of Johnson &amp; Johnson could afford. The process doesnt end there. In some cases, JLABS will give partners access to additional talent, data, and even funds to run quick experiments. And they do all of this without taking any economic stake in the partners they work with. Investing in a partnership or collaboration without asking for equity or revenue-sharing may seem crazy, but thats precisely why this model works so well. Because JLABS doesnt have to worry about the ROI of every decision they make, they can try lots of unconventional collaborations quickly and cheaply, giving them access to research and ideas they would ordinarily never be exposed to. It turns out this approach pays off. The most extraordinary example Richter shared with me was a company called Arcturus, which was interested in rare diseases, an area of research that typically isnt profitable for large pharmaceutical companies. Richter met Arcturus founders at multiple JLABS events, where she grew to love the passion of the two founders. Because of JLABS unique no-strings attached approach, she had no problem giving Arcturus access to R&amp;D experts to develop a plan, and laboratories to conduct initial research. When they came back with promising data, Johnson &amp; Johnson helped them raise venture money by validating their results. A few months later, Richter asked Arcturus to present their data to Johnson &amp; Johnsons R&amp;D leadership. At that presentation, one of Johnson &amp; Johnsons leaders realized that the same technology Arcturus was developing for rare diseases could be used for Hepatitis B, one of the worlds deadliest, most debilitating diseases, and ended up partnering with the small company on technology that even eventually did more than $2 billion worth of deals and is now a public company. Not all JLABS partnerships are that successful, of course. But by creating a process where they can test out partnerships with minimal friction and risk, Richters team has developed a lean process that can turn networking events into billion-dollar innovations. A new partner discovery playbook The partnership-as-product approach isnt limited to big companies partnering with startups. In fact, sometimes it works best when you need to make sweeping changes across a large, slow-moving industry. To understand their approach, I called up Tina Wung, who was formerly a longtime corporate innovator and now consults for Fortune 1000 companies who are looking to innovate. She told me that innovation challenges at large corporations look very different than than they look at most companies. When they want to explore a new idea, they dont just need to explore it with end consumers; they need to work with manufacturers, marketers, distributors, retailers, even sports leagues. To innovate in such a complex space, she said she often deployed a tactic from lean product development playbooks: Im calling it Partner Discovery. Wung often started the process by identifying partners who were interested in working in an innovative way and were willing to experiment on solving any one of the companys core interest areas (i.e., improving sustainability in the supply chain). Once her team identified potential partners, they started discussing ideas and challenges across the industry that they might be able to solve together. As trust grew, they were able to be more transparent about what they were each developing internally, ultimately sharing ideas and product roadmaps that had previously been closely guarded secrets. In taking this approach, Wung was able to decrease the risk for all of her partners innovation teams by effectively spreading it across multiple organizations. This allowed the entire industry to cut losses faster and increase the pace of innovation. Whether youre a startup trying to get a complex product off the ground, a multinational business looking to explore moonshots outside your core business, or a conglomerate trying to make an industry more innovative, you should consider taking a lean, product-development approach to building partnerships. Theres no better way to navigate the complex world of innovation work that with the tried and true approach of build, test and learn to establish a fit between you and and a new partner.","The best innovation teams don’t work alone.

Shawn Langlois,"The junk-bond market has been on fire. And, now, as corporate debt piles up to “precarious heights” in the face of a rising-rate environment and a hawkish Federal Reserve, Wolf Richter of the Wolf Street blog finds that Wall Street pros are licking their lips over the potential popping of the bubble. The so-called smart money, he says, is getting ready to load up on distressed debt, which is defined as junk-rated bonds yielding at least 10 percentage points above equivalent U.S. Treasurys TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.63%. “It’s preparing now because these preparations include raising billions of dollars for their funds, and that takes some time,” Richter wrote in a post. He explained that distressed-debt investors can rack up big profits during times of economic stress by buying bonds of companies they believe will emerge from the gloomy cycle without defaulting. “In this scenario, a distressed bond might sell for 40 cents on the dollar, and two years later, the company is still intact and the credit squeeze is resolved, and now the bond is worth face value,” he said. “For those two years, the bond paid a huge yield to investors that bought at 40 cents on the dollar – and the profit might be 200% in capital gains and interest.” That’s the kind of scenario investors like Jason Mudrick, founder of Mudrick Capital, are hoping for in the coming weeks and months. “This economy is roaring right now,” Mudrick told the Financial Times. “It’s rocking and rolling. But that’s just not sustainable. My job is not to predict exactly when [the turn in the cycle] happens but to have the platform ready when it does.” Richter gave an example of the kinds of gains those who time the shift correctly can pocket. The U.S. High Yield Corporate Distressed Bond Index, for instance, peaked in early July 2014 right before the oil bust and proceeded to drop 56% over the next 18 months. This chart tells you all you need to know about where it went when new money flowed back in and banks started lending again. The index’s gain over the next two years or so doubled that of the S&amp;P 500 SPX, +0.38% which had notched a massive 46% rally of its own. “The smart money that got the timing right made huge gains,” Richter wrote. “But the hypothetical buy-and-holder, whose portfolio mirrors the bonds in the index, would have seen their investments plunge and then recover mostly, but they would still be down 6%.” So, the smart money is at it again, building up a cash pile — $74 billion, by one measure — and preparing for the next downturn in junk bonds HYG, +0.12%. According to the FT, seven distressed debt funds have raised money more than $15 billion total this year alone. One of them is run by Sheru Chowdhry, the former co-portfolio manager of the Paulson Credit Opportunities fund. “I think we’ll be doing a lot of distressed stuff when there’s distressed stuff to do,” Chowdhry told the FT. “It feels like we’re about 12 months away, but we could get into extended innings.” Read: Next wreck in junk bonds will be bigger, longer, uglier. Richter says while the smart money sets up for the next credit event and the opportunities it will bring, the little guy has to tread cautiously as it takes “a special expertise” to pull it off successfully. “When the bottom falls out, distressed debt becomes an illiquid market. When forced selling sets in as bond mutual funds and others that have to meet redemptions by nervous retail investors, while buyers simply evaporate, incredible deals can be made,” he explained. “But the risk of total wipeout is large. Many distressed bonds get crushed in bankruptcy. This is a fate to be avoided.”","The junk-bond market has been on fire.

NINA SIEGAL,"Ms. Wagstaff oversees the Met Breuer, the museum’s branch on Madison Avenue and, in a telephone interview, she described her programming there as “consciously transhistorical,” a term she said she started using about six years ago. “With a blending of history and contemporary art, we can reveal some of the puzzles at the centers of great art,” she said. The Breuer’s 2016 exhibition “ Unfinished: Thoughts Left Visible ” presented incomplete paintings through the ages, from Titian to Lucian Freud, Gerhard Richter and Bruce Nauman. She followed up with “ Like Life: Sculpture, Color and the Body (1300 -N ow),” on view until July 22, which takes a nonchronological look at 700 years of sculptures of the human body. Including not only fine art but also wax effigies and anatomical models, the show opens with a hyperrealistic sculpture by Duane Hanson from 1984, jumps from a 15th-century Donatello sculpture to a Spanish Renaissance work by El Greco, and juxtaposes a modern android with a 19th-century effigy of Jeremy Bentham, made with the British philosopher’s bones. “The idea with this show was to open it up and to expand the canon more, with work that could be seen in a more populist way,” Ms. Wagstaff said. Suzanne Sanders, an art historian in Amsterdam, who organized conferences on “The Transhistorical Museum” in 2015 and 2016, calls transhistorical curating “the most urgent thing curators are doing in trying to reinvent the museum to create some sort of new paradigm.” “It can be ‘trans’ in all these senses of the word,” she explained, “from across history, to transdisciplinary or queer, or just to represent things in an inclusive way, to find a balance between acknowledging and addressing points of view.” But James Bradburne, director of the Brera Art Gallery in Milan, said the trend was just a new term for what curators have always done: “Try and bring people back to the moment when the art was contemporary.” “We are always obliged to re-perform the art we have in our collections in a contemporary way,” he said, “just as an actor, when they perform Shakespeare, has to re-perform it for a contemporary audience, whether in mafia costumes or in drag.” A year ago, M, a museum in Leuven, Belgium, rehung its permanent collection as “ Collection M: The Power of Images,” presenting new comparisons, such as a 14th-century Pietà alongside a 16th-century Baroque painting and a conceptual art installation from 2009. “We wanted to get out of this time-chain approach,” its director, Eva Wittocx, said by telephone. “Even people who know these works for a long time can find new meanings or new ways of looking at them.” Photo Tullio Lombardo’s “Young couple,” left, from around 1505 has been placed alongside Felix Gonzalez-Torres’ “Untitled (Perfect Lovers),” a work from 1987-1990, at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.

Credit Kunsthistorisches Museum; Kate Rothko Prizel &amp; Christopher Rothko/Artists Rights Society (ARS) “I’d like to think that we are teasing out all of the ideas and concerns and dreams and nightmares that are buried in all of the historical works that we have,” said Jasper Sharp, who curates the museum’s program for modern and contemporary art. But he added that the curators spent a few years trying to figure out “what types of confrontations would be interesting, respectful,” he said. Pairing Édouard Manet with Diego Velázquez, or bringing a Titian into conversation with a J.M.W. Turner seemed to work, he said, because “these are very well-documented admirations of younger artists looking at older artists.” But other choices proved riskier. Scores of art lovers responded on Instagram to the museum’s juxtaposition of a Rembrandt self-portrait next to a Mark Rothko color field painting. “Half of them were saying ‘this is absolutely abysmal,’ or ‘Rembrandt must be turning in his grave,’” Mr. Sharp said. “Some of the connections knit together instantly; others reward more sustained looking.” Ms. Demeester of the Frans Hals Museum pointed out that the history of art is cacophonous in its connections and influences — with “people talking to each other in salons and cafes and messing things up.” “In creating more meaning and new stories for an audience, it’s important as a museum to think more like an artist,” she added. “An artist is more free, or less inhibited than an art historian, to make connections that go across time or across culture or across geography. To connect.” A version of this article appears in print on April 21, 2018, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Mash-Ups Bridge Time.

Allegra Frank,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. will introduce another Donkey Kong character to the game. King K. Rool, a long-time enemy of D.K. and his simian dudes, enters the fray for the first time. During today’s Super Smash Bros.-centric Nintendo Direct, the company announced two new characters, including Simon Belmont and his echo fighter, Richter, before ending the presentation with King K. Rool. Donkey Kong fans have wanted another rep from the franchise for some time — and K. Rool in particular. He first appeared in Donkey Kong Country for the Super Nintendo, a series where he continued to be the main villain. The Kremling king looks like an alligator, but he’s... a Kremling, obviously. He’s also a fan of bananas, which is a big reason why he’s so anti-Donkey Kong and company. K. Rool isn’t the most threatening guy — no offense intended — and that may be why his intro teaser compared him to Kirby’s antagonist, King Dedede. Still, we love both of these royals all the same. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is heading to Nintendo Switch on Dec. 7. The game will be exclusive to Nintendo Switch, and marks the fifth unique entry in Nintendo’s crossover fighting series.

Alana Abramson,"Lauren Cooper first started to notice something was awry with her daughter Molly when she was seven months old, in 2003, and was unable to bear any weight on her legs. Alarmed, she and her husband Kevin Allen took her to a slew of doctors and neurologists, but a diagnosis evaded them. Finally, Cooper found something on the internet called Rett Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder found mainly in girls with symptoms that matched her daughters’. Molly not only tested positive for the syndrome, which affects language, breathing, coordination, and can produce seizures, but had one of the more severe mutations. “I had a pretty good idea of what was going to be in the future for us,” Lauren Cooper recalled in an interview with TIME. “At thirteen months, I knew that she was gonna need ever-expanding care.” That care has been paid for by the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, which not only covers Molly and her two siblings but also subsidizes all of her medical supplies. But despite bipartisan support, the future of the federal and state program has been put on hold as Congress squabbles over how to pay for an extension. That’s put additional stress on families who rely on CHIP to keep their children healthy. Today, Molly, now 14, is unable to walk or talk, and is fed through a gastrostomy tube. She suffers from seizures, and got septic shock last summer after scoliosis surgery. Although Lauren and Kevin, who live in Washington, D.C., went on to have two other children, 8-year-old Sophie and 5-year-old Rory, they altered their careers to fit their daughter’s needs; both are self employed, because it makes it easier to rush to the emergency room when Molly has a seizure that lasts longer than five minutes. (Kevin is an editorial photographer and Lauren runs her own cake-making company). CHIP enabled the family to simultaneously keep Molly at home and remain financially stable, says Cooper. “It completely changed our lives,” Cooper said of program. “We were able to get things for Molly we could never have before, because everything is covered.” Implemented in 1997, CHIP uses a combination of federal and state funding to insure children whose parents do not qualify for Medicaid, but are not necessarily covered under private insurance. The program, which covered 8.9 million children across all 50 states and the District of Columbia in fiscal year 2016, according to the Kaiser Foundation, has become a financial lifeline, not only for families like the Allen’s, who face exorbitant medical costs by chance, but for working class families with healthy children. But its future could be in jeopardy. CHIP is essentially funded by money the federal government provides to the states, so Congress has to greenlight the spending through reauthorization. The program had been on a five-year reauthorization cycle, but in 2015, Congress reauthorized it for two years instead. Funding lapsed on September 30. Although Congress approved $2.85 billion in December to fund the program through March 31, a plan for funding a more permanent reauthorization has yet to reach a consensus. “It’s definitely something that weighs on my mind every single day. I don’t feel secure,” said Cooper. “I’ve never even thought about [the possibility of losing funding] before. It always just seemed like something that was really well received. It was just something I didn’t think I’d worry about.” CHIP started as a bipartisan initiative, spearheaded by the late Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy and co-sponsored by Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch — who now chairs the finance committee, which ultimately determines funding mechanisms for the program — and has retained support on both sides of the aisle. The disagreements have stemmed from where the funding should come from; in November, for instance, House Democrats largely opposed a bill that would have reauthorized the program for five years, because the funding came from a portion of the Affordable Care Act that would otherwise subsidize public health programs. On Thursday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said that reauthorizing CHIP for 10 years would ultimately reduce the deficit by $6 billion over the next decade, largely because of unrelated changes in the tax reform bill President Trump signed. Consequently, Congressional aides on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Senate finance committee — which have jurisdiction over funding mechanisms — have expressed optimism about reauthorization. “In light of the latest analysis from CBO – largely due to the repeal of the individual mandate – Chairman Hatch is reviewing options with committee members to determine how best to move forward to ensure a long-term CHIP extension occurs before January 19,” Katie Niederee, Press Secretary for the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, wrote in an e-mail to TIME. “ Chairman Hatch believes it is time to stop holding CHIP hostage and get this important program extended to ensure the families who rely on it get the care they need.” But for families reliant on the program who are unfamiliar with Congressional budgetary processes, they are simply bewildered and anxious. “The more time has gone on and the more they drag their feet on it, the closer we get to feeling like they won’t be funding it,” said Heather Richter, a Colorado mother with three children on CHIP whose son Ari, 5, has Type 1 diabetes. “The people … us, we don’t know. We’re just the ones getting caught up in this and having to wait around on people to make decisions.” No states have halted the program yet, because leftover funds have enabled continuity, although some states have sent letters to recipients of the program warning insurance could lapse. (The Richters have received three of those). But on Jan. 5, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said funds for the program would actually begin to dry up in some states starting Jan. 19, although the center did not specify the exact states that would be impacted. Parents are bracing themselves for the worst. Cooper says she has begun hoarding some of Molly’s supplies in case there is a lapse in coverage, and reusing supplies that are only intended for one-time use, like formula basins or feeding tube bags. “It’s not like i can go to the grocery store or go to the pharmacy and buy them. They are all prescribed, super-expensive things,” she explained. The family can apply for a Medicaid waiver for Molly should the program lapse, but there is no way to predict how long the wait will be. Even though Richter received a call from Hatch assuring her CHIP would remain intact, she’s still on the edge of her seat. She is finishing her training to be a medical assistant, and if CHIP funding lapses, all of her family’s extra income would go towards her son’s medical supplies. “His exact words [to me] were ‘it’s not easy to move an entire government body,’” Richter said of her phone call with the Senator. “I don’t know why they’ve waited until the very last minute to figure this out, and who knows what he means by that.”","""We’re just the ones getting caught up in this""",2018-01-12T11:00:05Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",‘I Don’t Know Why They’ve Waited.’ Families Stress Over Delay in Children’s Health Funding,http://time.com/5093735/childrens-health-insurance-program-funding-delay/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cooperfamily.jpeg?quality=85,time,Time,Richter,0
ANNA CODREA-RADO,"Since Mr. Frahm’s breakthrough album, “Felt,” was released in 2011, he has become the face of a new breed of musicians who combine elements of electronic dance and classical music to produce a new, more contemplative kind of pop. Often branded “contemporary classical” or “neoclassical,” his tracks feature alongside artists such as Max Richter, Olafur Arnalds and Brian Eno on playlists created by Spotify with names like “ Late Night Synths and Strings.” Mr. Frahm has played concert halls, including the Barbican Center in London and Philharmonie de Paris, as well as music festivals including Dimensions in Croatia and Primavera Sound in Barcelona. Mr. Frahm’s music is often led by him on the piano, supplemented with electronic textures from synthesizers and drum machines. It’s melancholy, but also euphoric. “All Melody” opens with a haunting, wordless choral number (a collaboration with Shards, a British choir), followed by the percussive second track, “Sunson,” that would not be out of place in on a nightclub dance floor. Photo Mr. Frahm’s studio was originally built for the recording of chamber music by the East German state broadcaster. Credit Mustafah Abdulaziz for The New York Times The BBC radio presenter Mary Anne Hobbs, a highly regarded musical tastemaker in Britain known for supporting experimental artists, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Frahm was “the single most important artist in the world right now.” Ms. Hobbs has championed Mr. Frahm’s music on her radio show since 2013, and in 2015 she invited him to play in a concert she was hosting at the BBC Proms, a festival mostly dedicated to classical music. “We stepped across a boundary that night,” Ms. Hobbs. “We showed that music with classical roots can be taken to a whole new generation who want to experience it and it can be interpreted in such a radical new way by Nils.” Mr. Frahm himself shied away from discussing genre. “Describing my music with genres is a helpless approach,” Mr. Frahm said. “I won’t ever fight against it though, I think it’s fantastic. It just tells me that a lot of people are still stuck not being able to choose for themselves.” The Icelandic producer Olafur Arnalds, a longtime collaborator, was more pragmatic. “I’m not a fan of the term of ‘neoclassical’ at all,” he said in a telephone interview. “But there’s definitely something great happening right now. It’s a mirror on our society; people are seeking this more contemplative type of music.” Mr. Frahm’s childhood in Hamburg, Germany, was filled with eclectic sounds, courtesy of his music-loving father, he said. “My parents were hippies but they bypassed all the clichéd rock stuff,” Mr. Frahm said. “No Eric Clapton or Pink Floyd, which I really appreciated.” Instead, Mr. Frahm’s father introduced him to jazz by artists like John Abercrombie, Horace Silver and Keith Jarrett, as well as classical music. His brother would be in one room of their family home playing techno, and his father in another with his own music on. “I was sitting in the middle and it noodled together,” Mr. Frahm said. Bringing these sounds together is what Mr. Frahm has been working on in his studio at the Funkhaus on the banks of the River Spree. A former headquarters of the East German state broadcaster (funkhaus means “broadcasting house” in German), it is a vast, imposing building, with a brutalist exterior that gives no hint of the opulent recording studios and performance rooms within. Photo Mr. Frahm’s music is often led by him on the piano, supplemented with electronic textures from synthesizers and drum machines. Credit Mustafah Abdulaziz for The New York Times Mr. Frahm’s studio was originally built for the recording of chamber music., With its golden wallpaper and parquet flooring, is an obscure piece of German musical history preserved in amber. Mr. Frahm had already held a number of recording sessions in the space, including for the soundtrack of “Victoria,” a 2015 thriller directed by Sebastian Schipper as a single continuous take, when the building’s new owners invited him to house his studio there. In the two years since, he has filled it with a huge collection of synthesizers, pianos and custom-built instruments. When Ms. Hobbs visited the studio in Feb. 2017, she said Mr. Frahm was in the middle of making “All Melody” and he had taken to sleeping there. “He’d made a tiny makeshift bed which was little more than a blanket folded over and a pillow on the ground,” she said. “The place of rest he created for himself was so humble and simple by comparison to the beautiful environment he made for his instruments.” Reverence for instruments started in Mr. Frahm’s youth, when he learned the piano from Nahum Brodski, who Mr. Frahm said had been taught by a student of Tchaikovsky. “It was nasty learning piano, boring,” he said, but he was disciplined in his practice. “I understood that you have to suffer for something which is beautiful,” he said. “This is my biggest criticism in our age, that we try to erase suffering and hardship from our lives in order to just be left only with beauty.” Mr. Frahm was about to play the final show in a four-day run of performances at the Funkhaus, the first leg of his world tour, and he turned to ruminating on how the concerts had gone so far. “These people have wet eyes and they look at me all smiling, and I feel like it’s my birthday every day,” he said. “But it makes me very skeptical,” he said. “It can’t be my birthday every day.” Mr. Frahm said that he didn’t think he could make music forever. He’s too troubled by the ills he sees in the world and making music doesn’t do enough to solve them. “I’m already thinking of when the right time will be to change jobs,” he said. “I still feel like I have a little bit of potential, but when I feel like I’m fully blossomed as a flower, I will cut myself down and something else will grow.” Continue reading the main story","Nils Frahm outside his studio in a former East German broadcasting headquarters in Berlin.

Didi Martinez,"After announcing the special election date, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott wrote the millionaire former congressman to request that Blake Farenthold pay for the special election costs himself. Farenthold refused. | Drew Anthony Smith/Getty Images Texas officials are fuming over the tab for the upcoming special election to replace former Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold. The total cost of the June 30 election to replace Farenthold, who resigned in April amid reports he had used $84,000 in taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit, is expected to be at least $157,000 in total — and many of the 13 largely rural counties holding the election say they can’t afford their share of the bill. Story Continued Below Worse, they argue, the special election is a pointless and needlessly costly exercise since the contest is likely to go to a September runoff — meaning the eventual winner is likely serve in Washington for less than 90 days. “We’re all not happy,” said Wharton County elections administrator Cynthia Richter. “It is what it is, it’s just crazy.” After announcing the special election date, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott wrote the millionaire former congressman to request that Farenthold pay for the special election costs himself. Farenthold had originally said he would pay back the $84,000 he used to settle the claim; the governor asked that he apply that money to the local counties to cover the costs of the special election. By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. Farenthold’s response? No. “In my opinion, as well as many other county officials I have heard from, a special election was not warranted and should not have been called,” wrote Farenthold in a letter addressed to Abbott. “However, that was your decision based upon the advice you were given. Since I didn’t call it and don’t think it’s necessary, I shouldn’t be asked to pay for it.” Farenthold also told ABC News that he has been instructed by his attorneys not to pay the $84,000 at all. That has left the burden on the financially strapped counties that comprise the 27th Congressional District, who say the election is burning a hole in their already-stretched budgets. “We don’t have the funds for it,” said Caldwell County elections administrator Pam Ohlendorf. “This election is costing us what we don’t have.” Matagorda County clerk Janet Hickl said: “It’s just crazy that they had to have more money just to have the special election.” Since leaving Congress, Farenthold has taken up a job with the Calhoun Port Authority as a legislative liaison, earning a salary of $160,000. Farenthold did not return several calls to the port authority seeking comment. County officials says expenses associated with a special election are forcing them to reach into their contingency funds -- accounts set up to cover government emergencies — or significantly downsize their operations. “We have done everything we can to introduce cost-saving methods,” said Bastrop County elections administrator Bridgette Escobedo, whose county is expected to shell out $12,000 in special election expenses. “We’ve consolidated locations, reduced election workers, we’re running minimum crews for no overtime, we’re all paper and ordered minimum ballots.” The counties aren’t alone in their frustration. The governor points his finger directly at Farenthold. “The governor shares the frustrations of the District in having to pay for a special election for a disgraced ex-congressman whose his final act was to stick taxpayers with the bill at the worst possible time,” wrote Abbott’s deputy press secretary Mac Walker in an email. “Texans in the 27th Congressional District deserve better representation, something they have severely lacked in Washington D.C. for far too long.” This article tagged under: Missing out on the latest scoops?

Olivia Singh,"Justin Theroux has opened up for the first time since his split with Jennifer Aniston. In a profile for the New York Times that was published on Saturday, the ""Maniac"" actor shared his thoughts on the couple's shocking split — which was confirmed in February 2018 after two years of marriage. ""The good news is that was probably the most — I'm choosing my words really carefully — it was kind of the most gentle separation, in that there was no animosity,"" Theroux said. ""In a weird way, just sort of navigating the inevitable perception of it is the exhausting part."" The 47-year-old went on to say that he and Aniston don't have any bad blood. ""Again, neither one of us is dead, neither one of us is looking to throw hatchets at each other,"" he said. ""It's more like, it's amicable. It's boring, but, you know, we respected each other enough that it was as painless as it could be."" Theroux added that although they remain on friendly terms, their friendship changed as a result of their split. ""It was heartbreaking, only in the sense that the friendship would not be the same, as far as just the day to day,"" he said. ""But the friendship is shifting and changing, you know, so that part is something that we're both very proud of."" The actor also said that he doesn't go on Twitter because ""with the internet, it's too inelegant a machine to accurately carve truth"" — but he's aware of headlines written about his personal life. ""These are actually in reality small events that take place,"" Theroux said. ""But everything can feel like 10 on the Richter scale if you make the headline big enough and salacious enough."" When Theroux and Aniston revealed their separation in February, their statement indicated that they still valued their relationship and would ""maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another."" ""We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship. Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else's fictional narrative.""

Jeff Beer,"So that was quite a week, eh? Of course, the biggest hits on the industry Richter scale came from the top of Mount WPP, and we’re still a ways out from seeing how the aftershocks affect the work we actually see and the agencies that help create it. But there were two other big hits of the week that once again illustrate the power of finding just the right way to break into culture. Spotify and Uniqlo helped create two pop cultural pieces of art that were singular, accessible, events in their own right. MORE PLEASE. Onward! Why we care: It’s just putting a little Ziggy Stardust into everyday life, through wall-sized images, fan-made art, and five limited edition MetroCards commemorating the late Thin White Duke. The brand is also using its Spotlight platform to host a new content series called David Bowie Stories, featuring anecdotes, origin stories, making-of’s, mini-essays and more, paired with photos, video, and other items from the David Bowie Archive.

Who: Under Armour, Droga5 Why we care: Johnson is one of the more uplifting, positive personalities in the celebrity-industrial complex, and here he’s in full Tony Robbins, brand spokesRock mode. Pairing him with lesser-known athletes—at least lesser known than UA stalwarts Steph Curry, Tom Brady, and Missy Copeland—fits the underdog, fighting-spirit narrative like a glove. Uppersafe “Hide Yourself–The Last Intrusion” What: An ad for online security brand Uppersafe that used open-source hacks to access cameras in people’s homes. Who: Uppersafe, Herezie Group Why we care: This might as well be an ad for the International Luddite Society. Confirming all our worst fears about access and privacy, the brand does a bang-up creepy job of illustrating the need for its product. It’s terrifying, and pretty damn clever.

Shawn Langlois,"The corporate buyback binge has reached historic proportions, with repurchases by S&amp;P 500
SPX, -0.56%
companies in the last three months of 2018 marking the fourth straight quarterly record high. 
Thats never happened before.
Companies continued to spend more of their tax savings on these share repurchases as they boosted earnings through significantly reduced share counts, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt explained last month. 
Top buyback queens in 2018 included Apple
AAPL, -0.12%
Oracle
ORCL, +0.26%
Wells Fargo
WFC, -1.47%
and Microsoft
MSFT, -0.48%
But what happens to these shares and the rest of the investment landscape when it stops? Wolf Richter of the Wolf Street blog chewed on the notion of a stock market without its biggest source of demand, and the picture he paints, with the help of Goldman Sachs
GS, -0.89%
isnt pretty.
Too painful to even imagine, he wrote. Share buybacks are the relentless bid, buying at any price, buying not to acquire assets at a low price but buying with the specific purpose of pushing up prices.
Read: How is this possible? Analysts puzzle over stock markets rally amid equity-fund exodus
To get a sense of what the biggest investors have been up to over the past few years of this broad market push, Richter cited this data:
As one can see, the total amount shed comes to about $1.1 trillion. Thats a lot of selling pressure, no doubt, but its no match for the massive $2.95 trillion in share buybacks that overpowered it. 
So it all worked out. As investors were selling, companies were buying back their own shares. And markets boomed. But what would happen to stocks in a world without buybacks? Richter asked, referencing the Goldman note. 
He explained that some members of Congress are now targeting share buybacks and proposing legislation, which apparently has Goldman Sachs concerned that the bull market may be hobbled.

It would be a truly unspeakably, nay, unthinkably gruesome nightmare that no politician would want to be responsible for: a world in which stock prices would decline! Richter said, cheekily. 
But in all seriousness, he laid out what would happen in such a scenario. Essentially, demand would evaporate, volatility would rise, earnings-per-share would take a hit and the bull market would lose the force that powered it. 
In other words, wed have a market left to fend for itself and embark on its own price discovery. No one would be ready for it, Richter said. This type of world is just too painful to even imagine these days.

Meira Gebel,"New Yorkers are known for being extreme — so extreme, in fact, that many are spending upwards of $100,000 on making their child's nursery into a picture-perfect dream. 
 According to a new report by the New York Post, some New York-based parents are eliciting the help of top-tier interior designers to go all out on nurseries and investing deeply in eye-catching aesthetics that can include details like 24-karat cribs that go for as much as $6,000. 
 ""Everyone is excited to show off their space — and their personalities via their space — more than ever before,"" Malorie Goldberg, co-president of Noa Blake Design in Marlboro, NJ, told the Post. 
 Zoya Bograd, a Murray Hill-based interior designer, estimated that her clients spend $10,000 to $100,000 decorating their child's nursery, while Keren Richter, a designer in Williamsburg, told the Post most of these big spenders are moms in their 40s with a level of financial stability. 
 But when money isn't an object, finding the right furniture, art, and even wallpaper becomes a great task. Brett Helsham, a mom featured in the Post piece, said she had a $4,000 custom wall pattern made after she was inspired by a similar print by de Gournay. The cost of her baby's entire nursery? $18,000. 
 Spending significant amounts of money on nurseries may just be the new status symbol for wealthy New Yorkers on par with, as Business Insider previously reported, being seen with a luxury pram, or ""bougie buggy"" stroller.
 And it begs the question: Is this all because of the overwhelming amount of mood boards and perfectly curated feeds inspired by the likes of Instagram and Pinterest? 
Read more:Wealthy New York moms are embracing a $600 'uniform' that signals a change in how people display their money
 Goldberg seems to think so, telling the Post, ""The honest truth, I think it's really for social media."" 
 It's far from the only trend to develop directly in reaction to social media. In fact, a $15,000-per-month NYC penthouse was designed specifically for social media; influencers rent the pink, perfectly curated space for lifestyle shoots. And similarly, new travel destinations are suddenly seeing an uptick in tourism, be that a bygone luxury destination like the Catskills that's reinventing itself with Instagrammable lodges and wellness retreats, or the Insta-famous blue city in the hills of Morocco that's been seen skyrocketing popularity thanks to the social platform.

Designed by the Richter Dahl Rocha &amp; Associés firm of architects, the Aquatis Complex is part of the Biopôle, a science park centred on life sciences, developing fast in the northern area of Lausanne. It is a strategic location, where the orbital motorway around the city intersects with the new M2 Lausanne Metro line, opened in 2008. The development consists of an area with a car park and Park &amp; Ride, where there is a hotel and the “ Cité de l’Eau Douce ” Aquarium/Vivarium, linked by a central mall that offers access both to the “Lausanne-Vennes” metro station and to the car park. Each building has its own identity, but is part of a coherent whole. © Fernando Guerra | FG+SG The 1200-place car park forms the structural basis of the project. Its unusual shape follows the built-up area of the site. It also follows the contours of the terrain, and has wide open views to the southern side on all three levels. It belongs to the city of Lausanne, and opened in September 2010. © Fernando Guerra | FG+SG The hotel, with its 143 3* superior rooms, has a restaurant, a wellness area, and several conference rooms. Its special “L” shape forms the boundary of the hub’s central area, and shows it off to best advantage. This space is the heart of the project – it houses the aquarium, the building that is emblematic of this freshwater complex. Its organic, circular shape gives it a unique identity, reflecting its teaching and cultural missions. © Fernando Guerra | FG+SG Floor Plan © Fernando Guerra | FG+SG While the silk-screened glass façades of the hotel reflect the colours of the surrounding area and the vagaries of the weather, those of the aquarium shimmer as the wind moves them. One hundred thousand aluminium discs are suspended from this façade, but they remain mobile due to their fixings. The effect caused by the wind looks like fish scales shining in the sun, or like waves on a body of water. There is water there at ground level, between the two buildings, in an outdoor pool which adds to this reflected play of light. It also contributes to the leisure aspect of the area, aimed at families. © Fernando Guerra | FG+SG More than two million litres of fresh water, twenty different ecosystems, 10,000 fish and more than one hundred reptiles (transferred from the old vivarium in Lausanne) will offer the visitor rich and varied surroundings in the first two storeys of the building. The ground floor is devoted largely to technology, essential to the functioning of the aquariums and the care of the creatures. The rest of the ground floor provides a reception area for visitors, an entrance hall, shop, cloakroom and restaurant, with wide open views to the south with a terrace that looks out over the outdoor pool. Teaching areas on the first floor enable school parties to be accommodated, extending the educational aspect to the visit. © Fernando Guerra | FG+SG General Section © Fernando Guerra | FG+SG Environmental and sustainable development aspects: Part of the construction of the complex was the physical design of the building and the energy systems to provide an implementation fulfilling all the criteria for a rational useof energy, working towards sustainable development. The recommended materials fall within this approach. The components of the “exterior skin” of the buildings have also been upgraded, to improve both thermal performance and investment costs. In the same way, the link to the Services Industriels de la Ville de Lausanne (City of Lausanne Industrial Services) remote heating network, which uses the incineration of household waste, enables the use of renewable energy, with low greenhouse gas emissions. The production of cold needed for air-conditioning the whole complex is achieved by high-performance equipment, functioning with environmentally-neutral fluids and optimising heat recovery.

Opinions expressed by Green Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
Over the last few years, CBD has become more mainstream as a supplement for relief. Studies show a variety of potential benefits including anxiety reduction, joint and muscle pain relief, lower inflammation, and more. Every day new CBD retailers are popping up coming up with creative products to help take advantage of this lucrative market.
One burgeoning but often overlooked market for CBD is for our furry little friends. People love their pets like they love their own children. They don’t want to see them in pain, and they are willing to go outside traditional medicine to help their four-legged family members. CBD retailers are well aware of this and are creatively marketing CBD oils, CBD topicals and more for pets.  If you’re looking to enter the CBD industry pet products are a very hot and potentially lucrative niche.
Because CBD for pets is a relatively new product and because the DEA has not given veterinarians the authority to possess, administer, dispense, or prescribe CBD, pet owners understandably have many questions. Here are some answers.  
Related: The Coming International CBD Boom and How it Will Disrupt the Marijuana Business
How Does CBD Interact With Pets?
CBD is a compound from the cannabis plant that interacts with your body via the endocannabinoid system. There are two main receptors, the C1 and C2. These two receptors not only communicate with the body natural through endocannabinoids, but they also interact with plant-based cannabinoids like CBD. Unlike its counterpart THC, CBD is non-psychoactive and will not get you high.
CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system the same way for all mammals. According to Dr. Gary Richter, a holistic vet based out of Oakland. “CBD effects the endocannabinoid system, which is a system of neurotransmitters in the body that helps balance and maintain normal body function. CBD has much the same effect in animals as it does in people.”
This means your dog and cat can enjoy similar relief from CBD without worrying about getting high and without any major side effects just like you.
How Can CBD Help Pets?
Common signs of anxiety in pets CBD compounds work with the Endocannabinoid system to induce calming effects in both pets and humans. One of the most common ways brands market CBD is to lower anxiety in dogs, especially during the 4th of July.
The Epilepsy Foundation has reported CBD has been proven to help reduce seizures. Not only can CBD help reduce the number of seizures, but can help reduce the episodes as well.
Arthritis and joint relief has been a major selling point for brands. This Holistapet review shows how pet CBD suppliers are creating and marketing dog treats intended to help with joint and mobility pain.
It Fights Cancerous Cells
Some report that CBD helps reduce or slow tumorous growth cells in pets.  This report on PubMed supports Cannabidiol as a potential anticancer drug.
CBD not only helps boost appetite in humans, but works similarly with pets. Yes, they too can get “the munchies” without feeling high.

So What's the Problem?
This all sounds great -- and it is. Because CBD is typically derived from hemp oil and doesn’t contain THC, pet CBD products are widely available in stores across the U.S.  Retailers are allowed to legally sell it both online and in stores. Bizarrely, the one place you won't find CBD is at veterinary clinics. The Federal Government does not allow veterinarians to prescribe or sell CBD. This is true even in states like California, where Prop 215 was very specific about medical cannabis being for humans, not animals.
This means that the most influential potential proponents for pet CBD have been virtually silenced for fear of losing their licenses. 
""By far and away the biggest challenges are the legal issue and the lack of understanding on the veterinary community’s part of what they have at their fingertips,"" Dr. Richter told HelloMD in an interview.  ""I’m working with the California Veterinary Association in hopes that legislation will introduce a bill that will amend and allow cannabis for animals.""
Here's hoping he's successful.

Scott Davis,"One month into the NBA season, TV ratings are down, and LeBron James is partly to blame, according to Austin Karp of Sports Business Daily. TNT's viewership is down 26%, and ESPN's is down 6%, with TNT averaging 1.79 million viewers per telecast, its slowest start in a decade, according to Karp. James' move to the Los Angeles Lakers has been a big reason why. With James now playing on the West Coast, the early time slots have been hit hard. Meanwhile, the later slots, usually featuring Western Conference teams, have done well. Via Karp: ""For TNT's early windows this season to date, the net is averaging 1.61 million viewers compared to 2.75 million viewers at the same point last season (zero James games this year vs. two in '17). But the late windows, which feature more prominent Western Conference teams, are seeing a less-pronounced drop, with two Lakers games to date. Meanwhile, ESPN is down 6% overall after 18 telecasts, averaging 1.69 million viewers compared to 1.79 million. But the net is up compared to the same time frame two years ago (1.61 million viewers for 14 games). James and the Lakers also have the top ESPN game this season, with 2.7 million viewers for the Nov. 8 matchup against the Celtics."" What also hasn't helped the networks is that the Eastern Conference's best teams don't register as high on the Richter scale. The Toronto Raptors own the NBA's best record at 17-4 (as of Monday), but Toronto's market isn't included in Nielsen's ratings. The Milwaukee Bucks and Indiana Pacers are in second and third place in the East but are two of the smaller markets. The Philadelphia 76ers can help boost the ratings, but the Boston Celtics have gotten off to a sluggish start, and the New York Knicks are only 7-14 and aren't featured as prominently on national TV. Of course, the fall is not the NBA's main season, particularly with NFL ratings up this year.

Chris Ciaccia,"A large swath of earthquakes hit the Pacific's ""Ring of Fire"" earlier this week, prompting some to wonder if it is a precursor to the oft-discussed massive earthquake, colloquially known as ""the Big One."" Sixty-nine earthquakes, including 16 tremors registering 4.5 or above on the Richter scale, recently hit the area known as the ""Ring of Fire,"" according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which recorded the events, but did not issue a warning. Several of the quakes registered significant impacts, including one that hit 5.0 and shook the area on Tuesday morning. Fiji appeared to be the most impacted, as five tremors above a 4.5 magnitude hit the small island. 'BIG ONE' COMING? EARTHQUAKES OFF THE WEST COAST COULD TRIGGER A GLOBAL EVENT Luckily, the earthquakes did not reach the western coast of the U.S., which partially sits on the Cascadia subduction zone, a fault that stretches from mid-Vancouver Island to Northern California. The recent tremors have sparked concern that ""the Big One"" could be near, according to the Daily Mail, but the USGS has made no mention of this. Of the 69 earthquakes, 53 hit the area on Sunday, followed by the 16 subsequent tremors, impacting Indonesia, Bolivia, Japan and the aforementioned Fiji. ""The Big One"" ""The Big One"" is often described as an earthquake with a magnitude 8 or above, causing massive destruction to California, which some have said is overdue for a an earthquake of this magnitude. California sits on the San Andreas fault, a 750-mile fault that has been responsible for some of the state's most devastating earthquakes. The last earthquake that came close to a 8.0 magnitude in California was the great earthquake of 1906, which hit a magnitude of 7.9 and shook San Francisco to the ground, destroying 80 percent of the city and resulted in 3,000 deaths. A massive earthquake registering 8.2 was registered on Sunday, hitting 174 miles north-northeast of Ndoi Island, Fiji, according to the the USGS. Luckily, the massive quake did not cause any significant damage, hitting at a depth of 347.7 miles, too deep to cause a tsunami. “We are monitoring the situation and some places felt it, but it was a very deep earthquake,” Director Apete Soro told Reuters in an interview. CALIFORNIA MEGA-EARTHQUAKE FEAR: IS THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT AT RISK OF THE 'BIG ONE?' The Ring of Fire The Ring of Fire is a 25,000 mile horseshoe shaped ring, accounting for approximately 90 percent of the world's earthquakes, according to the USGS. The region also contains 452 volcanoes, more than 75 percent of the world's active and dormant volcanoes. Though the USGS did not issue a warning, the recent spat of earthquakes in the Ring of Fire could eventually cause some problems for the western part of the U.S. and other close regions. Speaking with Vox in February, University of California Santa Cruz professor Emily Brodsky said ""earthquakes and volcanoes can interact,"" before adding it's unclear how much the string of earthquakes we've seen in recent months are connected. Brodsky also said that having quakes and volcanic eruptions at the same time in an active area is not unusual. SCIENTISTS FIND DOZENS OF HIDDEN EARTHQUAKES BURIED UNDER ANTARCTICA'S ICE In late July, a string of recent earthquakes off the West Coast of the U.S., ranging from 2.8 to 5.6 on the Richter scale, also raised questions of whether the ""Big One"" could be near.

Or other ideas how to get a similar look? Thank you all! ~ Melanie *** Hi Melanie Glad you’re thinking of updating your EXPEDIT. That old bookshelf is a keeper. The EXPEDIT has a laminated veneer finish which doesn’t allow stains to, well, stain. Stain works by seeping into the fibre and grains of wood and leaving a layer of pigment. Stain will simply not be able to penetrate this top layer well. You can, however, paint it. Here’s a guide on painting veneer finishes. And a similar Hackers Help question asked some years ago. Read the comments for readers’ tips. Also I found this good write-up if you need more detailed guidance. Finally, a little inspiration to get you going on your project.

Cory Doctorow,"There are more houses for sale in San Mateo County, Santa Clara County and San Francisco County than at any time since 2013; inventory in December was up 113% year-on-year, and asking prices have fallen by 12% since their peak.
It's the most expensive real estate in America, and widely considered recession-proof due to the startups, universities, and other draws that bring buyers to the market. 
But increases in inventory are driving prices down: the number of properties with price cuts in December rose 455% year-on-year. 
As Wolf Richter notes, the market may come back if the 2019 IPO season -- Uber, Palantir, Lyft, Airbnb -- is successful and creates a bunch of fresh-minted millionaires, but with a market crash on the horizon, this is a big if.
With inventories for sale rising, as sales are slowing, a whiff of competition is settling in among sellers, who have to determine where the market is today, not where it was last year, and if they want to sell their property, they have to price it where the buyers are. But buyers arent where they were a year ago, and the bidding wars have receded into history, and mortgage rates have jumped from a year ago. The right property, priced right will sell. But if its priced off the market, it will likely sit. This is starting to sink in. And sellers are cutting their asking prices.
In December, the number of properties on the market with price cuts in Silicon Valley and San Francisco combined skyrocketed by 455% from a year earlier to 444. This chart shows the year-over-year percentage change for each month, with the red bars denoting when bubble trouble began:

"USA TODAY, Marilyn Icsman, USA TODAY","Students protest for gun reform outside the White House. (Photo: Marilyn Icsman, USA TODAY) Hundreds of students from the Washington, D.C., area walked out of school mid-day Wednesday. But they weren't ditching class to enjoy the sunny, nearly 80-degree weather. Instead, they headed to the White House to call for gun reform. Students across the country participated in a school walk-out to demand tougher gun control in response to last week's school shooting in Florida. The protest at the White House was a part of that movement and included high-schoolers and even some middle-schoolers from the D.C. area. The walkout came on the same day President Trump met with students, parents and teachers. During the listening session, Trump promised tougher background checks and mental health screenings for gun buyers as he discussed ways to prevent mass shootings. Chanting ""No guns, no NRA, no violence in the USA"" pic.twitter.com/hDF0SHAnTQ — marilyn (@marilynicsman) February 21, 2018 Outside, the protest lasted four hours, with some students arriving as early as 10:30 a.m. and some arriving mid-afternoon. Almost all the students there had participated in the school walk-out earlier in the day. Students laid down on the ground to symbolize those who have died in school shootings. They pointed at the White House, chanting ""shame on you"" and ""Donald Trump, Mike Pence, gun control is common sense."" Many of the teens echoed a similar fear: that their school could be the next one to be targeted in a school shooting. ""It could be you next, it could be your friends, it could be your neighbor's kids,"" said Camille Richter, an 18-year-old student at McLean High School in McLean, Va. ""I don't want to keep going to school every day being scared of what's going to happen to me."" Students protest for gun reform outside the White House. (Photo: Marilyn Icsman/USA Today) Miranda Baltaxe, a student from H-B Woodlawn in Arlington, Va., said she cried when she read the texts sent by students during the Florida shooting. ""Thinking about how it could be you is really scary,"" Baltaxe said. ""You're reading these texts that kids are sending to their parents and it's like, well what would I send?"" Terry McQuilkin, a 16 year old who attends Richard Montgomery High School in Rockville, Md., said the government needs to regulate guns more to stop mass shootings. ""I came out here to join the protest to show support to all the families who are affected by the situation,"" McQuilkin said. ""Just to see if we could get our voices across to the president to see if there could be gun laws changed to see the situation get better."" High school students form a circle in front of the White House during an anti-gun protest. (Photo: Marilyn Icsman/ USA Today) Many students also said that automatic and semi-automatic weapons should not be available to buy in the United States. ""I'm not going to pretend that I know everything about government, I'm not going to pretend to be a lobbyist or anything,"" Richter said. ""But we should not have AR-15s, we should not have military grade weaponry circulating in the U.S."" Paloma Mallan, 16, said she was angry that it was students who had to take actions instead of adults. ""The teenagers and the young adults that are here right now skipping school... We are the future,"" Mallan said. And Kirsten Knisely, a student from H-B Woodlawn, said this protest was not the end of the gun fight for her and her peers. ""This is not going to stop,"" Knisely said.

"River Donaghey, Lauren Messman","Still of Birdman via Adult Swim/YouTube; photo of Colbert by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images Way back in the early 2000s, before Adult Swim became the bastion of absurdist comedy it is today, there was Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law. The Space Ghost: Coast to Coast spinoff was one of the first Adult Swim masterpieces, taking Space Ghost 's whole Hanna-Barbera-in-the-real-world conceit to even more brilliant levels. The Flinstones / Sopranos mash-up episode is still one of the best things Adult Swim has ever done, hands down. The show ended in 2007, but now, over a decade later, it looks like Harvey, Peanut, and the rest of the legal team at Sebben &amp; Sebben are coming back to TV. On Monday, Adult Swim announced that it will revive Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law for a brand-new, one-off special called Harvey Birdman: Attorney General. That's right—Harvey has somehow made it all the way to the top of the Department of Justice, thanks to his former boss, apparent new leader of the free world, and ""megalomaniac billionaire"" Phil Ken Sebben. ""In his new role, it’s up to Harvey Birdman to find a way to remove President Phil Ken Sebben from office,"" Adult Swim wrote in a press release, ""before everyone starts to worry it’s more than the ridiculous plot to an animated show."" The upcoming half-hour special will be written by the show's creators, Erik Richter and Michael Ouweleen, and is set to bring back the full Harvey Birdman cast—including Gary Cole as Harvey and Stephen Colbert as Phil Ken Sebben, reprising his role from the original series. ""This is a great day for our country and for no one else,"" Richter said in the release. ""It's funny because it’s true,"" Ouweleen added."" Wait, not funny because it’s true."" The triumphant return of Harvey Birdman is set to hit Adult Swim this fall. As of now, the special is just a one-time thing, but if it manages to capture the brilliance of the original series, who knows—maybe we'll see a full-on revival in the near future.

David Ehrlich,"In 2006, a 33-year-old German director named Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck took Hollywood by storm with his Oscar-winning debut, a manipulative and wantonly middle-brow spy drama about a heartless Stasi captain’s long road to redemption. Told with a watchmaker’s precision and finished off with a tear-jerking gut punch of a finale (complete with a freeze frame for good measure), “The Lives of Others” offered a seductive peek at a shadowy part of history, and seemed to herald the arrival of a filmmaker who might be able to class up some Hollywood fare, or even sell American viewers on the idea of reading subtitles. Then von Donnersmarck made “The Tourist,” and that was the end of that. Now, eight years since his disastrous — but Golden Globe-nominated! — dalliance with the studio system, von Donnersmarck is ready to walk his own long road to redemption (even if his most grievous crime was failing to save a Johnny Depp movie from itself). And what a long road it is: 189 minutes, to be exact, every one of them burnished with the same genteel watchability that made “The Lives of Others” such a crossover success. An epic piece of fiction inspired by the life and work of Gerhard Richter, “ Never Look Away ” is a return to form in the most literal sense of the phrase, as it finds its director retreating to the same mode for which he became famous; it even finds him doubling back to the same time period, the same handsome star, and the same vague insistence that art should allow people to transfigure their personal trauma into self-ennobling peace of mind. The film is as confident and sweeping as von Donnersmarck’s breakthrough, and even more determined to explore how the psychic fallout of the Holocaust shaped the reconstruction of Germany on both sides of the Berlin Wall — it would make a fine double feature with Luca Guadagnino’s “Suspiria” for anyone willing to sacrifice an entire Sunday. Read More: Oscars: 40 Foreign-Language Performances That Competed at the Academy Awards But where “The Lives of Others” was held together by a moral velocity that allowed viewers to overlook the convenience of its storytelling, “Never Look Away” is more sure of what it wants to say than of how it wants to say it. Even at its most sumptuous and entertaining, von Donnersmarck’s latest struggles to fill in any of the profound truisms that it so neatly traces from the pages of history. Spanning from Dresden in 1937 to Dusseldorf in 1966, the story begins when a wild-eyed young Aryan woman named Elizabeth (Saskia Rosendahl) takes her tiny nephew to see a Nazi exhibition on “Degenerate Art.” Otto Dix, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse — all the usual suspects are there, strung up on the walls of a museum as examples of obscene work that Goebbels saw as “an insult to German feeling.” For little Kurt Barnert (Cai Cohrs), barely old enough to wipe himself but already showing raw creative talent, the scene is dismaying: “Maybe I don’t want to be a painter after all,” he says to Aunt Elizabeth, squeezing her hand in his. It will take a World War, a couple of monumental coincidences, and some kooky art school friends in order for Kurt to find his way back to the wonder that was snuffed out from him that day. His journey starts where Elizabeth’s ends, as Kurt’s creative streak is galvanized by his aunt’s emerging schizophrenia (memorably expressed in a scene where Rosendahl strips naked to play the piano, the first of several instances in which von Donnersmarck uses the female body as a window into the male brain). “Everything that’s beautiful is true,” she tells him, imbuing those words with enough grace and gravitas to fool you into a false sense of depth. “Never look away.” When the Nazis learn of Elizabeth’s condition, they mark her down for sterilization; for all of her beauty, and her avowed potential to bear strong German soldiers, she’s still regarded as a stain on the master race. “Never Look Away” Enter the bad guy, a man whose cold and clinical disposition only underlines the extent to which he’s a cartoon monster. His name is Professor Carl Seeband (Sebastian Koch, the square-jawed hero from “The Lives of Others”), and he insists that you never leave off the “professor” part. An evil gynecologist whom the Nazis have conscripted into their eugenics program, Carl has a Marvel supervillain’s ability to sniff out physical “weakness, and no empathy to moderate that gift. It’s he who condemns Elizabeth to death, even when she begs him to think of her as his own daughter. And, some 15 years later, it’s he who scowls at the scrawny young artist making eyes at his actual daughter. Kurt, now a wispy twentysomething played by popular German actor Tom Schilling (“A Coffee in Berlin,” “Woman in Gold”), falls in love with Ellie (“Transit” star Paula Beer, inspiring dreams of what Christian Petzold might do with this material) the moment he sees her in a classroom of their restrictive East German art school. She’s intrigued by his sensitive nature, and how his poetic soul is almost an act of defiance against the ruthless productivity of the other painters at the GDR academy. It would almost have to be that, as Kurt has little else to offer as a character; he’s haunted and withdrawn, passive whenever he’s not looking for something he can’t seem to find. “Me me me,” he often repeats as a facetious mantra, and yet there’s almost nothing to him. Schilling is powerless to break him out of that shell, and — even after more than three hours — the film’s protagonist is still an empty vessel of sorts, waiting to be filled by the symbolism of a narrative that’s more story-driven than von Donnersmarck might care to admit. For all of the script’s talk about truth, beauty, and the value of representational expression, “Never Look Away” is always more of a soapy melodrama than anything else (a stylistic choice which, in its own way, might generously be construed as a comment on truth, beauty, and the value of representational expression). There isn’t a single moment of this movie that makes it possible to forget that you’re watching a movie. Caleb Deschanel’s saturated lighting is soaked with myth and romance, so that even the most painful moments feel like they’re embalmed in a hard coat of amber. Read More: Asian World Film Festival Showcases 14 Foreign-Language Oscar Contenders The script, likewise, skips from one suspenseful development to the next, tripping over all manner of hamfisted moments along the way. Kurt refers to Ellie as a “golden pheasant,” and sweeps the young woman off of her feet with lines like “You’re so beautiful it’s almost unromantic… it’s so easy to love you.” Swap Schilling out for lookalike James McAvoy, replace the German for English and the GDR with mid-century America and this sophisticated arthouse fare might as well be a very special episode of “This Is Us.” Not that von Donnersmarck has much choice when trying to turn a profit on the kind of miniseries-length melodrama that people too seldom make anymore; “Never Look Away” needs to be entertaining to sustain itself, and the film is ultimately held together by the force of its narrative inertia. All of the developments in the plot — and all of the artistic digressions that pop up between them — are in the service of a single eventuality: At some point, Kurt is going to realize that his wife’s father is the Nazi eugenicist who sentenced his beloved aunt Elizabeth to death, and the discovery is going to reshape his existence. Von Donnersmarck engineers enough anticipation for that moment to hold our interest as the story shifts from East to West Germany, where Kurt enrolls in a Dusseldorf art school and falls under the spell of an enigmatic professor with a tragic backstory of his own (Oliver Masucci as Antonius van Verten). The movie depends on the perpendicular desires of seeing Kurt learn the truth about his past and unlock the artistic potential of his future, and leans on those things to the point where Ellie is all but erased from the narrative — by the time all is said and done, her uterus has more of a character arc than she does. It’s a flaw that would be easier to “forgive” if the payoff were worth it; if the film’s climactic barrage of epiphanies and breakthroughs were as satisfying as those at the end of “The Lives of Others,” but they’re not. It’s here, of all places, where “Never Look Away” shifts towards a more representational mode. In emphasizing how art allows us to make sense of the past, and consecrate even the most banal of sins, Von Donnersmarck loses his grip on the emotional payoff of the present. This is a beautiful movie, and occasionally one that rings true. But, in contradiction to aunt Elizabeth’s claim, it’s seldom both of those things at the same time.

Dan Neilan,"Zach Galifianakis has a history of disrupting the talk-show format. Whether it’s on his own short-lived late-night VH1 show or his scripted web series Between Two Ferns, he seems to take pleasure in subverting audience expectations and constantly one-upping himself. But, it’s going to be difficult for Galifianakis— or anyone for that matter —to top the entrance he made on Conan last night. After attempting to introduce Galifianakis a couple times, both Conan and sidekick Andy Richter were noticeably confused and concerned. Then, without warning (and with the help of some quick video editing) the comedian burst out of Richter’s stomach like some sort of Alien /adult-sized baby hybrid. “I’m fine. There’s a lot of Toblerones in there,” Galifianakis replied when Conan asked if he was alright, to which the distressed Richter retorted, “Why the hell are you asking him if he’s alright?” Realizing this was no way to conduct an interview, Conan suggested they take a quick break. When they returned, Andy Richter was whole again and Galifianakis had his own chair. The abrupt return to normalcy only heightened the absurdity of the opening bit.

ABC News,"An explosion rocked Hawaii's Kilauea volcano early Tuesday morning, spewing ash nearly a mile into the air and sparking an earthquake that registered 5.5 magnitude on the Richter scale, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Interested in Volcanoes? Add Volcanoes as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Volcanoes news, video, and analysis from ABC News. The tremor occurred at around 4:30 a.m. local time, the agency reported. It was not clear if any damage was caused, but no tsunami was expected, officials said. Thousands of residents have been evacuated from the area and lava spewing from the volcano's fissures have destroyed more than 100 structures since the first eruption a month ago. The incident didn't trigger tsunami warnings due to the small size of the earthquake. ""It's not big enough,"" Cindi Preller, geologist and duty scientist at the Oahu office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told ABC News. Instead, tsunamis or tidal waves, become more serious threats if the size of the earthquake increases, Preller said. ""Anything above 6.9 [magnitude] is our threshold,"" she said, noting that it would warn people to stay clear of the ocean in such an event. On May 4, a 6.9-magnitude earthquake was centered near the south flank of Kilauea one hour after a 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck nearby, the U.S. Geological Survey confirmed. Eruptions like the one today may not wane anytime soon, Preller cautioned. ""This could go on for months,"" she said. ""The volcano is active and when these eruptive sequences get underway it's doing exactly as it's supposed to do, behaving as it should.""",An ash explosion rocked the Kilauea volcano Tuesday.,2018-06-05T16:58:15Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}","Explosion rocks Hawaii's Kilauea volcano, sending ash 1 mile high",https://abcnews.go.com/US/explosion-rocks-hawaiis-kilauea-volcano-sending-ash-mile/story?id=55661514,https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/hawaii-lava-ocean-zp-ps-180604_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,Richter,0

KENNETH CHANG,"The new quark became known as charm. The J/psi consists of two quarks: a charm quark paired with a charm antiquark, each circling the other like twirling square dancers. Burton Richter was born on March 22, 1931, in Brooklyn, the oldest child of Abraham Richter, a textile worker, and Fanny (Pollack) Richter. After graduating from Far Rockaway High School in Queens, he enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at 17. He obtained his undergraduate degree in physics there in 1952, and a doctorate four years later. Dr. Richter then joined Stanford’s High-Energy Physics Lab as a research associate and became an assistant professor of physics in 1960. In 1963 he also took a position at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, one of the leading particle physics laboratories in the world. (The name was changed to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in 2008.) As laboratory director from 1984 to 1999, Dr. Richter oversaw the construction of the Stanford Linear Collider, a new type of machine that, instead of guiding positrons and electrons along a circular ring, fired them at each other along straight paths. Construction ran into many difficulties and delays, but ultimately the machine lived up to its promise. Dr. Richter later realized that the next generation of accelerators would not be built at SLAC and so began shifting its focus to high-energy X-ray lasers and astrophysics — endeavors that would not require large swaths of pricey California real estate. “I really think Burt was a visionary leader at SLAC,” said Persis Drell, the Stanford provost who served as SLAC director from 2007 to 2012. Dr. Drell said Dr. Richter had been careful not to tell her what he would have done if he were still director, but he was also blunt when asked for advice. “It was kind of refreshing, actually,” Dr. Drell said. “With Burt, it wasn’t subtle.” Dr. Richter turned to energy issues in the latter part of his career, asserting his views with similar bluntness — as he did when he worked on a Department of Energy advisory committee on nuclear energy.","He shared the 1976 physics prize for the discovery of an unexpected particle, a building block of the universe, in a high-speed accelerator he had designed.",2018-07-23T21:17:14Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Burton Richter, a Nobel Winner for Plumbing Matter, Dies at 87",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/obituaries/burton-richter-a-nobel-winner-for-plumbing-matter-dies-at-87.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/24/obituaries/24RICHTER1/21RICHTER1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Richter,0

Today, Adult Swim announced that Harvey Birdman’s returning to television in a half-hour special, Harvey Birdman, General Attorney, which finds the lawyer stepping into his new role in President Phil Ken Sebben’s administration.

In a press released styled after an official announcement from the White House, Harvey Birdman co-creators Erik Richter and Michael Ouweleen didn’t go so far as to draw a direct comparison between Sebben and Donald Trump. But when the subtext is that loud, it’s difficult not to see the parallels.

Associated Press,"(MELBOURNE, Australia) — Australian Cardinal George Pell, the most senior Vatican official to be charged in the Catholic Church sex abuse crisis, must stand trial on charges that he sexually abused multiple victims decades ago, a magistrate ruled Tuesday. Magistrate Belinda Wallington dismissed some of the charges that had been heard in the four-week preliminary hearing in Melbourne but decided the prosecution’s case against was strong enough to warrant a trial by jury. When she asked Pell how he pleaded, the cardinal stood and said in a firm voice: “Not guilty.” Lawyers for Australia’s highest-ranking Catholic had argued the accusations were untrue and should be dismissed. Pell, Pope Francis’ former finance minister, was charged last June with sexually abusing multiple people in his Australian home state of Victoria. The details of the allegations against the 76-year-old have yet to be released to the public, though police have described the charges as “historical” sexual assault offenses — meaning the crimes allegedly occurred decades ago. His alleged victims testified in the first two weeks of the preliminary hearing via a video link from a remote location to a room closed to the media and public. His lawyer Robert Richter told Wallington in his final submissions two weeks ago that the complainants might have testified against one of the church’s most powerful men to punish him for failing to act against abuse by clerics. But prosecutor Mark Gibson told the magistrate there was no evidence to back Richter’s theory that Pell had been targeted over the church’s failings. Since Pell returned to Australia from the Vatican in July, he has lived in Sydney and flown to Melbourne for his court hearings. His circumstances are far removed from the years he spent as the high-profile and polarizing archbishop of Melbourne and later Sydney before his promotion to Rome in 2014. The case places both the cardinal and the pope in potentially perilous territory. For Pell, the charges are a threat to his freedom, his reputation and his career. For Francis, they are a threat to his credibility, given he famously promised a “zero tolerance” policy for sex abuse in the church. Advocates for abuse victims have long railed against Francis’ decision to appoint Pell to the high-ranking position in the first place. At the time of his promotion, Pell was already facing allegations that he had mishandled cases of clergy abuse during his time leading the church in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia’s largest cities. So far, Francis has withheld judgment of Pell, saying he wants to wait for justice to run its course. And he did not force the cardinal to resign, though Pell took an immediate leave of absence so he could return to Australia to fight the charges. Pell said he intends to continue his work as a prefect of the church’s economy ministry once the case is resolved. In recent years, Pell’s actions as archbishop came under particular scrutiny by a government-authorized investigation into how the Catholic Church and other institutions have responded to the sexual abuse of children. Australia’s Royal Commission Into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse — the nation’s highest form of inquiry — revealed last year that 7 percent of Catholic priests were accused of sexually abusing children in Australia over the past several decades. In testimony to the commission in 2016, Pell conceded that he had made mistakes by often believing priests over people who said they had been abused. And he vowed to help end a rash of suicides that has plagued abuse victims in his hometown of Ballarat. Pell testified to the inquiry in a video link from the Vatican about his time as a priest and bishop in Australia. He did not attend in person because of a heart condition and other medical problems. Police said at the preliminary hearing that they had planned to arrest Pell for questioning had he returned to Australia in early 2016 to testify. His lawyers argued in court that Pell was targeted for “special treatment” by detectives from a police task force that investigated historical sex abuse. Police witnesses denied that accusation. The investigation of Pell began in 2013 before any complainant had come forward to police, whom Richter accused of running “a get Pell operation.” Pell’s lawyers told the court in February that the first complainant approached police in 2015, 40 years after the alleged crimes, in response to media reports about the royal commission. Pell was charged by summons in Rome and agreed to return to Australia to face the allegations.","Pell, the most senior Vatican official to be charged in the Catholic Church sex abuse crisis, pleaded not guilty",2018-05-01T01:59:32Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Cardinal George Pell, Former Vatican Treasurer, Will Stand Trial on Sex Abuse Charges in Australia",http://time.com/5260746/cardinal-george-pell-trial-australia-charge/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gettyimages-939487574.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Richter,0

""Really, what I wanted to do is provide a landscape or a musical place where people could fall asleep."" Richter has performed Sleep live a few times now, and brought the experience to Bass Hall in Austin, Texas.

Chris Ciaccia,"A giant swarm of 153 earthquakes recently hit near the Yellowstone supervolcano, according to the latest data. The data, taken from the University of Utah Seismograph Station, shows a series of earthquakes happening all around Yellowstone, but none higher than a 2.5 magnitude on the Richter scale.

In October 2017, researchers Hannah Shamloo and Christy Till analyzed minerals in fossilized ash from the most recent eruption. What they discovered surprised them — the changes in temperature and composition only took a few decades, much faster than the centuries previously thought. At the time, several media outlets suggested that the findings could mean that the supervolcano was going to erupt faster than Shamloo and Till expected, but that is not the case. ""There's no reason to think it could impact mass transport the way the Iceland eruption did nor would it have any effect on crops,"" Till told Fox News at the time. ""There is no evidence to suggest it could destroy mankind.""

Victor Reklaitis,"President Trump has dug a hole for himself with his latest take on immigration policy, as both Republicans and Democrats denounce his “ shithole countries ” remark. The tweeter-in-chief is trying to switch the conversation to why he scrapped his London trip, but it’s tricky to climb out of a big pit quickly. Announcing further sanctions relief for Iran could help. Markets also find themselves in a tough spot, says our call of the day from the Wolf Street financial blog’s Wolf Richter. Richter is focused on a warning shot fired late yesterday by the New York Federal Reserve’s William Dudley. The salvo from Dudley comes as the inflation-obsessed Fed keeps an eye out for today’s fresh reading on consumer prices. Dudley said the U.S. central bank may have to “press harder on the brakes” at some point over the next few years, increasing the risk of a hard landing for the economy. “It was a shot before the bow — one of many — for the markets to start paying attention to the Fed,” Richter writes. “Monetary policies have no impact unless markets believe in them, react to them and thus effectively implement them. But this might be a lot to ask, after the Fed has spent years methodically and thoroughly destroying its own credibility by flip-flopping wildly at every market squiggle,” he adds. The big risk, Richter reckons, is that markets will go overboard when they finally react. “If I read Dudley’s words correctly, he is worried that markets will fall in line too late, and only after the Fed has fired some big guns to get their attention, and then it might happen all at once, and the sudden adjustment in prices, yields, spreads, risk premiums, etc. might be too brutal for the economy to digest,” the Wolf Street writer says.

Image © Darmon Richter Richter has spent the last 10 years exploring Eastern Europe with his camera, creating the ongoing project to document and preserve these vestiges of past revolutions and regimes. ""Today, many of these monuments are in terrible condition, marked with graffiti and falling apart,"" explains Richter. ""In Croatia there are Yugoslav monuments dedicated to the victims of Croatian war criminals; while in Serbia, in the 1990s, Slobodan Milošević tarnished the Yugoslav brand by endorsing ethnic cleansing under the banner of the Yugoslav People’s Army. In neither country do the surviving Yugoslav monuments always offer a particularly comfortable narrative."" In many Eastern European countries, these relics of socialist-era monumentalism represent half a century of work by artists, sculptors, and architects. As Richter continues to catalog and document the architecture and monuments, many have begun to already disappear. ""Piece by piece they disintegrate, getting smaller from one visit to the next.

Taps Coogan,"Submitted by Taps Coogan on the 12th of April 2018 to The Sounding Line. Wolf Richter, creator of the website Wolfstreet.com, recently gave a wide ranging interview with Peak Prosperity’s Chris Martenson and issued the following warning for pension funds: Chris Martenson: “Central banks like to think there is such a thing as a free lunch. If they can just print up all this money and get some… asset price inflation all is going to be good, but of course the opposite side, the cost for this lunch was pension funds were just getting obliterated without having any yield that they could get on safe, so-called safe, assets on the bond side… 60% of their assets (US Pensions) are invested in equities. So an equity correct here would be just absolutely devastating…” Wolf Richter: “… These pension funds, clearly this was perfect timing. You know plowing into… stocks… after they had already been rising for years. So yeah like you said, they’re heavily involved in stocks and there facing a correction on those, a big one. They’re also still involved with bonds and they are now having a dual problem. So the stock prices, you know they’re at risk and they’re likely to decline and that’s going to hurt pension funds but the bond market it also at risk and the bond prices are declining and, while the yields are going up, the yields that the bonds in the portfolios generate are very low. So the pension funds that have these bonds, and they carry them to maturity, these bonds are generating the yields that were in the market a year or two or five ago and these are very low yields… They have 10-year treasuries in them that,,, yield their portfolio 2% or less than that. They may have Euro-bonds in it that yields a negative rate. And so when yields go up these days, those yields don’t change. Their locked in their portfolios and unless they sell those bonds at a loss and replace them with high yielding instruments, those yields are locked in… So now they’re having the losses on the stocks. They’re having extremely low yields for the next many years on their bond portfolio and they’ve taken on more risk by going into alternative investments such as private equity and so forth. So they have loaded up on risk to deal with the situation. And that’s clearly what the central banks wanted, what the Fed wanted. They wanted every investor to go way out on the risk branch and pension funds have done that and now the price, as your said, is right here in front of us…” There is a great deal more to the interview, so enjoy it below: P.S.

Cory Doctorow,"Toronto is one of the many great world cities that has been rendered nearly unlivable by real-estate speculation, both from onshore investors and offshore ones. Following a raft of measures to cool off the property market, sales have plunged, down 35% overall in Feb 2017 relative to Feb 2016; prices are down an average of CAD110,000, and listings are up (which will drive the prices down further). Bullish real estate investors point out that the market is still up relative to prices two years ago. However, bubble pricing is intrinsically unstable: people who bought property in Toronto on the belief that the market would always go up and there would always be tons of liquidity that would allow them to cash out on a few days' notice are now motivated to sell (especially if they were highly leveraged). When they list their properties, it drives the market down, panicking more investors, who list their properties -- lather, rinse, repeat, implode. The anti-bubble measures included a 15% stamp duty on non-resident foreign speculators; higher interest rates set by the national bank; and tighter lending rules. Canadian borrowers are largely in adjustable rate mortgages, making them liable to shocks if the Bank of Canada raises interest rates. It split up this way: * City of Toronto: -6.1% to C$806,494. * Rest of the GTA without Toronto: -16.1% to C$743,196. The movements of average prices showed a large disparity by home type, between condos, whose prices still rose despite a 30% plunge in sales volume, and the rest of the market: * Detached houses -17.2% to C$1,000,736 * Semi-detached houses -8.6% to C$756,894 * Townhouses -2.9% to C$638,691 * Condos +10.1% to C$529,782 Home Prices Sink, Sales Plunge in Toronto [Wolf Richter/Wolf Street] ( via Naked Capitalism ) Stevin Tuchiwsky survived cancer as a child, which he says motivated him to become a renowned nature photographer.

Cory Doctorow,"Softbank's bid to buy Uber shares based on a valuation 30% lower than the company rated in its last round has been largely successful, with about 15-20% of shares changing hands at that price. This deal will not raise money for Uber itself but will allow employees and early investors to cash out some of their holdings – at a steep discount. But to maintain the illusion of the previous “valuation” of $69 billion – which is critical for a properly hyped future IPO – SoftBank will also make a $1-billion direct investment into Uber at the $69-billion “valuation,” as part of the deal. Since startup “valuations” are based on the price paid during fund-raising, this $1-billion deal forms Uber’s new “valuation,” the same as the prior one. So the “valuation” illusion remains intact.

Peter Brown,"There are many reasons why Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is regarded as a classic. The allure of secret passages and new equipment draws you into a haunted castle filled with odd creatures and dangerous traps. All of it beautifully designed, not to mention backed by an eclectic soundtrack to suit the castle's many moods. You delve into this adventure as the silver-haired Alucard, the sympathetic son of a notorious supernatural villain, with graceful moves and a cool demeanor befitting of a vampiric heartthrob. Each of these pieces neatly click together, forming what many consider to be one of the best video games ever made. Symphony of the Night is the rare game that seems to get everything right, because even when it stumbles in gloriously cheesy ways, our accumulated goodwill turns would-be mockery into celebration. Konami, apparently, doesn't see things the same way. Its upcoming release of Symphony of the Night on PS4 (as part of the Castlevania Requiem collection) is based on the retooled PSP release that was buried within Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles. This version, while still excellent in most respects, tries to improve upon the original PlayStation release (which is also mostly intact on Xbox 360), but in the process eliminates one of the most memorable moments of the entire game. I'm referring, of course, to the meme-ified exchange between Richter Belmont and Dracula during the prologue. Richter: Die, monster! You don't belong in this world! Dracula: It was not by my hand that I'm once again given flesh. I was called here by humans who wish to pay me tribute. Richter: ""Tribute""?! You steal men's souls, and make them your slaves! Dracula: Perhaps the same could be said of all religions. Richter: Your words are as empty as your soul! Mankind ill needs a savior such as you! Dracula: What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets! But enough talk! Have at you! It's campy, over the top, and incredibly memorable. Who among us hasn't been tempted to rhetorically question the essence of humanity, fling a glass of wine across the room, and declare the answer we all know in our hearts to be true? Dracula may have sounded ridiculous, but let's be honest: he's not wrong. The PSP version, and the upcoming PS4 port, use new voice actors and a new script, with Richter and Dracula's iconic lines rewritten to the following. Richter: Dracula. Die now, and leave this world! You'll never belong here! Dracula: Oh but this world invited me. Your own kind called me forth with praise and tribute. Richter: Tribute? You're a thief. You steal men's souls, their freedom... Dracula: Freedom is always sacrificed to faith, good hunter. Or are you truly here by choice? Richter: All I'm here for is you. To hell with your heresy! You're nothing but a blight on mankind. Dracula: Ha! Mankind. A cesspit of hatred and lies. Fight for them, then, and die for their sins! In the age of Twitter, where the original discussion has been glorified and given a life of its own, the decision to base the re-release on the altered version of Symphony of the Night feels like an odd one. Granted, this is a small piece of a much bigger puzzle; the game is far from ruined. Its reputation, however, is definitely challenged. When polled, 1,780 respondents on Twitter weighed in on the matter: 33% don't care about the fact that the PSP version is being used, 26% feel that their excitement for the re-release is slightly diminished, and 41% of voters consider it to be a deal breaker. For as much as I dislike the decision to use the PSP version of Symphony of the Night, I'm not going to pass up the chance to have a fresh copy on a modern console--assuming its emulation is technically sound. I may not, however, be able to shake the little voice in my head reminding me that it's not the definitive version of the game. Where do you fall on the matter?

Dracula: Freedom is always sacrificed to faith, good hunter. Or are you truly here by choice? Richter: All I'm here for is you. To hell with your heresy! You're nothing but a blight on mankind. Dracula: Ha! Mankind. A cesspit of hatred and lies. Fight for them, then, and die for their sins! In the age of Twitter, where the original discussion has been glorified and given a life of its own, the decision to base the re-release on the altered version of Symphony of the Night feels like an odd one. Granted, this is a small piece of a much bigger puzzle; the game is far from ruined. Its reputation, however, is definitely challenged.

dfd-tud,"Document Colour Tracking Dots or simply yellow dots are small systematic dots in yellow color which encode information about the printer and/or the printout itself. This process is integrated in almost every commercial colour laser printer. This means that almost every printout contains coded information about the source device, such as the serial number.

Victor Reklaitis,"Americans are falling out of love with their cars — at least when it comes to the daily commute. Wolf Richter, of the Wolf Street financial blog, cites this growing challenge for the auto market, in our call of the day. “Driving, while still by far the top way of getting to work in America, has lost some ground,” Richter writes. “For auto makers, this is not a propitious trend.” Richter has created the chart below that’s based on recent Gallup polling. It shows a jump in the percentage of American workers who don’t use a car in their commute. That figure climbed to 16% this year, up from 9% in 2007. Watch that thin red line. Instead of driving themselves or carpooling, these folks are taking public transportation, telecommuting, biking, walking or doing “something else” (maybe going by boat or scooter?). “This shift is real,” Richter says. “While the annual increments are small, spread over time they will further impact the dynamics of the auto industry.” Don’t miss: U.S. auto sales maintain momentum for now Some 77% of U.S. workers drive themselves, down from 85% in 2007, he adds. “At this rate, the percentage might drop to something like 69% over the next decade.” Shares in Detroit’s Big Three have struggled of late. General Motors GM, -1.25%, Ford F, -0.11% and Fiat Chrysler FCAU, +0.94% FCA, -0.99% have suffered year-to-date losses that range from about 3% to 24%, while the S&amp;P 500 is up around 8%.

Joe Skrebels,"No longer a miserable little pile of secrets. By Joe Skrebels Nintendo has announced Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's 66th and 67th characters, Simon Belmont from the Castlevania series and Donkey Kong's King K. Rool. During a Nintendo Direct today, showed Simon attempting to save a beleaguered Luigi, who may or may not have been murdered. Fellow Belmont, Richter, will be an Echo Fighter for Simon. Simon's will use his Holy Whip, which offers a longer reach than any other fighter. His special attacks include his axe, cross, holy water, and the good ol' uppercut, while his Final Smash is a Grand Cross. The character also comes with a Castlevania stage, Dracula's Castle. The stage will feature bosses from the Castlevania stage, including Dracula himself. The stage is backed by 34 tracks from the series as its soundtrack. Castlevania's Alucard will also join as an Assist Trophy. He'll be able to take a mist form, but is still susceptible to attacks and KOs. King K. Rool was also announced in a new trailer. He received no detailed breakdown but can appear to use his gold-plated belly for attacks and counters, and his Final Smash sees him fire an enormous death ray from his island palace. Chrom from Fire Emblem and Metroid's Dark Samus were also announced as Echo Fighters. Echo Fighters will be available to pick as separate characters on the character select screen, or ""stacked"" onto the core fighter's entry to save space. Creator Masahiro Sakurai announced that there would be more character design reveals to come, with none staying secret upon release. Joe Skrebels is IGN's UK News Editor, and Alucard is his favourite anagram in games.

STANLEY REED,"The government has placed tight restrictions on the activity. For instance, Cuadrilla is required to put seismic monitors around the site to detect tremors. The threshold for shutting down operations is 0.5 on the Richter scale, a level that seismologists say is well below what could threaten life or property. Richard Luckett, a seismologist for the British Geological Survey, an agency that is monitoring the Cuadrilla site, said in a telephone interview that such tremors were predictable as a result of fracturing. The agency reported that the shudder on Tuesday had registered 0.4 He said tremors of that size could not be felt by people near the site and posed no threat of property damage, adding that 0.4 does not worry me as a seismologist. But the agency subsquently reported that a tremor on Wednesday had registered 0.5, athough Cuadrilla said that was a result of the reading being rounded up from 0.48. In an emailed statement, Britains Oil and Gas Authority described the tremors as low-level seismic activity that can only be detected with specialist equipment, and said that it was monitoring carefully Cuadrillas activities to ensure they remain in line with approved plans. Despite the tight scrutiny and obstacles like a lack of domestic hydraulic-fracturing expertise, Cuadrilla and other companies say they are confident they can make a successful business out of shale-gas drilling in Britain if the countrys rock formations prove suitable. They argue that more drilling and fracking is needed to discover what resources Britain has and whether they can be used commercially.","Cuadrilla Resources’ Preston New Road fracking operation in Lancashire, Britain.

Text description provided by the architects. The new museum houses an internationally significant boat collection on the shores of Windermere in the Lake District National Park. It includes exhibition spaces for the display of steam launches, motorboats, yachts and other vessels telling the stories of their construction and use on the lake. The site repurposes a historic gravel-extraction plant, continuing the working life of the place with an active conservation programme of the boats. Emphasis is placed on the visitor experience amongst buildings in a park landscape that creates a connection between people, boats and water, as well as providing a reinterpretation of the sites picturesque and industrial heritage.
© Christian Richter
Rather than a singular huge building, a granular ensemble of smaller buildings that are square on plan creates a more fitting scale with its context. The museum therefore has a strong topographical relationship with the land and the water. The wet dock forms the centre-piece of the museum and brings the lake into the heart of the experience to present the collection at water level. Other buildings making up the visitor route including: main entrance, conservation galleries, interpretation, education and cafe, all cluster around the wet dock but are elevated on a podium away from the risk of floodwaters. A conservation workshop is a standalone building placed closer to the water level on the working boatyard.

The architectural language of the museum is characterised by the vernacular typology of the roof, taking reference from the pronounced overhanging eaves of Broadleys, Voyseys grand house on Windermere, as well as more archetypal agricultural and industrial buildings of the Lake District. The building forms are somehow familiar, but made special by the overhanging canopies which extend the inside spaces of the building with all-weather shelter into the landscape. Internally, each individual building is organised with a large principal room centrally orientated to face the lakeshore, with ancillary spaces and the external canopy spaces balancing each side of the symmetrical sectional composition.
© Christian Richter
The museum is seen and approached from all sides, from land and water and from a number of points of elevation. Roofs and walls therefore assume equally important status in the formal composition. Oxidised copper is used as the determining material to give architectural consistency to these elements and to the museum buildings working together as a cohesive whole. Copper is folded and pinned with a regular pattern of brass fixings gives the elevations a unique texture, which is further reinforced by the patina gained by weathering over time. Very large windows and doors enable boats to be easily moved between outside and inside and allows the museum route between buildings to be clearly legible.

Clear tectonic expression of the natural copper cladding gives levity to the forms in strong contrast to the monolithic concrete podium that they sit upon. The repeated horizontal grammar of the claddings string courses which wrap the buildings exterior further references the lateral datum of the beautiful lake context.

Kate Sierzputowski,"﻿ German seamstress Agnes Richter (1844–1918) was a patient at the Heidelberg Psychiatric Clinic during the 1890s. While held at the asylum she would densely embroider her standard issue straightjacket, stitching the object with words, phrases, and diaristic entries in deutsche schrift, an old German script. The layers of language make it difficult to distinguish a beginning or end to the writing, and only fragmented phrases have been deciphered from the jacket such as “I am not big,” “I wish to read,” and “I plunge headlong into disaster.” The object is a part of the Prinzhorn Collection at the University of Heidelberg Psychiatric Clinic, named after collector and psychiatrist Hans Prinzhorn. The collection contains over 5,000 paintings, wooden sculptures, sketches, and other art-based ephemera from patients at the hospital, collected by the psychiatrist during the early 20th-century. This vast collection of work made by psychiatric patients has had a major influence on a modern understanding of “ outsider art,” or the artwork created by self-taught artists who have had little to no contact with the mainstream art world. Over a century later, the jacket remains a powerful item, a lasting object that showcases how one woman transformed a sterile and impersonal garment into a rich record of her life’s journey.

Jason Kottke,"Based on the available archaeological evidence, researchers had assumed that bread and agriculture developed around the same time. But a recent find in Jordan of a 14,500-year-old flatbread indicates that bread was first made some 4000 years before agriculture was invented. No matter how you slice it, the discovery detailed on Monday shows that hunter-gatherers in the Eastern Mediterranean achieved the cultural milestone of bread-making far earlier than previously known, more than 4,000 years before plant cultivation took root. The flatbread, likely unleavened and somewhat resembling pita bread, was fashioned from wild cereals such as barley, einkorn or oats, as well as tubers from an aquatic papyrus relative, that had been ground into flour. And now researchers are wondering, did the invention of bread drive the invention agriculture? “We now have to assess whether there was a relationship between bread production and the origins of agriculture,” Arranz-Otaegui said. “It is possible that bread may have provided an incentive for people to take up plant cultivation and farming, if it became a desirable or much-sought-after food.” University of Copenhagen archeologist and study co-author Tobias Richter pointed to the nutritional implications of adding bread to the diet. “Bread provides us with an important source of carbohydrates and nutrients, including B vitamins, iron and magnesium, as well as fibre,” Richter said.

Gargi Verma,"Dhundalwadi Ashramshala students sleep inside a tent as Ullas Satvi keeps a vigil. Archive
ULLAS SATVI, headmaster of Dhundalwadi Ashramshala is dealing with distraught parents since morning. The Class X exams started today. The Class XII exams have been going on. The children are used to the tremors now, but the parents worry. So, many of them have landed up wanting to take their children home. Convincing them has been an uphill task, he said.
Since the earthquake measuring 4.1 on the Richter Scale hit on February 1, when a four-year-old girl died in Haladpada village, the quake Friday measuring 4.3 on the Richter Scale was the highest recorded in the area. While no structures have collapsed, various buildings have developed cracks.
The exams had started and within 15 minutes, the tremors struck. The children were scared a bit. Usually, we dont feel so much of the tremors, but this time it was real. It lasted hardly for a couple of seconds, but it was scary, an invigilator at Talasari civil school said.
The earthquake was felt over a region of around 40 km from where it originated at the Gujarat-Maharashtra border. The epicentre of the earthquakes are moving further away from Dhundalwadi, but the tremors are increasing too. It is scary, but we cant do anything until the exams get over, Satvi said. Three more earthquakes were recorded on Friday, but none of them were felt seriously overground.
Over 10,000 villagers of more than 40 villages in Dahanu have been sleeping outside their houses since November 2018. I was hoping that the February earthquake would be highest, but this was more scary. I felt the ground giving way under my feet and had to hold on to a tree, said Surya Ghoda, a resident of Karanjvira village near Dhundalwadi. His wife, Anita said, My first thoughts were about my children, two of whom were in school. The youngest, my daughter, was out playing. I ran to fetch her and asked my husband to bring back the other children.
Ghoda, however, refused to fetch children from the school. This keeps on happening. Cant keep getting them out of school after every tremor. I just want this to stop forever, he said.
Several villagers requested for tents from the collectors office, the local civic representatives said. Some people were living in their houses as they were cement structures and would just step out to sleep. But deep cracks have come up in all of the single-storey houses. So, most of the residents of Haladpada and Bajarpada are now setting up house inside the tents and dont want to go home, said Ananta Mahal, an anganwadi worker in Haladpada.
The 4.3 quake have left many geologists confused, as the shallow earthquake travelled far. Generally, shallow earthquakes dont affect a larger region. But we are studying the seismic activity and will have to understand the situation better, said a geologist at the station set up by the Palghar disaster management team near Dhundalwadi.

"Associated Press, Associated Press","Cardinal George Pell is pictured leaving court after his hearing at the Melbourne Magistrates Court in Melbourne. (Photo: Con Chronis, AFP/Getty Images) MELBOURNE, Australia — Australian Cardinal George Pell, the most senior Vatican official to be charged in the Catholic Church sex abuse crisis, must stand trial on charges alleging he sexually abused multiple victims decades ago, a magistrate ruled Tuesday. Magistrate Belinda Wallington dismissed around half the charges that had been heard in the four-week preliminary hearing in Melbourne but decided the prosecution’s case was strong enough for the remainder to warrant a trial by jury. The number of charges has not been made public When she asked Pell how he pleaded, the cardinal said in a firm voice: “Not guilty.” Wallington gave him permission not to stand, which is customary. When the magistrate left the room at the end the hearing, many people in the packed public gallery broke into applause. Lawyers for Australia’s highest-ranking Catholic had argued all the accusations were untrue, could not be proved and should be dismissed. Pell, Pope Francis’ former finance minister, was charged last June with sexually abusing multiple people in his Australian home state of Victoria. The details of the allegations against the 76-year-old have yet to be released to the public, though police have described the charges as “historical” sexual assault offenses – meaning the crimes allegedly occurred decades ago. More: Top Vatican official Cardinal George Pell denies sex offense accusations Related: Senior Vatican official Cardinal Pell faces Australian court on sex charges His alleged victims testified in the first two weeks of the preliminary hearing via a video link from a remote location to a room closed to the media and public. His lawyer Robert Richter told Wallington in his final submissions two weeks ago that the complainants might have testified against one of the church’s most powerful men to punish him for failing to act against abuse by clerics. But prosecutor Mark Gibson told the magistrate there was no evidence to back Richter’s theory that Pell had been targeted over the church’s failings. Since Pell returned to Australia from the Vatican in July, he has lived in Sydney and flown to Melbourne for his court hearings. His circumstances are far removed from the years he spent as the high-profile and polarizing archbishop of Melbourne and later Sydney before his promotion to Rome in 2014. The case places both the cardinal and the pope in potentially perilous territory. For Pell, the charges are a threat to his freedom, his reputation and his career. For Francis, they are a threat to his credibility, given he famously promised a “zero tolerance” policy for sex abuse in the church. Advocates for abuse victims have long railed against Francis’ decision to appoint Pell to the high-ranking position in the first place. At the time of his promotion, Pell was already facing allegations that he had mishandled cases of clergy abuse during his time leading the church in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia’s largest cities. So far, Francis has withheld judgment of Pell, saying he wants to wait for justice to run its course. And he did not force the cardinal to resign, though Pell took an immediate leave of absence so he could return to Australia to fight the charges. Pell said he intends to continue his work as a prefect of the church’s economy ministry once the case is resolved. In recent years, Pell’s actions as archbishop came under particular scrutiny by a government-authorized investigation into how the Catholic Church and other institutions have responded to the sexual abuse of children. Australia’s Royal Commission Into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse – the nation’s highest form of inquiry – revealed last year that 7 percent of Catholic priests were accused of sexually abusing children in Australia over the past several decades. In testimony to the commission in 2016, Pell conceded that he had made mistakes by often believing priests over people who said they had been abused. And he vowed to help end a rash of suicides that has plagued abuse victims in his hometown of Ballarat. Pell testified to the inquiry in a video link from the Vatican about his time as a priest and bishop in Australia. He did not attend in person because of a heart condition and other medical problems. Police said at the preliminary hearing that they had planned to arrest Pell for questioning had he returned to Australia in early 2016 to testify. His lawyers argued in court that Pell was targeted for “special treatment” by detectives from a police task force that investigated historical sex abuse. Police witnesses denied that accusation. The investigation of Pell began in 2013 before any complainant had come forward to police, whom Richter accused of running “a get Pell operation.” Pell’s lawyers told the court in February that the first complainant approached police in 2015, 40 years after the alleged crimes, in response to media reports about the royal commission. Pell was charged by summons in Rome and agreed to return to Australia to face the allegations.

Lane Sainty,"Former Australian prime minister John Howard has provided a judge with a highly complimentary character reference for cardinal George Pell, the most senior Catholic to be convicted of child sex abuse.
The reference, which describes the cardinal as a ""lively conversationalist"" and person of ""exemplary character"", was tendered at Pell's sentencing hearing on Wednesday.
Pell was found guilty by a jury in Dec. 2018 of one count of sexual penetration and four counts of indecent acts on two 13-year-old choirboys, carried out at St Patrick's Cathedral in 1996 and 1997.
Howard was prime minister of Australia from 1996 to 2007, leading a conservative Liberal National coalition government.
Howard wrote to Judge Peter Kidd that he had known Pell for 30 years and was aware of the conviction as well as the fact Pell is appealing and that he maintains his innocence.
""None of these matters alter my opinion of the Cardinal,"" Howard wrote.
Howard went on to describe Pell as ""a person of both high intelligence and exemplary character"".
""Strength and sincerity have always been features of his personality. I have always found him to be lacking hypocrisy and cant. In his chosen vocation he has frequently displayed much courage and held to his values and beliefs, irrespective of the prevailing wisdom of the time.
""Cardinal Pell is a lively conversationalist who maintains a deep and objective interest in contemporary social and political issues.""
Howard is not the only political figure to come out in support of Pell since his conviction was revealed on Tuesday following the lifting of a suppression order.
Another former Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, told 2GB radio he had called Pell after the news broke.
Abbott described the verdict as ""shocking"" and ""devastating"" and noted it was subject to an appeal.
Asked for whom it was shocking and devastating, Abbott replied: ""Certainly for the friends of Cardinal Pell, and as you say I am one, devastating for all who believe in the Catholic church, and I'm also one of those.""
Abbott declined to answer several times if he would continue to support Pell if his appeal is unsuccessful.
Howard's was among ten character references submitted to the court on Pell's behalf. Pell's barrister Robert Richter told Kidd there could have been ""hundreds, had the net been cast wider"".
Professor Greg Craven, the vice chancellor of the Australian Catholic University, wrote that Pell's public face does not match his private persona.
""Publicly, he is business-like and can appear gruff and intensely determined ... privately, he is a deeply sensitive person: thoughtful; considerate; and notably charitable in respect of the failings of both friends and enemies, though not himself.""
Katrina Potter, a Catholic church representative who accompanied Pell on each day of both trials, said she struggled to square the man she knew with the figure who has ""drawn so much ill feeling"".
""Cardinal Pell once told me he doesn't wear his heart on his sleeve,"" she wrote. ""Perhaps his stoicism has contributed to a perception held by some.""
Along with the character statements, Kidd will take into account victim impact statements from one of Pell's victims who testified at trial, and the father of the other victim, who died in 2014. These statements were not released publicly.
On Wednesday, prosecutor Mark Gibson called for Pell to be put in jail immediately for his ""serious"" crimes, saying there were several aggravating factors including the boys' youth and vulnerability and the fact Pell had abused his power to commit the offences.
Pell's barrister Robert Richter said there were no aggravating factors and described Pell forcing oral sex on of the boys as ""no more than a plain vanilla sexual penetration case where the child is not volunteering or not actively participating"".
Pell will be sentenced on March 13.","""Cardinal Pell is a lively conversationalist who maintains a deep and objective interest in contemporary social and political issues,"" John Howard wrote of George Pell, the most senior Catholic to be found guilty of child sex abuse.

Christopher Intagliata,"On March 27th, 1964, a huge earthquake struck the Prince William Sound, off the coast of Alaska. &lt;&lt;CLIP: ""Out in the gulf of Alaska, the ocean bottom plunges, then heaves upward a full 50 feet, and a wave starts racing toward the shore…""&gt;&gt; The quake is the second most powerful ever recorded, at 9.2 on the Richter scale, and it killed more than a hundred people. And just like the devastating Sumatra quake of 2004… or the Chilean quake in 2010… the Great Alaska Earthquake struck right around the time of the full moon. Coincidence? In 2016, Japanese researchers concluded that large earthquakes might indeed be more likely to occur during times of significant tidal stress… when it's either a new or full moon. And the news rumbled through the media, despite the study's small sample size, of just a dozen large quakes. Now seismologist Susan Hough of the U.S. Geological Survey has done a much larger analysis. She plotted more than 200 big quakes--magnitude 8.0 or above--over the past four centuries, looking to see if they were more likely to strike on certain days of the year, or during key phases of the moon. The answer, neatly summed up in the study's one-word abstract? ""No."" The study is in the journal Seismological Research Letters. [Susan E. Hough, Do Large (Magnitude ≥8) Global Earthquakes Occur on Preferred Days of the Calendar Year or Lunar Cycle? ] That's not to say we don't know of certain factors that actually do increase the risk of quakes. Hough says the ground injection of wastewater, oil and gas production, fracking, and damming up waterways can in some cases cause quakes.

Michael McWhertor,"Castlevania Requiem, a collection that brings Castlevania classics Symphony of the Night and Rondo of Blood to PlayStation 4, is available today, but one of those games might not be the same game you remember from the original PlayStation era. The version of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night included in Requiem is based on the 2007 re-release for PlayStation Portable. That means the game features an updated script and new voice overs; the cheesy translations of the PlayStation original are gone. In other words, you wont hear Draculas infamous What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets. and other so-bad-theyre-good lines when Richter Belmont confronts him in the games opening scenes. If thats a deal-breaker for you, well, stick to the version from 1997 (or the Xbox 360 port of that game). Konami Castlevania: Symphony of the Night lets you choose Japanese voice overs and lets you play as Maria, just like the version included in Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles for PSP, but there are few other options. For both Symphony of the Night and Rondo of Blood, you can choose to run the game at its normal size or at full screen. The games 4:3 aspect ratio remains in tact, and the game scales well (full screen shaves a couple pixels off the bottom of the image), with six wallpaper background options at your disposal. Both games can be played with display effects, including scanlines and interlacing. The latter creates a horrible flickering effect, and its unclear why anyone would elect to view the game this way. Sprite smoothing, which rarely offers any visual improvement, is also available. Konami doesnt offer any sound options outside of Japanese-language voices. Some sound effects, like item pickups and select voices, are delivered through the DualShock 4s built-in speaker, and there doesnt appear to be any way to turn this off. Other than that, the package includes Symphony of the Night and Rondo of Blood mostly as you remember them, accessible from some clunky, confusing menus. The Requiem collection offers little else: no bonus art galleries, no music libraries, no developer interviews or insights. Anyone familiar with Konamis track record for game collections likely wont be surprised by the barebones treatment, but when other publishers, namely Capcom, are releasing Mega Man and Street Fighter collections with a treasure trove of source material, its a massive missed opportunity. Fortunately, Symphony of the Night and Rondo of Blood still hold up, and thats the only reason to recommend this collection.","Konami’s Castlevania Requiem re-release for PlayStation 4 includes the PSP version of Symphony of the Night, not the original PlayStation version, and Rondo of Blood with a few extra features.",2018-10-26T19:00:02Z,"{'id': 'polygon', 'name': 'Polygon'}",Castlevania: Symphony of the Night for PS4 may not be the game you remember,https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/26/18027418/castlevania-requiem-symphony-of-the-night-ps4-psp,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-ribemBn9dDEgxMVKhoJRXMyuHo=/0x0:1920x1005/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13340245/sotn.jpg,polygon,Polygon,Richter,0

UBS,"Earths natural resources largely determine the global economys ebb and flow. As such, the effects of climate change continue to cause concern among economists and environmentalists alike. In 2018, professors William Nordhaus and Paul Romer won the Nobel Prize in Economics for their work exploring how climate change affects economic stability. Ultimately, the pairs research found the phenomena to be closely linked. The case for investment in sustainable ventures is clear: Without such commitments, both the planet and the global economic ecosystem will suffer. Sustainable investments may jump start the slow process of changing consumer habits. Below, we examine the economy-boosting benefits of environmentally friendly business models and how sustainable investment plays an important role. Rolling the DICE As part of Nordhaus research, he developed an economic model called Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model DICE. The acronym, he notes, acknowledges that ignoring climate change is a gamble with severe economic and environmental costs. The DICE model examines expenses related to crop failures, flooding, and other natural disasters. It considers the threat and frequency of environmental damage, as well as the economic harm associated with carbon emissions. The long story short: Climate change has potential to wreak havoc upon the global economy. Nordhaus research helped shape the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (PICC)s recent report. The findings have attracted attention from policymakers and economists worldwide. Preventing severe consequences of climate change is a matter of enacting strict environmental regulations and quickly. The UNs report says that such regulation on an international scale has no documented historic precedent. As one part of a solution at scale, Nordhaus and Romer have proposed that governments enact a global carbon tax. Earlier in 2018, at the UBS Nobel Perspectives Live! event in Shanghai, economist and 2007 Nobel Laureate Eric S. Maskin supported this notion. Climate change is not a problem that is going to take care of itself, says Maskin. Some progress has been made toward reducing [carbon] emissions. But not nearly enough... A carbon tax forces people and companies to pay directly for the damage theyre creating. Government action is, however, historically a process that moves at a snails pace time the planet doesnt have to waste. This is why private and institutional investment in environmental ventures is part of a realistic long-term plan to combat climate change. We must learn to do more with less Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, echoes Maskins sentiment that urgent action is no longer optional. We have been borrowing resources from future generations in order to raise our living standards today, Donovan says. Environmental constraints on economic growth are becoming increasingly visible whether that is the destructive power of natural disasters or simply a lack of resource. We must learn to do more with less, Donovan continues. That requires innovation and productivity. It also requires a climate where the existing way of doing things is challenged. Sustainable models: Saving the environment, boosting the economy Thankfully, a number of organizations are working to build sustainable business models both from an environmental and economic perspective. These smaller-scale initiatives can have major impact from the ground up. Ambri is a revolutionary battery technology founded by Dr. Donald Sadoway, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a UBS Global Visionary. Dr. Sadoway created the liquid metal battery based on his research with electrochemical processes. Ambris products are intended to reduce societys reliance upon the traditional power grid. Ambri hopes to bring a renewable energy source to the masses. The idea is to have a battery that is robust and long-lived, and ultimately very cheap, says Dr. Sadoway in a video for UBS. And so, I conceived of this device ultimately, we want to have something about the size of a ten-meter shipping container that would have a capacity to service 100 American homes. Image: VELAFRICA, UBS Velafrica, created by UBS Global Visionary Paolo Richter, is another company that blends economic growth with environmental progress. The organization collects and refurbishes bicycles and delivers them to rural areas of Africa. The bikes provide an efficient, affordable, and sustainable method of transportation that can help lift people out of poverty. Velafricas bicycles provide people in underserved areas with transportation and access to resources like food, water, and education. Today, the company has distributed more than 180,000 bikes in places like Ghana, Gambia, Madagascar, Tanzania, Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast. A recent study found that more than 80% of institutional investors are interested in customizable sustainable investments. Continued investment in organizations like Ambri and Velafrica may help ensure both environmental and economic benefits for future generations to come. Luckily, investors have expressed increasing commitment to sustainable ventures. A recent study found that more than 80% of institutional investors are interested in customizable sustainable investments. Donovan has seen this very trend firsthand at UBS. UBS clients tend to have a long-term view and often consider future generations, notes Donovan. It is natural that they will have a particular interest in managing the issues of the environmental credit crunch. The value of investments can go down as well as up. Your capital and income is at risk. ESG/Sustainable Investing Considerations: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and in some instances integrate the analysis of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process and portfolio. Strategies across geographies and styles approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio managers ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio consisting primarily of ESG or sustainable investments may be lower or higher than a portfolio where such factors are not considered by the portfolio manager. Because sustainability criteria can exclude some investments, investors may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as investors that do not use such criteria. Companies may not necessarily meet high performance standards on all aspects of ESG or sustainable investing issues; there is also no guarantee that any company will meet expectations in connection with corporate responsibility, sustainability, and/or impact performance.

Christopher R. Weingarten,"Angelenos can do some unique California dreaming this summer, as acclaimed minimalist Max Richter will bring his massive eight-hour ""lullaby"" Sleep to Grand Park for two overnight concerts. Attendees can reserve one of 560 cots to experience this massive work under the stars on July 27th and July 28th. Though Richter and various ensembles have staged Sleep with beds in London, Berlin, Paris, Sydney, Austin and New York, these two nights – with American Contemporary Music Ensemble and soprano Grace Davidson – will be its largest stagings and first outdoor performances. ""Even the biggest buildings can only accommodate a few hundred beds,"" Richter tells Rolling Stone. ""So, this is us trying to sort of connect it into... like a normal concert-size audience. ""One of the things that the piece is about really is the communal listening experience. Going on that journey together,"" he says. ""When we go to sleep ordinarily, we're doing something really private. It's kind of an intimate, private connection with our sort of physical humanity. People going to a place and … sleeping with a bunch of strangers they've never met, there's a sort of act of trust there. So, in a way, it's kind of natural to try and want to expand that out into sort of bigger numbers of people."" Though the piece – released as a 8-CD set by Deutsche Grammophon in 2015 – is tranquil, drone-heavy and made for the possibility of sleeping through it, Richter says he attempted to make the epic piece ""a little bit in the protest music tradition."" ""We're living in our neoliberal, sort of late-stage capitalist culture where human beings are really like objects of production and consumption,"" says Richter. ""We're on our screens all the time, we're kind of being sold at all the time. And the piece, in a way, it is a kind of invitation to stop that for a while. Just kind of go, 'Hang on a minute. Let's just press the pause button.' And try and connect a little bit more to, that humanity and how it sort of is bigger than all of that stuff."" In turn, he says that the piece has been hitting listeners on an emotional level. ""I guess, when we stop, when we get off our screens, the big questions kind of bubble up, don't they? We keep ourselves distracted all day from that big stuff, but, you know, it's around us. … [ Sleep ] seems to elicit that stuff. You know, the kind of big questions: life, death, love, why,"" he says. ""The stuff none of us can answer, but we all wrestle with."" To perform the piece through an entire evening, Richter says he and his ensemble give themselves a form of jet lag, staying up the night before. He performs his normal ""morning"" routine before the show – his cup of tea, oatmeal, stretching, listening to his usual radio show. ""It feels impossible at the beginning of the night. I've got 250 pages of piano music to play through when I sit down,"" says Richter. ""The piece is really physically demanding. … It is tough to be playing for that long. Especially for the strings; they're playing a lot of long, sustained tones. Which is the hardest thing for strings to do. You're sitting there and you get very stiff. It's like extreme sports basically."" In composing the piece, Richter connected with neuroscientist David Eagleman to find if there is scientific basis behind the music that helps us sleep. Max Richter's 'Sleep' performance in New York, on May 5th, 2018. Mike Terry ""From [Eagleman's] standpoint sleep is an informational process. It's another brain state where the brain is doing stuff. It's active, but just differently active,"" says the composer. ""We talked a little bit about some research where they've used kind of repetitive, low frequency sounds to support the slow-wave state of sleep, which is where you get memories of being transferred from sort of temporary into permanent stuff and information structuring and learning and stuff. It's basically what gives rise to that phrase 'I'll sleep on it.' … It's a real thing. ""I guess the other sort of purely physiological thing I did in the piece, which is more poetic really, but I think is really important, is that... I deleted all the high frequencies,"" he adds. ""And that was because I wanted to mimic the spectrum that the baby hears inside the womb. Because that kind of points all of us to that kind of origin. That kind of first hearing. So, it kind of mimics that womblike feel. So, the piece then does, it doesn't, it just inhabits that space. And then for about the last hour, you get a kind of sunrise in the piece where the frequency spectrum just kind of slowly opens up. So it's like morning is written into the spectrum of the piece.""

Gil Green,"Last month contemporary classical composer Max Richter re-released his acclaimed sophomore album The Blue Notebooks in celebration of its 15th anniversary, and a new Super Deluxe expanded edition is out at the end of this month via Deutsche Grammophon. In its inception, the album was a protest of the Iraq War that saw Richter, like many, using music as an externalized meditation on violence. The Blue Notebooks was and still is a delicate space for reflection. Today, Richter is debuting the George Belfield-directed video for one of the album’s most well-known and compelling songs “On The Nature Of Daylight.” Its slow-moving, cinematic nature has no doubt contributed to the track’s extensive use in films such as Shutter Island, Stranger Than Fiction, and most prominently 2016’s Arrival. The video stars The Handmaid’s Tale and Mad Men actress Elisabeth Moss, who shared a statement explaining that she regularly listens to Richter’s music before shoots to get herself in the zone: When I was asked to do this project it was a dream come true. My work has been inspired by his music for so many years and not a day goes by on set where I don’t have Max’s music playing in my ears before a take. His music and my acting have gone hand in hand for a long time. So for me the opportunity to act to one of his most prolific pieces was such an incredible honor. Working with George and this entire team was so artistically fulfilling and an experience I will never forget. “On The Nature Of Daylight” feels reminiscent of Radiohead’s “ Daydreaming ” video. As Moss walks down street after street, her expression remains reserved, bleak, until she’s overwhelmed by tears and then anger and then a powerful determination to keep reaching slowly forward. The instrumental is more hopeful than the visuals let on, and with its palindromic structure, “On The Nature Of Daylight” proves that it can carve a space both in the past and present. Watch and listen below. The extended version of The Blue Notebooks is out 6/29 via Deutsche Grammophon.

Cory Doctorow,"As part of its ongoing commitment to evaluate information security and privacy when reviewing IoT devices ( previously ), Consumer Reports has published a scathing review of D-Link's home security camera. D-Link's DCS-2630L was one of half a dozen cameras evaluated in a process that included consideration of privacy policies, network monitoring, vulnerability analysis -- 50 indicators in total. Five of the cameras used encrypted transport to send their video to cloud servers; the D-Link stored the video locally and allowed you to stream it, but did not always encrypt these streams, and allowed access to the streams without a unique password. None of the cameras tested had decent privacy policies that spelled out all the ways your footage would be used; this is particularly disturbing, given that they are meant to run in your home. Testers at CR havent learned of any security breaches as a result of the D-Link problem. But most consumers may never realize theyre vulnerable, says Robert Richter, who leads security and privacy testing in CRs labs. Its like a half-open door to hackers that should be closed, he says. In response to a Consumer Reports query, D-Link said that security would be tightened through updates this fall. Consumer Reports will evaluate those updates once they are available.

Lane Sainty,"Kidd, 53, is chief judge of the Victorian County Court. He began his remarks by saying the Pell case was unlike any other.
""At the time you returned to Australia to face these charges you were one of the most senior figures within the Catholic Church, globally,"" he told Pell. He said there had been ""extraordinary and widespread publicity and public comment"" surrounding Pell and referenced the recent exposure of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church.
Pell was convicted on one count of sexual penetration of a child, and four counts of indecent acts with, or in the presence of, a child.
His sentence was for this, and this only, said Kidd: ""You are not to be made a scapegoat for any failings or perceived failings of the Catholic church. Nor are you being sentenced for any failure to prevent or report child sexual abuse by other clergy within the Catholic church.""
Kidd delivered a message to people watching who had been abused as children in churches or institutions, saying Pell could not be punished for what was done to them.
""I recognise that you seek justice, but it can only be justice if it is done in accordance with the rule of law.""
Pell was convicted of sexually abusing two 13-year-old choirboys. One of them, J, is now aged in his 30s and testified at trial, while the other, R, died in 2014.
Kidd said that the jury convicted Pell based on Js account of what happened. He read out a summary of that evidence now the facts of the case.
In late 1996, following Sunday mass, J and R had snuck away from the choir procession and entered the off-limits priest's sacristy, a room where church officials would prepare for services.
The boys began to drink sacramental wine, when Pell entered.
""You planted yourself in the doorway and said something like youre in trouble to the victims,"" Kidd said.
Pell pulled out his penis, grabbed R's head, and pushed it in front of his genitals, Kidd said. ""R was squirming, struggling and flailing while this was occurring. J saw Rs face R was terrified.""
Pell then turned to J, and put his penis into J's mouth for about two minutes. ""J was, to use his words, freaking out when this happened. You were standing and J was pushed down, crouching or kneeling.""
He then touched J's genitals and began to masturbate himself as he did so. ""Once you stopped, J put his clothes back on, and J and R left the room. They eventually re-joined the choir. 
""During the incident J and R were crying and sobbing. J and R called out but it was at a level of whimpering and whispering. At some point you told J and R to be quiet because they were crying.""
More than a month later, Pell indecently assaulted J by pushing him up against a wall and briefly squeezing his genitals as he walked along a corridor that went past the sacristy.
There were two statements: one each from J and R's father. Sometimes victim impact statements are read aloud in court, but neither J nor R's father wanted that to happen, so Kidd paraphrased them in his sentence.
J had reported a significant impact on his mental wellbeing, which had affected his life and in particular his relationships. R's father felt ""shocked and upset"" and that he had failed his son.
As R died in 2014, there was no statement from him. But Kidd said while it wasn't possible for him to quantify or articulate how the abuse impacted on R, ""I have no doubt that it did in some way"".
Part of sentencing involves a judge reaching an objective assessment of how serious the offending was compared to other instances of the same offence.
Kidd found that the sexual penetration of J, holding R's face to his penis, and touching J's genitals were all examples of serious offending.
He found Pell's moral culpability the degree to which he can be held responsible for what he did was high.
To reach these conclusions, Kidd considered a number of things.
""The first episode in the priests sacristy involved a brazen and forceful sexual attack upon the two victims. The acts were sexually graphic,"" Kidd said.
He said the second attack on J in the corridor was ""very brief and spontaneous and involved contact over clothes"", but went on to say it was ""coloured"" by the sacristy assault, and that Pell had had time to reflect on his previous abuse before deciding to do it again, ""with what I consider to be a degree of physical aggression and venom"".
Pells lawyer, barrister Robert Richter, argued his client was not acting rationally when he committed these crimes. Kidd rejected this for several reasons, including: ""There is no evidence before me from any witness at the trial that you were other than a fully functioning, competent, lucid and intelligent man, during the relevant period of time. To the contrary, there is evidence that on the day of the first episode, you had successfully delivered Sunday Solemn Mass, as archbishop, this being a public role requiring discipline and focus.""
Kidd found that Pell had abused his power as archbishop and breached the relationship of trust he had with the choirboys. He said Pell's crimes were both ""breathtakingly arrogant"", and that the cardinal had been confident that the two boys, on the lowest rung of a strict church hierarchy, would not complain.
Kidd also said the abuse occurred when Pell was still dressed in his robes from having just delivered the sermon at mass, while the children were still in their choirboy robes.
""The full weight of your authority and position of power must have been very obvious to your victims, and to you,"" Kidd said.
At Pell's sentence hearing earlier this month, Richter told Kidd what Pell had done was ""no more than a plain vanilla sexual penetration case where the child is not volunteering or not actively participating"".
The remark quickly drew opprobrium and Richter later issued a comprehensive apology for the ""wholly inappropriate"" phrase.
He had said it as he argued there were no ""aggravating factors"" to Pell's crime, meaning elements that would have made it more serious, like grooming or threats to stay silent.
At the time, Kidd told Richter: ""It must be clear to you that I am struggling with that submission.""
In the end, Kidd said the fact those aggravating factors werent at play did not necessarily make the crime less serious.
After assessing the gravity of Pell's offence, Kidd moved on to look at factors that might reduce the sentence.
Pell pleaded not guilty, which means he doesn't get a discount on his sentence for a guilty plea. He also hasn't shown any remorse for his crimes another factor that can reduce a sentence because he maintains he is innocent.
Kidd told Pell, who is 77, it was possible he may die in prison given his age and poor health.
""The fact is that you are of advanced years and are entering the last phase of your life. Like anyone in their late 70s your health will decline in time,"" Kidd said.
""I am conscious that the term of imprisonment which I am about to impose upon you carries with it a real, as distinct from theoretical, possibility that you may not live to be released from prison. Facing jail at your age, in these circumstances, must be an awful state of affairs for you.""
He also found Pell had been a person of ""good character"" since the offences 22 years ago, basing this on the fact Pell has an otherwise clean criminal record and the character references submitted to the court including one from former prime minister John Howard.
Kidd found Pell had effectively zero risk of re-offending because of his age, good character, lack of offending for 22 years, and also his notoriety and sex offender registration.
Richter argued Pell had been subject to an ""unprecedented level of public scorn and criticism"", partly because of the actual crimes he was found guilty of, and partly over charges that were later dropped.
The enormous media scrums and placard-bearing protesters surrounding Pell as he went in and out of court were cited, with Richter arguing Pell had been ""publicly pilloried"".
""Finally, it was submitted that because of this kind of publicity and stigma, the resumption of your earlier life ... is now impossible,"" Kidd said.
The prosecutors actually agreed with this, saying the above warranted ""a level of mitigation"". Kidd said he took it into account.
Pell's lawyers argued that Kidd should give weight to the fact jail time will be more difficult for Pell than for the average prisoner.
""Like so many things to do with your case, cardinal Pell, I think your situation is somewhat unique,"" Kidd said. He referenced a report from the assistant commissioner of Corrections Victoria which assessed Pell at ""immediate risk of serious threat"" in prison and effectively said he would have to be housed in solitary.
The report said the risk to Pell ""may be reduced in protection, so that in time he may be able to mix with a limited number of heavily vetted prisoners"".
Again, Kidd said he took this into account.
The sentence was broadcast around the world via a single camera in the jury box. It was fixated only on Kidd, and not permitted to swivel to show Pell, or the other 120-plus people in the courtroom.
Pell's lawyers argued the presence of the camera was effectively extra punishment and would make Pell's time in custody more difficult. Kidd disagreed.
Punishment is only one factor judges refer to when sentencing. When he found Pell was unlikely to re-offend, Kidd set aside sentencing principles of protecting the community and specifically deterring Pell from committing future sexual abuse.
But there were remaining elements he needed to consider in arriving at the right sentence: general deterrence, punishment, denunciation.
These three are ""very important"" in cases that involve child sex offences, and a sentence must demonstrate the ""grave consequences"" of violating these laws, he said.
Another part of the sentence is that Pell must register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.
One of the most striking moments in court was when Pell, seated at the back of the courtroom, signed the registry.
Pell was sentenced on the basis of the maximum penalty at the time he committed the crimes, which was 10 years for each offence.
For pushing R's face down to his penis, Pell received two years and six months.
For forcing J to perform oral sex on him, four years.
For touching J's genitals, two years and six months.
For masturbating as he touched J, 15 months.
For grabbing J's genitals in the corridor, 18 months.
Usually, those sentences would be served at the same time (concurrently). But a judge can order the sentences, or parts of them, to be served one after the other (cumulatively).
Kidd ruled that one year of the 2.5 years Pell received for abusing R should be served cumulatively, to show there were two victims.
""Were I not to do this R would become a meaningless statistic,"" he said.
Kidd used the four-year sentence as his base, because it was the longest term of imprisonment and the most serious offence. On top of that, he ordered the following periods to be served cumulatively: one year for abusing R, four months for touching J, two months for masturbating, and six months for the corridor assault.
All in all six years.
Pell will be eligible for parole after three years and eight months. Kidd said this was a shorter period than usual because of Pell's age to increase his chances of not dying in prison.
Just before Pell stood up to hear his fate, Kidd used his global platform to say sentencing was far from an easy task.
It is not a mathematical exercise, he said, telling Pell there were factors in his case that favoured a more lenient sentence, and others that favoured a harsher one.
In your case this complexity is exemplified by the fact that on the one hand I must punish and denounce you for this appalling offending, he said.
""Yet, on the other hand, I am conscious of the heavy reality that I am about to sentence you, a man of advanced years, who has led an otherwise blameless life, to a significant period of imprisonment, which will account for a good portion of the balance of your life.""",Judge Peter Kidd spoke for over an hour as he sentenced cardinal George Pell to six years in prison for child sex abuse.

Cory Doctorow,"On paper, America's bailed-out banks learned their lessons from the crash of 2008 and got rid of their exposure to subprime debt, especially ""deep subprime"" loans to people who are so broke that it's basically impossible that they'll ever pay their loans back. In reality, the banks have extended billions in loans and lines of credit to ""nonbank lenders"" -- bankerese for subprime lenders, payday lenders, and other issuers of credit to risky borrowers. Did I say billions? I meant tens of billions. Er, make that hundreds of billions. Last week, the Wall Street Journal rounded up the financial picture a decade after the 2008 crash and specifically identified credit bubbles (including the now-bursted subprime auto bubble and student debt bubbles ) as a systemic risk. How much banks are exposed in this manner to subprime loans – not just auto loans, but also subprime mortgages, and subprime consumer loans – is somewhat of a mystery. But some clues are percolating to the surface. According to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal of regulatory filings, bank loans to nonbanks lenders have surged sixfold since the Financial Crisis to nearly $345 billion at the end of 2017. Here are the top contenders: 1. Wells Fargo: $81 billion, up from $14 billion in 2010 2. Citigroup: $30 billion 3. Bank of America: $30 billion 4. JP Morgan: $28 billion 5. Goldman Sachs: $22 billion 6. Morgan Stanley: $16 billion. Banks extend these loans at relatively low interest rates because the loans are collateralized and don’t expose the banks directly to the risks of lending to subprime consumers. Nonbank lenders make money off the spread between the relatively low cost of money and the often double-digit rates they charge consumers. The spread is so sweet and enticing that it caused a boom in the sector and attracted private equity firms. How Much Are Banks Exposed to Subprime? More than we Think [Wolf Richter/Wolf Street] ( via Naked Capitalism ) ( Image: Andrew McGill, Cjohnson7, CC-BY; Steve Morgan CC-BY-SA ) The subprime car-lending industry -- charging exorbitant rates for car-loans to people least suited to afford them, enforced through orwellian technologies, obscuring the risk by spinning the debt into high-risk/high-yield bonds -- is collapsing. The House of Commons Library has published research projecting the post-2008 growth of inequality until 2030, arriving at an eye-popping headline figure: at current rates, the richest 1% will own two thirds of the world's riches by 2030. I think that number is too low. Here's why. It's been ten years since the financial crisis, when barely regulated banks destroyed the world's economy, kicked off wars, and directly and indirectly killed millions.

DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN,"Dr. Hofstadter’s research, like that of physicists before and since, was designed to explore the inner workings and architecture of the subatomic world, which had first been revealed by Ernest Rutherford in the early 20th century. Dr. Rutherford had discovered that the nucleus of atoms contained positively charged particles that he called protons. He and physicists who came after him assumed that they were elementary, or fundamental, particles. Dr. Hofstadter wanted to measure their size, to understand the internal structure of nuclei. He did so by aiming electrons at the nucleus of a hydrogen atom and measuring the angles at which they were deflected. The experiment was known as elastic scattering, because the kinetic energy of the electrons was conserved in the interactions. Dr. Hofstadter was awarded the 1961 Nobel Prize in Physics for his research. But to continue the investigation into the fundamental nature of matter and particles, more powerful equipment was needed, so Stanford, with the federal government’s backing, built the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, known as SLAC. When it was finished, in 1966, it had two miles of equipment and was the world’s most powerful electron accelerator. Among other things, Dr. Taylor assembled SLAC’s two-story tall spectrometer, a device that identifies particles and atoms based on their mass, momentum and energy, and tracks their trajectories in the accelerator. The first experiments performed at SLAC were in elastic scattering, but they provided no new insights. Then the accelerator was used to perform what is called deep inelastic scattering, in which electrons bombard protons and neutrons. Here some of the electrons’ energy is transferred to the bigger particles, sometimes shattering them, and the electrons are deflected. The same type of experiment had been done with less powerful accelerators, and nothing terribly interesting had happened. That was because few particles had lost their energy and been deflected. But inelastic experiments performed at SLAC, many of which were led by Dr. Taylor, produced a lot of scattering of particles at very big angles, to a far greater degree than had been predicted. At first, the scientists thought that their results were incorrect, or that they had misinterpreted them, but the data were eventually confirmed. The number of deflections by the electrons, and the wide angles of their deflection, showed that protons were not solid — that they contained internal structures. Persis Drell, a former director of SLAC and now the provost of Stanford, told The Stanford News that the experiments by Dr. Taylor and his colleagues had shown that the proton was like “jam, with seeds” (the quarks), rather than like “a smooth ‘jelly’ ” of electrical charge. Before these experiments, it was generally assumed that protons and neutrons were elementary particles — that is, that they were nondivisible. “I don’t think anyone was seriously questioning the elementary character of the proton at that time,” Dr. Taylor said in his Nobel lecture. Photo Dr. Taylor at a news conference in October 1990 after it was announced that he would share the Nobel Prize in Physics. Credit Chuck Painter/Stanford University (There were some naysayers, however. One, Murray Gell-Mann, an American physicist and future Nobel laureate, postulated in 1964 that such a thing as a quark might indeed exist. Perhaps fittingly, he was the one gave the particle its name, taking it from a line in James Joyce’s “Finnegans Wake”: “Three quarks for Muster Mark!”) Dr. Taylor shared the 1990 Nobel with two physicists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Jerome I. Friedman and Henry W. Kendall, who had also worked on the experiments at SLAC alongside Dr. Taylor. Dr. Taylor believed that many others deserved to share in the prize as well, among them Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky, the director of SLAC from its founding until 1984. He had been the driving force in getting the accelerator built and oversaw it at a time when four different experiments performed there would lead to Nobel Prizes. “There were 20 of us named on that experiment,” Dr. Taylor said in a 2008 interview with the Nobel Institute. “There were, like, 40 of us who built that apparatus, backed up by another 40 engineers and technicians, using an accelerator that is built by a thousand people.” A science prize given to even more recipients, he said, would “acknowledge that it is not the work of an individual person, but a huge group of people.” Richard Edward Taylor was born on Nov. 2, 1929, in Medicine Hat, Alberta, the son of a Canadian father (whose own parents had immigrated from Northern Ireland and Scotland) and an American mother (a daughter of Norwegian immigrants). When he was young, Richard wanted to be a surgeon, but while in high school he lost the forefinger and parts of the middle finger and thumb on his left hand after accidentally blowing up a chemistry lab in his basement at home. He recalled that a surgeon said to him at the time, “ ‘People aren’t going to come to a surgeon without fingers.’ So I had to give that up.” He switched to science. Though he did not get his high school degree — he failed Latin — he was admitted to a four-year honors program in physics at the University of Alberta. But at the end of the third year he became ill, was hospitalized and was dropped from the program. He received a non-honors bachelor of science degree and then a master’s. During his time at the university Dr. Taylor married Rita Bonneau. They had one son, Ted. Both survive him. Information about other survivors was not available. Dr. Taylor applied to the University of California at Berkeley for his Ph.D. but was rejected. Stanford, which had an up-and-coming physics department, accepted him, despite his middling grades. Dr. Taylor worked in the High-Energy Physics Lab at Stanford until 1958, when physicists at the École Normale Supérieure invited him to Paris. The group was building an accelerator in Orsay and sought his expertise. Dr. Taylor stayed there three years, gaining experience that helped him later when building SLAC. After returning, he worked for a year at Berkeley before returning to Stanford, where the construction of SLAC had just begun. He remained at Stanford the rest of his life and lived on its campus. Dr. Taylor continued to work at SLAC throughout the 1970s. One of his notable efforts came in 1978, when he confirmed a revolutionary theory — put forth by Steven Weinberg, Sheldon Less Glashow and Abdus Salam — positing that two of the four known forces in the universe, weak and electromagnetic, are aspects of the same force, called the electroweak force, when particles have very high energy levels. The theory was important because, if confirmed, it would provide an essential building block to a long-sought unified theory to explain all the workings of the universe. Dr. Taylor was able to confirm the theory in an experiment he designed that afforded a higher degree of precision than had previously been possible. It showed that at some point in the history of the universe there were three, not four, forces. Dr. Weinberg, Dr. Glashow and Dr. Salam were awarded the Nobel Prize the following year. Dr. Taylor saw himself, matter-of-factly, as an experimentalist in physics, not a theoretician. “My job was to measure things and to make sure that the measurements were right,” he said in the 2008 Nobel interview. “It is the job of the theoretical community to understand why things are the way that I see them when I do the experiments. “So I was not running around saying that I have discovered quarks,” he continued, adding: “I am telling you how electrons scatter from protons. You are telling me what’s inside that scatters the electrons. I didn’t have a real stake.” Continue reading the main story","Richard E.

Andrew M. Barker,"Period films always pose a musical challenge: How authentic should a composer be? For “ Mary Queen of Scots ” with Saoirse Ronan as Mary Stuart and Margot Robbie as Elizabeth I, composer Max Richter created a fairly modern score to sit alongside 16th-century music. Early-music expert William Lyons was called in to handle the historical material, leaving Richter free to tackle the dramatic score. “I wanted women’s voices to be really important in the film,” Richter says from London, “and I decided to try a cor anglais [English horn] for Mary’s voice.” Early experiments with the viol (a stringed instrument of the time) led to Richter processing the sound into “a sort of electronic cloud of viols for some of the more coloristic sequences with the voices.” “The instrumental music is based on a kind of geometry and a set of gestures which come from Renaissance music,” Richter explains. “So it’s a kind of wandering border between the contemporary and period authenticity.” The constant beat of field drums also foreshadows Mary’s eventual fate. “There’s going to be a funeral drum,” Richter says. “The other side of that is the marching drums of war. They came to symbolize Mary and Elizabeth’s shared antagonism for this world of male government. They were rivals and cousins, but they were also, in a way, allies against the male universe they inhabited.” A string-rich, 100-piece orchestra and 12-voice women’s choir are heard throughout. Yet curiously for a film largely set in Scotland (and despite Richter having studied in Edinburgh) there are no bagpipes. Instead, he employs a clàrsach, a Celtic harp common to the place and time. “We tried to evoke those sorts of colors without resorting to the touristy,” he says.","Period films always pose a musical challenge: How authentic should a composer be?

Please join us and participate via our donation page, which shows how to give via check, credit card, debit card, or PayPal. Read about why were doing this fundraiser and what weve accomplished in the last year, and our current goal, more original reporting By Wolf Richter, a San Francisco based executive, entrepreneur, start up specialist, and author, with extensive international work experience. Originally published at Wolf Street US bank stock index down 17% from January. EU bank stocks crushed, crushed, crushed since Financial Crisis. Monday early afternoon, the US KBW Bank index, which tracks large US banks and serves as a benchmark for the banking sector, is down 2.5% at the moment. It has dropped 17% from its post-Financial Crisis high on January 29. If the index closes at this level, it would be the lowest close since September 18, 2017: While that may be a nerve-wracking decline for those who have not experienced bank-stock declines, it comes after a huge surge that followed the collapse during the Financial Crisis: The second chart is on a different scale than the first chart above. So this years decline is small fry compared to the movements since 2006, including the dizzying plunge toward zero in early 2009, and the subsequent boom when it became clear that the Fed would pull out all stops to save the banks with all kinds of mechanisms, including ruthless financial repression forcing interest rates to 0% that it waged on depositors and savers for a decade. Profits derived from these mechanisms effectively recapitalized the banks. The 55% jump in bank stocks after the 2016 election through the peak in January 2018 was a reaction to promises for banking deregulation and tax cuts from the new Trump administration along with signs of lots of goodwill toward Wall Street, as top positions in the new administration were quickly being filled with Wall Street insiders. However, the Trump bump for banks is now being gradually unwound. But unlike their American brethren, the European banks have remained stuck in the miserable Financial Crisis mire a financial crisis that in Europe was followed by the Euro Debt Crisis. The Stoxx 600 bank index, which covers major European banks, including our hero Deutsche Bank, has plunged 27% since February 29, 2018, and is down 23% from a year ago: But note how minuscule this years 26% drop is in the overall collapse-scenario in the chart below going back to 2006: The Stoxx 600 Banks index never got anywhere near recovering after the Financial Crisis, as after each hopeful partial recovery, it kept falling off the wagon, and is once again falling off the wagon: Its not exactly a propitious sign that the banks in the US, after nearly recovering to their pre-Financial Crisis highs Close, but no cigar! are once again turning around and heading south as the Fed is gradually removing accommodation, which results in higher funding costs for banks and greater credit risks on outstanding loans. And the European banks remain a mess and have an excellent chance of getting still get messier. Why does this sell-off smell different?

"AP, AP","NEW YORK (AP) Petr Mrazek and the Carolina Hurricanes had a reason to enjoy themselves, too, on Friday night.
Mrazek made 27 saves and the Hurricanes spoiled a celebration at Madison Square Garden that honored the last Rangers team to win the Stanley Cup, blanking New York 3-0.
Warren Foegele scored the go-ahead goal early in the third period as the Hurricanes ended a 16-game losing streak at the Garden. He took a pass from Saku Maenalanen in the slot and wristed a shot past Henrik Lundqvist at 6:43.
""It was nice to get rewarded there,"" Foegele said. ""It was a great play by (Kegger) Greg McKegg to enter the zone with speed and then a beautiful pass by Saku.""
Rookie Andrei Svechnikov and Brock McGinn added empty-net goals as Carolina won its third in a row. It was Carolina's first win at MSG since a 4-3 victory on Oct. 29, 2010.
In a 45-minute pregame ceremony, Mark Messier, Brian Leetch and the players and coaches from the Rangers' 1994 Stanley Cup team were introduced. They were seated at center ice as a sellout crowd cheered the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of that championship.
To honor that club, Lundqvist wore a goaltender's mask similar to Mike Richter's with the Statue of Liberty prominently displayed on the front. Lundqvist's mask also has ""1994"" painted on the right side with a picture of Richter, his name and number.
""Unbelievable. It's a humbling thing. What a great statement by him,"" Richter said before the game.
""(He) didn't have to do it. It's very classy. I was shocked. ... Coming from him, look at the career the man has put together. He's been nothing but consistent from the day he arrived. He's had just a remarkable career, so it means a lot coming from him.""
Rangers coach David Quinn was disappointed in his team's effort in the game.
""There was definitely a lack of urgency which was surprising,"" he said. ""It certainly was set up to be a special night. We just didn't capitalize on it.""
Carolina, which is 13-4-1 in its past 18 games, climbed within a point of the Pittsburgh Penguins for the final playoff position in the Eastern Conference.
""I think we know where we are in the standings and how important each game is,"" Foegele said. ""We need wins and it's important we got two points there.""
These Rangers are near the bottom of the Eastern Conference.
After a tightly played opening period, both teams had better scoring chances in the second.
Kevin Hayes took a pass from Jimmy Vesey and faked Mrazek and attempted to stuff the puck into the net, but Hurricanes defenseman Jaccob Slavin swept it out from the crease.
""That was a big save by him,"" Mrazek said. ""Hayes did a nice job holding the puck for a little bit, I get out and a great save by Slavin.""
Mrazek closed the second period by making a stellar stick-side save on Mika Zibanejad with the Rangers on the power play.
Lundqvist kept the game scoreless late in the opening period as he stopped Nino Niederreiter on a breakaway. He finished with 30 saves.
""We definitely had our looks, especially in the second period,"" Lundqvist said. ""It came down to one play. Unfortunately we were on the wrong end. We had our opportunities. But they defended really well the whole game.""
NOTES: For the national anthem, the Garden replayed John Amirante's version of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" that he performed during the '94 Cup Final. ... The Rangers are 1-2-1 on their homestand. ... Defenseman Haydn Fleury was scratched for Carolina. Center Brett Howden and defenseman Neal Pionk were scratched by the Rangers.
UP NEXT:
Hurricanes: At the Devils on Sunday in the fourth game of a five-game road trip.
Rangers: Host Toronto on Sunday to close out a five-game homestand.

Yves Smith,"Wolf takes a well-deserved victory lap as Cointelegraph reports on more dodgy blockchain plays (hat tip furzy): The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published a report Thursday, Feb. 15 explaining the temporary suspension of trading in three companies that had made statements about acquiring cryptocurrency and “Blockchain technology-related assets”. All three companies, Cherubim Interests (CHIT), PDX Partners (PDXP), and Victura Construction Group (VICT) have been suspended starting Feb. 16 for two weeks for investor protection purposes. The SEC trading suspension orders state that all three companies issued press releases that claim that: [T]he companies acquired AAA-rated assets from a subsidiary of a private equity investor in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, among other things. According to the SEC order regarding CHIT, it also announced the execution of a financing commitment to launch an initial coin offering [ICO], The SEC orders also state “there are questions regarding the nature of the companies’ business operations and the value of their assets”. By Wolf Richter, a San Francisco based executive, entrepreneur, start up specialist, and author, with extensive international work experience. Originally published at Wolf Street I’ve never seen a sector skyrocket and totally collapse this fast – in four months – as these newfangled “blockchain stocks.” Now they’re surrounded by debris and revelations of scams. These fly-by-night or near-failure outfits used the hype of “blockchain” and the whole media razzmatazz about cryptocurrencies to manipulate up their stocks, sometimes by several thousand percent in a matter of days. I vivisected some of these outfits and their stock manipulation schemes on the way up. And on January 25, I documented Phase One of the collapse. This is now Phase Two of the collapse. And dip buyers are still not through getting crushed. UBI Blockchain International got totally mangled. When I last wrote about UBIA on January 25, it was down 93% from the peak six weeks earlier. Since then, all heck has broken loose. On Friday, OTC Market, where the shares had been demoted to, slapped a “skull-and-crossbones” icon next to the ticker and no longer displays a quote. It started out so promising: Over the course of a few days in mid-December, UBIA skyrocketed 1,500% to $115 a share intraday. December 28, I tarred and feathered the company, its executives, their shenanigans, and their Chinese connection [for details, read, I’m in Awe of How Far the Scams &amp; Stupidities around “Blockchain Stocks” are Going ]. January 9, the SEC halted trading in UBIA, for two reasons: lacking “accuracy” in disclosures and funny trading activity. The trading halt froze the share price at $22. January 23, when trading resumed, shares plunged further. January 25, when I last wrote about it, they were at $8.25, down 93% from the peak. February 9, the company disclosed in its quarterly SEC filing that it had zero revenues and a quarterly loss of $1.24 million. It repeated that its ability to go on as a “going concern” depended on getting new financing and its “ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations.” Fat chance. February 15, shares closed at $6, down 95% from the peak. Friday, February 16, OTC Markets Group stopped displaying quotes of UBIA, labeled the shares “Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware),” and placed the skull-and-crossbones icon next to the stock symbol. It told investors to “exercise additional caution and perform thorough due diligence before making an investment decision in that security.” In other words, the normal ways of obtaining a quote – on otcmarkets.com, MarketWatch, Yahoo, Bloomberg, WSJ, etc. – have disappeared. These shares are essentially goners. Riot Blockchain down 75% from the peak. The vultures are circling. This was a failing biotech outfit called Biotix with annual revenues of less than $200,000 over the past four years, generating a total of $34 million in losses. Shares were trading at around $4.50. But on October 4, it announced that it would change its name and start investing in cryptocurrency and blockchain startups. BAM went the shares – up nearly 1,000% to $46.20 by December 19. But by January 25, they’d plunged 61% to $17.92. On Friday, shares plunged 33.4% to $11.46 after CNBC published the results of its investigation into the shenanigans of the executives, a major investor, and the company. Later that day, I received an email from U.S. Market Advisors Law Group PLLC. The law firm “represents investors in antitrust, securities and shareholder litigation.” It announced “the completion of an initial investigation on behalf of investors” into “whether Riot Blockchain and certain of its officers and directors violated federal securities laws”: As a result of its findings, the firm has prepared, but not yet filed, a proposed class action complaint to recover losses suffered by Riot Blockchain investors. The law firm explained how the biotech company changed its name and used the hype around blockchain announcements to manipulate up its shares. Then… On December 29, 2017, after the market closed and heading into a three-day holiday weekend, John O’Rourke, the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer, made an SEC filing revealing he had sold over 30,000 Riot Blockchain shares. On this news, Riot Blockchain’s stock price declined more than 14% over two trading days. On January 31, 2018, before the market opened, the Wall Street Journal published an article detailing investor Barry Honig’s involvement with Riot Blockchain and his trading of the company’s shares. On the same day, Riot Blockchain announced that its annual shareholder meeting would be postponed for a second time. On this news, Riot Blockchain’s stock price declined more than 14% over two trading days. On February 16, 2018, CNBC reported that Riot Blockchain’s operations raise a number of “red flags,” including: (i) insider selling; (ii) making no apparent effort to timely hold annual shareholder meetings; and (iii) diluting the common stock. On this news, Riot Blockchain’s stock price fell more than 30% during intraday trading. Not that dip buyers won’t plow in and drive up the shares for a little while. But RIOT is likely a goner too. Long Blockchain Corp down 66% from the peak. LBCC is a failing beverage-maker that was called Long Island Iced Tea until December 18. With the name-change announcement, it manipulated its shares up by 360% from $2.06 on December 18 to $9.49 a few days later. This scheme was hatched as the company had received a delisting notice from the Nasdaq, which it disclosed on October 13, 2017 in an SEC filing. The reason was that its market capitalization had dropped below the minimum of $35 million for 30 consecutive trading days. It averted a delisting with the scheme of changing its name to “Long Blockchain” and peppering the announcement with gobbledygook about its new “blockchain” business model. Its market cap surged along with the shares. But… January 5, when it announced that it would sell 1.6 million shares in a secondary offering, shares crashed 21%. January 9, under intense scrutiny, it canceled the stock offering. January 25, when I last wrote about it, shares had plunged 61% from the peak to $3.72 and continued to drop until they hit $2.82 on January 30. Then dip buyers piled in and pushed shares back to $3.63. On Friday, February 16, shares plunged 11% to $3.23. This leaves them down 66% from the peak. What caused the plunge? On Thursday, the company had disclosed in an SEC filing that it had received another delisting notice from the Nasdaq. The company can appeal the delisting. But even if it wins the appeal, it will have to keep its market cap above $35 million for a minimum of 10 trading days in a row by April 9. As of Friday’s close, its market cap was $33 million. Longfin down 76% from the peak. LFIN went public in November. On December 15, the company announced a mix of gobbledygook, hype, and silliness about having acquired a “Blockchain-empowered solutions provider,” namely some website that belonged to a Singapore corporation that is 95% owned by Longfin’s CEO. It didn’t pass the smell test. But shares skyrocketed 2,700% over the three-day period to an intraday high of $142.82 on December 18, pushing the company’s market cap to a fabulous $7 billion and making it the role model of every “blockchain” scammer out there. By January 25, LFIN had plunged 71% to $41.61. On Friday shares plunged 18%. At $34.40, shares are now down 76% from the peak. DPW Holdings down 70% from the peak. This was a penny stock before it came up with its blockchain scam. The company makes power supplies for computers. But when it announced that it would market its power supplies to cryptocurrency miners, shares skyrocketed 880% from $0.56 on November 21 to an intraday high of $5.95 on December 18. On Friday, the stock fell 6.4%. At $1.76, shares have plunged 70% from the peak. On-line Blockchain [OBC] down 44% from the peak. This is another name-change scam. The company was called On-line Plc, a thinly traded penny stock in London. After it changed its name, its shares spiked nearly 1,000%, from 14 pence to 152 pence by January 9. By January 25, shares had plunged 35% from the peak to 97 pence. On Friday, shares dropped 7% and closed at 84.55 pence, down 44% from the peak. Eastman Kodak [KODK] down 47% from the peak. Kodak’s blockchain-and-crypto manipulation scheme wasn’t a name change but an announcement on January 9 of a “blockchain initiative,” including its own cryptocurrency, KodakCoin. Shares soared 300% in two days, from $3.10 to $12.40. Interestingly, on January 8, the day before the announcement, seven independent directors awarded themselves big-fat stock grants. By January 25, shares had dropped 23% from the peak to $9.50. On Friday, shares dropped 7.8% to $6.55, and are down 47% from the peak. Seven Stars Cloud Group [SSC] down 55% from the peak.

"Associated Press, Associated Press","Cardinal Pell facing Australian court on sex abuse charges
 Time
MELBOURNE, Australia The most senior Catholic cleric ever charged with child sex abuse has been convicted of molesting two choirboys moments after celebrating Mass, dealing a new blow to the Catholic hierarchys credibility after a year of global revelations of abuse and cover-up.
Cardinal George Pell, Pope Francis top financial adviser and the Vaticans economy minister, bowed his head but then regained his composure as the 12-member jury delivered unanimous verdicts in the Victoria state County Court on Dec. 11 after more than two days of deliberation.
The court had until Tuesday forbidden publication of any details about the trial.
The convictions were confirmed the same week that Francis concluded his extraordinary summit of Catholic leaders summoned to Rome for a tutorial on preventing clergy sexual abuse and protecting children from predator priests.

The jury convicted Pell of abusing two 13-year-old boys whom he had caught swigging sacramental wine in a rear room of Melbournes St. Patricks Cathedral in late 1996, as hundreds of worshippers were streaming out of Sunday services.
Pell, now 77 but 55 at the time, had just been named the most senior Catholic in Australias second-largest city, Melbourne.
The jury also found Pell guilty of indecently assaulting one of the boys in a corridor more than a month later.
He faces a potential maximum 50-year prison term after a sentencing hearing that begins on Wednesday. He has foreshadowed an appeal.
Pell had maintained his innocence throughout, describing the accusations as vile and disgusting conduct that went against everything he believed in.
His lawyer Robert Richter had told the jury that only a mad man would take the risk of abusing boys in such a public place. He said it was laughable that Pell would have been able to expose his penis and force the victim to take it in his mouth, given the cumbersome robes he was wearing.
Both he and Chief Judge Peter Kidd urged the jury of eight men and four women not to punish Pell for all the failings of the Catholic Church.
You must not scapegoat Cardinal Pell, Kidd told the jury.
Pell, who walked to and from court throughout his month-long trial with a crutch under his right arm, was released on bail to undergo surgical knee replacements in Sydney on Dec. 14. Prosecutor Mark Gibson did not oppose bail, saying the surgery would be more easily managed outside the prison system.
Last SlideNext Slide
Kidd warned that the continuing bail was not a sign that the 77-year-old would avoid a prison sentence.
The first four offenses occurred at the first or second Solemn Mass that Archbishop Pell celebrated as leader of the magnificent blue-stone century-old cathedral in the center of Melbourne. Pell was wearing his full robes though not his staff or pointed bishops hat at the time.
The now 34-year-old survivor told the court that Pell orally raped him, then crouched and fondled the complainants genitals while masturbating.
The other victim died of a heroin overdose in 2014 without ever complaining of the abuse, and even denying to his suspicious mother that he had been molested while he was part of the choir.
Neither boy can be identified.
More than a month later, the complainant testified that Pell pushed him against a cathedral corridor wall after a mass and squeezed the boys genitals painfully before walking away in silence.
I didnt tell anyone at the time because I didnt want to jeopardize anything. I didnt want to rock the boat with my family, my schooling, my life, the complainant told the jurors.
The complainant testified that he feared that making such accusations against a powerful church man would cost him his place in the choir and with it his scholarship to prestigious St. Kevins College.
Pell pleaded not guilty to one count of sexual penetration of a child under 16 and four counts of willfully committing an indecent act with or in the presence of a child under 16 in late 1996 and early 1997.
Pell did not testify at his trial. But the jury saw a video recording of an interview he gave Australian detectives in Rome in 2016 in which he stridently denied the allegations.
Pell grimaced, appeared incredulous, distressed, waved his arms over his head and muttered to himself as the detectives detailed the accusations that his victim had leveled against him a year earlier.
The allegations involve vile and disgusting conduct contrary to everything I hold dear and contrary to the explicit teachings of the church which I have spent my life representing, Pell told police.
Richter, Pells lawyer, had told the jury that the media had portrayed Pell as the Darth Vader of the church, referring to the Star Wars character.

Sophia Mitrokostas,"Staying healthy is a full-time job. Eating right, keeping active, and avoiding unnecessary risk is all part of making sure your body is fit enough to take on whatever life throws at it. Though some not-so-great habits and environmental factors are obviously bad for your health, other health risks might not be so obvious. 
 INSIDER consulted with medical experts to uncover a few seemingly harmless things that can actually get you sick. 
Washing raw meat actually increases your chances of getting food poisoning
 It might seem counterintuitive, but washing raw meat to remove contaminants and bacteria actually elevates your chances of becoming infected by a food-borne pathogen. 
 ""Never wash raw meat before cooking! Water has a tendency to splash, which can give germs a free ride to your sink, counter, and nearby utensils and food,"" certified food safety expert Katie Heil told INSIDER. 
 Instead of scrubbing down raw meat, keep it isolated from all other meal ingredients until it's thoroughly cooked. Be sure to wash your hands after handling raw meat and use separate utensils for the meat and the rest of the dish. 
Spending face time with your dog could expose you to diseases if you don't practice good hygiene
 Illnesses that transfer from animals to humans are known as zoonotic diseases. Unfortunately, dogs can potentially spread a few to their owners. 
 Veterinarian Dr. Gary Richter told INSIDER that parasites like hookworms, roundworms, and scabies can transfer from dogs to humans. People can also be exposed to Leptospirosis and salmonella bacterial infections from dog feces or urine. 
 Actually catching a disease from a dog is uncommon. 
 ""Transmission of diseases from dogs to people is rare. There are concerns with people who are immune-suppressed (on chemotherapy, have HIV, etc) but for most healthy people, reasonable amount hygiene will keep them safe,"" Dr. Richter said. 
You aren't safe from your dog's illnesses.

And no, you can't catch a cold from your dog. 
If you often follow the '5-second rule,' it can be risky
 ""The five-second rule"" is the idea of when you drop an item on the ground, it won't be contaminated by germs if you pick it up within five seconds. Unfortunately, this isn't the whole story. 
 ""You may be fine since the majority of germs are harmless, but by eating something off the floor or countertop, you're taking a calculated risk. It is possible a cold or flu virus is on the surface,"" infectious disease and critical care expert Dr. Thomas S. Ahrens told INSIDER. 
 One study from Rutgers University found that the longer an item is on the ground, the more bacteria transfer to the item. Though this means that it may technically be safer to eat a fallen potato chip that was immediately picked up rather than one left on the floor for a few minutes, you're still better off avoiding placing anything in your mouth that has had contact with the ground. 
Taking too many vitamins or supplements can cause health problems
 Getting essential vitamins and minerals through food is a good way to keep your body healthy. But when it comes to vitamin supplements, it is possible to inadvertently take more than your body is equipped to handle. 
 ""Many people do not realize that taking certain vitamins, even good products, in the wrong doses can have negative effects. The fat-soluble vitamins A, E, D, and K are especially likely to cause toxicity if taken in excess,"" internal medicine physician Dr. Arielle Levitan told INSIDER. 
You can have too much of certain vitamins.
 Farion_O/Shutterstock 
According to The Mayo Clinic, taking too much vitamin D can lead to vomiting, weakness, frequent urination, bone pain, and kidney problems. Consuming more than the recommended daily dose of vitamin C (65 to 90 mg a day with an upper limit of 2,000 mg a day) can lead to vomiting, heartburn, headaches, and insomnia. Regularly getting too much vitamin A may have the potential to cause bone problems. 
Washing with antibacterial soap can actually lead to a weaker immune system
 Washing with antibacterial soap is a good idea if you're in a germy environment or if you have a compromised immune system. But for most of us, regularly using antibacterial soap may do more harm than good. 
 ""Our skin hosts more than 500 different types of good bacteria. This bacterial system provides vital protection for the body and contributes to our immune defenses. Regularly using antibacterial products can reduce this vital immune safety net, leaving us more prone to colds, flu, and other illnesses,"" Dr. Holly Phillips, internal medicine physician and medical expert for RetailMeNot Rx Saver, told INSIDER. 
 In 2016, the FDA banned 19 antibacterial ingredients in hand and body washes, including triclosan and triclocarban. Their investigations found that regular use of these products might product health hazards such as bacterial resistance or hormonal effects. Sticking to regular soap and water is a good way to combat the spread of germs. 
Drinking out of public drinking fountains can harbor cold and flu viruses
 Public water fountains can harbor contagious bacteria or viruses. The problem usually isn't with the quality of the water itself, but the possibility of contamination by previous users. 
 ""If you drink out of a water fountain, there might be some airborne bacteria or viruses present, especially if someone before you was already infectious with a cold or virus and didn't know it,"" said Dr. Ahrens. 
Never touch your mouth to the tap.

To avoid catching something unpleasant from a drinking fountain, be sure to never place your lips against the spout but sip from the stream of water as it flows out. You can also use a disinfectant wipe on the spout, or skip the fountain entirely and carry your own reusable water bottle. 
Touching your face can spread viruses
 Dr. Ahrens warned that touching your face can transfer germs to your mouth and nose. 
 ""The main way viruses enter our bodies is via the nose and mouth. If you touch one of the many germ hotbeds we encounter every day and then rub your nose, bite your nails, or rub your eyes, you're giving illnesses an open door to enter your system,"" said Dr. Phillips. 
 Keyboards, doorknobs, escalator buttons, cellphones, and cash are all items that can be breeding grounds for bacteria and viruses. Touching the face can also worsen acne for people who are prone to it. 
Thawing food at room temperature gives bacteria time to breed
 You might think nothing of tossing a package of frozen meat or vegetables on the kitchen counter to thaw. But allowing perishable foods to thaw at room temperature increases the likelihood of bacterial growth. 
 ""Room temperature is within the temperature danger zone or 41 to 135 degrees Fahrenheit. Pathogens can grow and multiply extremely quickly in that temperature range, and when food is left out at room temperature it can become unsafe to eat, even after cooking,"" said Heil. 
 According to the USDA, perishable food should never be left at room temperature for more than two hours, regardless of whether it is frozen or not. The best ways to thaw food are in the refrigerator, in cold water, or in the microwave. 
Even minor cuts and scrapes can potentially get infected
Not all cuts are harmless.

It's not just gaping wounds that need to be protected from germs. Something as minor as a skinned knee or a cat scratch has the potential to become infected by germs that are already on your body. 
 ""You routinely have germs on your skin, but if you break the skin, there's now an entry point for the germs that normally are kept outside. If you have a cut or any break in the skin, clean and cover it with a bandage,"" said Dr. Ahrens. 
 An exposed cut or scrape of any size means that germs have an unprotected pathway into your body. Disinfect and cover any cuts and only touch the wounded area with clean hands. If you notice signs of infection such as itching, burning, swelling, or redness, get the cut checked out by a healthcare provider. 
Ignoring oral health may actually increase your risk of illness in the rest of the body
 Brushing your teeth and flossing are useful for more than just preventing tooth decay and bad breath. Research has also linked gum disease with the development of type-2 diabetes and certain heart problems. 
 ""Gum disease is linked to several different diseases. There is a clear link between periodontitis and diabetes, and it seems they're so intrinsically linked that it's unclear which one causes the other,"" dentist Dr. Mark Burhenne told INSIDER. 
 According to the National Health Service, developing gum disease can also increase your risk of stroke and heart disease. 
 ""If you're at high risk for heart disease, getting your teeth cleaned, pulled, or even brushed vigorously can increase your risk for developing endocarditis. This happens when bacteria from plaque gets into the bloodstream, leading to bacteremia,"" said Dr. Burhenne. 
 Endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of your heart. It is a serious condition and can be life-threatening. Bacteremia is more likely to lead to endocarditis in people with already weakened immune systems or pre-existing heart conditions.","Tons of things in your everyday life can run the risk of making you sick.

Lane Sainty,"Cardinal George Pell will face a jury trial on a number of historical sexual offence charges. The decision to commit Pell to trial on some of the offences he had been charged with was handed down by magistrate Belinda Wallington in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Tuesday morning. She dismissed several other charges against Pell on the basis there was insufficient evidence for conviction. Pell, 76, is Australia's most senior Catholic, and the highest ranked Catholic in the world to face charges of historic sexual offences. He was charged with multiple offences from multiple complainants, the details of which cannot be reported for legal reasons. Pell has strenuously denied the allegations against him. He entered a plea of not guilty after Wallington delivered her ruling on the committal hearing. In 2014, Pell moved to Rome to take up the role of Prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively the treasurer of the Vatican, appointed by Pope Francis. He has taken leave from that role while facing legal proceedings in Australia. A number of accusers, their family members, and other witnesses testified at the committal hearing, which ran for about four weeks in March. The purpose of a committal hearing is for a magistrate to hear the evidence against the accused and decide whether it is sufficient to commit them to stand trial. It is not a determination of guilt or innocence. The first one and a half weeks of the hearing were closed to the public as the complainants against Pell gave evidence, which is routine for committal hearings involving sexual offences. Pell attended each day of the committal hearing, usually flanked by police officers as he entered the court. Wallington heard final arguments in the committal from Pell's barrister Robert Richter QC and prosecutor Mark Gibson SC in mid-April, and then took two weeks to make her decision. The Archbishop of Melbourne, Denis Hart, released a statement saying that he wouldn't make any comment about the decision to commit Pell to trial. ""Archbishop Hart expressed his confidence in the judicial system in Australia and said that justice must now take its course,"" the statement said.","Pell, an adviser to Pope Francis, is the most senior Catholic in the world to face historic sexual offence accusations in court.

A.O. SCOTT,"Richters mid-60s paintings, and the similar canvases that Kurt executes at the climax of the film, are haunting, challenging attempts to plot the intersection of personal and historical experience, a zone composed almost entirely of gray areas. Exact reproductions of ordinary photographs with faces and other details blurred, they are troubling and suggestive studies in unspoken guilt and suppressed memory, heavy with meanings that they refuse to disclose.
That is not the way von Donnersmarck operates. He is not a man to choose nuance when a statement of the obvious, preferably accompanied by an orchestra and tasteful nudity, is available. Never Look Away traffics in all kinds of thorny, ambiguous material: Its about family secrets, psychological misdirection, the sometimes uncanny harmonies between artifice and reality. But its methods are almost defiantly literal, engineered for accessibility and sentimental impact.
This is not entirely a bad thing. Von Donnersmarcks first feature, The Lives of Others, unpacked some of the moral baggage of the former East Germany and laid out the contents in clear, conventional cinematic language. Part melodrama and part Cold War thriller, that film won an Oscar in 2007 and was embraced by many critics, including this one, for its blend of suspense and ethical precision.
Never Look Away, working on a grander scale in muddier genre territory not quite a biopic, it hovers between psychological drama and period romance tries to achieve a similar blend of clarity and excitement. Even when it stumbles, it remains watchable and engaging, partly because von Donnersmarck possesses an old-fashioned Hollywood showmans sensibility. In addition to the lush music (composed by Max Richter), it has rich, velvety images (for which Caleb Deschanel has just received an Oscar nomination) and emphatic performances by highly attractive actors.","This film, based on the life of Gerhard Richter, follows a German artist from the Nazi era to the 1960s.",2019-01-24T19:01:59Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","‘Never Look Away’ Review: A Lush Adventure in Sex, Politics and Painting",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/movies/never-look-away-review.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/25/arts/25neverlookaway1/25neverlookaway1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Richter,0
Caroline Williamson,"PERPETUAL CALENDARS from Joseph Magliaro, designer and former co-founder of Table of Contents Marshall McLuhan believed that outmoded technologies often return as works of art. In that vein, I like to think of the perpetual desk calendar — a staple of pre-digital 20th century office life obviated by the smartphone and personal computer — as a form ripe for recuperation as an enabler of symbolic rites. The perpetual calendar offers no practical benefit today, functioning instead as an instance of memento mori. The only reason to turn its dials or click its buttons is to remind us that another day has passed, and that to take advantage of our openness to the world, we shouldn’t feel paralyzed by angst, but rather called to action, obligated to engage as many possibilities as we can in the time that remains. TRAVEL WINE COOLERS from Fabiana Faria and Helena Barquet, co-founders of Coming Soon The first time we saw the Travel Wine Cooler — designed in 1980 by Australian designer Richard Carlson for Décor, and in MoMA’s permanent collection — was a recent purchase a friend, Esteban Arboleda, made at a local vintage store while we were staying at his house in Shelter Island. We became obsessed with it and have tried to buy out the market of them to get the best colors. We ended up amassing quite a few of them. Some have a sleeve that you can freeze that keeps the wine cool, but you might just want that particular color. We also found one with the original box, which has an amazing image of the cooler on it. STONE FRUITS from Keren Richter, co-founder of The White Arrow I’ve always found fake foods fun, be they wooden kid’s toys, plastic display-case sushi, or oversized Oldenburg Burgers. My ‘stone fruit’ collection playfully elevates something kitschy into the realm of the Renaissance still life. The monochromatic pairings explore the subtle color and textural variations between marble and alabaster, while looking pretty, too. DIGESTIF GLASSES from Daniela Jacobs, founder of ARC Objects Digestif glasses have come into my world of possessions because I love small-scale home objects – especially glass or ceramic ones. I enjoy using these small vessels for a variety of things, like sipping espresso in the morning, or placing fresh herbs in the kitchen, or actually enjoying a digestif after a meal. BASKET THEMED OBJECTS from Daniela Jacobs, founder of ARC Objects Basket-themed objects have always attracted me, since I was tiny. This probably has something to do with always seeing them around at home, and with their ubiquity in Mallorca, where I grew up aside from New York. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve grown not only an aesthetic appreciation for how these materials look, but also for the care put into how they’re made. Something about basket textures are just visually calming. CLIP-ON EARRINGS from Mary Ping, founder of Slow and Steady Wins the Race We amassed a collection of various vintage clip on earrings sourced from eBay, Etsy, and thrift shops. We went in search of timeless, sculptural, architectural, and unusual takes on the clip-on, whether it be a 1960s Space Age Lucite starburst shape, or modernist silver-tone half-cylindrical bars. Our favorites are the 1950s pea-soup colored earrings with a pivot point connecting 3 blade-shaped pieces of Bakelite that you can wear closed or spread open. We haven’t seen anything quite like them, but we wish we designed them ourselves. ICE GLASS from Monica Khemsurov, co-founder of Sight Unseen and Tetra I only purchased my first piece of vintage Blenko ‘ice glass’ –thick, chunky cast-glass objects with a beautiful watery texture — last year, in the form of a half-cylinder bookend I found at a flea market in my hometown of Columbus, Ohio. But I quickly became obsessed with collecting it, both because it’s surprisingly inexpensive despite its ridiculous heft, and because transparent and cast-glass furniture and objects have been setting off my inner trend radar for almost two years now. BALANCING BIRDS from Matthew Sullivan, designer and former founder of AQQ Index Presumably the Egyptian god Horus — overseer of sky, war, and hunting — distilled down to a cheap Chinese trinket. Pretty elegant kitsch though, a real weird time-shrinker (progress?). CLAY PIPES from Matthew Sullivan, designer and former founder of AQQ Index These vintage pipes are probably all from the late 19th century or early 20th century, and Dutch. One has really beautifully rendered curls. It’s a strange concept, smoking tobacco out of a head. Apparently the mud of all European urban waters are full of them (the Thames, the Canals of Venice, and Amsterdam). PEPPERMILLS from Sabrina De Sousa, co-founder of Dimes I’ve been collecting peppermills for some time, which led me to design my own last year. I have a bunch more at home which I can’t part with, but the group that I chose for the show are a great representation of the more modernist mills. My favorite is the tall black one with the glass tube (maker unknown) — it’s a great example of Memphis design.

Reuters,"By: Reuters | Published: August 26, 2018 8:06:29 am The casualties were in the city of Tazehabad, northeast of Kermanshah, according to Tasnim. A magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck near the Iranian city of Kermanshah, killing one and wounding 58, the Tasnim news agency reported on Sunday. The casualties were in the city of Tazehabad, northeast of Kermanshah, according to Tasnim. Two aftershocks above 3.0 on the Richter scale were also recorded, according to the Tasnim news agency. The U.S. Geological Survey reported that a shallow, magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck about 55 miles (88 km) west-northwest of Kermanshah. The quake was felt as far away as Baghdad, according to Iraqi state television, which also said there were no injuries recorded.

Nasdaq down 24% already. Renaissance IPO ETF down 31%. But Uber and other unicorns are planning record IPOs in 2019, à la dotcom-crash-debut in 2000.
The IPO hype machine has produced some very successful companies and a lot of spectacular wealth transfers from the hapless public to early investors selling their shares. Here are two of the standouts that I covered:
Snap [SNAP], purveyor of the Snapchat app and must-have sunglasses with a built-in camera: Shares peaked at $29 on the second day after its IPO, given it a market capitalization of $32 billion. Shares closed on Friday at $4.96 and this morning trade at $5.24, down 82% from day two of trading.
Blue Apron [APRN], the cream of the crop of about 150 VC-funded meal-kit startups founded over the past five years, was valued at $2 billion during its last round of funding in June 2015 when it was one of the most hyped unicorns that would change the world. Then enthusiasm began to sag. By the time the IPO approached, the IPO price was cut from a range of $15-$17 a share to $10 a share. Shares closed on Friday at $0.68 and are trading this morning at $0.71, down 93% from its IPO price.
But not all IPOs are tech companies though theres nothing tech about a meal-kit maker other than the least important part, the app. The Renaissance IPO ETF [IPO] holds the shares of companies across the board that went public over the past two years. After two years, the companies are removed from the ETF. Its top five holdings are in real estate, insurance products, music streaming, and cable TV, so not exactly pushing the boundaries of tech invention.
These five IPOs havent done all that badly, compared to the wholesale destruction of Blue Apron, though they all have dropped sharply from their recent peaks (prices as of this morning):
Vici Properties [VICI], a casino property company, at $18.02, is down 22% from its peak in January 2018 shortly after the IPO.
Athene Holding [ATH] a retirement services company that issues, reinsures and acquires retirement savings products at $38.36, has dropped 29% since September, 2018.
Invitation Homes [INVH], Blackstones buy-to-rent creature that acquired over 48,000 single-family homes out of foreclosure at the end of the housing bust, at $19.40, is down 18% from its peak in September.
Spotify [SPOT], the music streaming service, at $107.46, has plunged 46% from its peak on July 26. It went public in April.
Altice USA [ATUS], a cable TV operator, at $15.37, is down 39% from the peak on the day after its IPO in July 2017.
Overall, the Renaissance IPO ETF has plunged 31% from its peak in June 2018 (data via Investing.com):
The Nasdaq itself has dropped 24% from its all-time peak at the end of August.
It is in this new reality that some of the biggest startups and some of the biggest money-losers in the startup circus are trying to unload the shares to the public in 2019 before the window closes. The enormous hype about these IPOs has already started, with bankers funneling this hype to the Wall Street Journal, which breathlessly reported on the big numbers to be transferred from the public to the selling insiders and the companies. The hyped numbers are truly huge.
The biggest candidates that are that are now being hyped for an IPO in 2019 are:
Uber, with a current valuation of $76-billion, could go for an IPO in early 2019 that would value it at as much as $120 billion, the WSJ reported, based on the hype the bankers are now spreading to maximize their bonuses. Not all shares would be sold in the IPO, so the proceeds in this scenario could reach as much as $25 billion.
Palantir (data mining), with a current valuation of $20 billion, could see an IPO valuation of $41 billion, according to the WSJs people familiar with its plans, who also cautioned that these plans remained in flux, and that, according to the WSJ, investment bankers often exaggerate projected IPO values to win business.
Lyft, with a current valuation of $15 billion, is also looking for an IPO in early 2019, at more than $15 billion.
Then there is a gaggle of other big startups that could also head for the IPO window in 2019, according to the WSJs people familiar with the matter, but apparently havent decided on the timing yet. They include:
Ant Financial Services Group (current valuation of $150 billion), formerly known as Alipay, an Alibaba creation. Alibabas shares have plunged 36% since June.
Didi Chuxing (current valuation of $56 billion), the Chinese ride-hailing outfit.
Airbnb (current valuation of $31 billion).
Pinterest (current valuation of $12 billion).
Slack (current valuation of $7 billion), which sells cloud-based collaboration tools.
A raft of smaller but closely watched companies, such as food-delivery service Postmates, security firms CrowdStrike and Cloudflare, and videoconferencing-software provider Zoom Video Communications.
The all-time high that tech IPOs combined raised in a single year was $44.5 billion. If these tech IPOs come to pass in 2019, and if these valuations can be pulled off, with Uber alone hoping to raise $25 billion, the 2000-record would be broken by a large amount.
That would make sense: The year 2000 was when the dotcom bubble began to collapse catastrophically, and everyone tried to get their heroes out the IPO window before it would close for years to come. The Nasdaq, where these IPOs were concentrated, would eventually crash 78% from its peak in March 2000, with catastrophic consequences for those whod bought the hype.
The WSJ muses about this new generation of record-setting IPOs and Wall Street bankers hype machine:
For average investors, it could mean they finally will be able to bet on companies like Uber that have become part of their everyday lives but have been out of reach, even as their estimated values ballooned.
When all IPOs are included, and not just tech IPOs, 2018 was a banner year, with $54 billion raised. This includes 47 tech companies that raised only about $18 billion a far cry from the $44.5 billion that tech IPOs raised in 2000. But 2019 is going to fix this shortcoming, assuming that the hype works and that the public is buying.
The WSJ, citing Dealogic, pointed out that tech IPOs this year on average soared 28% on the first day of trading. No word about what happened afterwards. But the Renaissance IPO ETF is down 31% so far this year. Reality starts after the first few days of trading.
Tech companies that had already gone public raised an additional $21 billion in 2018 by selling more shares to the public in follow-on offerings, the most for follow-on offerings since 2000.
Then, the WSJ tucked this reality-infested warning into its last paragraph:
In another sign of exuberance, investors are overlooking lofty valuations and measly or zero profits to have a shot at outsized returns. In the first three quarters of the year, four-fifths of all U.S.-listed IPOs were of companies that lost money in the 12 prior months. That is the highest proportion on record.
So the last three months of 2018 plus 2019 and perhaps years to come are shaping up to be, by the looks of it, a similarly glorious period for tech stocks, IPOs, and the Nasdaq as the period from March 2000 till late 2002.","Companies planning IPOs for 2019 must hope that the upcoming year will be like 2000, the last hurrah of the dot-com era.",2018-12-25T08:39:54Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Nakedcapitalism.com'}","Wolf Richter: Nasdaq, “Tech,” & IPOs Are in for Gut-Wrencher",https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2018/12/wolf-richter-nasdaq-tech-ipos-gut-wrencher.html,https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/00-US-renaissance-ipo-etf-2018-12-24.png,,Nakedcapitalism.com,Richter,0

Yves Smith,"By Wolf Richter, a San Francisco based executive, entrepreneur, start up specialist, and author, with extensive international work experience. Originally published at Wolf Street
Housing inventory listed for sale in the two counties that make up Silicon Valley San Mateo County and Santa Clara County and in the county of San Francisco, surged by 113% in December compared to December last year, to 2,691 active listings, the most for any December since 2013, when the area emerged from Housing Bust 1. December is usually near the annual low point in terms of listings, but not in 2018, when listings in December were higher than in each of the first five months that year.
The chart below shows the year-over-year percentage change in active listings. The bars in red denote when the underlying dynamics of the housing market changed direction (all data via the National Association of Realtors at realtor.com):
The shift is now becoming more obvious in Silicon Valley and San Francisco, among the most expensive housing markets in the US with median prices for single-family houses ranging from about $1.2 million in Santa Clara to about $1.5 million in San Mateo.
With inventories for sale rising, as sales are slowing, a whiff of competition is settling in among sellers, who have to determine where the market is today, not where it was last year, and if they want to sell their property, they have to price it where the buyers are. But buyers arent where they were a year ago, and the bidding wars have receded into history, and mortgage rates have jumped from a year ago. The right property, priced right will sell. But if its priced off the market, it will likely sit. This is starting to sink in. And sellers are cutting their asking prices.
In December, the number of properties on the market with price cuts in Silicon Valley and San Francisco combined skyrocketed by 455% from a year earlier to 444. This chart shows the year-over-year percentage change for each month, with the red bars denoting when bubble trouble began:
The median asking price for the three counties had peaked in May 2018 at $1.37 million but has since plunged by $170,300 or by 12% from the peak, to $1.2 million. Median asking price means half the properties are listed for more and half are listed for less. It differs from the median selling price at which homes are actually sold. This was the lowest median asking price since August 2017:
Compared to December last year, the median asking price dropped by $100,000 or by 7.7%. The chart below of year-over-year dollar changes in median asking prices shows to what extent a new sense of reality about the direction of the market has crept into asking prices over the past two months:
And these are still the boom times in Silicon Valley and San Francisco. There is some anecdotal evidence that some of the tech companies are slowing down some moonshots or expansion projects or are cancelling later phases, and some startups have trouble getting funding.
But a slew of massive IPOs are being hyped for 2019 Uber, Palantir, Lyft, Airbnb, and the like before the Nasdaq craters, thereby shutting the IPO window. And this tsunami of mega-IPOs was hoped to flood the land with cash, as investors and employees start selling their shares. These hopes still exist, and at least some of those IPOs will happen this year. While the water is a little ruffled, these are still the boom times in the Bay Area.
And that the underlying dynamics of the housing market have changed direction is this time not a result of the tech bust. That hasnt happened yet.

Ed Yong,"When Charles Konsitzke and Dhanu Shanmuganayagam first met, they were both just trying to get some peace and quiet. It was early 2014, and they were representing the University of Wisconsin-Madison at a fancy event to promote the university’s research to local politicians. After hours of talking to senators, Shanmuganayagam was fried, and went for a walk to clear his head. That’s when he bumped into Konsitzke, an administrator at the University of Wisconsin’s Biotechnology Center. They introduced themselves, and discussed their work. Shanmuganayagam said that he ran a facility that rears miniature pigs, which are genetically engineered to carry mutations found in human genetic disorders. Scientists can study the mini-pigs to better understand those diseases. “And I said: I have a project for you,” Konsitzke recalls. Konsitzke’s son Mason, now aged 7, was born with little brown birthmarks on his buttocks. Many kids have one or two of these café-au-lait spots and at first, Konsitzke thought they were cute. But after more appeared, he did some research and found that such spots are a common symptom of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1)—an incurable inherited disease. Around Mason’s first birthday, a pediatrician confirmed the diagnosis. Mason Konsitzke (Bryce Richter / University of Wisconsin-Madison) NF-1 is an incredibly varied disease with many possible symptoms. The spots are the least of them. Some patients, Mason included, develop learning disabilities. Others develop bone and heart problems. Most commonly, patients get tumors on their skin and nerves; Mason already has one on the side of his face. These tumors are usually benign, but even so they can still disfigure. “It continues to grow, and if it runs out of space, it will deform his face outward,” says Konsitzke. Konsitzke isn’t a scientist by training, but through his job he’s well connected to the scientific world. Once Mason’s diagnosis was in, he started asking around about NF-1 research. In particular, he wanted to know where the bottlenecks are. What was the single thing he could do that would most accelerate research into his son’s condition? And the answer that he kept hearing was: Find better animals to experiment on. When studying diseases, scientists often turn to laboratory animals like mice and zebrafish. They can use these so-called model organisms to work out how mutations cause diseases, and to find and test possible treatments. But the usual lab animals aren’t a good fit for NF-1. They’re too small, and they don’t react in the same way to the mutations that cause the disease in humans. For example, studies in mice suggested that a drug called lovastatin might help to address the learning and attentional problems that accompany NF-1. But when the drug was tested on actual children, in a large clinical trial, it did nothing. To better understand NF-1, Konsitzke learned, you need a species that’s closer in both size and biology to a person, and yet is still relatively easy to raise and study. That is, you need pigs. “Pigs closely represent humans,” says Neha Patel, who directs the UW neurofibromatosis clinic. “People with NF-1 have varied cognitive deficits, from severe learning issues to subtle problems. If you imagine studying those in a rat, you’d only get a crude picture of how that translates to humans. But pigs are intellectual animals.” That’s why, in a quiet corner of the Wisconsin State Capitol, Konsitzke was so excited to meet Shanmuganayagam. Here was someone with experience in raising, engineering, and studying pigs. Here was just the guy he needed to give NF-1 research a boost. Dhanu Shanmuganayagam (Bryce Richter / University of Wisconsin-Madison) For his part, Shanmuganayagam was keen to take on a new challenge. “I know a lot of diseases,” he says, “but when Chuck told me [about NF-1], I thought, ‘I don’t know what this is.’ And I can’t believe I didn’t know because it’s not that rare.” Indeed, NF-1 affects at least one in every 2,500 babies, making it more common than other better-known genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis. And that figure is probably an underestimate, because many cases don’t present with obvious symptoms. “It’s under-recognized, and kids are not getting the best care,” says Patel. She’ll often see parents whose children clearly meet all the clinical criteria for the disease, and yet hadn’t been diagnosed for over a decade. The disease has a low profile partly because its symptoms can be so disfiguring. Patients with NF-1 often “become closeted and sheltered,” says Konsitzke. “People don’t look at them or listen to them, so there’s no strong speaking voice for the disease.” The man whom Pope Francis embraced in 2013, whose face was covered in growths, had NF-1. Joseph Merrick, the so-called Elephant Man of 19th-century England, was once suspected of having had NF-1. “Our neuro-oncologist told us to take pictures of Mason now, and be prepared for his face to change,” says Konsitzke. For different reasons, NF-1 has a low profile in the scientific community, too. It’s caused by mutations in a gene called neurofibromin 1 (confusingly also shortened to NF1), which is daunting to study because of its large size and unusual variability. “People fear it in the research realm,” says Konsitzke. There are more than 4,000 variants of the gene, each of which changes the symptoms of NF-1 in subtle ways. Again, the pigs can help. Konsitzke and Shanmuganayagam aren’t just planning to develop pigs that can model the symptoms of NF-1. They want to use the revolutionary gene-editing technique known as CRISPR to create pigs that have the specific mutations of a particular individual. Each child with NF-1 would get their own personalized piglet, whose version of the NF1 gene matched their own. The piggy proxy could be monitored to see how the kid’s condition might progress, especially since they mature faster than humans do. The pigs could also be used to test possible treatments. At the moment, people with NF-1 “are their own guinea pigs,” says Konsitze. “It takes years of tests and side effects to find something that works. My son is on a cocktail of four different meds.” Having an animal that mirrors the particulars of a person’s condition might make it quicker to narrow down the best treatments. And Konsitze argues that this should save enough money to compensate for the costs of creating a customized pig. A pig undergoing surgery (Bryce Richter / University of Wisconsin-Madison) Shanmuganayagam and his colleagues started actively trying to make the gene-edited pigs in 2014, with a shoestring budget of $50,000 from the Neurofibromatosis Network, which they bolstered through their own fund-raising efforts. (Two companies also developed pig models of NF-1 around the same time: Recombinetics, based in St. Paul, Minnesota; and Exemplar Genetics, in Sioux Center, Iowa.) Jennifer Meudt, one of Shanmuganayagam’s colleagues, led the work. “Dhanu said: ‘We’re going to gene edit pigs,’” she says. “And I said: Okay, ha ha, how are we going to do this? My background is in botany.” The easy way to do it would be to buy pig eggs from slaughterhouses, fertilize them in the lab, do any necessary gene editing, and inject them back into sows. But UW’s pig-rearing facility is kept free of disease-causing microbes, so the team can’t just implant their pigs with commercially sourced embryos. Instead, they have to artificially inseminate their own sows, collect the embryos, inject them with CRISPR ingredients, and put them back into other pigs. The embryos themselves are hard to work with, because they’re not translucent like those of many other animals. “They look like little black balls, which makes it more difficult to inject when you don’t know where you’re poking,” says Meudt. There are logistical complications too. Meudt has to do the CRISPR injections in a building that’s 30 minutes from the pig facility, so the animals have to get shuttled back and forth. From start to finish, the process to make a single embryo starts at 4 in the morning, and ends at around 10 at night. “Those are well-traveled embryos,” Meudt says. The team delivered their first edited animal in November 2016, which carried a set of NF-1 mutations that had been reported in an earlier published study. They have since engineered three more animals, each with a different cluster of mutations. All of these are essentially personalized—they represent someone ’s case of NF-1, but those patients are anonymized. The next step will be to create pigs that are openly personalized to specific people—and the team is in the midst of getting approval for that. “We slowed ourselves down for some ethical reasons,” says Shanmuganayagam. For example, if a personalized pig starts to show symptoms, and their child counterpart has not, how should the team communicate that information to a family? What happens if the pig dies early? Should a family even get to know which pig is “theirs”? “We’re trying to resolve that,” says Shanmuganayagam. “We might blind ourselves to whose pig is whose with the option of revealing at a later date. I’ve also had my group read Flowers for Algernon. ”",A team of scientists wants to accelerate research into a genetic disorder by using CRISPR to copy unique mutations from affected children into pigs.,2017-12-13T11:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",Turning Piglets Into Personalized Avatars for Sick Kids,https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/12/turning-piglets-into-personalized-avatars-for-sick-kids/548204/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/12/pigs_WiscMiniature17_8809/facebook.jpg?1513117724,,Theatlantic.com,Richter,0

Colin Marshall,"Surrealism, according to this short Unlock Art video from the Tate, began in Paris, at the cafe Les Deux Magots, in 1924. You can still go there, but among its habitués you won't find the fellow on whom the camera zooms in: André Breton, author of the Surrealist Manifesto. That influential text drew inspiration from the work of Sigmund Freud, father of psychoanalysis, specifically his book The Interpretation of Dreams. ""Breton believed art and literature could represent the unconscious mind,"" says the video's narrator Peter Capaldi, well known as one of the Doctors of Doctor Who. He then names some artists who agreed with Breton on this point, such as Salvador Dalí, Max Ernst, Joan Miró, and Rene Magritte — just a few of the Surrealists. ""Surreal,"" as an adjective, has perhaps fallen victim to debasement by overuse in the past 84 years. But Breton had specific ideas about Surrealism's potential effects, its sources of power, and its methods. Desire, for instance, ""was central to the Surrealist vision of love, poetry, and liberty. It was the key to understanding human beings."" Surrealist artistic practices included putting objects ""that were not normally associated with one another together, to make something that was playful and disturbing at the same time in order to stimulate the unconscious mind."" Think of Dalí's 1936 Lobster Telephone, made out of those very objects. ""It's about food and sex,"" Capaldi pronounces. The Surrealist vision also extended to more complicated endeavors, such as elaborate paintings and films that still fascinate today. You can catch up on Surrealist film here on Open Culture, beginning with Luis Buñuel &amp; Salvador Dalí's nightmarish 1929 short Un Chien Andalou, continuing on to the Surrealist feature Dreams That Money Can Buy (a collaboration by the likes of Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp, Alexander Calder, Fernand Léger and Hans Richter), and the history of Surrealist cinema as presented by David Lynch, a filmmaker widely considered one of the movement's modern heirs. Whether Breton would recognize the Surrealist sensibility in its current manifestations will remain a matter of debate, but who could watch this Unlock Art primer and fail to sense the fascination its basic ideas — or basic compulsions, perhaps — still hold today?

Karin Matussek,"Porsche Automobil Holding SE, the controlling shareholder of Volkswagen AG, faces a new legal front in investor cases over the diesel-emissions scandal after a Stuttgart judge indicated the company may be liable for misleading investors as far back as 2010. Porsche’s 2009-10 report was probably wrong because it cited a VW document claiming its cars already complied with the strictest European emission rules for diesel engines, Judge Fabian Richter Reuschle wrote in a May ruling obtained by Bloomberg News. The judge is seeking to summon about 30 witnesses in an investor suit to find out what former VW Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn knew about the scam. The ruling extends the troubles for Porsche over the disclosure of the diesel cheating to capital markets. While there’s already a mass suit pending in a Stuttgart appeals court over claims totaling 865 million euros ($1 billion), Richter Reuschle has kept parts of some cases and continues to hear them individually. The ruling indicates investors may still be able to sue for trades as far back as November 2010. “The court has to clarify whether there are enough facts showing a reprehensible motivation by” Porsche, the judge wrote in the ruling that hasn’t yet been made public, adding he needs to examine whether VW’s “action needs to be qualified as ruthless.” The cases are baseless, Porsche spokesman Frank Gaube said by email, adding that the court didn’t rule on the merits of the claims. VW spokesman Nicolai Laude declined to comment on Richter Reuschle’s ruling. Witness Privileges While the ruling is a setback for Porsche, any suit before Richter Reuschle hinges on an issue pending with the appeals court in the mass case. The question is whether what executives learned about the scam in their role at VW can also be attributed to Porsche because the same people served at boards of both companies. Unless the appeals court says it’s possible, investors won’t be successful. Likewise, the prospects depend on what VW’s then-CEO knew at the time. Most of the witnesses listed in the ruling are either being investigated themselves, such as Winterkorn, or they work at companies being probed, like Audi chief Rupert Stadler and Robert Bosch GmbH head Volkmar Denner. They can claim privileges not to testify and most certainly will do so, making it unlikely to find the evidence the court is looking for. Richter Reuschle has issued several rulings unfavorable for Porsche and for Volkswagen, which is also being sued in Stuttgart. In turn, VW earlier this year filed a motion to remove him for bias, but the bid was rejected this week. VW filed most of its objections against the judge too late and others weren’t enough to question his fairness, the court said. The judge’s previous actions raised “considerable doubts” about whether he can handle the cases objectively and without bias, VW’s Laude said Thursday, adding that VW may appeal the ruling rejecting the bid to have him removed. The Porsche case is: LG Stuttgart, 22 O 348/16.","Porsche Automobil Holding SE, the controlling shareholder of Volkswagen AG, faces a new legal front in investor cases over the diesel-emissions scandal after a Stuttgart judge indicated the company may be liable for misleading investors as far back as 2010.",2018-06-07T16:00:00Z,"{'id': 'bloomberg', 'name': 'Bloomberg'}",Porsche Faces New Legal Front in Stuttgart Case Over Diesel,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-07/porsche-faces-new-legal-front-in-stuttgart-case-over-diesel,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iUzoJtQSkXNY/v0/1200x799.jpg,bloomberg,Bloomberg,Richter,0

Wellness enthusiasts flock to the supermarket chain for its promise of fresh, organic produce and healthier packaged food options. Others simply like to splurge on high-priced guacamole and hummus on occasion.

Cory Doctorow,"As I've written, the demise of newsmedia can't be blamed on tech -- rather, it was the combination of technology and deregulated, neoliberal capitalism, which saw media companies merged and acquired, vertically and horizontally integrated, with quality lowered, staff outsourced and assets stripped, leaving them vulnerable to technological shocks, after all their in-house experts were turned into contractors who drifted away, their physical plant sold and leased back, their war-chests drained by vulture capitalists who loaded them up with debt that acted like a millstone around their necks as they strove to maneuver their way out of their economic conundrum. It would be hard to ask for a better example of this phenomenon than Clearchannel (now called ""Iheartradio,"" though not for long). For decades, Clearchannel was the bogeyman of people who cared about media consolidation, a company that rapaciously acquired and then downgraded radio stations up and down the dial and from coast to coast. That was only possible because of loose markets and loose regulation, the seismic shift in antitrust enforcement, allowing all our media eggs to be stuck into one gigantic, unwieldy basket. Enter Bain Capital. Once Clearchannel was at its unwieldy zenith, loaded with $8B of debt from all these acquisition, Bain Capital and Thomas H Lee acquired the company with an additional $10B in debt that it dumped on its balance-sheets (paying themselves handsomely!), and then proceeded to run the company into the ground, weighing it down with another $2B worth of debt. Now Clearchannel/Iheartradio is about to die. Having been stripped of nearly all its assets, having sold off all those once-diverse, once-thriving community radio stations to yet another set of private equity vultures, they're about to join the likes of Sears, Sears Canada, Toys R Us and other former giants whose demise has been handily blamed on Big Tech, without any scrutiny given to the shadowy, banal billionaires who asset-stripped them, debt-loaded them, and ran them into the ground. Then Clear Channel, which was already burdened by $8 billion in debt before the buyout, engaged in various debt transactions that funded its own buyout and compensated the PE firms. When everything was said and done, it had $18.4 billion in debt. By April 2010, unnamed insiders disclosed to the media that the company was facing bankruptcy because it “has been unsuccessfully negotiating with some lenders to refinance its crippling debt.” This was when the PE firms got stuck in their buyout. Originally they’d wanted to sell their shares for a big profit after a few years to the unsuspecting public, but since the idea of bankruptcy had been floated, that options was off the table, as the shares had plunged. With bonds facing default, no one wants to buy the equity, which tends to get wiped out.

Kyla Mandel,"Two minor earthquakes hit the San Francisco Bay Area on Wednesday and Thursday, measuring 3.4 and 3.5 on the Richter scale respectively. While neither caused much damage, it prompts the larger question: What happens if a really big one hits while the government is shut down?
According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) shutdown contingency plan, a total of 75 employees are “excepted,” meaning they will remain on the job without pay because their work is required “for the protection of life and property.” This includes staff at the National Earthquake Information Center, where less than one-half of employees are excepted.
“Additional employees are on call as necessary to respond in the event of a natural disaster,” the contingency plan adds. There are roughly 450 employees on call in case of a natural hazard or other emergency — most of these are personnel from volcano observatories, geologic hazard science centers, and water science centers.
The California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) is currently working with USGS to develop an earthquake early warning system, including ShakeAlert, but doesn’t have a system in place yet. Los Angeles rolled out a new earthquake warning app this month, but it’s limited to residents of Los Angeles County. So, for many concerned citizens searching for information during the shutdown, little can be found beyond the basic measurements of the earthquake’s magnitude and depth.
The USGS homepage currently displays a red banner which reads: “Due to a lapse in appropriations, the majority of USGS websites may not be up to date and may not reflect current conditions. Websites displaying real-time data, such as Earthquake and Water and information needed for public health and safety will be updated with limited support. Additionally, USGS will not be able to respond to inquiries until appropriations are enacted.”
Searching for more information on the Department of Homeland Security’s earthquake emergency website yields the same result. A red banner at the top simply states that “Due to the lapse in federal funding, this website will not be actively managed.”
Phone calls and emails to USGS staff and media contacts went largely unanswered Thursday, with the requisite automatic reply stating: “Due to the lapse in appropriations, I am prohibited from conducting work as a Federal employee, including returning phone calls and emails, until further notice.”
The USGS Earthquake Science Center in Menlo Park — located an hour south of where this week’s earthquakes hit — also appears to be closed. According to KPIX CBS San Francisco Bay Area, a seismologist is “almost always available to discuss the seismic event.” But this week, calls and emails have gone unanswered.
Per the contingency plan, the USGS National Earthquake Information Center in Colorado, however, remains open and is answering calls. “I guess we’re just functioning as we normally would here,” a seismologist told ThinkProgress. “We’re still updating, providing information… and of course, we’re not getting paid.”
They explained that earthquake information will still be updated on the USGS website, and that during major events — such as a deadly earthquake — automatic notifications are sent to “important people” to ensure they’re notified and response efforts are coordinated. The two earthquakes in the Bay Area this week, however, were not major events.
When pressed for more details, the seismologist simply said, “we’re not being told a whole lot here.”
Emergency response efforts typically involve multiple arms of government. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) earthquake preparedness guide, while there is no advance notice given for an earthquake, “emergency information will be provided immediately after through radio and TV broadcasts and via Wireless Emergency Alerts text to cell phones.”
The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also broadcasts radio alerts for all hazards to the National Weather Service.
FEMA’s website, however, is not being actively managed during the shutdown. NOAA websites and social media channels “necessary to protect lives and property” are being maintained.
Outside of the federal government, there are additional experts responsible for helping with the initial data tracking for earthquakes during a shutdown. The UC Berkeley Seismology Lab has a standing agreement with the federal government that it will conduct the initial review of any earthquake that happens.
As Peggy Hellweg, operations manager for the siesmology lab, explained to ThinkProgress, under normal circumstances UC Berkeley and USGS Menlo Park collaborate to monitor earthquakes in the northern California region. “At any given time, each of us has a complete view of what’s going on,” Hellweg said.
Each office has an earthquake information computer system which gathers data that is shared with the other, and they take turns being the “master,” or the lead system. This allows the other computer system to undergo upgrades as needed, for example. During the shutdown, with Menlo Park closed, UC Berkeley is the master computer system (data is still being automatically collected at Menlo Park). UC Berkeley is therefore responsible for verifying the data and confirming the earthquake.
Meanwhile, the Colorado-based National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) monitors things to ensure no big earthquake goes unnoticed, and that the public website remains up to date. Should a big earthquake happen in northern California, UC Berkeley would coordinate response efforts with NEIC.
The USGS’s Earth Resources Observation and Science Center (EROS), another department in which staff are excepted, is also collecting data. For earthquakes, this includes the magnitude and depth, as well as details such as which tectonic plates were involved and the type of motion. According to the contingency plan, the center is operating at the “minimal necessary contingent to ensure 24-7 Mission Operation Center coverage to sustain computer support, antenna operations, and command and control of the LandSat satellites.”
This will allow the collection and storage of data to continue so that when the government reopens, or in the event of an emergency such as an earthquake, flood, fire, or landslide, the data can be processed and analyzed.
But for now, said Hellweg, the data for all earthquakes that have occurred since the shutdown began on December 22 is not being re-evaluated and improved — typically there are multiple stages of analyzing to ensure location data, for instance, is as precise as possible.
Now in it’s 27th day, the partial government shutdown is the longest in U.S. history. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees continue to go without pay, and the longer the shutdown drags on, the more challenging it becomes to maintain essential services.
And for Hellweg and her team at UC Berkeley, concerns over funding are mounting. Their work is funded in part by USGS on an annual basis, which restarts on February 1. Usually by now Hellweg knows whether they received all their requested funding or if their budget proposal to USGS for the new year needs to be revised.
“All of these people pushing the paperwork are also furloughed,” she said, “and it’s not clear to me that there will be time between whenever the government returns and February 1st to get the paperwork in place [for that start date].”
This means that if their budget isn’t confirmed soon, come February 1, they will need to find an alternative plan. “We are not allowed to bill the USGS for work that we have done in an interval when they have not authorized for spending the money,” Hellweg said. “If they finally come back on February 1st and it takes them until March 1st to get the money in place for us, then we have to find other ways to pay everybody between February through March 1st.”
Hellweg hopes that perhaps she can reshuffle funds to cover the cost of their earthquake monitoring if this happens, adding, “our intention is to continue to monitor.”
“But we also hope that the USGS will come back before [this happens],” she said, “their pockets are way bigger than our pockets.”","Two minor earthquakes hit the San Francisco Bay Area on Wednesday and Thursday, measuring 3.4 and 3.5 on the Richter scale respectively.

ANJALI MARAR,"Written by ANJALI MARAR | Pune | Published: November 23, 2017 8:54 am Six decades ago, a powerful earthquake had struck the area near this reservoir in Koyna. Scientists studying the seismic activity triggered at the Koyna-Warna reservoirs — located near Karad, 165 km from Pune — have observed that the epicentre of earthquakes recorded in the recent decades are shifting towards the southern direction, and are concentrated around the Warna reservoir. Six decades ago, a powerful earthquake measuring 6.6 on the Richter Scale had struck the area near the Koyna reservoir, causing massive damage in the locality. Apart from Koyna reservoir, there are only three other seismically-active reservoirs in the world — located in China, Zimbabwe and Greece — which have recorded earthquakes stronger than 5 on the Richter Scale. This dam, according to geologists and seismologists, is one of the 120 reservoirs in the world which are seismically active. Experts, after analysing data sets collected since 1967, found that the seismic activity peaked in this region during the monsoon. This is believed to be triggered by a sudden rise in the water level at the reservoir. Two earthquake data sets — from 1970 to 1990, and from 2003 to 2010, were used to conclude that higher the levels of water stored, higher the seismic activity, making it crucial for dam operators to store and release water appropriately. “But, in the recent decades, we have also found that most earthquakes, with an epicentre located at a depth ranging between 2-8 km, have been shifting away from Koyna reservoir, towards Warna reservoir. This could be due to shifting of the faultline in that direction,” said Dr Nitin Karmalkar, Vice-Chancellor of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and a senior geologist associated with the central government’s Borehole Drilling Project at the Koyna-Warna reservoirs. Karmalkar made the comments at a public talk organised by the India Meteorological Society, Pune chapter, recently. The team has been drilling at the site in order to identify the exact fault which is triggering frequent earthquakes in the region, though a majority of them have been within an intensity of 5 on the Richter Scale. However, the challenges involved are many, as the reservoir is built on hard basaltic rock. Despite this, the team, along with ONGC, has been carrying out drilling, and has so far managed to drill 14 boreholes, their depths ranging between 900 metres to 1.9 km, said Karmalkar. The team plans to drill to a maximum depth of 8.5 km in the coming years. “Our further course of exploration remains in identifying the direction in which the faultline is shifting, its dimensions in terms of length and breadth, and slippage movements between the faultlines. The idea is to identify the right spot to puncture the fault, where sensitive instruments can be installed, which can then be used to issue futuristic earthquake warnings systems,” explained Karmalkar. Yet another interesting fact about the Koyna – Warna reservoirs is that geologists believe that only 50 per cent of the residual stress or energy has been released in the form of earthquakes so far. “This means earthquakes up to an intensity of 5 would continue to take place at this location. And the real test for our team lies in actually tracing the exact spot where the fault is triggering shocks,” said Karmalkar.

Kate Gray,"You know what really turns me on? Microtransactions. I know I’m not alone. There must be dozens out there for whom the mere thought of blowing $9 on a virtual hat gets us dripping below the waist. Oh yeah, we say. Charge it right to my card, you saucy minx. Give me those abstracted gem-based currencies with which I may buy ways to make this game slightly easier. NSFW Warning: This post contains NSFW imagery. If any of that resonates with you, perhaps you’d like to check out Pocket Waifu, available for free on Nutaku. The game takes the dating sim concept of putting Kindness Coins into a woman until ice-cold cans of Sex come out the bottom, and shamelessly reduces it into a Tamagotchi-style girl-babysitting experience in which your— sigh —”waifu” requires sleep, snacks, showers, and video games to fall in love with you. You can also spend real world money on gifts, toys, furniture and outfits for your collection of waifus. On top of all that, you’ve been cursed by a nude demon woman (with a painful-looking clitoral hood piercing) who takes your soul in exchange for the power to... make women come over to your house? Unwillingly? It’s not entirely clear. Pocket Waifu is a massive ball of contradictions and nonsense. It’s clearly shameless enough to not care that it’s portraying women as helpless babes who are unable to shower themselves without your help, or to get food out of the fridge without posing like a porn star. And yet, from time to time, the aforementioned nude demon berates you for thinking that women are mere vending machines for sex. Shortly after saying this, I managed to poke a woman into showing me her labia. And I literally mean “poke,” here: the word “poke” comes up every time you click her, and her ample bosom (because it’s never not ample) bounces like a 7.5 on the Richter scale. I don’t want to seem prudish—I’m completely down with sex games being contrived and silly. Just as it’s completely fine to have lashings of poetic license in things like Twilight —”I love you because I’m a vampire and your blood smells delicious ”—I don’t particularly care if sex games need to tell me that women are only swarming around me because I’m cursed. Sure, I can get down with that. But to tell me that this game isn’t about kindness coins? I can literally buy an item called “Lust Dust,” or spend Gacha tickets on gifts that I can give to various women to make me like them more. There’s even a meter at the top that tells me how much they like me. Just be honest in your grubbiness. It’s not like I can judge, anyway—anyone who clicks on “Pocket Waifu” is probably not in any position to judge. Perhaps I’m blaming Pocket Waifu for the failings of sex games in general, but I’m finding it difficult to discover many sex games that don’t have a base level of disrespect for both their players, and the games themselves. It’s honestly fine if you enjoy grubby sex games. Everyone has their personal preferences, and as long as no one’s getting hurt, feel free to get your rocks off however you like. But when almost all sex games feature the exact same level of grubbiness, the exact same skinny-but-big-boobed women, and the exact same treatment of women as hopeless, shy creatures that nevertheless whap their baps out at the slightest provocation, I have to ask: is this really what the majority of people are into? Or is it just that it’s the only thing available, and therefore ends up shaping the fetishes of those who play games like this? I can see the argument that sex games don’t need to be a higher form of art, or to have greater respect for themselves. As long as they have the required effect of getting people off, who cares? But why shouldn’t we hold these games to a higher standard? Sex is something that a majority of the population does, or at least thinks about, and there should be more options, in the same way that you can buy furniture from IKEA, or you can buy a one-of-a-kind hand-crafted dining table made from rainforest hardwood. IKEA is great, but sometimes, don’t you want something a little… special? Or even something in a comfortable middle zone, between completely basic and totally unique? Pocket Waifu, I apologise for making you the target of this rant. You’ve not really done anything wrong, apart from being pretty tacky. But having played so many sex games that seem like repackaged versions of the same damn thing—virginal women with sizeable racks and a penchant for blushing all the damn time—I want more. I want to see artisan sex games. I want an industry that respects its consumers enough to give them something more substantial. I want the developers to realise that there is next to no market for anyone who’s into men, or even just smaller-boobed women, but that’s an argument for another day. If we can accept women as more complex beings than Pocket Waifu offers, which I hope we can, then perhaps we can accept men as more complex beings than Pocket Waifu caters to.",You know what really turns me on?

Cory Doctorow,"The subprime car-lending industry -- charging exorbitant rates for car-loans to people least suited to afford them, enforced through orwellian technologies, obscuring the risk by spinning the debt into high-risk/high-yield bonds -- is collapsing. The three most prominent lenders in the subprime auto sector shut down spectacularly and suddenly through bankruptcies and fraud investigations (and the bankrupt ones are said to have been fraudulent!). Meanwhile, the borrowers -- lent money that everyone understood they couldn't afford, backed by assets that depreciated by 50% the day they were acquired -- are defaulting and missing payments like crazy, at a rate that puts the subprime housing bubble in the shade. The subprime lenders got their capital from big banks and private equity firms, who are left holding the bag when the subprimes disappear into bankruptcy. This is one of the credit bubbles whose bursting the Wall Street Journal predicted, and while its absolute magnitude is smaller than the subprime housing bubble, and while cars are more liquid (and thus easier for creditors to sell and get some cash out of), it will have knock-on effects for car-makers, dealers, and the banks and PE firms most exposed to the sector -- to say nothing of the borrowers who depended on the subprime sector for work-related transport in a nation where underinvestment in public transit has turned the carless into economic roadkill. Summit Financial Corp, a privately owned company that works with auto dealers in Florida, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 23, after it “performed an extensive analysis of alternatives,” its attorney said in a statement. Summit blamed Hurricane Irma. But Bank of America – which, as Summit’s largest secured creditor, is owed $77 million – alleged in the bankruptcy documents that Summit had repossessed many cars without writing down the bad loans, thus under-reporting the losses. “The move allowed the company to hide operating losses and borrow more money to fund loans, the bank said,” according Bloomberg. Spring Tree Lending, an Atlanta-based specialized subprime auto lender, is being pushed into bankruptcy by a creditor who filed to force the company into involuntary bankruptcy on March 28. Fraud allegations are swirling. Pelican Auto Finance, which specialized in “deep subprime” auto loans shut down last month, after private equity firm Flexpoint Ford LLC, decided to cease funding it. “There’s been intense competition. The margins just aren’t there,” Pelican CEO Troy Cavallaro told Bloomberg. Other PE firms that have together plowed about $3 billion into the subprime auto loan bonanza, based on data cited by Bloomberg, are now licking their wounds, unable to get out.

ADAM BAIDAWI,"Allegations later surfaced that the cardinal himself had been involved with abuse decades ago. Pope Francis granted Cardinal Pell a leave of absence to contest the charges, which the cardinal has vehemently denied. Fiery exchanges during witness testimony this week typified the tone of the hearing, and they have shed light on the seriousness of the yet-to-be-detailed charges. On Wednesday, Ms. Wallington asked the cardinal’s attorney Robert Richter to stop shouting at her before she denied his request that she recuse herself from hearing the case. The hearings have been punctuated by similarly heated exchanges, many of which have involved Mr. Richter, a lawyer known for a confrontational style of cross-examination and for commanding a five-figure daily fee. Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Richter told the court that the task force set up to investigate potential offenses by the cardinal was an “operation looking for a crime.” He suggested that the police may have avoided specific lines of questioning while collecting evidence and statements that led to the charges against the cardinal. “It would be horrible if an investigator decided not to pursue an obvious line of questioning just because he was afraid that the answers might destroy his case,” Mr. Richter said to Superintendent Paul Sheridan, the detective who led the investigation into the cardinal for the last two years. “I would agree with that,” replied Mr. Sheridan, who stood for the entirety of his cross-examination, angling his body and eyes away from Mr. Richter. At several points, Mr. Richter mentioned that he and Mr. Sheridan had known each other for a long time. Photo Cardinal Pell’s attorney Robert Richter, who is known for his confrontational style of cross-examination, outside the court in Melbourne this week. Credit Luis Ascui/EPA, via Shutterstock During several hours of testimony, Mr. Richter pressed Mr. Sheridan on apparent inconsistencies in his testimony, at one point suggesting that the cardinal’s robes were made in such a way that events alleged to have taken place at a Melbourne cathedral could not have happened. He also argued that “acts of appalling seriousness” alleged to have occurred on a mountaintop, on an altar and at a 1978 screening of “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” could not have happened, citing inconsistencies in the accuser’s timeline. It was on this point that Ms. Wallington questioned Mr. Richter’s own proposed timeline, leading him to further argue his case with her. “Please don’t shout at me, Mr. Richter,” Ms. Wallington said softly. It was then that Mr. Richter asked the magistrate to “disqualify herself from further hearing this matter, on the basis of a biased view of the evidence.” “Your application is refused,” replied Ms. Wallington. On Tuesday, Mr. Richter accused the journalist Louise Milligan of omitting key reporting in a television report on the accusations and a book she published last year, “Cardinal: The Rise and Fall of George Pell.” The court had previously heard that statements some complainants gave to the police differed somewhat from those given to Ms. Milligan during her reporting. As is common in such cases, her book was removed from bookstores in the state of Victoria, where the trial is taking place. “She distorted what went to the public,” Mr. Richter said of Ms. Milligan’s coverage. “I would put to her that she distorted it even more in her book, so as to poison the public’s mind against Cardinal Pell,” he added. “I completely and utterly reject that,” Ms. Milligan said. “Of course you would,” said Mr. Richter. Ms. Milligan later pushed back on Mr. Richter’s characterizations of some accusers, saying that abuse victims were unfairly “torn apart by people like you” in courts. Mr. Richter later described some of Ms. Milligan’s documented exchanges with her sources as “charming, if not flirtatious,” which she dismissed as insulting. “I think that is an absolutely sexist assertion,” she said. Should the cardinal’s case go to trial, it is unclear how soon there would be a resolution. A pretrial hearing would be held to determine what evidence could be used during the trial, and another hearing would be held to determine a timeline for the proceedings. “It’s hard to predict how long it will be — it depends on the law calendars,” said Mark Nolan, a professor of criminal law at the Australian National University. If the magistrate rules that there is insufficient evidence to send the case to trial, Victoria’s director of public prosecutions can still decide to try Cardinal Pell.

Cory Doctorow,"In Goldman Sachs's April 10 report, ""The Genome Revolution,"" its analysts ponder the rise of biotech companies who believe they will develop ""one-shot"" cures for chronic illnesses; in a moment of rare public frankness, the report's authors ask, ""Is curing patients a sustainable business model?"" The authors were apparently spooked by the tale of Gilead Sciences, who developed a Hepatitis C therapy that is more than 90% effective, making $12.5B in 2015 -- the year of the therapy's release -- a number that fell to $4B this year. The analysts are making a commonsense observation: capitalism is incompatible with human flourishing. Markets will not, on their own, fund profoundly effective cures for diseases that destroy our lives and families. This is a very strong argument for heavily taxing the profits of pharma companies' investors and other one percenters, and then turning the money over to publicly funded scientific research that eschews all patents, and which is made available for free under the terms of the Access To Medicines treaty, whereby any country that devotes a set fraction of its GDP to pharma research gets free access to the fruits of all the other national signatories. Humans have shared microbial destiny. If there's one thing that challenges the extreme libertarian conception of owing nothing to your neighbor save the equilibrium established by your mutual selfishness, it's epidemiology. Your right to swing your fist ends where it connects with my nose; your right to create or sustain reservoirs of pathogens that will likely kill some or all of your neighbors is likewise subject to their willingness to tolerate your recklessness. Goldman Sachs's analysts suggest three ""cures"" for the problem of one-shot cures; and taxing the rich to fund socialized pharma research isn't among them; rather, they propose eschewing rare diseases, to ensure that the pool of patients is large enough to produce a return on their investment, or developing one-shot cures fast enough to ""offset the declining revenue trajectory of prior assets."" ""The potential to deliver 'one shot cures' is one of the most attractive aspects of gene therapy, genetically-engineered cell therapy and gene editing. However, such treatments offer a very different outlook with regard to recurring revenue versus chronic therapies,"" analyst Salveen Richter wrote in the note to clients Tuesday.

Cory Doctorow,"Normally, economic expansion is driven by more spending by the wealthy, and you'd think that 2018 America, where the wealthy are wealthier than they've ever been, would be dependent on the few people with ready cash as engines of economic growth. But it turns out that nearly all of the economic growth in today's economy has been driven by subprime borrowing by the poorest 60% of Americans, who have zeroed out their savings and then gone into heavy debt to get university degrees, start ""businesses"" (often by leasing a car to drive for a rideshare company or trying in some desperate way to get a toehold on the ladder), and maxing out credit cards. It's like a rerun of the 2008 crisis in more ways that one. The loans that enabled this debt-fueled growth have low teaser rates that are starting to expire, with new, much higher interest rates about to kick in. When that happens, expect waves of defaults. The Reuters piece, by Jonathan Spicer, also argues that the sell-by date of this unsustainable subprime-debt-fuelled growth may have been postponed by the Trump tax cuts. If anything, the picture may be even worse than that view suggests, since some experts, as well as our own readers, have said in some, perhaps many cases, the cuts in income tax withholding looked high relative to the taxes that would be due for 2018. In other words, more taxpayers than in the past may find themselves hit with unexpected tax bills come April. Independent of whether bigger debt millstones around the necks of subprime borrowers are a harbinger of a slowdown, high levels of personal debt are a negative for growth. Personal borrowings are almost never productive. Even the often-hyped examples of borrowing for education or borrowing to start a business are overhyped. With higher eduction overpriced and the punishment for missing a payment draconian, the merits are at best debatable, and that’s before you factor in the risk of graduating during a recession or crisis.

matthewgrobar,"In Josie Rourke ’s historical drama Mary Queen of Scots, composer Max Richter found a fresh, contemporary take on a familiar story. Centered on Queen Elizabeth I and her cousin Mary Stuart, who aggressively pursued her seat of power, the drama called for a score that was as unexpected and alive as its central characters, casting off the sonic preconceptions associated with the conventional period piece. Like Yorgos Lanthimos’ radically unorthodox The Favourite —which examined Queen Anne and her fleeting affections—Rourke’s film strongly juxtaposed the worlds of men and women, finding the latter party in power, even as their counterparts pursued every opportunity to take them down. While Mary Queen of Scots features scenes on the battlefield, neither of these films placed its focus in that realm—and while Richter offered up some heavy orchestral music and war drums for these moments, his real interest was in a different spectrum of musical colors, which were far more lyrical and lush. Putting women at the center of his score—as Rourke had put women at the center of her film—Richter came to a delightful creative epiphany, as he looked for a sound for Mary Queen of Scots, herself. How did you come to Mary Queen of Scots, and why was this a film you had to take on? A lot of different things came together. Obviously, the story is well known. We all think we know the dynamics and the story between Elizabeth and Mary, but this was a new take on it. It puts the women very much into the center of the thing, in opposition to the world of men that they inhabited. It makes their relationship feel different, and it casts that in a new light. I was really interested in working with Josie Rourke, who is a fantastic theater director. This was her first film project, and it’s always exciting to be in the beginning of somebody’s journey. Reading scripts as a composer, what are you looking for? It’s usually a lot of dimensions coming together. For me, one of the big things with Mary Queen of Scots was that it’s a period film, and it’s 16th century. That immediately chimed in with some of my own musical interests; I’m very involved with Renaissance music. Some of my favorite listening music comes from that time, so that was quite exciting, to think about trying to develop a musical language, which could be dramatic and contemporary, but at the same time had a shared DNA with the music of that period. That technical challenge was exciting. There was something quite inviting about that. In early conversations with Josie, what was discussed? Josie was brilliant in that she gave me completely free rein to imagine a musical universe for the story. Obviously it’s a period film, and there was going to be historical music as well. There are various formal entertainments and those kinds of things, where we felt it obviously needed to have actual period music in it, which we sourced. But beyond that, she was completely open for me to bring my vision into the thing. I made sketches, we tried a few things out, and honestly, it all came together quite easily. There’s a certain balance you strike here between the expected colors of war—of the world of men—and a more light and lyrical sound. How did you conceive of this story’s emotional core? There’s a few colors that I was playing with in navigating the story. The first thing is that I wanted to have these quite abstract women’s voices—there’s no text, but there are these sustained tones, and they provide a psychological context, I think. It’s a female-driven piece of storytelling. It’s kind of a love story; it’s multiple love stories, really. It’s the two of them navigating their relationship, and they also have love relationships with other people, and it’s about how that plays out against the historical backdrop. I wanted women’s voices really at the center of the score, and that’s why the work is lyrical. Then obviously, there is the world of men, and the world of men in this film is generally associated with brutality of various kinds. There are lots of quite heavy drones, and a lot of heavy orchestral music, with low-register instruments, bass instruments as pulsation. Then you’ve got war drums, evoking this idea of the drums being used to propel the various combatants in these various battles and skirmishes. But also, ultimately propelling Mary to her execution. It’s the executioner’s drum. That’s the psychological dynamic of the various colors of the score. What part did the harp play in your musical palette? The harp works, in a way, as a domestic storytelling color. There are many scenes where somebody’s talking in a room, and I wanted something which felt a bit lighter and more domestic, more everyday for that material. So the harp is playing, and it also connects to the Gaelic harp at one point; you have this classical harp, and then you have the Gaelic harp. One of the main, big themes is played quite often by a cor anglais. I wanted to use that because it does have a reedy, almost Renaissance-y color, this modern cor anglais. It’s like a big oboe, but I also wanted to use it because of its name, actually. Because in a way, it’s a little Easter egg: Mary was [raised] in France, and then came to Britain. I liked the idea of having this instrument with a French name, playing her melody. It’s Mary’s voice, really. The instrument was perfect for that story. Were there other ways in which the film’s 16 th century setting manifested in your work? There’s a lot of choral music in the score, and there are these wordless female drones, but then there’s also more written-out choral music, and that uses the language of 16th century Elizabethan, polyphonic choral music. It uses that grammar, so it’s written in that style, and it feels in some ways embedded in that period. Apart from that, a lot of the orchestral music is built around these repeating bass phrases, and again, that’s very Elizabethan. At that time it was called a “Ground bass”; now, there’s usually a loop. But it’s this idea of a repeating bass line, and a lot of the music is built around that. So, there are technical little procedures, which I’ve pulled out of Renaissance music, and I’ve just imported them into the score. What was your process in finding recurring melodic lines that felt right? Honestly, I write them down on a piece of paper. [Laughs] That’s the starting point: I sit at the piano, and I just find things, and play things, and slowly, the thing takes shape. Once I have the bare bones of it, then for Josie or anyone I’m working with, they need to be able to hear it in its orchestral presentation. Then I’ll move over to the computer, and use the softwares and everything there. But it really starts with notes on a piece of paper. When you set out to record your music, do you prefer to have a full orchestra in the room, or take your instrumental sections one at a time? I tend to record in sections. We’ll build it up in layers, and as we go, we remove the sampled layers until in the end, we’ve got all real stuff. The choir was all recorded completely separately in different days, different sessions. Then we built up from the strings, and did a bunch of string sessions, and a bunch of brass and woodwind and percussion sessions, all separately. Then we assemble it all. So, we’re recording basically in stems, and that allows a lot of flexibility in terms of how the music is presented. One of the film’s memorable scenes was set at a wedding, with a crowd of people marching back and forth in time to your score. How was that moment approached? That came very early on from Josie and Wayne [McGregor], a choreographer who is responsible for all the movement. Josie and Wayne came up with this idea that they wanted to make the wedding as this ritual, so there would be the wedding itself, and there would be this formal dance, which is a bit spooky. Then they would intercut that with the drama taking place between Mary and her new husband, and various darker, more threatening bits of material. The idea was to tie all of this together with a pulse that would then be picked up within the music in the scene; there’re bits of light music in the scene being played. And also, of course, that gave me the engine for the score, that pulse. We picked a tempo, and that seemed to have worked for that plan. Then that was all choreographed and made, and once they got some way along in their process, I started to score it. All these elements pulled together, and I think it works really effectively, all these things all locked in that grid. Were there other major hurdles you confronted with Mary Queen of Scots ? There were just a couple of things. The first is that there are battles, and we wanted to try to avoid just massive percussion going off during the battle. We wanted to try to do that in a different way. There’s quite an extended battle sequence, where it actually plays very much against that traditional battle music. I feel like it works in an interesting way. Then, the other thing was the whole last section, which is a very long piece of music, around nine or 10 minutes. It took a bit of time to get the architecture working exactly as we wanted it. Having created so much compelling music to date, presented in various ways, what are you thinking about, career-wise, as you look to the future? I’m always looking for the next surprise, really. Obviously I’ve always got plans for my own next project, what I might want to do next, in terms of record releases. In a way, that’s something that I can control, but there’s always that out-of-the-blue phone call, where you’re just thinking, “Yeah, that sounds good.” Film is a bit like that; you get the call, and it just sounds fantastic. A bit like this call, you just think, “I should be doing that.”","In Josie Rourke ’s historical drama Mary Queen of Scots, composer Max Richter found a fresh, contemporary take on a familiar story.

Valerio Farris,"I mean, it’s only a matter of time before robots overtake us. And we’re approaching the singularity at neck-breaking speeds. Just last week a robot was hired to flip burgers and then it was fired for being too good at its job! If that’s not a narrative arc dripping with humanity, then I don’t know what is. We’ve invited robots to take care of so many of our daily tasks, it only makes sense that we invite them into the kitchen, too, right? Uhhh, I don’t know. Robots doing human tasks actually kind of scares me. Call me old-fashioned, call me fearful, call me stuck in the past. Whatever, I’ll shrug my shoulders. The robot takeover is not something I will ever warm up to. But every once in a while, a robot comes along that reminds us just how special we humans are, how perfectly inimitable our actions can be. This matcha-making robot is one such example. The video first appeared on Twitter and stars a three-pronged machine making a cup of matcha tea. Its movements are a bit clunky and stop-and-go, but it’s able to fill a bowl with water and matcha powder. Then, the bamboo whisk lowers itself into the bowl of water and powder. What happens next you should see for yourself: Wow, mixed enough for ya? The whisk shakes so vigorously that the whole machine shoots off the Richter scale—it’s a vibration of seismic proportions. When I first watched this video, I grabbed my seat to make sure I, too, wasn’t violently convulsing. After the whisk goes to town, it kind of just slowly retracts from the bowl as if expecting some words of praise or a conciliatory gold star. The camera zooms on the freshly rattled bowl of matcha. To no one’s surprise, it looks whisked. Like beyond a shadow of a doubt. In theory, the machine does its job. It produces a cup of ready-to-drink matcha from raw ingredients. But it’s the process that has me tripped up. I’d much rather put in the extra time to whisk my own matcha than have some machine aggressively vibrate in front of me. But maybe that’s just me. The future of this mysterious machine has yet to be specified. Some tweets hinted that this is a prototype and its makers are collecting critiques and working on a redesign. Hopefully the second version is a bit chiller. Where do you stand on robots in the kitchen? Tell us your thoughts in the comments below.

Kristopher Tapley,"One of the most unexpected Oscar nominations this year came for a German film in the thick of the foreign-language race that managed to score love elsewhere: Caleb Deschanel’s cinematography notice for Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s “Never Look Away,” a three-hour epic inspired by the life of artist Gerhard Richter.
For Deschanel, a beloved industry veteran with six nominations dating back to 1983’s “The Right Stuff,” it was as much a shock to him as it was to the awards season chattering class.
“You sort of figure, ‘No chance; not enough people have seen the movie,'” Deschanel says, calling from London where he’s in the middle of production on Jon Favreau’s effects-driven remake of “The Lion King,” due out in July. “But I had so many calls from people who loved this movie.”
It’s easy to see why Deschanel’s colleagues in the cinematography branch, over which he has presided as a governor in the past, would be drawn to the work. The lighting is gorgeous, the German locations add to the rich imagery, and with a focus on the development of painter Kurt Barnert (the character based on Richter), played by Tom Schilling, the photography is accented all the more.
Incidentally, Deschanel and von Donnersmarck had hoped to shoot the project on film. The labs in Berlin and Munich had already shuttered, however, and the closest facility was in Vienna. After they shot a handful of tests, that facility closed as well. “They said don’t bother, we just went out of business,” Deschanel says. “The loss of film is like the loss of a friend to me.”
“Never Look Away” wasn’t Deschanel’s first experience with shooting a foreign-language production. Oddly enough, his most recent previous Oscar nomination came for Mel Gibson’s 2004 opus “The Passion of the Christ,” which featured dialogue in Latin, Aramaic and Hebrew. But for Deschanel, shooting a film that’s not in English is still unusual — and the DP feels it allows him to be more intuitive in his work.
“When you don’t speak a language, you end up really looking carefully at people,” he says. “It’s kind of what we do as filmmakers. We’re judging people’s faces and reading what they’re telegraphing.”
The 74-year-old lenser did not have filmmaking in his sights to start. He attended Johns Hopkins University where he met film editor Walter Murch and screenwriter Matthew Robbins, who convinced him to get into the business.
“I just came out to L.A. and went, ‘What a nice goof, to make movies for a while and see how it goes,'” he recalls. “And here I am, 50 years later.”
Early on he was tipped for possible Oscar recognition for Carroll Ballard’s 1979 film “The Black Stallion.” A nomination didn’t materialize, but he finally got the call with Philip Kaufman’s “The Right Stuff” four years later. The circuit was much different then, of course, than it is now.
“My wife and I were in Rome and we got a call from a friend of hers, an agent who had found out about it,” Deschanel recalls. “Being young, you don’t realize how profoundly important it is [to get a nomination].”
Buzz around his work carried through to another nomination the very next year, for Barry Levinson’s baseball drama “The Natural,” with Robert Redford. Based on the Bernard Malamud novel, it was a tale with qualities of magical realism, something Deschanel has found to be a constant in the projects that attract him.
“It’s one of these stories where you incrementally carry the audience along to the point that when he hits the ball into the lights and they explode, your brain has been so distorted by the mythology that you totally believe this is happening.”
“You sort of figure, ‘No chance; not enough people have seen the movie.'”Caleb Deschanel
Deschanel teamed with Ballard again on 1996’s “Fly Away Home,” a dramatization of Bill Lishman’s work with aircraft-led migration of birds that brought him his third nomination. It was a tech-heavy production that yielded awe-inspiring footage of a small aircraft leading a gaggle of Canadian Geese over striking landscapes. “It was about figuring out ways that you could make this real,” Deschanel says. “We used a lot of different techniques.” That was a special nomination, too, because he was able to bring his daughters, Emily and Zooey, to the Oscars that year.
Four years later, Deschanel met Gibson on “The Patriot,” a Revolutionary War drama directed by Roland Emmerich.
“I loved those big canvases and the scope of that,” Deschanel says. “To me, that movie was about this intimate story that opens up into a battle for the whole country. It was, ‘How do you stand up against something that is so big and powerful and well-trained when you are not?'”
Having been brought up a Quaker, Deschanel says he wasn’t fully attuned to the Stations of the Cross story told in “The Passion of the Christ.” But again, owing to his attraction to the mythological, he was taken by the archetypal story of a character taking on the sins of humanity.
“We were in Southern Italy, and every weekend I walked to tens of churches and would go inside, and after a while, I realized every church had the storyboard for this movie in it,” he says. He and Gibson were largely inspired by Caravaggio paintings in developing the look for the film.
And now, “Never Look Away.” Deschanel might be a long shot to finally bring home the gold, but the real victory is shining a brighter light on the film.
“What’s great is that I never expected it,” he says. “A lot of it’s luck.”","One of the most unexpected Oscar nominations this year came for a German film in the thick of the foreign-language race that managed to score love elsewhere: Caleb Deschanel’s cinematography notice for Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s “Never Look Away,” a t…",2019-01-29T21:45:13Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Variety.com'}",Oscar-Nominated ‘Never Look Away’ DP Caleb Deschanel Never Saw It Coming,https://variety.com/2019/film/in-contention/oscar-nominated-never-look-away-dp-caleb-deschanel-never-saw-it-coming-1203118850/,https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/calebdeschanel.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1,,Variety.com,Richter,0
Chris Reed,"Nintendo released a Nintendo Direct presentation that focused on the upcoming Switch game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Among many other pieces of news, the company announced that Donkey Kong Country villain King K. Rool will be a playable character in the game--the croc's first appearance in the series. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is set to land on Nintendo Switch on December 7. In addition to many other characters announced in the Nintendo Direct, it will also feature every character who's ever appeared in the entire series, giving it by far the biggest roster of any Smash Bros. game in history. King K. Rool made his first appearance in the 1994 Super Nintendo game Donkey Kong Country. He is the leader of a gang of crocodilian enemies known as Kremlings, and one of his eyes is veiny and bulging. He's a fairly goofy villain, using tactics like pretending to be defeated to get a leg up on the Kong crew. In Ultimate, he'll be able to throw his boomerang-like crown at opponents and use a blunderbuss that can fire cannonballs. Other new characters appearing for the first time in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate include Castlevania's Simon Belmont and Richter, who will be Simon's echo, meaning he'll control similar to Simon. Also announced was Dark Samus, an echo character for Samus who first appeared in the Metroid Prime series.","Nintendo released a Nintendo Direct presentation that focused on the upcoming Switch game Super Smash Bros.

Chris Carter,"WAHHHHHH [ Update: Now you can compare Richter directly to Simon below.] WAHHHHHHHHHHH Wario is in the house with a brand new 3DS game, and now Nintendo is showcasing his personal stylings with an updated Super Smash Bros. Ultimate clip. Samus, who just hosted her first major game last year after a seven year hiatus (and will be a part of the upcoming Metroid Prime 4 ), is also present and accounted for. In case you were curious as to whether or not Ultimate changes anything: Wario seems to be mostly the same mechanically, but will sport more Wario Land references. Samus is now faster overall and has more control over her abilities, including her charge shot. I only dabbled with the former but have been known to use Samus occasionally since Smash 64, so these changes are quite welcome. Super Smash Bros.
