Josh Ocampo,"Whats the worst part of social media? Seeing friends on tropical vacations, baking under the sun, while youre seated in a cubicle seething under harsh fluorescent lighting.
If youre in need of a vacation (and a warmer climate), JetBlue is now rewarding the selected few for committing to a digital detoxwith a year of free flights.
Whether you travel once per year or every month, theres value to joining an airlines frequent
Read more Read
Yes, its true. JetBlue, the airline with Terra blue chips, is offering three lucky entrants (and a companion for each) a year of flights, with one conspicuous rule: you must rid yourself of Instagrams past.
Why? Likely, its because you will become a year-long influencer/advertisement for the airline. But lets be honest, if there was a price for anyones integrity, itd likely be a year of free flights.
There are a couple of catches, however. As the Points Guy noted, youll still have to pay for those pesky bag fees and taxes. Youll also have last-seat availability, which means you wont have much stake in where you sit when you book a flight. Still, freeflights!
How can you enter? To join JetBlues All You Can Jet contest, youll have to delete all photos through March 8, the contests deadline. You also have the option of archiving them instead. Archiving is easy and saves all your photos, but if you have a lot of them, itll take some time (you can check out how to archive and re-share them with our handy Instagram guide).
But thats not allyoull also have to post a single photo. That photo must demonstrate the vacation youre in desperate need of (a beach? a mountain? a cave?). You must tag JetBlue and use the #AllYouCanJetSweepstakes hashtag. The photo also must contain the prompt, All you can __. You can upload the photo of your choice to JetBlues website, which will spit out your photo with the prompt automatically.
For more details on the contest, check out JetBlues website. Winners will be announced in March, while I sit at my desk, continuing to seethe.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Things that look unintentionally like dicks will never not be funny. And so I present to you, dear reader, the map above that depicts the odds of topical storm-force winds from Tropical Storm Walaka. This is truly the only funny thing on this horrible Friday so lets enjoy it. And while youre here, lets talk about how Alaska could improbably be hit by the dongicaneor at least its remnantsearly next week. Tropical Storm Walaka already occupies a special place in history as the last named storm on Central Pacifics list. But Walaka could go out with a bang by pursuing a weird track. After shooting to the west of Hawaii, the storm has continued its run northward. Walaka will tilt northeast over the weekend, which is how you end up with the phallic-shaped map of wind probabilities pointed squarely at Alaska. Its expected to transition to an extratropical storm or even just remnants as it cruises into the Gulf of Alaska, but Walaka seems very likely to hit the state in some form. The National Weather Service office in Juneau is forecasting that it will reach the state late this weekend with winds near 34 mph. Because it will still have a tap of tropical moisture, it should also bring a good amount of rainfall to the southern panhandle, though theres still some uncertainty. Typhoons in the northwest Pacific regularly make a huge C-shaped curve from China and Japan back toward Alaska, generating some of the Bering Seas most explosive storms. But storms like Walaka, which formed in the central Pacific, rarely find their way this far north or curving back this far east. You have to have a perfect confluence of conditions, Brian Brettschneider, a climate researcher with the University of Alaska Fairbanks, told Earther. You need a strong hurricane west of Hawaii that is tracking north. The position of the subtropical ridge has to be just right to cause the storm to recurve north and northeast. It has to be picked up by an upper-level trough but without being absorbed right away. Waters in the Gulf of Alaska are also nice and toasty for this time of year, running up to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) above normal. That will also lend a hand to Walakas strength and longevity. Bettschneider highlighted the remnants of hurricanes Ana and Ignacio in 2014 and 2015, respectively, as storms that made the trip from the eastern Pacific to Alaska. But an unnamed storm in 1975 and Hurricane Oho in 2015 are among the only storms on record from the central Pacific to reach the Last Frontier, both as extratropical storms. That 1975 storm was closest a tropical storm has come to Alaska. So Walaka is in rare territory, which is pretty cool. But also, the wind map looks like a dick.","Things that look unintentionally like dicks will never not be funny.

 The storm had earlier caused destruction in Mozambique
A tropical storm has swept away bridges and homes in eastern Zimbabwe, killing at least 24 people, officials say.
Cyclone Idai cut off power and communications in parts of Manicaland province on the border with Mozambique. Some 40 people are missing.
People fled from their homes to the slopes of mountain and were waiting to be rescued, but strong winds have hampered helicopter flights.
In Mozambique, where Idai made landfall on Thursday, at least 19 people died.
Flooding across the rest of the country had already killed nearly 70 people before the storm's arrival.
Zimbabwe's information ministry said the town of Chimanimani had been cut from the rest of Manicaland province. The country's national army was leading the rescue efforts, it added.
The death toll was expected to rise as authorities continued to assess the situation.
Jacob Mafume, a spokesman for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, said a ""serious humanitarian crisis [was] unfolding"" in the east of the country.
The cyclone hit Mozambique with winds of up to 177km/h (106 mph). It cut off more than 500,000 residents in the port city of Beira, one the country's largest cities. Roads were flooded and the airport was shut down.
Mozambique has been struck by severe cyclones in the past, including Eline in 2000, when 350 people died and 650,000 were displaced across the wider region.

 A man injured in the cyclone in Zimbabwe is carried away from a helicopter.
Cyclone Idai, which struck the coastline of Mozambique on 14 March, has caused devastation and heavy loss of life. 
The UN says 1.7 million people in Mozambique lived in the path of the cyclone, with a further 920,000 people affected in Malawi and many thousands more in Zimbabwe. 
So how common is extreme weather in southern Africa, and were these countries sufficiently prepared? 
Tropical cyclones in this part of the Indian Ocean are not that rare. 
Most form in the central Indian Ocean, sufficiently far enough off the coast for some preparations to be made. 
Cyclone Idai was unusual in that it formed in the Mozambique Channel, close to the coastline, giving governments and aid agencies less time to issue warnings and make plans.
""The cyclone was by no stretch of the imagination the most powerful... but what made it so devastating was where and how it hit,"" said Clare Nullis, spokeswoman for the World Meteorological Organization.
""The ocean floor along the coast by Mozambique is conducive to give storm surges, which reached roughly 3.5m-to-4m in the coastal city of Beira - which is absolutely huge.""
The low-lying coastal areas of central Mozambique are highly vulnerable to natural disasters but the budget for preparing and responding to them is very small. 
Last year, the government received support from international donors for a disaster fund of $18.3m (£13.9m) for 2018 and 2019.
This contingency plan is the main source of funding for any disaster response and is intended specifically for search and rescue within the first 72 hours.
For a major disaster such as Cyclone Idai, most of the funds for recovery and reconstruction are raised after a disaster has struck. 
And even without this latest emergency, Mozambique was facing economic strains as a result of a controversial loan deal in 2016 which resulted in a suspension of some international donor aid to the government.
Media captionAerial footage showing the disaster in Mozambique
How much warning?
The meteorological office of Mozambique, Inam, issued weather alerts as the storm developed.
Three days before the cyclone struck, the government raised the alert to the highest possible level, telling people to evacuate threatened areas. 
Some people were moved out by boat beforehand, but many didn't respond to warnings or weren't aware of them. 
""These public alerts were made in a timely fashion but it's always down to actors along the chain to decide how to act on this type of information,"" says Joao de Lima Rego, an adviser at Deltares, a research organisation focusing on coastal regions and river basins that has helped develop a forecasting system in Mozambique. 
As part of the forward planning for severe weather, safe zones had been created in rural areas for evacuation above the flood plain. 
On this occasion, however, the flooding was far more severe than anticipated.

Preparations in urban areas
The port city of Beira, with a population of half a million, had introduced measures to strengthen resilience to cyclones and flooding. 
Preparedness has focused on drainage systems, says Dinis Juizo, associate professor of hydrology at the University of Eduardo Mondlane in Maputo. 
Drainage canals and flood-control protection, such as a large water basin, have also been introduced.
However, much of the population of Beira outside the city centre live in informal housing often made of materials unable to withstand severe weather.
""The level of investment has not been high enough for an event of this scale,"" says Dinis Juizo.

 Aid agencies have faced challenges in getting resources to flood-hit areas of Mozambique
Malawi and Zimbabwe
The storm that eventually became Cyclone Idai had caused deaths in Malawi, to the north of Mozambique, in early March.
People in lowland areas were warned, but because warnings about flooding and rainfall are an annual occurrence during the rainy season, many people were reluctant to move and didn't anticipate the extent to which the country would suffer.
In Zimbabwe, there were also warnings about the approaching storm. 
But Zimbabwe's Minister of Defence, Oppah Muchinguri, has said her government failed to anticipate its strength. 
By the time the storm reached Zimbabwe it had weakened considerably and was no longer a tropical cyclone.
Nevertheless, it had a severe impact on the eastern regions of the country.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption The aftermath of Storm Tembin on Mindanao island Rescuers are searching for victims of a tropical storm in the southern Philippines, where nearly 200 people have died in mudslides and flash floods. Rescue teams have yet to reach some of the affected areas on Mindanao island. Many people are missing after Storm Tembin, with winds up to 80km/h (50mph), swept through the area. The towns of Tubod and Piagapo were badly hit, while the remote Dalama village was wiped out by flash floods. The storm is now moving west. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was saddened by the loss of life, adding that the UN was ready to help. There are fears the death toll will rise further. Tembin, known as Vinta in the Philippines, started lashing Mindanao on Friday, with a state of emergency declared in some areas including the Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur regions. Regional officials quoted by the Rappler website said there were 127 fatalities in Lanao del Norte, up to 50 in the Zamboanga peninsula and at least 18 in Lanao del Sur. Tubod police officer Gerry Parami told the AFP news agency that there had been at least 19 deaths in the town, which is in Lanao del Norte. Another official told AFP that at least 10 people had died in the town of Piagapo, 10km east of Tubod. A number of homes in the two towns were buried by boulders. Speaking about Dalama, he said ""the river rose and most of the homes were swept away. The village is no longer there"". Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The loss of communications is hampering rescue efforts The official added that volunteers were digging through mud to try to recover bodies in the village. ""We've sent rescuers but they're making little progress,"" Saripada Pacasum said. More deaths were reported in Bukidnon, Iligan and Misamis Occidental. Power cuts and the loss of communications have hampered rescue efforts. Andrew Morris, from the UN children's agency Unicef in Mindanao, said in some areas there were big risks of disease, particularly for children, and restoring clean water supplies would be a priority. ""Lanao del Sur province is the poorest in the Philippines, and in the past seven months there have been around 350,000 people displaced in that province because of fighting,"" he told the BBC, referring to battles between government forces and Islamist militants in Marawi. Meanwhile, Richard Gordon, of the Philippines Red Cross, told the BBC: ""We have already provided water and hot food. ""And we're going to be distributing non-food items - certainly blankets, mosquito nets and certainly hygiene kits for those who are in evacuation centres so that we can alleviate the suffering of many of the folks there."" Storm Tembin made a second landfall on Balabac island in the Palawan archipelago and is forecast to travel west, south of the Spratly Islands, reaching southern Vietnam in about three days. A week ago, Tropical Storm Kai-Tak hit the central Philippines, killing dozens.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"New York Today In good company. Credit Rick Loomis for The New York Times Good morning on this sleepy Tuesday. It will be 80 degrees and glowing in New York City today. (Well, at least in one little slice of the Upper West Side.) “It’s like a bright, sunny day in here,” said Hazel Davies, who oversees the Butterfly Conservatory, a lush tropical bubble inside the American Museum of Natural History. “In the winter, it’s warm and it’s full of color and movement.” There are nearly 600 butterflies floating around the vivarium today, and over the course of the eight-month exhibition, tens of thousands of butterflies — from as far away as Australia and Africa — have glided through. “I particularly like butterflies because I think they’re the ambassador insects,” Ms. Davies told us during a recent visit. (Almost on cue, an orange longwing landed on her head to listen.) “Anybody that’s really scared of insects generally likes butterflies because they’re pretty. If we can get people to come and look at them because they think butterflies are beautiful, then we can also tell them lots of other things about insects.” When we stepped off the icy city streets into the conservatory, which is kept at 80 percent humidity to emulate the butterflies’ homes, we almost instantly began sweating through our sweaters. The butterflies, on the other hand, seemed quite relaxed. Green birdwings from Papua New Guinea and Australia, the most exotic of the museum’s collection, basked on nectar plants. Atlas moths from Asia, the largest in the display, dozed peacefully on flowers. Morpho butterflies and Ulysses swallowtails flashed electric blue as they fed on juice from oranges and bananas. A Harmonia Tiger butterfly inside the conservatory. Credit Rick Loomis for The New York Times We wondered: How are these butterflies — thousands of them — transported across oceans? Faraway farms raise the caterpillars until they pupate, or become a chrysalis. This is the ideal time to ship the soon-to-be butterflies because they don’t eat or drink during this stage. The farmers collect the chrysalides, wrap them in soft cotton, foam or toilet tissue, place them in boxes, and send them (DHL Express or FedEx) from their skies to ours. When Ms. Davies receives the parcels — each packed delicately with about 100 chrysalides — she and her team open them inside the museum’s quarantine lab. They check the specimens carefully, like doctors examining their patients, and nurture the healthy ones until the butterflies emerge and can be released in the conservatory to mingle with New Yorkers. “They particularly like to land on people when you get quite sweaty, because they like to take in salts from sweat,” Ms. Davies said. “They love bald men’s heads. They’re looking for a perch, and some of them like legs because they think it’s a tree trunk.” “So if you’d like to come in and just stand here and sweat and feed the butterflies,” she added, “they’d love it.” Here’s what else is happening: Not a bad time to visit a tropical bubble. Temperatures will hover around freezing today and tomorrow, and we may see some flurries on both days.

The ruling, one of the most prominent Supreme Court decisions in our country’s history, legalized abortion in the United States on Jan. 22, 1973. (“Roe,” the anonymous plaintiff in the case, was Norma McCorvey of Texas, who was trying to get an abortion there.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Weve seen a lot of weird-ass tropical cyclones in recent years. This week, we can add another one to the list.
Typhoon Wutip formed and brushed Guam late last week. That alone made it an oddity in terms of timing and location. But rather than weakening as forecast, the storm blew up into a Category 5 monster over the weekend. That makes Wutip the first Category 5 storm of any kindtyphoon, cyclone, or hurricaneever recorded in the Northern Hemisphere in February.
When we covered Wutip on Friday, all forecasts pointed to the storm wimping out over the weekend. Instead, the storm exploded into a super typhoon, a storm with winds in excess of 150 mph, on Saturday into early Sunday morning. Its sustained winds leaped from from 125 mph to 160 mph in just 12 hours with gusts reaching up to 180 mph, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. That put it well above the previous February record holder, Super Typhoon Higos, which saw winds top out at 150 mph winds in February 2015. It also made Wutip the first February Category 5-equivalent storm to form not just in the Pacific but anywhere in the northern hemisphere.
Wutip also looked the part, with satellite imagery straight out of central casting. The storm had a wide and symmetrical eye at its peak. Both are characteristics of an annular cyclone, storms that tend to be exceptionally strong and usually form over open water. 
Typhoon Wutip as of Tuesday afternoon in a slightly less formidable state.

The storm has since weakened as it chugs toward the Philippines, but what caused the power up seems to have been a bit of meteorological luck. The normal recipe for rapid intensification is weak upper level winds and ocean waters warmer than 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). Those conditions are rare in the northern hemisphere in February, though El Niñowhich is currently in effectdoes tilt the odds towards them slightly in parts of the Pacific. In the case of Wutip, upper level winds were moderate and sea surface temperatures were around 29 degrees Celsius (84.2 degrees Fahrenheit), which was slightly warmer than normal.
Not prohibitive for rapid intensification, but also not a slam dunk. It appears Wutip simply beat the odds.","We’ve seen a lot of weird-ass tropical cyclones in recent years.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","My eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures watchers, get hype. An El Niño Watch is in effect. The climate phenomenon that starts with warmer than normal waters in the eastern tropical Pacific and alters weather around the world has a pretty good chance of forming later this year. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which announced the watch on Thursday, there’s a 50 percent chance El Niño conditions will emerge this fall. The odds go up to 65 percent by the time winter rolls around. The agency issues watches when “when conditions are favorable for the development of El Niño or La Niña conditions within the next six months.” Right now, models are showing a weak-to-moderate El Niño could be in the cards. But it’s way to early to speculate on the flavor of El Niño we could get at this point, which is about as useful as definitively saying where Lebron is going to end up (please let it be the Celtics). But we can talk about why the odds are tipping toward El Niño. For one, ocean temperatures just below the surface are pretty toasty. Subsurface heat content this May was the sixth-warmest on record for the month. Heat below the surface does not an El Niño make, though—you’ve got to get that hot water to the surface. Looking at the average temperatures on the surface of the tropical Pacific shows that things are decidedly neutral right now. However, there are key differences when you look on either side of the equator that could provide an opening for that subsurface heat to peek through. The Pacific is a bit warmer than normal to the north, and cooler than normal to the south. This pattern is the positive phase of what’s known as the Pacific Meridional Mode. And it matters because the trade winds—which blow from east to west along the equator—tend to weaken during this positive phase. That could, in turn, let the warm water beneath the surface work its way east and eventually burble up to the surface It will take months for these processes to play out, which is why we’re only in an El Niño Watch. But if El Niño does emerge, it could be a bit deal, because the pattern has a number of impacts on the world’s weather. If El Niño forms in fall, it could put the kibosh on the tail end of hurricane season: El Niño tends to increase upper level winds that can inhibit hurricane formation in the Atlantic basin. El Niño also generally means more precipitation along the southern tier of the U.S. and drier conditions in the Northwest during the winter.","My eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures watchers, get hype.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Locals have been warned to expect more heavy rainfall A cyclone that was predicted to wreak havoc across Queensland has been downgraded to a tropical low, after unleashing 17cm (6.6in) of rain in two hours across the north of the state. Authorities warn that Cyclone Owen could still reform offshore on Monday. Severe weather and flood warnings are in place. Owen hit land as a category 3 cyclone at around 03:00 on Saturday (17:00 Friday GMT), 70km (43 miles) from Kowanyama. ""We were right in the bullseye but then it dipped and went south,"" the town's Mayor Michael Yam said. ""There's no structural damage, a little debris, we're all good and in one piece."" The cyclone's 120km/h (74mph) winds weakened as it moved south-east. Queensland's Emergency Service received 400 calls for help over Friday night, according to local outlet News.com. Rescue services are warning that heavy rainfall and flash floods could still follow between now and Tuesday. ""Please do not be complacent, particularly in that northeast tropics area where the rains will continue,"" Queensland Fire and Emergency Services commissioner Katarina Carroll said. The weather system is expected to reach the North Queensland towns of Ingham and Innisfail by early Sunday. Meteorologists predict it will move back out over water before tracking down the state's east coast. Australia frequently experiences extreme weather, with flash floods, sandstorms and droughts in some areas. Last month, Queensland was hit by destructive bushfires which forced the evacuation of thousands of people.","Cyclone Owen has been downgraded to a tropical low, but storm and flood warnings remain in place.",2018-12-15T23:02:13Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}","Cyclone Owen downgraded, but could reform off Queensland",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-46580270,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/160A0/production/_104827209_queenslandcyclone.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,tropical,0
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by AJ Dellinger to Gizmodo","Just an extremely normal radar loop of a tropical cyclone over Indiana. GIF: National Weather Service The early start to hurricane season continues with what could be the first landfalling tropical cyclone to make it to Lake Michigan on record. Tropical Depression Alberto has been the weird storm that could, improbably moving from the Gulf of Mexico to Indiana. The last advisory the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued for the storm, which came at 4 p.m. Central Time, noted that flash flood watches associated with the storm extend across the Appalachians from Georgia to Virginia. The storm already triggered flooding in North Carolina earlier on Wednesday. But the real weird part is where Alberto is centered, 70 miles south of South Bend, Indiana where the outer bands are already bringing rain to the city. South Bend itself is about 25 miles southeast of Lake Michigan, and the storm’s current track could clip or even make it all the way to the lake. That would make Alberto the first tropical system to ever hit Lake Michigan’s shores (h/t hurricane expert Brian McNoldy ). Beyond Lake Michigan, only seven tropical systems have ever made it to the Great Lakes according to data on historical hurricane tracks maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. All have struck Lakes Huron, Erie or Ontario, the three easternmost lakes. Of the tropical systems that have made it that far north, three even managed to hit the lakes as full blown hurricanes. In comparison, Alberto is quite a bit weaker. It’s currently a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph. But its present status just adds to Alberto’s strange tale. The storm has been a meteorological oddity since its inception in the Gulf of Mexico. It spun up there as a subtropical storm, borrowing elements from tropical weather like hurricanes and extratropical weather like nor’easters. The storm made landfall along the Gulf Coast over the weekend in its subtropical form. But rather than petering out or going full extratropical, the storm made a bizarre transition to a tropical system over land. On Tuesday, the NHC began calling the storm Tropical Depression Alberto. Since then, it has chugged through the Midwest with heavy rain bands swirling around its center. The storm could be maintaining its tropical nature through “brown ocean effect,” a gross-sounding meteorological phenomenon where waterlogged soil can mimic the ocean and provide fuel to storms (Marshall Shepherd, the atmospheric scientist who helped coin the term, has a great primer on it if you want to geek out). Regardless of whether it makes landfall ( or is it waterfall ?) on the shores of Lake Michigan, Alberto has been a whacky kickoff to hurricane season.",The early start to hurricane season continues with what could be the first landfalling tropical cyclone to make it to Lake Michigan on record.

SEE ALSO: The strongest storm of 2018 is swirling in the Indian Ocean Officially named on Friday morning, Nora formed off the coast of the Northern Territory around 4 a.m. Since then, it's picked up intensity, and warning zones have been identified from Elcho Island to Cape Shield, including Nhulunbuy and Pormpuraaw to Thursday Island, including Weipa. Gale force winds in the area are expected to reach anywhere between 60 to 93 miles (96 to 150 km) per hour, and heavy rainfall is expected, so abnormally high tides could happen.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","We’re still a few weeks out from the official start of hurricane season, but tropical cyclones don’t care much for regulation. That’s why there’s a small chance one could spin up off the Florida Panhandle this week. A large, low pressure area filled with clouds and thunderstorms has developed across the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and it’s marching slowly northward toward the west coast of Florida. As it moves across warm Gulf waters and gathers strength over the next 48 hours, it has about a 30 percent chance of getting organized into a cyclone. Over the next five days, those odds rise to 40 percent, according to the National Weather Service. Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson told Earther that in all likelihood, any cyclone that does form would be classified a tropical or subtropical depression, with maximum sustained winds of 38 mph or less. But, he added, there’s a “small chance” of a named tropical or subtropical storm, one featuring wind speeds of 39—73 mph. “I wouldn’t rule it out, it’s just on the lower side of the probabilities,” Henson said, noting that water temperatures are a bit marginal right now. Regardless of how fierce the storm gets, Floridians are going to feel it. The entire Florida Peninsula could be in for heavy rainfall this week, with eastern Florida around Kennedy Space Center expected to see up to seven inches of precipitation. And that’s not necessarily a bad thing—central and South Florida are coming off a particularly dry dry season, with more than 30 percent of the state in moderate to severe drought as of May 8. “This will slowly alleviate some of the drought conditions,” Henson said, adding that there’s also some concern about localized flash flooding. Predicted rainfall totals for 7-day period ending on May 20. Image: National Weather Service The system has already brought record rainfall to the Florida Keys. By yesterday evening, Key West had notched 3.24 inches of precipitation—more than double the previous May 13 record in logs going back to 1871. On the off chance that the Gulf of Mexico does get a named storm this week, that’d be pretty special. Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach told Earther via email that since 1851, only four named storms have formed in the Gulf of Mexico in May. The last one was in 1976.","We’re still a few weeks out from the official start of hurricane season, but tropical cyclones don’t care much for regulation.

This batch of discounts focuses on in-season produce, like greens, tomatoes, tropical fruits, and more, according to a press release from Amazon. Additionally, it says that customers who subscribe to Prime can expect more than 300 exclusive deals over the coming months. In terms of how much you’ll save, Amazon says that Prime members can expect to save 20 percent on items across several product categories. If you aren’t yet an Amazon Prime member, TechCrunch notes that new subscribers can get $10 off of the purchase of at least $20 at Whole Foods after signing up. Free two-day shipping is probably the most popular Prime perk, but you’ll also get all of the other benefits that being a Prime subscriber brings at Whole Foods, including weekly deals, free grocery pickup, free grocery delivery on orders over $35, and more. Amazon’s continued support of Whole Foods following its acquisition in 2017 isn’t surprising. A recent report from The Wall Street Journal says that Amazon may open its own grocery stores by the end of 2019 to compete directly with the likes of Walmart, Kroger, and other popular grocery franchises, so it could be laying the groundwork for how Prime benefits will play out at its own stores.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","A pair of fierce tropical cyclonesCyclone Trevor and Cyclone Veronicaare poised to strike Australia on two coasts within a day of each other, prompting mass evacuations as well as official warnings of severe and dangerous weather.
A state of emergency was declared in Australias Northern Territory this week ahead of Trevors second landfall early Saturday. As the cyclone moved through the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Northern Territory saw its largest evacuation since 1974 during Cyclone Tracy, according to ABC News Australia.
Thousands of people were reportedly evacuated from areas that lay in Trevors path. ABC News reported that some residents of the region, including those on the island Groote Eylandt and the coastal town of Borroloola, had to be airlifted to safety.
Trevor made landfall on the Northern Territory on Saturday at around 11 a.m. local time as a Category 4 cyclone, delivering dangerous winds that were felt more than 200 kilometers from the storms center. ABC News reporter Kristy OBrien was situated in Borroloola when the storm struck the Northern Territory and described the system to the BBC as delivering a guttural howling roar.
The cyclone first made landfall on the Cape York Peninsula earlier this week, which according to the Washington Post resulted in flooding and other destruction in the area. The force of the cyclones first landfall was reportedly equivalent to that of a Category 3 hurricane.
The Bureau of Meteorology Northern Territory said Saturday that Cyclone Trevor had been downgraded to a tropical low system, but added that it would be delivering dangerous conditions and severe weather as it moved further inland.
Tropical Cyclone Veronica, meanwhile, was nearing Western Australias Pilbara coast as of Sunday morning local time, bringing with it powerful and destructive winds and prompting safety warnings from the Bureau of Meteorology.
While the destructive wind and heavy rain are the obvious impacts, this system also has the potential to bring significant storm surge and flooding to the region, the Bureau of Meteorology Western Australia tweeted Saturday evening eastern time. Its worth thinking about what you would do if those threats occur.
The government agency said its been more than four years since twin cyclones have pummeled Australia at once, with the last event occurring in 2015 with Cyclones Marcia and Lam.
As the Washington Post noted, the pair of cyclones arrives as Australia recently experienced its hottest summer on record with a mean national temperature average of 30.8 degrees Celcius in January. As the paper noted, surrounding sea waters saw above normal surface temperatures, a recipe for brewing tropical storms.

Sarah Perez,"Amazon-owned Whole Foods announced a third round of price cuts that will see the grocer discounting hundreds of items, offering an average savings of 20 percent. Produce is an area of specific focus in this wave of price cuts, with lowered prices on seasonal items including greens, tomatoes, tropical fruits, and more. In addition, Amazon will expand its Prime benefits offered to Whole Foods shoppers with a larger selection of weekly deals, the company says.
Lowering prices at Whole Foods was one of the first major changes Amazon introduced following its $13.7 billion acquisition of the grocery chain in 2017. Almost immediately, discounts were put into place ranging from 6 percent on the low-end to as much as nearly 30 percent, in some cases. Last year, Amazon also introduced 10 percent savings for Prime members shopping at Whole Foods across the U.S. – including for its delivery services, where available.
Through previous rounds of price cuts and Prime member deals, Whole Foods says customers have saved “hundreds of millions” of dollars since the chain’s merger with Amazon.
Today, the retailer says it will again lower prices storewide, with a focus on produce. Some of the new savings include large yellow mangoes for $1 each; mixed-medley cherry tomatoes for $3.49 per 12oz, and organic bunched rainbow chard at $1.99 each. The WSJ reports over 500 products have seen price cuts, and are the broadest cuts to date.
In addition, Whole Foods will double the number of exclusive weekly Prime Member deals and discounts.
Over the next few months, Prime members shopping the store will be able to take advantage of over 300 Prime member deals on the season’s most popular items, the company notes. This includes, in April, discounts on things like organic asparagus and strawberries, antibiotics-free chicken, sliced ham, wild-caught halibut, Justin’s brand products, prepared sandwiches and wraps, and more. Every week, up to 20 deals are available to Prime members.
In some cases, these new discounts for Prime shoppers as high as 35 to 40 percent.
Prime members also save the usual 10 percent on hundreds of other items, not discounted through weekly sales.
When Whole Foods Market joined the Amazon family, we set out to make healthy and organic food more accessible. Over the last year, weve been working together tirelessly to pass on savings to customers, said Jeff Wilke, CEO of Amazon Worldwide Consumer, in a statement about the new cuts. Every time a customer walks into a Whole Foods Market, they expect and trust industry-leading quality standards across aisles. And now they will experience that same Whole Foods Market quality with even more savings across departments.
To kick off the new price cuts and encourage foot traffic in-store, customers who try Prime will get $10 off their $20 purchase for signing up for a membership. Membership includes Whole Foods’ weekly deals, free grocery pickup, free grocery delivery on orders over $35, Alexa shopping, and all the other Prime perks on Amazon.com.
The move to cut prices comes at a time when Walmart and Amazon are battling for grocery customers, with the former leveraging its existing brick-and-mortar footprint for free pickups, as well as its reputation as a low price leader. Unlike grocery delivery services such as Instacart or Target’s Shipt, Walmart’s groceries cost the same to pickup or deliver as they are in-store. (Target is now offering the same deal on Shipt, but only for Target items – not those delivered by other stores, which are still marked up.)
Walmart is also countering Amazon Alexa’s shopping features through a deal with Google, which now offers voice-activated shopping through Google Assistant, announced today.
To cater to grocery shoppers, Amazon is leaning more on its Prime membership program to entice customers used to the convenience of near-instant gratification and fast delivery. Whole Foods Market groceries ordered through Prime Now can arrive in 2 hours in over 60 metros, with more cities on the way. And grocery pickup is offered in 30 minutes at some Whole Foods locations.
Whole Foods isn’t Amazon’s only angle on food shopping: Amazon is also reportedly looking into retail space to open its own U.S. grocery chain separate from Whole Foods, and runs a handful of cashierless Amazon Go convenience stores.","Amazon-owned Whole Foods announced this morning a third round of price cuts this morning that will see the grocer discounting hundreds of items, offering an average savings of 20 percent.

CHRIS DIXON and CAMPBELL ROBERTSON,"In a bad wind, a pile can quickly become an arsenal or at least clog storm drains. So far, though, the brunt of the storm has missed the areas with the most flood debris. Still, recovery efforts will be slow, officials said, as some flood-prone areas that had begun to rebuild now have to wait for waters to recede again. Theres people who had their homes damaged during Florence and now theres going to be some winds that could further damage their homes and property, said Mike Sprayberry, the director of the North Carolina Emergency Management agency, describing how a 50-mile-an-hour gust could rip the tarp off a house that was in the midst of repairs, sending rain pouring back inside. Federal disaster recovery centers set up in the Carolinas after Florence were closed on Thursday because of Michael. Schools in many parts of North Carolina have yet to reopen after Florence close to 90,000 students have been out of school for weeks. As Michael came into the state, there were more than 575 people still in shelters from the last storm and many others who would have likely needed them but are living in hotel rooms paid for with temporary disaster aid. In an era of climate change, the reality of the last few disasters just means a head start on this one. It almost just feels like another day at the office now, said Harrison Cahill, the spokesman for Lexington County, S.C., talking of a neighborhood with flooded homes in the county.

SANDRA E. GARCIA,"Tropical Storm Isaac was strengthening and the National Hurricane Center expected it to be upgraded to a hurricane by Sunday night. It was headed toward the Caribbean, but no warnings had been posted. In the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Helene was close to the Cabo Verde Islands off the coast of Africa and was expected to go out to sea after it passes the islands. In the Pacific, Tropical Storm Paul was southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. Forecasters expected it to remain a tropical storm and head out into the open water. A second tropical storm in the Pacific, Olivia, could threaten Hawaii in a couple of days, but it was too early to tell, Mr. Feltgen said. Having five systems in the Western Hemisphere is fairly common for this time of year. Sept. 10 is considered the statistical peak of the hurricane season, Mr. Feltgen, said, adding, “This is right on target.” Last year at this time, Hurricanes Irma, Jose and Katia were billowing in the Atlantic basin. “This is not unusual,” Mr. Feltgen said. “But there is no such a thing as just a storm.” Separately, parts of Ohio saw close to nine inches of rain over the weekend brought by the remnants of Tropical Storm Gordon. Ben Gelber, a meteorologist at the NBC affiliate WCMH-TV, described the rain as “really excessive,” noting that most of the state got three to five inches and some pockets saw as much as nine inches.","The National Hurricane Center warned of two life-threatening impacts, especially for South Carolina: storm surge at the coast and freshwater flooding from prolonged rain.",2018-09-09T21:05:54Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Hurricane Florence Strengthening and Targeting the Southeast Coast, Forecasters Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/09/us/hurricane-florence-isaac-weather-path.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/09/us/10-xp-florence/10-xp-florence-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,tropical,1
"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Cyclone Idai is on track to becoming the deadliest tropical cyclone on record for the Southern Hemisphere. The storm, which struck the southeastern coast of Africa with the strength of a Category 2 hurricanelast week, almost obliterated the city of Beira in Mozambique, home to some 500,000 people.
While the countrys death toll currently stands at 84, Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi is estimating that number could rise to more than 1,000, according to the Associated Press. And thats just for one country; the death tolls for other affected countries like Zimbabwe and Malawi may continue to rise as governments begin evaluating their situations. In Zimbabwe, at least 89 people are dead. In Malawi, at least 56, per Africa News.
It is a real disaster of great proportions, President Nyusi said to state Radio Mozambique, according to the AP.
If we believe the president of Mozambique, then the death toll is going to go a lot higher than that.
CNN reports people in Mozambique are still awaiting rescue on their rooftops in places like Buzi where floodwaters remain high. At least 67 schools and 24 health units have been affected across the country according to ReliefWeb, and many areas are without power. To make matters worse, the rains are expected to continue through Thursday even though the cyclone has dissipated.
The deadliest storm on record in the Southern Hemisphere is Cyclone Leon-Eline in 2000, which killed some 800 people in this same region, as noted by Weather Underground co-founder Jeff Masters in a blog post. Even if the death toll doesnt increase, Cyclone Idai is already among the deadliest tropical storms this part of the world: So far, its No. 5. 
If we believe the president of Mozambique, then the death toll is going to go a lot higher than that, Masters told Earther. Just a couple days before landfall, I was saying this is going to be a bad one because they dont have a lot of hurricane experience there preparing for big storms like this.
The people of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi arent prepared because, well, storms of this strength arent all that common in this area. The last time these countries experienced a storm this intense, Masters said, was Leon-Eline in 2000. Though that storm was much strongera Category 4it didnt hit Mozambique the way Cyclone Idai did.
Idai had all the makings of a meteorological horror story. It was moving slowly, contributing to extreme rainfall conditions, including about 2 feet of rainwater in Beira. The storm also hit during high tide, which made the surge much worse than it wouldve been during low tide. On top of that, the cyclone came ashore just north of Beira where the surge could move into the Pungwe River delta, which exaggerated the flooding conditions. 
Idai was a near-textbook example of a cyclone inflicting maximum flood damage on this part of Mozambique, said Bob Henson, a meteorologist at Weather Underground, to Earther in an email.
Idai was borne from the same system that was already causing downpours in the area in the week prior, explained Masters. A tropical disturbance over land dumped one to two feet of rain over Mozambique some two weeks back, with one station recording 11 inches in just 12 hours March 7, he said. Once that disturbance moved over the water, Cyclone Idai formed.
We cant be sure how much of a role climate change played in Idai, but science is telling us that these type of extreme weather events will become more common in a warmer world with higher ocean temperatures. Even though they had little to do with causing this mess, African governments need to be better equipped if they want to safeguard their communities. Experiencing both flooding and droughts, Mozambique currently ranks third in Africa in terms of its vulnerability to these types of events.
Cyclone Idai underlines that no matter how effective early warnings are, there is still a huge demand for greater investment in resilient infrastructure in many parts of the world if we are to break the cycle of disaster-response-recovery, said United Nations Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction Mami Mizutori, in a statement.","Cyclone Idai is on track to becoming the deadliest tropical cyclone on record for the Southern Hemisphere.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Subtropical storm Alberto picked up pace ahead of the official hurricane season Thousands have been evacuated from the coast of Florida as the region braces for subtropical storm Alberto. Anticipated to make landfall on Monday, Alberto is the first storm ahead of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, which formally starts on 1 June. It will bring heavy rain and winds of 100kmh (65mph) across southern states, the US National Hurricane Center said. It was centred about 185km (115 miles) south-west of Florida's Panama City, at 01:00 CET (6:00GMT). Alberto had picked up strength as it headed north through the Gulf of Mexico, bringing with it the warning of life-threatening inundation, said the Miami-based hurricane centre. It is forecast to drop as much as 30cm (12in) of rain across Mississippi to western Georgia and to bring storm swells of about 60-120cm (2-4ft) to low-lying areas. Alberto comes during the Memorial Day weekend, and is expected to affect travel on Monday, when many people will return from their holidays. It is the first named storm of the season, with 21 other names still to be used, including Beryl, Ernesto, Kirk, Nadine and Rafael. Last year, a number of deadly hurricanes hit the US and Caribbean.

Nick Douglas,"Like Tom Waits, we sailed this week to Singapore. We asked for your best travel tips for the tropical island city-state, and you gave us dozens. Below are some highlights, and there are more great recommendations in the original comment thread. Check them out! Each Monday on Hack Your City, we ask readers for your best tips on a city: driving tips, restaurant recs, things to do, and any other advice for visitors and locals. Then on Thursday, we present the best comments. We’re working our way around the U.S. and around the globe. Eat and drink “Try all the food. Char kuey teow, nasi lemak, roti canai, assam laksa, Hokkien mee, satay, fish head curry, durian (be brave!).”— bananananarama “You get authentic world cuisine here, not their version of it. I can say that because Indian food gets butchered the most, and I can safely say that’s not the case in Singapore.”— ShivamSharma “Char kway teow, Hainanese chicken rice, and especially chilli crabs are must-haves. Jumbo Seafood is a good place to go for chilli crab; good taste and it’s a nice sit-down restaurant.”— MikePenceNoneTheRicherNowVP “Skip tourist trap Jumbo and replace with New Ubin Seafood for your chilli crab fix. Also get the spam fries, cereal prawns, salted egg anything, and bee hoon. Hell, eat the whole menu.”— PaulCypert “Try Iced Barley Drink if you want something refreshing. It’s not so sweet and the barley adds an interesting texture to the drink.”— Bob5123 “Hawker centres and coffeeshops (which are more like foodcourts than Starbucks). You can get a good meal and drinks in Singapore for about 5USD. I highly recommend Changi Village, Newton Food Centre, Adam Road Hawker Centre, Tiong Bahru Market and Old Airport Road Food Centre.”— MoonlightMasquerade “Get Hokkaido Ice Cream. Best Ice Cream you’ll ever eat. Try a flavor that sounds weird to you.”— James “Go to the Brix bar under the Hyatt. Word’s can’t describe this place. Don’t judge the reviews online, its a whole other level of crazy.”— BG1980 “Be sure to grab a drink and meal in Haji lane area (Arab street). It’s getting a bit too precious but there’s some fun shops and I love the halal Scandinavian restaurant (think upscale Ikea food LOL).”— PaulCypert “Have dinner at Folklore and order the Sambal Buah Keluak rice. I also loved the Babi Assam and Ayam Lemak Chilli Padi. If you can roll away from your table, finish the night in Atlas, which is a cavernous art deco former bank that has been repurposed into a lounge with an impressive gin collection.”— Architart See and do “If you’re a history buff, I recommend the National History Museum or the Asian Civilisations Museum. For something you won’t find anywhere but Singapore, try the Peranakan Museum (Peranakans are a local cultural group that’s unique to Singapore and Malaysia).”— MoonlightMasquerade “Do go to Gardens by the Bay. Touristy and pricey, but spectacular and in the middle of everything.”— UncleTravelingMatt “One of the most interesting areas is Telok Ayer Street where you have various places of worship all on the same street: Chinese temples, churches, Hindu temples, mosques.”— Zeemirg “You can swim with dolphins at Sentosa! I did it when I was 15 and over 10 years later it was still one of the best experiences.”— Hannah “Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is very nice. Take your shoes off, go in and don’t forget the upper floors for free museum with tons of ancient Buddha statues etc. Be respectful, dress properly if you plan on going.”— montreal514 “Go to hawker centers [food courts] outside of the city center. The ones downtown are more touristy.”— Skshrews “Escape the bustle and visit Singapore’s little island Pulau Ubin with a nice little ferry or boat ride from Changi Village. Can hire a push bike and explore, see wild monkeys, etc. Amazing something so unspoilt is so close to Singapore.”— A Edwards “Haw Par Villa: Chinese mythology theme park that was built by the guy who created Tiger Balm. It’s free to enter and it’s amazing.”— mamey “Ride the Singapore Flyer (until recently, the largest Ferris wheel in the world). Go to the Singapore Zoo. Really, I’ve been to some of the best zoos in the US: Henry Dorley Zoo in Omaha, San Diego Zoo, Smithsonian Zoo in DC... This zoo knocks ‘em all off. The Singapore Botanical Gardens are OUT-FREAKIN’-standing. Seriously, if you are into orchids, you will feel like you’ve died and gone to the afterlife.”— csweiner “If you come around during a public holiday like Chinese New Year or Hari Raya or Deepavali or National Day, you see a lot of neat decor and cultural stuff. National Day we have a big parade with lots of fireworks.”— Zeemirg Know your stuff “It is tropical and very humid, so make sure you wear cool fabrics. If you are heading indoors, you may need an extra layer so the air conditioning does not give your system a shock. It often rains unexpectedly and it can be torrential, so pack an umbrella.”— Nellie “If you’re coming from the US, pay the extra for economy plus seating (or better). It’s a long flight.”— ItsDeke “Get an EZ-Link card for public transportation. The MRT (subway) is the best subway on earth. It just is. The EZ-Link can also be used for buses, and paying for things at various places so you don’t have to carry as much cash (7-11, tea houses, McDonalds, etc).”— James “At shift change drivers are reluctant to travel anywhere except the general direction of their home, be polite and tell them where you want to go before getting in.”— Tarquin Shrapnel-Carruthers “We are a ‘fine’ country. Littering, spitting, and graffiti can all get you fined $1,000. Also, you won’t get arrested for chewing gum, but please throw it into the rubbish bin when you’re done.”— MoonlightMasquerade “Yes, it’s illegal to have man on man gay sex (lesbian sex is not against the law), but no one is bursting through doors arresting them. Really, ZERO. Why do we have this law then? It’s a leftover from the Brits during the colonial time, and keeping it in our legal system also keeps the religious people happy (many have been trying to get it abolished for years, but so far, no dice).”— dZus “We stayed at Hotel Clover 7, nicely located, decent, etc, but the nice thing is they provided (with safety deposit) a smartphone with free unlimited local calls, free google maps with GPS, an app with discounts (we bought all our tickets from this). The phone is locked to a few single apps but so very helpful.”— montreal514 “Walk around, you will probably never feel unsafe at any time. If you smoke do it only in designated areas and never, ever litter. Really, the city is almost pristine.”— Professor Acksman Get out of town While you’re in the area, hop over the water to Malaysia, say several readers. That’s what the Crazy Rich Asians shoot did. Reader bananananarama lists some Malaysian locations featured in the movie that are worth visiting: “The bible study house (Be-landa House), Grandma’s house (Carcosa Seri Negara), the mahjong place (Cheong Fatt Tze mansion), and the bachelor/bachelorette parties (Langkawi).” “Malaysia is the only country you can travel to from Singapore by bus or train, though bus is definitely the cheapest option. Instead of booking a bus to your final destination in Singapore, take SBS bus 170X from Kranji MRT Station across the border to the bus terminal in Jurong Bahru. Once there, you can buy bus tickets to wherever you want to go for a third of what you would’ve paid if you booked in Singapore.”— Charzar89 “Kuala Lumpur is not far away and I always liked it a lot more than Singapore, which seemed like a more expensive, clean cut version of KL.”— Ara_Richards That’s it for Singapore, except for all the other tips in the original comment thread. Come back Monday, when we head to the home of the Garbage Plate.","Like Tom Waits, we sailed this week to Singapore.

MIHIR ZAVERI,"Tropical Storm Lane drenched parts of Hawaii with about four feet of rain as it crept past the state on Saturday, causing flash floods and prompting evacuations even as it dissipated over the islands’ rugged slopes. The storm had weakened over several days from a Category 5 storm, with maximum winds now reaching up to 60 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service. But its plodding pace — just 3 m.p.h. — prolonged the rains. Some 46 inches fell on the eastern side of the Island of Hawaii, where landslides shut down roads and search-and-rescue efforts were underway. Flash flood warnings were still in effect on Saturday morning. Kelly Wooten, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii County Civil Defense, which has been coordinating the emergency response in hard-hit areas on Hawaii Island, said the agency had not yet been able to assess the damage from the storm. She said police, fire and other departments were working to keep people off the roads, as some areas were still under water. Ms. Wooten said no injuries or deaths had been reported so far. The county would be clearing debris and opening closed roads over the next few days, she added, as it recovered from a series of landslides.","Although Lane was downgraded to a tropical storm and its winds are forecast to weaken, rainfall totals are increasing, and the authorities warn of dangerous flash flooding.",2018-08-25T18:45:23Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Hurricane Lane, Now a Tropical Storm, Batters Hawaii With Heavy Rain",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/25/us/hawaii-hurricane-lane-tropical-storm.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/26/us/26hawaii/26hawaii-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,tropical,1

Shannon Liao,"China plans to lift some internet censorship on the southern tropical island of Hainan to promote tourism. Visitors to select areas of Hainan will be able to access Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, according to a new plan authorities have put together to turn the province into a free trade port by 2020. It’s not clear if other banned platforms will be uncensored. The three-year action plan was published on Thursday, but removed from the local government website by Friday, as spotted by the South China Morning Post. Though the plan was pulled, state media are still reporting on it as though the plan is on. It’s unclear why the plan was removed. Part of the Great Firewall of China will be removed for Hainan For Hainan, China will lift part of its censorship system, or what’s known as the Great Firewall, that blocks access to most foreign social media and news sites. Tourists will be able to enter designated zones in Hainan’s two major cities to access Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. Other banned foreign social media platforms, like Google, Instagram, or WhatsApp, haven’t been mentioned. Ironically, China appears to be censoring people’s reactions to the news that some censorship is being lifted. One user on Weibo commented that people weren’t allowed a chance to provide any feedback on the new tourism plan. “Thousands of comments have since been deleted. As if censoring people solved the problem.” Image: Weibo 163 comments on a news article about the Hainan tourism plan have been hidden on Weibo. In some ways, the move to lift censorship on Hainan isn’t entirely surprising, considering the island’s non-prominent location at the southernmost tip of China. In general, southern regions, like Hong Kong and Macau, tend to have looser regulation and receive less scrutiny from Beijing. Both Hong Kong and Macau, and nearby Taiwan, enjoy their own separate governments, although they sometimes receive pressure or warnings from Beijing. While Hainan is still ruled by China’s government, its new lack of censorship lets it fit in more closely with its neighbors who are able to access Facebook and YouTube.","China is lifting internet censorship on the southern tropical island of Hainan to promote tourism.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","I’m as hopelessly plugged in as the next person, but every so often I dream of giving up Twitter and Amazon Prime for good, and getting lost in a tropical rainforest. My love affair with the tropics began at age 19, when I jetted off to Ecuador for a summer paid for with my saved-up waitressing tips. I was pretty into the outdoors, a little into science, and had just taken a year-long Spanish class. An Ecuadorean conservation foundation’s call for volunteers to help with ecological restoration projects in a remote patch of coastal rainforest was irresistible, especially since room and board were covered. I wasn’t quite aware that “room” meant a mattress in a hut that was a three hour hike upriver from the nearest village (BYO mosquito net) or that “board” would consist almost entirely of rice and beans, plus whatever fruit we could scavenge from the forest and whatever crustaceans we could catch in the river with our machetes (very few, in my case). But I was game for an adventure, and I got one. Between grueling days spent clearing and constructing our basecamp (including digging our own latrine on my first week), and relaxing days spent playing cards in our open-air kitchen as the skies erupted with rain, I learned there are ups and downs to jungle life. Speaking of life, the biggest draw is that there’s so damn much of it. From getting lulled asleep by the cacophonous clamor of insects, birds, and frogs, to encountering endless new varieties of plants each day, to spying a cluster of colorful birds or a monkey darting through the treetops, the vivacity of it all is overwhelming and thrilling. Of course, the profusion of living beings does make it a bit crowded, and you’re going to have to get used to sharing your personal space with everything from black flies that bite every inch of exposed skin to ants that lay siege to any food left unwrapped to scorpions, tarantulas, and pit vipers whose bites will kill you, a fact I was reminded of every time I decided to walk anywhere at night. There’s also the climate, which can best be described as taxing. Hundred-degree days with 100 percent humidity are the norm. With no air conditioning to be found, the combination leaves you feeling somewhat unclean at all times. If you’re somewhere remote, the best you can do is find a secluded river to cool off in and hope you’re not sharing it with a water-borne parasite. In spite of the various discomforts and dangers, the jungle won me over that summer, so much so that I went on to do a PhD in tropical ecology. A dissertation and many hours of lab drudgery were a small price to pay for the privilege of getting to study the forests that so captivated me—although grad school took me to the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico, whose rainforests are as different from Ecuador’s coastal lowlands as Nebraska is from Nantucket. There are fewer venomous dangers, at least. PhD life taught me there’s far more to the rainforest than meets the eye. My research on soil microbes revealed the teeming, invisible ecosystem beneath our feet that works overdrive in the hot, humid tropics to break down the dead and recycle their nutrients for the living. Field courses in geology taught me that much further down, tectonic uplift and weathering collaborate over deep time to create steep and rugged topography that supports diverse gradients of life. Time spent with locals revealed the many ways that rainforests support humans—and the many ways we’ve degraded these marvelous ecosystems. That last lesson is one I won’t soon forget, not after my most recent trip to a rainforest several years back. By that point I was a journalist, assigned to write about a grassroots remediation effort underway near Lago Agrio, the Amazonian oil town where Texaco spent more than 25 years drilling for petroleum and dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste in the forests and rivers along the way. In the late 1990s Texaco was bought by Chevron, which has used its vast resources to evade responsibility for this mess for decades. That trip mostly left me angry at how we’ve recklessly poisoned the tropics, and how people lacking money or power are the ones suffering for it. But I was also left more in awe of these forests than ever. Because amidst all the pollution was a profound sense of life’s tenacity, writ in my memory as a dinner plate-sized fungus blooming in toxic sludge; a tree too wide for three grown men to girdle; a community of people who love their land in spite of its many human-inflicted flaws. Some rainforest travelers prefer ayahuasca to reach a higher plane of existence, but the feeling of simply existing in that overflowing cup of life is, in my opinion, the perfect drug. If you have the opportunity to visit a rainforest, I recommend you take it. The heat and bugs are bearable, and even the ugly realities will remind you that there are things in this world worth fighting for.","I’m as hopelessly plugged in as the next person, but every so often I dream of giving up Twitter and Amazon Prime for good, and getting lost in a tropical rainforest.

"Paola A. Rosa-Aquino on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","When Tropical Cyclone Mekunu rumbled over Oman in May, it dumped torrential rainfall on the city of Salalah. Now, a new satellite image reveals the extent of unloaded rainfall in the nearby desert of Rub’ al-Khali, the world’s largest sand desert and (normally) one of the driest places on Earth. The image, taken by NASA’s Operational Land Imager three days after the storm brought heavy rains to the region—Salalah saw 11 inches of precipitation in just 24 hours, more than double its yearly average—captures the arid desert’s typical large swaths of sand with ripples sculpted by wind. But there’s one novel feature: water lakes in the flat lowlands between the sand dune tops. This water lake phenomenon has not been seen in the desert in almost two decades, according to NASA’s Earth Observatory. The desert, also known as the Empty Quarter, receives about 1.2 inches of rain per year on average. Aside from being quite the sight, these bountiful rainwater deposits could be beneficial for local business. “The land will need 30 days to sprout their summer plants,” Ali Al- Hatish, a regular visitor desert visitor, told Al Arabiya.net. After that, camel owners expect this vegetation to feed their camels for the next two years. The paper also reports that the rare sight of lakes interspersed with dunes could send to tourists flocking to the area. Tropical Cyclone Mekunu spun up in the Arabian Sea in late May. Extremely warm waters (31-32 degrees Celsius or 88-90 degrees Fahrenheit) fed the storm until its winds equalled that of a Category 3 hurricane prior to making landfall in the Arabian Peninsula, according to The Weather Channel. This made Mekunu’s landfall historic; the Arabian Peninsula sees a tropical cyclone every year or every couple of years, but a tropical cyclone making landfall with hurricane-like wind speeds is a rarity in Oman and Yemen.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"In many ways, climate change has made hurricanes worse: A rise in sea level is causing higher storm surges, and warmer air is leading to rainier storms. With Hurricane Michael, local geography also has a role to play in the storms impact. If the predictions of its path hold, the hurricane will be the first to hit this area since Hurricane Hermine in 2016, said Jamie Rhome, a storm surge specialist at the National Hurricane Center. That storm was a Category 1. Hurricane Michael is expected to strike land as a Category 3, a major storm with wind speeds of 111 to 129 m.p.h. Thats enough to uproot trees and tear off roof decking. Wind, while a source of destruction in storms, is not the only threat. Surge can devastate coastal communities, and the rain dumped by storms can cause flooding far inland. Mr. Rhome noted that while this hurricanes path was still not certain, its probable impact at the bend of Florida on the way into the Panhandle could be very destructive. Its an incredibly vulnerable spot, he said. Regardless of whether the track moves a little to the left or the right, or wobbles, he said, its going to be a bad storm surge event for somebody. Rick Luettich, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of North Carolina, said that the area was especially susceptible to a large storm surge because of its funnel-shaped geometry and broad, shallow continental shelf. If there is good news, he said its that the area of possible impact is not as densely populated as other parts of the Gulf Coast, and therefore the human consequences of such a large surge should be less severe than if it hit further west on the Florida Panhandle or further east, in say, Tampa.",Tropical Storm Michael was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on Monday as it barreled toward the Gulf Coast.

ALAN BLINDER,"The language, familiar to people living along the Gulf, came as the state and local authorities readied for a storm whose primary threats appeared to be rainfall and storm surge. Some areas of the coast could record a foot of rain, forecasters said, and officials warned of the threat of flooding. The governors of Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi declared emergencies. Many schools along the coast were closed Tuesday morning, with others expected to shut down in the afternoon. Some districts announced that their classrooms would also be empty on Wednesday. The City of Biloxi, Miss., ordered its harbors and marinas evacuated, affecting about 300 vessels, but local leaders were plainly trying to avoid wide panic. “We’re asking people to do the same things that we’re doing: prepare,” Mayor Andrew Gilich said in a statement. “There’s no reason to be alarmed. We’re being told to expect rain and wind, and we’re preparing accordingly. We expected our citizens to be doing the same.” Although New Orleans, the economic and cultural center of the coast, was not expected to suffer a direct strike, the city’s new mayor, LaToya Cantrell, issued an emergency declaration and a voluntary evacuation order for certain neighborhoods.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","After a sluggish start to eastern Pacific hurricane season, the basin is making up for lost time. Hurricane Bud is the second of back-to-back major hurricanes to form in less than a week. The Category 3 storm is currently churning toward Baja California, though it’s thankfully forecast to weaken before likely landfall this weekend. As of 3 a.m. local time this morning, Bud was still picking up steam roughly 235 miles south of Manzanillo, Mexico. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) put Bud’s winds at 115 mph, making it a Category 3 storm. That’s the threshold for classifying storms as major hurricanes. Meteorologist Ryan Maue tweeted a more recent satellite image with data indicating Bud had reached Category 4 strength with winds around 132 mph. Either way, it’s quite a difference from how the storm looked yesterday. At 4 a.m. local time on Sunday, Bud had winds of just 50 mph, making it a moderate tropical storm. But just as Aletta before it, Bud underwent rapid intensification thanks to warm waters and low wind shear. Rapid intensification is a term used when a storm’s winds increase 65 mph in less than 24 hours. The outer bands of Bud’s winds could reach Mexico, prompting the NHC to issue tropical storm watches from Manzanillo north to the Puerto Vallarta area. The agency also forecast that up to 10 inches of rain could fall in isolated locations on Tuesday and “cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides.” From there, Bud will continue to lumber northward. While the storm is expected to strengthen a bit more in the next day or two, it will then begin gradually decaying as it moves over cooler waters. It could reach Baja California near Los Cabos by Saturday as a tropical storm where floods and mudslides could again be a concern. From there, Bud or its remnants could push into the Southwest. While it’s too early to forecast what locations could be impacted or when they could get hit, it’s worth remembering that tropical systems can bring major flash flooding to the region, so keep an eye out as the forecast develops. The remnants of Hurricane Newton reached Arizona in September 2016, the last time a tropical system impacted the Southwest. Eastern Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 without much fanfare. But the season has since gotten much more active. Bud follows Hurricane Aletta last week. That storm whipped up into a Category 4 hurricane on Friday, thankfully posing no threat to land. Aletta has since been downgraded to a tropical storm and is meandering westward into the Pacific as it weakens. No other storms appear to be on the horizon, but the next one that forms and attains a name will be Carlotta.","After a sluggish start to eastern Pacific hurricane season, the basin is making up for lost time.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Seeing the forest through the trees is so 2018. In the coming years, ecologists are planning to do a lot more listening through the trees in an effort to get a better handle on forest health.
A new study released on Thursday in Science illustrates how deploying simple acoustic monitoring devices in tropical forests can provide new insights into biodiversity. With the falling costs of listening devices and storage, it could soon become feasible to set up a network that gathers a baseline soundscape scientists can use to monitor impact humans are having on the landscape.
Until recently, scientists have had two main avenues to monitor forest health. The first and oldest is trekking into the jungle to take samples and measurements. But that slow, methodical approach only captures a very tiny sliver of whats going on unless youre visiting a lot of places and have long-term monitoring.
More recently, satellites and aerial surveys have given scientists the ability to see the bigger picture. But with the exception of canopy-penetrating LIDAR, those techniques only give scientists a view of the trees. Theres still lots of interesting stuff that can be gleaned from those types of surveys like forest cover, tree health, and large-scale changes. But it doesnt tell us anything about the animals on the ground or what humans may be doing in the understory.
Bioacoustic monitoring aims to fill the gaps of these two methods. The premise is simple: You simply deploy a listening device and then go back and swap out the memory card when its full and voila, you have a wealth of sonic data across a surprisingly large sound theater. 
Some species, like gibbons or hornbills, are comfortably heard 500 meters away and sometimes more, but typically bioacoustic monitors are sampling the soundscape in the immediate couple of hundred meters, Eddie Game, the lead scientist with The Nature Conservancy and co-author of the new paper, told Earther in an email. He noted that most recordings are done at pretty much the range of human hearing and certainly capture birds, amphibians, many mammals and many (maybe most) insects.
Game and his co-authors have done recordings in Papua New Guinea as well as Indonesia. Early results show theres a clear difference between disturbed and undisturbed forests with the latter having a much more dense soundscape. In Puerto Rico, other researchers found a similar phenomenon comparing the soundscape from before and after Hurricane Maria, an indication that there are plenty of other uses for bioacoustic monitoring. 
Thats why Game and company are advocating for more researchers to pick it up as a new tool of the trade in an effort to help conserve more lands and slow the loss of biodiversity in the face of logging, palm oil plantations, farming, climate change, and other threats that have afflicted tropical rainforests. Bioacoustic monitoring alone wont provide a full snapshot of a forest health or if countries are meeting conservation goalssome species dont vocalize (ahem, trees) and its still in its infancy so theres no clear baselinebut Game said it could be a good compliment to satellite and other on-the-ground surveillance tools like camera traps.
The time has never been more ripe to pursue sound monitoring. Game said that while scientists have made recordings in the past, theyve been limited by cost or a narrow focus on one species. Now, a combination of factors have opened the floodgates for more widespread adoption of bioacoustic monitoring. 
Chief among them are smaller units with more memory that are cheaper than their predecessors. Game said units that were once more than $3,000 now run in the $500 range, allowing researchers to deploy more of them and sample the landscape as a whole as opposed to focusing on a specific area or species. The rise in computing power and machine learning has also opened up new ways to analyze the massive amounts of sound data. 
Beyond the scientific value of such work, bioacoustic monitoring gives the rest of us a chance to hear places we may never get the chance to visit. You dont have to be an ecologist to hear what makes those places special.","Seeing the forest through the trees is so 2018.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","One of the most well-studied tropical forests on Earth has seen its insect populations crash since the 1970s with effects rippling up the food chain, an alarming new study has found. Published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, the Rensselaer Polytechnic University researcher-led study shows a 10-60 fold decline in the abundance of insects in Puerto Ricos Luquillo Rainforest, the only tropical forest in the U.S. national forest system. The authors say rising temperatures are the most likely culprit, raising the possibility that the base of the food web could be unraveling elsewhere as climate change turns up the heat on rainforests around the globe. Comparing 1976 to 2011-2013, the new study found a massive drop in the weight of insects collected in traps from two long-term research sites. Twenty years of data on the abundance of more than 120 groups of canopy insects revealed a similar decline. The researchers found a concomitant drop in the abundance of insect-eating lizards, frogs, and birds. This loss of life correlated with steady uptick in mean maximum temperatures at the study sites. Across the two sites, the hottest days have become 2 degrees Celsius hotter since the 1970s. Correlation does not necessarily imply causation, but the authors arent really sure what else could be driving the insect die-offs. The forest has remained largely undisturbed since receiving protection in the early 20th century, and agriculture has been on the decline across the region. Pesticides which were implicated in a study showing major insect declines in German nature reserves last yearseem an unlikely culprit. Lead author Bradford Lister told Earther that a statistical analysis used to determine causality also pointed to the strong effect of temperature on insect declines. [O]ur initial results are very suggestive [of a climate change effect] but to extrapolate to other rainforest ecosystems we need more data, he said. James Cook University tropical ecologist Bill Laurance was less sure about that linkage, noting in an email to Earther that you cant get away from the fact that we live in a complicated world with lots of environmental changes happening all at once, from pollution to habitat disruption. The results are certainly alarminginsects are the base or a key part of an incredible wealth of ecological interactions Laurance wrote. Are the declines down to global warming? Its hard to say any for sure. Tropical ecologist Dan Janzen, who has been working in Costa Rican rainforests for decades, said he did not find the results surprising. He told Earther he thought rising temperatures are massively contributing to the trend the paper saw, but that it was already well on its way long before people started noticing climate change. More field studies and different lines of data could certainly help shore up the idea that rising temperatures are driving an unraveling of the food web. At the same time, as Lister noted, the findings underscore the need for more research on the effects of climate change across the tropics at large. Historically, scientists have paid far more attention to how climate change impacts temperate and high-latitude ecosystems. But a growing body of research suggests many tropical species are specialized to a narrow range of temperatures, having never experienced seasonal swings. Tropical mountains, in particular, feature unique microclimates that can be lost entirely as temperatures rise. And thats to say nothing of changes in rainfall and extreme weather events that are affecting tropical forests worldwide. Home to an enormous fraction of Earths biodiversity, right now, these ecosystems are flying blind into a hotter, weirder future.","One of the most well-studied tropical forests on Earth has seen its insect populations crash since the 1970s with effects rippling up the food chain, an alarming new study has found.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","It’s the statistical peak of Atlantic hurricane season today, and it appears the message has been received. The tropical Atlantic has spawned three hurricanes, but none is more worrisome than Hurricane Florence. The National Hurricane Center advisory at 11 a.m. listed Florence as a Category 3 storm, with winds of 115 mph. That’s the threshold for major hurricanes. A hurricane hunter aircraft passed through at noon, however, and found Florence had winds of 130 mph, making it a Category 4 storm. Forecasts indicate Florence will continue to undergo rapid intensification, a meteorological term for when a storm see sustained winds increase at least 35 mph over a 24-hour period. “Further strengthening is anticipated, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday,” the National Hurricane center wrote in its Monday morning update. The unfortunate forecast is due to a few factors. All weekend, Florence had strong upper level winds that kept it from really being able to wind up. But those winds have since slackened and Florence’s structure has become much more stable from Sunday night into Monday. Weekly sea surface temperature departure from normal in the Atlantic. Image: NOAA The second big factor favoring Florence’s rapid intensification is the remarkably warm ocean. The storm is cruising over an area where ocean surface temperatures are up to 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), providing more fuel to turbocharge the hurricane. Those temperatures are about 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal for this time of year. “Now that Florence has these ingredients, and is developing a ring of intense storms around its eye, it will likely continue to strengthen to a major hurricane, likely a Category 4 storm soon,” Brian Tang, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Albany, told Earther shortly before the Category 3 and Category 4 updates came in. Tang pointed to Harvey, Irma, and Maria last year as examples of other rapidly intensifying hurricanes in the Atlantic. But Florence still stands out in how much it’s expected to intensify. University of Oklahoma meteorology PhD student Sam Lillo tweeted that Sunday’s Florence forecast from the National Hurricane Center called for it to be the most rapidly intensifying Atlantic storm in the past 20 years. It’s a shockingly high-confidence forecast, but one that’s based on all available lines of evidence. “Given that these models have been unanimous, cycle after cycle, in predicting Florence undergoing rapid intensification, it has given forecasters at the NHC confidence to also forecast rapid intensification,” Tang said. Research published earlier this year indicates the magnitude of rapidly intensifying Atlantic storms is on the rise. Using satellite data from 1986-2015, the researchers found that rapidly intensifying storms saw wind speeds increase 4.4 mph per decade in the eastern and central Atlantic (there was no trend in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico). The researchers attribute this to the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), which is marked by warm waters in the Atlantic. But they also don’t rule out a climate change, which has warmed oceans the world over. Whatever the role the AMO and climate change play in influencing Florence, the impacts of the storm will likely be acute and potentially deadly. The storm is expected to smash into the East Coast by late Thursday delivering powerful surge, winds, and torrential rains. If you live anywhere between Georgia and New Jersey, pay very close attention to the forecast in the coming days.","It’s the statistical peak of Atlantic hurricane season today, and it appears the message has been received.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The Atlantic hurricane season has suddenly found its legs. Following some summer doldrums, a number of factors have come together to fuel a run of tropical weather. That includes Hurricane Florence, which just became the first major hurricane of the season. The storm reached Category 3 status—the threshold for major hurricanes—on Wednesday morning. The storm was packing winds of 120 mph and the National Hurricane Center said it was “still strengthening.” The storm is still out in the middle of the Atlantic, which is good news. Hurricane-force winds extend only 15 miles from its center, making it only slightly bigger than Hurricane Beryl, this season’s first hurricane (though that said, tropical storm-force winds extend 90 miles from the storm’s its core). The bad news, though, is that Florence strengthened faster than predicted. It’s also now likely to maintain hurricane strength through the weekend as opposed to yesterday’s forecast indicating it would dip back into tropical storm status. All of this is a concern because recent weather model runs take it near Bermuda by the middle of next week, with a possible U.S. landfall after that. This is not say landfall in either location is by any means a given, but it does mean that Florence is worth watching if you live in either locale. September is usually the most active time of Atlantic hurricane season, and this year has proven to be no exception. Colorado State hurricane guru Philip Klotzbach tweeted that on average, one major hurricane has formed by September 5, so we’re pretty on schedule. The tropics are expected to stay active for the next few weeks as a parade of potential storms could form. That includes an area of low pressure currently sitting to the west of Africa that’s likely to become a tropical depression by the end of this week.","The Atlantic hurricane season has suddenly found its legs.

"Ari Phillips on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Washington, D.C. is famous for its cherry blossoms, but someday it could also be renowned for its palm trees. That’s according to a new study looking at how palm trees are expanding into northern parts of the world that have long been too cold for the iconic tropical trees. There are over 2,500 species of living palm trees, and while the vast majority of them survive only in tropical climates, some are more hardy and can grow in places that regularly get snow. As climate change warms the planet, countless plants and animals are migrating into new habitats made more suitable for their survival. Palm trees are no different. The study, published in Nature’s Scientific Reports, found that a palm tree’s latitudinal limit is determined by the average temperature of a region’s coldest month. If that average is above 2 degrees Celsius, or 36 degrees Fahrenheit, the palm may be able to successfully propagate in the wild. According to Tammo Reichgelt, a Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory researcher who led the study, this means that at an average of 34 degrees Fahrenheit in January, Washington, D.C. is just a little too cold to host palm trees, “but that you can expect range expansion in the coming decades as average winter temperatures warm up.” Looks like the National Arboretum might need to make room for some new species. Average January temperatures in slightly farther south Norfolk, Virginia, and Greenville, North Carolina, have not dropped below 36 degrees Fahrenheit in January since the 80s, according to the study—long enough for a palm to grow to maturity. “But if that is actually the case also depends on other factors, such as the presence of cultivars and the amount of competition with the natural vegetation,” Reichgelt said. “I would love to see the data that shows how the range of palmettos has changed in eastern North America, or fan palms in California, but unfortunately I do not have that data.” Reichgelt told Earther that for many palm lineages, the average temperature of a place didn’t matter as much as the yearly temperature range. This could also impact the ability of palm trees to thrive in certain tropical locales as they face increased heat driven by climate change, which “could be detrimental to palms in those places.” Palm trees grow very quickly and thus their cells cannot go dormant in winter. They are also very aesthetically appealing, and when people plant them in non-native areas it allows the palms to potentially establish new strongholds in the wild. Reichgelt said that in Florida alone there are seven “category 2” invasive palm species that were introduced as ornamental plants but have since established healthy wild populations. For now they are co-existing with native flora, but eventually they could become “category 1” invasives if they begin to harm or displace local vegetation. David Greenwood, a paleobotanist from Brandon University who also worked on the study, said the authors wanted to see how cold some palms could go. Greenwood told Earther that the Chinese windmill palm (Trachycarpus fortunei) is especially cold hardy, and is commonly cultivated for this reason. Windmill palms have recently been found in the forests of southern Switzerland—the foothills of the Alps—after one such decorative palm escaped and spread “simply because frost is not as prevalent as it used to be,” according to the study. “A little bit more warming will see their seedlings survive winters.” Greenwood said for a palm to colonize a new region, its seedlings must be able to survive their first winter. “So just because you can grow a windmill palm or another cold-tolerant palm in your yard in Utah, British Columbia, or Ohio, doesn’t mean that species can colonize the nearby woods,” he said. “But this is of course changing as the climate gets warmer.” Greenwood said parts of the Northeast, Northwest, and neighboring areas of Canada are close to a winter climate that could allow cold-tolerant palms to become established. “In all of these areas palms in people’s gardens are flowering and setting fruit, which means the temperatures are now warm enough for that step in their reproduction,” he said. “A little bit more warming will see their seedlings survive winters.”","Washington, D.C. is famous for its cherry blossoms, but someday it could also be renowned for its palm trees.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","After two mercifully quiet months, the Atlantic hurricane season has suddenly roared to life. There are currently two storms spinning in the Atlantic basin with a potential third on the horizon. While it’s not like 2017's record-setting run of storms, the sudden spate of unwelcome activity is the result of similar climate conditions. And those conditions are likely to persist for the next few weeks just as we reach the statistical peak of hurricane season, meaning we could see more storms spin up. The two active storms are Tropical Storm Gordon and Hurricane Florence. The former poses a pretty serious threat to Gulf Coast, with the National Hurricane Center forecasting it will intensify into a hurricane and make landfall on Tuesday night with life-threatening storm surge from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle. It could also dump up to a foot of rain. Florence, meanwhile, reached hurricane strength on Tuesday morning, though it’s expected to weaken to a tropical storm and then restrengthen to a hurricane again. It could reach Bahamas by early next week and possibly the East Coast, but that’s still a long ways away. Ryan Truchelut, the president and chief forecaster at WeatherTiger, told Earther that he’s concerned about Florence’s threat to the Bahamas in the near-term, but the odds of it reaching the East Coast are low given its track and historical precedent. Finally, there’s a tropical wave off Africa. Waves are often precursors to tropical storm systems characterized by low pressure and thunderstorms. This one currently has a 70 percent chance of becoming a full fledged tropical system within the next five days. What happens after that is still up in the air. Regardless of the unnamed wave’s fate, things are definitely rumbling along after the Atlantic basin went nearly two months without a hurricane. There are two climate shifts helping stir the basin up. Or more to the point, there’s one that’s happening and one that isn’t. The one that’s happening is the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which is characterized by a band of rainstorms that move around the equator influencing the convection of air masses in the tropics. It recently “shifted into a pattern more favorable for upward motion and tropical cyclone development in the Atlantic,” according to Bob Henson, a meteorologist with Weather Underground. Henson noted that the Madden-Julian Oscillation could stay in its current phase for weeks, meaning we could see activity continue. This is particularly true since mid-September is the statistical peak of hurricane season in the Atlantic basin. Then there’s the climate shift that isn’t happening. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has had an El Niño watch in place since June. El Niño is characterized by a warming of eastern tropical Pacific that in turn impacts the atmosphere. One of those impacts is increased upper level winds blowing into the Atlantic that can rip apart hurricanes or inhibit them from forming. “[T]he progress toward that predicted El Niño event has stalled over the last month, so the potential suppressive effects on the Atlantic tropics aren’t increasing,” Henson said. He also noted that trade winds in the Atlantic are weaker than normal right now, making life easier still for tropical storms to spin up. A third factor is temperatures in the main development region, the area of the tropical Atlantic where hurricanes traditionally form. For nearly all of hurricane season, temperatures in this region have been cooler than normal by roughly 1-2 degrees Fahrenheit—enough to slow down convection and deprive storms of humid fuel. Since bottoming out in late July, though, ocean temperatures in the main development region have been steadily increasing. “Recently, sea surface temperatures in the main development region have returned to near-normal levels,” Allison Wing, a hurricane researcher at Florida State, told Earther. All of these conditions are likely to continue to grip the region over the next few weeks, meaning that even in a hurricane season forecast to be quieter than normal, things could get active. Truchelut worries that any storms forming after Florence could be more problematic for the U.S., particularly with the way a ridge of high pressure is expected to build in the coming weeks. “ I am more concerned about the waves following Florence, particularly if they are slower to develop and thus travel westward rather than west-northwestward for an extended period of time,” he said. “The broad ridge that ensembles suggest will be in place over the east-central U.S. for at least 11-15 days is a dangerous steering pattern that is capable of moving storms that reach the Lesser Antilles towards Florida and the Gulf Coast.” In other words, pay attention to the forecast.","After two mercifully quiet months, the Atlantic hurricane season has suddenly roared to life.

 The storm is the second deadliest to hit the Philippines in 2018
More than 60 people have died after a powerful storm struck the Philippines, with locals reportedly taken by surprise by its strength.
Storm Usman hit the Bicol region southeast of capital Manila on Saturday.
At least 17 people are missing and the death toll is expected to rise.
One official told AFP news agency that people did not take precautions as it was not classed as a typhoon under the government's alert system.
""People were overconfident because they were on vacation mode and there was no tropical cyclone warning,"" Bicol civil defence director Claudio Yucot said.
Although the storm did not have strong winds, it brought heavy rains which triggered deadly landslides.
The tropical depression has destroyed infrastructure and displaced more than 40,000 people nationwide.

Patrick Howell O'Neill,"The day started with an intense tropical storm consuming San Francisco, but by evening the clouds had parted just in time for a group of grinning and excited venture capitalists, techies, and real estate agents to gather at atop a downtown highrise that overlooks the city all the way to across the Bay to Oakland.
Everyone was there to discuss all the money to be made off the newest class of overnight millionaires that Silicon Valley is about to birth.
2019 is slated to produce an extraordinarily long list of multi-billion-dollar IPOs from San Francisco Bay Area heavyweights like Lyft, Uber, Palantir, Pinterest, Airbnb, Slack, Postmates, and Instacart. The result will be a massive and sudden injection of liquid cash into a region already infamous for both the nations priciest real estate as well as a vast and growing wealth gap between rich and poor neighbors.
On stage at Mondays event, a three-hour catered affair titled Tech IPOs effect on Bay Area Real Estate held in DocuSign headquarters, Deniz Kahramaner, a big data real estate agent at the tech real estate firm Compass, laid out a series of shocking numbers about what to expect as San Franciscos rich prepare to get so much richer. He estimated $250 billion in total valuation of the local companies expected to IPO this year, based on private investment, which dwarves anything seen in half a decade.
Are we going to see a one bedroom condo worth less than $1 million in five years? Deniz Kahramaner, a big data real estate agent at a company called Compass rhetorically asked the room. Probably not.
When Bravo reality television star and Sothebys real estate agent Roh Habibi took the stage, he thought out loud about whether his newly IPO-rich clients should spend $9 million on a single San Francisco property or buy three $3 million properties spread out around Northern California.
A few miles away, Oakland High School teacher Matt Fields lives in a two bedroom apartment with three people. Even sharing a bedroom with a friend, Fields still pays around $1,000 monthly in rent in order to live in the community where he teaches.
The City of Oakland is three days into a public school teacher strike centered around the difficulty of living in the Bay Area on a non-tech salary.
Combined with student loans and the learning curve any second-year teacher faces, Fields says his $47,000 salary and glacial pace of raises makes the grueling first few years of teaching even more taxing. The result is an extraordinarily highteacher turnover rate in every corner of Oakland.
If union demands for higher teacher salary and better school conditions are met, Fields says, the best case scenario is that he may be able to rent his own bedroom inside a shared apartment.
Its not an option to fail, Fields told Gizmodo in a conversation about the strike. Were in a situation right now where I, as a college educated, second-year teacher, cannot even afford to have my own bedroom in the place where I teach, and that needs to change.
I have been reconciled for some time to the fact that my own income is not enough to support my family in Oakland, Lara Trale, an English teacher at Oakland High School, said on Monday to Gizmodo by phone. Students and families are being priced out too. Ive seen the same thing to happen to colleagues. Theyre excited, motivated, and driven but feel like they cant make a lifelong living in a place where they have to share a room.
The imminent slate of tech IPOs promises to push real estate prices higher in what is already the costliest market in the country, according to multiple studies as well as the real estate agents in the room at DocuSign.
That is super beneficial, Habibi told a rapt crowd of real estate brokers on Monday, for the tech industry rich who will be readily buying and the real estate agents who will be aggressively selling. For people stuck on the outside looking in, the view is turning dark.
Back inside DocuSign headquarters, its bright as hell. A group of real estate agents couldnt help themselves from uttering wow out loud with every new big dollar figure on center stage: 211 techie buyers projected to purchase property above $10 million, thousands expected to buy above $1 million, and San Franciscos real estate dominated by buyers51.1 percent of whom come from the software industrywho are about to have a whole lot more money in their pocket.
Laughs and maybe a little jealousy hit when the conversation turned to Nema, a luxury housing company known for building and buying property within walking distance to tech giant headquarters in downtown San Francisco and then selling at absurd prices to engineers who readily pay whatever it takes to avoid public transportation. Heres a $6,303 per month studio from Nema near Ubers headquarters, in case you happen to be nearby and about to come into a windfall of cash.
As you might expect from a crowd like this, Californias income inequality gap and housing crisisproblems deemed a code red by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsomnever came up during Monday nights beautifully catered event.
Instead, the panels last question probed Habibi about the flashiest pads hed sold recently to clients rich enough to buy huge amounts of land in the heart of Silicon Valley. A panel consisting of a real estate agents, tech CEO, and venture capitalist was congratulated as a very well balanced conversation about the impact of new tech IPOs. The teachers like Fields and Trale, up since 6:30 am that morning to strike despite flash flood warnings, went unrepresented and unmentioned.
I wish I had a clever, optimistic answer, Anthemos Georgiades, CEO at the real estate startup Zumper, said. But the next two to three years, if you look at the liquidity about to come to market with these IPOs, and then you look at how few buildings coming to market that would actually bring inventory. Its basic supply and demand. It makes no sense to think anything will get cheaper.
For someone who doesnt make what a Facebook employee doesthe company has a median annual salary of $240,000 the prospects of living in and around Silicon Valley and the entire San Francisco Bay Area is now more uncertain, even for the students who were born, raised, and recently began their public education there.
Its a crisis, Newsom said last year when he was running for governor. We cant live on intentions. At the end of the day, if you want to move the mouse, youve got to move the cheese. The middle class of the state is leaving in droves. This is a Code Red in California.","The day started with an intense tropical storm consuming San Francisco, but by evening the clouds had parted just in time for a group of grinning and excited venture capitalists, techies, and real estate agents to gather at atop a downtown highrise that overl…",2019-02-26T20:20:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",Upcoming Tech IPOs Will Mint Hundreds of Overnight Millionaires and Silicon Valley Vultures Are Licking Their Chops,https://gizmodo.com/upcoming-tech-ipos-will-mint-hundreds-of-overnight-mill-1832889859,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--b15-Czv1--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/za0ctle2zvxsnnyzkdes.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,tropical,1
Andrew Freedman,"Severe weather has been hammering parts of the south central Mediterranean this week, with heavy snow falling in the Alps, torrential rains in lower elevations along with powerful winds, and high waves affecting Italy, in particular. Deadly flash flooding has also occurred in Greece, as the low pressure area sitting to that country's west vaults moisture northward around its eastern periphery. The storm system responsible for this inclement weather is just getting started, however. Computer models show the storm will become a small but powerful hybrid system with some of the characteristics of a tropical cyclone typically found in the North Atlantic Ocean Basin. SEE ALSO: Major federal climate report rebuts everything Trump administration has said about climate change Such storms, known as ""medicanes,"" are relatively rare, but not unheard of. The storm is expected to move south and east of Italy through Thursday while intensifying, and then hug the coast of Greece, where it could bring damaging winds, heavy rain, high waves, and other hazards. By late this week and into the weekend, the storm — be it a purely tropical system or a hybrid storm — will be located just southwest of the Greek coast, with heavy rain and severe thunderstorms affecting that country. During the Thursday through Saturday period, the low pressure area is forecast to move southeast of Italy, and to the west of Greece, while becoming better organized. Low atmospheric wind shear (meaning winds won't change much in direction or speed with height), is forecast for that area, and ocean surface temperatures are relatively mild. Computer model projections show a small, closed circulation system that could have subtropical to tropical characteristics, with a ring of thunderstorms and strong winds surrounding a calmer inner core. Surface wind forecast for Friday, Nov. 17, 2017. Note the donut-shaped circulation near the Greek coast. Image: weatherbell When tropical systems, either subtropical or fully tropical, occur in the Mediterranean, they are usually much smaller in area than their cousins in the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans, and there's actually some scientific debate over how to classify them in the first place. The structure of a storm matters because it governs how such storms may affect areas that they hit. Interestingly, medicanes typically occur during October and November, which is at the tail end of the Atlantic hurricane season. Satellite image of 2014 medicane that struck Malta.

George Dvorsky,"For nearly 100 years, scientists havent been able to agree on the evolutionary origins of a strange, now-extinct monkey that lived and thrived in Jamaica for thousands of years. New research suggests its ancestors arrived from South America, and that life on this tropical island caused the species to acquire its odd set of features. This extinct Jamaican monkey, called Xenothrix mcgregori, was first discovered by scientists in the 1920s, who found traces of its skull and teeth. Other discoveries since then, including more skulls, some leg bones, and bits of jaw, suggested a species of monkey unlike any other known, extinct or extant. Living in Jamaica, Xenothrix did not have to contend with predators. It had weirdly rodent-like legs, relatively few teeth, and a body plan similar to the loris. This small monkey was likely a tree-dweller, moving slowly from branch to branch like a shrunken sloth (the researchers compare it in size to a capuchin monkey, which grows only 12 to 22 inches in length). This plethora of odd features led to questions about Xenothrix s evolutionary roots, with some experts speculating that it came from a unique or unknown branch of ancient New World primates. Scientists, in addition to struggling with its strange morphology, found it difficult to obtain DNA from the bones of these extinct tropical animals; high temperatures and humidity destroys DNA very quickly. New research published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences is now putting the history of this mysterious primate into clearer focus. Genetic analysis of four Xenothrix specimens found in Jamaican caves suggests its closely related to South Americas titi monkey. These creatures likely arrived to Jamaica by clinging to rafts of floating vegetation, the researchers say. This latest study was conducted by scientists from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), Londons Natural History Museum (NHM), and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Xenothrix was an extremely derived titi monkey that underwent major body-plan modifications after arriving and colonizing their new island environment, the researchers write in the study. Ancient DNA indicates that the Jamaican monkey is really just a titi monkey with some unusual morphological features, not a wholly distinct branch of New World monkey, Ross MacPhee, a co-author of the study and a scientist at the American Museum of Natural Historys Mammalogy Department, said in a statement. The deposits from which these samples were recovered date back relatively recently1,400 to 900 years agoso these creatures likely lived alongside human settlers. Xenothrix, the researchers say, was likely the last living Caribbean primate. The research team used an established dating technique known as direct accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) to date the samples. Interestingly, these dates are roughly consistent with the accounts of European settlers who described an unknown monkey-like animal living on the island. Genetic analysis suggests the ancestors of Xenothrix arrived to Jamaica from South America around 11 million years ago during the Late Middle Miocene. DNA evidence also suggests that the ancestors of Xenothrix arrived on the island on multiple occasions. These animals may have clung to rafts of natural vegetation, which were washed out from the mouths of large South American rivers, the researchers say. These ancient monkeys were not the only South American animal to have endured such an aquatic journey. Large extant rodents, called hutias, likely arrived to the Caribbean islands in a similar manner. This study also shows how island environments can influence the evolutionary trajectory of animals in dramatic ways. Islands have produced miniature elephants, Hobbit humans, gigantic birds and rats, and, in this case, sloth-like primates. This new understanding of the evolutionary history of Xenothrix shows that evolution can take unexpected paths when animals colonize islands and are exposed to new environments, said ZSL scientist and study co-author Samuel Turvey in a statement. However, the extinction of Xenothrix, which evolved on an island without any native mammal predators, highlights the great vulnerability of unique island biodiversity in the face of human impacts. The researchers arent sure how or why Xenothrix went extinct, but hunting and loss of habitat likely played a part. As for inferring the exact appearance of Xenothrix, thats more difficult, owing to the poor fossil record. The researchers say it likely looked like a kinkajou or a night monkey. Today, the still-living titi monkeys are small, tree-dwelling creatures that feature long, soft fur with red, brown, grey, and black coloring. These animals are highly vocal and territorial, and are active during the day. Titi monkeys live up to 12 years, and the fathers often care for the young.

Mark Kaufman,"Hurricanes and typhoons — the monstrous, destructive storms that bring extreme wind and rain to coasts around the world — are slowing their pace as they traverse the globe. After assessing every tropical cyclone on record between 1949 and 2016, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientist James Kossin found that the storms have slowed down in every ocean, save the Northern Indian. This research, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, concluded these storms are now moving about 10 percent slower on average than they did in the past, though regional speeds in specific oceans vary. SEE ALSO: Hurricane damage could triple in the U.S. if global warming goes unchecked At first blush, 10 percent might sound like a relatively small percentage, but in reality, it's a big deal, said Kossin, in an interview. A storm that sits still over one place for an extended period of time brings that much more wind and rain to that area. ""Nothing good can come of a slower storm,"" said Kossin. Hurricane Harvey on August 25, 2017, when it reached maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. Image: nOaa Hurricanes already bring a number of well-known hazards — flooding, pummeling winds, and surging seas — all which can prove fatal and wreak havoc on infrastructure. In a May 2018 report, NOAA said last year's Hurricane Harvey, which stalled over Houston, was responsible for the direct deaths of at least 68 Americans. ""It's safe to say you want them [hurricanes] to get out of your neighborhood as quickly as possible,"" said Kossin. Hurricane Harvey may have been exceptional — breaking rainfall records while dumping over four feet of rain onto Houston — but any cyclone can wreak havoc if slowed or stalled. ""Sitting still for two days is a big deal,"" Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane researcher at Florida International University who had no role in the study, said in an interview. Willoughby noted that there's another culprit at play here, too. With every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit) rise in global temperature, the atmosphere becomes capable of holding 7 percent more water vapor, which provides fuel for heavier downpours. A Houston resident paddles through his home following Hurricane Harvey. Image: John Glaser/CSM/REX/Shutterstock ""This research gives a pretty good picture of what we should expect in the future,"" said Willoughby. ""The threat to the U.S. is from flooding."" Atmospheric scientists, like Kossin, have a pretty good idea about why these storms are slowing down as well. Warming global temperatures, especially the accelerated heating of the Arctic, are disrupting the way air travels through the atmosphere. One of these changes amount to a weakening circulation of tropical air, particularly during the summer. These winds, and others, are hugely influential as they push major storms around ""a bit like a cork in a stream,"" said Kossin. ""It makes physical sense that they should be slowing down,"" said Willoughby, adding that there's still not quite enough historical storm data to say for certain that the storms have slowed as much as the new study shows. ""Stuff happened out in the ocean before 1950 that we didn’t know about,"" said Willoughby. Today, NOAA has a sophisticated group of weather-tracking satellites, so in the coming years scientists' grasp of storm trends will only improve. But at the same time, global temperatures will almost certainly increase, perhaps by 6 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century if the global community fails to rein in carbon emissions. Image: noaa Damage to U.S. communities and coastlines from future hurricanes are expected to hit the U.S. economy quite hard. Research published in the journal Environmental Research Letters found that future storms — enhanced by rising seas and carrying more water — could bring three times the amount of economic damage than infrastructure-pummeling tempests do today. Over the nearly 70 years of hurricane data Kossin analyzed, the planet warmed by half a degree Celsius (about 1 degree Fahrenheit) on average, but it's unknown what will happen with another degree of warming or more, said Kossin. There could be more than a 10 percent drop in storm speed — or perhaps less. What is known, however, is that while deaths from surging stormwaters on U.S. coastlines have gone down over the decades, inland flooding has become a substantially higher risk for death, said Kossin.

When the water got too shallow and the boat scraped bottom, the men hopped out and waded, grabbing pieces of fence post and siding to sound the depth of the water in front of them. Finally, a blue two-story house on Summer Haven Lane emerged from the trees. As they approached, a woman’s palm pressed up against a dark second-story window. “Hey!

Mark Kaufman,"At the end of May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its 2018 hurricane forecast, predicting a likely active or above active season in the Atlantic Ocean — though certainly not on par with 2017's exceptionally stormy season. But almost a month later, conditions in the Atlantic are showing signs that the 2018 season might be quieter than forecasters initially thought. SEE ALSO: Hurricanes are slowing down, and that's very bad news for everyone Specifically, surface water temperatures in the tropical Atlantic are unusually cold. When these waters are cooler, it tends to damper the formation of powerful storms, Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University, said in an interview. ""This is very unusual,"" said Klotzbach. Back in March, the cooler water temperatures were pretty similar to those a year earlier, in March 2017. But since then, tropical waters have simply failed to warm. Tropical Atlantic sea surface temps (SSTs) (10-20°N, 60-20°W) remain at record cold levels (since 1982) for mid-June. About 0.2°C colder than prior coldest (1985) and nearly 1.7°C cooler than last year at this time. Colder SSTs typically mean quieter Atlantic #hurricane seasons pic.twitter.com/dcexoXkUJn — Philip Klotzbach (@philklotzbach) June 15, 2018 ""The water went from normal to the coldest since 1982,"" said Klotzbach. ""It's the coldest water temperature at this time over the last 35 years."" This is all the more strange, he said, because globally oceans have warmed. Most of the world's accumulating heat, due to climate change, collects in Earth's absorbent waters. ""To me, it's just fascinating given how much warmer the globe is,"" said Klotzbach. Of course, this is not to say a powerful, potentially destructive storm won't arise and pummel the Caribbean or the coastal U.S. ""It’s not an inactive season when the wind blows 100 mph in your backyard,"" Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane researcher at Florida International University, said in an interview. ""It doesn’t mean you can’t have bad luck."" Hurricane forecasts are never set in stone In late May, just before the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season on June 1, NOAA predicted just a 25 percent chance of a ""below normal"" season. A calmer season may look more likely now, but forecasting the weather months in advance is always challenging, and comes with inherent uncertainties. ""The ocean is as unpredictable as the atmosphere but on a longer timescale,"" said Willoughby. NOAA's 2018 Atlantic hurricane forecast as of May 24, 2018. Image: noaa And NOAA took this into account, months ago. The agency noted that although the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean waters, known as the ""main hurricane development"" region, had ""anomalously cool"" waters at the time, there was still considerable uncertainty about what would happen during August and September, the peak of the hurricane season, Jerry Bell, the lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, explained over email. When temperatures in the tropical waters remain cooler and don't warm, a few things can suppress hurricane activity, said Klotzbach. For one, hurricanes ""live off warm ocean water,"" he said, so these storms have less fuel when ocean temperatures are colder. Second, colder sea surfaces generally mean more dense air over large swathes of the ocean — and with denser air comes more overall stability. Lastly, colder tropical waters often mean stronger trade winds blowing from the east that can ""tears apart hurricanes,"" said Klotzbach. Hurricanes Katia, Irma, and Jose in September 2017. Image: Noaa If these tropical waters don't warm up soon, conditions will be mostly locked in for a milder storm season. ""There's still some time for it to change,"" said Klotzbach. ""But usually when you get to July things are set."" ""If it's going to change, it's got to change soon,"" he added. Hurricane forecasts are still quite important, despite any inherent uncertainty. ""A forecast — if you have a realistic idea of its credibility — is better than no forecast,"" said Willoughby. These forecasts can help slow-moving ocean tugs decide if they should take other oceanic routes, for instance. But most of all, ""It's good for getting people started thinking about hurricanes,"" said Willoughby. NOAA measures sea surface temperatures in a variety of ways, including ocean gliders. Image: noaa Last season brought three major storms to the United States, causing $265 billion in damages. In addition to cooler tropical waters, NOAA has raised the possibility of a 2018 El Niño event in the Pacific, which often brings stronger opposing winds to the Atlantic. ""That's very well understood,"" said Willoughby. ""It kills hurricanes."" Both hurricane scientists and the public alike will see how things ultimately take shape this season — though many won't find a quieter season too disappointing. ""I have to admit that an inactive season wouldn’t break my heart,"" said Willoughby.","At the end of May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its 2018 hurricane forecast, predicting a likely active or above active season in the Atlantic Ocean — though certainly not on par with 2017's exceptionally stormy season. …",2018-06-21T14:26:18Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}","This Atlantic hurricane season may be quieter than expected, and no one's complaining",https://mashable.com/2018/06/21/quiet-2018-atlantic-hurricane-season/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PsA7nA6J0cp_tVTXNoUrdiZTFbc=/1200x630/2018%2F06%2F21%2F2f%2Febf7e8d3ba3348abbf3870b11f968047.24991.jpg,mashable,Mashable,tropical,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","It’s the summer of apocalypse weather with wildfires, heat waves, and drought. But it looks like we could be granted a reprieve from the fourth horseman of the weather apocalypse—hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration updated its hurricane forecast on Thursday, and hey, good news. Due to a burgeoning El Niño, it’s likely that the rest of Atlantic hurricane season will be quieter than normal. It only takes one hurricane to do damage, though, and the peak of hurricane season is still ahead, so we’re not out of the woods yet. The forecast calls for 4-7 hurricanes, of which up to two could become major ones with winds of Category 3 or greater strength. All told, NOAA is forecasting there will be 9-13 named storms. That includes tropical storms, hurricanes’ weaker sibling (though they can still dump copious amounts of rain). Overall, forecasters give this season 60 percent odds of being less active than usual, a huge uptick from the 25 percent forecast issued in May. Saharan dust has played a role in tamping down activity, as have cooler-than-normal waters in the part of the Atlantic where tropical storms and hurricanes tend to form. But the biggest reason forecasters think this year could be quiet is the creeping presence of an El Niño, which is characterized by warm waters in the eastern tropical Pacific. Those warm waters kickstart a series of changes in the atmosphere, including powerful upper level winds that cut across the Atlantic hurricane basin and tear storms apart or prevent them from spinning up at all. Some storm systems will inevitably defy the odds, though, which is why forecasters continue to urge anyone living near the coast to stay vigilant. “There are still more storms to come—the hurricane season is far from being over,” Gerry Bell, NOAA’s lead seasonal hurricane forecaster, said in a statement. This Atlantic hurricane season has been a bit of a weird one so far. It started a few days early when a subtropical storm (yet another flavor of hurricane-like weather) formed in the Gulf of Mexico. Said storm then turned tropical as it passed over land and basically made landfall again on the Great Lakes, all of which is extremely not normal. Three other storms have formed including tiny ass Hurricane Beryl, the first hurricane of the season. The lower odds of a season of horrors like last year are a welcome forecast if ever there was one even with the statistical peak of hurricane season still ahead and the official end months away.","It’s the summer of apocalypse weather with wildfires, heat waves, and drought.

Rayne Ellis,"Well folks, we officially have our first major Atlantic hurricane of the 2018 season. Early Wednesday afternoon the National Hurricane Center announced that Hurricane Florence, a storm brewing 2,205 miles off the coast of Bermuda, has intensified into a major storm. A hurricane is considered “major” or intense when wind speeds exceed 111 mph, which means it's at least a Category 3 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). SEE ALSO: Hurricane Maria is the deadliest storm of the 21st century “This is almost exactly on target,"" NOAA representative Dennis Feltgen said in an interview. ""The typical day to see the first major hurricane is September 4. It’s September 5."" “Tropical Storm Gordon just hit the south, so we’ve seen seven storms already. On average, we see seven storms by September 16, so we are actually above the average,” Feltgen said. There's also a lot of uncertainty about what track Florence will take or if it will impact land at all. But there's no reason to panic, at least not yet. Models predicting the storm's path vary by 1,000 miles and meteorologists aren’t even sure if the hurricane will go north, south, turn out to the east or keep barrelling toward the west. Careful proclaiming #Florence will go west. Lots to figure out here, as short-term motion may ultimately determine long-term track. Red dot below shows where Florence crossed 45W this morning relative to 0Z EPS (from @Weathernerds ). It's way on north side of guidance for now. pic.twitter.com/7RGLMhjpjM — Levi Cowan (@TropicalTidbits) September 5, 2018 “This is certainly a storm to watch, but it’s too early to know if we’re in danger if it’s just a fish storm,” meteorologist Philip Klotzbach said in an interview. “If every model that predicted that a hurricane would hit the U.S., actually hit the U.S., the east coast would be uninhabitable.” Any prediction made this far in advance is made with uncertainty, Klotzbach explained. “If the National Hurricane Center could do 10 day forecasts with skill, they would,"" Klotzbach said. ""In 50 years, with even better models, you still won’t have certainty nine days out."" But no one should turn a blind eye to the storm. Florence has been fairly difficult to forecast already. Klotzbach said himself that earlier this week he thought Florence wouldn’t amount to more than a medium level tropical storm, but by this morning it was a major hurricane. “Hurricane Florence is certainly an overachiever. It’s been stronger than what most of the forecasters thought,” he said. “But It’s important to dial down the hype and check again in a few days.” The tropical Atlantic is now quite active. Tropical Depression Gordon is moving across Mississippi. Hurricane Florence in the central Atlantic is now a Cat 3 storm with 125 mph max winds. A tropical wave behind Florence could become a tropical depression by the end of the week. pic.twitter.com/QivVGnCjQ9 — NWS Eastern Region (@NWSEastern) September 5, 2018 This weekend, tracking models will be substantially more accurate as the number of factors determining the path of the storm will be made clear.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Well that escalated quickly. Hurricane Aletta became the first tropical storm of the eastern Pacific hurricane season on Thursday, and by Friday morning it had spun up into a Category 4 monster. The storm might not be done ramping up, either. The meteorological marvel is thankfully not forecast to make landfall (though rip currents and swells are possible along Mexico’s west coast this weekend), which means we can safely gawk at its beastly nature. The storm’s rise has been a swift one. It became a tropical storm on Wednesday and puttered around throughout the day. But things changed in a big way on Thursday into Friday. At 3 p.m. local time on Thursday, the storm became the first hurricane of the eastern Pacific season as a Category 1 storm with 75 mph winds. The storm’s location—in the open ocean with no interference from land—and warm waters for fuel are what caused Aletta to blow up. By 9 a.m. local time on Friday, it had ballooned into a Category 4 storm with 140 mph winds. That 65 mph increase in less than 24 hours more than meets the criteria for rapid intensification, a meteorological term for when a storm’s windspeed increases at least 35 mph in a day. Even the National Hurricane Center (NHC) seems a bit agog at what happened with Aletta. “The remarkable intensification of Aletta has continued through this morning,” forecasters wrote in their most recent update about the storm. “The short-range intensity forecast is particularly difficult since there are no obvious reasons why Aletta should cease intensification.” The forecast calls for Aletta’s winds to pick up a little more speed to 145 mph before it hits rough steering winds that will tear it back down to a tropical storm by the end of the weekend. Aletta may be a beast, but the eastern Pacific is no stranger to explosively powerful storms. You may remember that this same region spawned Hurricane Patricia—the most intense hurricane ever recorded—back in 2015. That storm rapidly intensified, peaking with winds at a mind boggling 215 mph (well above the 155 mph Category 5 threshold). Rapid intensification was also a hot topic last year during Atlantic hurricane season. Four storms blew up in the Atlantic last year, including Maria. How climate change affects rapid intensification is an active area of research. Some studies indicate the most intense storms are becoming, well, more intense in parts of the Atlantic. Other findings suggest climate change could cause Atlantic hurricanes to rapidly intensify more often as they approach land. Eastern Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 and after three weeks of relative quiet, it appears to be waking up. Another storm is on the horizon. NHC has an eye on an area of clouds and thunderstorms currently sitting off the coast of Central America that has a 90 percent chance of organizing into a tropical system in the next 48 hours, which would be named Bud. Early signs indicate that the storm could pose more of a threat to land, potentially getting sucked into the Southwest.","Well that escalated quickly.

A.A. Newton,"The National Hurricane Center expects Hurricane Florence to cause “ life-threatening, catastrophic flash flooding ” when it makes landfall later this week, and now there’s a tool that gives us an idea of just how catastrophic that impact will be. This tracker from ESRI Media takes the familiar prediction model and uses it to calculate some key demographic data for the area inside the error cone. ESRI’s tracker shows the total population, total households, and total educational organizations in Florence’s projected path: Clicking on the individual items in the legend pulls up more data, including the proportion of the total population that’s over age 65, and how many of the total households are below the poverty line. At the time of writing, 16% of the affected population is over 65, with 15% of affected households living in poverty; the median household income is $51,000. Whether you’re smack dab in the danger zone or watching the storm from afar, you should know how to correctly read an error cone projection. ESRI has an efficient summary in the description of their tracker (emphasis mine) that hits on the main points: “The Cone of Uncertainty...represents the probable track of the center of a tropical cyclone, and is formed by enclosing the area swept out by a set of circles along the forecast track (at 12, 24, 36 hours, etc). It is important to note that the area affected by a tropical cyclone can extend well beyond the confines of the cone enclosing the most likely track area of the center.” In other words, if your city—or your loved ones’—is outside the error cone, it just means that the center of the storm isn’t expected to pass over; areas outside the cone can still expect high winds and heavy rain, and should watch local forecasts extra-carefully in the days to come. That’s the most important thing to take away from error cone projections, but if you’d like a more in-depth explainer, this Wall Street Journal piece briefly explains how they’re calculated, how to correctly interpret them, and what the limitations are. Understanding the potential human cost of a storm—especially among vulnerable populations—is a crucial first step to mobilizing support for communities that’ll see the worst of it. Get your hurricane plan locked down, check in on your friends and family, and be prepared to do some vetting before making any donations to relief efforts.","The National Hurricane Center expects Hurricane Florence to cause “ life-threatening, catastrophic flash flooding ” when it makes landfall later this week, and now there’s a tool that gives us an idea of just how catastrophic that impact will be.

So are many volunteers, including Tray Tillman, 26, a construction foreman who was part of a makeshift rescue flotilla that has plucked hundreds of stranded people from attics, second-floor bedrooms, church vestibules and crumbling decks. • View photos of the storm and its effects on areas across the Carolinas. • The New York Times is providing unlimited access to our coverage of Florence and Typhoon Mangkhut. Catch up on the rest of our coverage. More than one million power failures have been reported, according to the Department of Energy, but utility companies and the state authorities reported some successes in restoring service. Most of the outages were in North Carolina, but like their neighbors to the south, North Carolinians had known they were likely to face days of flooding from engorged rivers long after the immediate drama of flying shingles and TV newscasters staggering in the squalls. “There is a lot of rain to come,” said Jeff Byard, associate administrator for response and recovery at the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Saturday. He spoke during a news conference where a snapshot of the federal response so far emerged. The Coast Guard said 43 aircraft had rescued five people. The Army Corps of Engineers was engaging in a $6.1 million response, monitoring federal dams, helping with rescues, and deploying pumps and portable barriers. And while officials pleaded with residents not to try to drive on flooded streets, and warned that the storm still posed a serious threat, they also began preparing for what will most likely be a long and costly recovery. Some who had evacuated returned home on Saturday evening to survey the damage. Tanya Caulder of Coward, S.C., found a giant tree on her front lawn after spending two nights at a shelter. Fortunately, the tree had fallen away from the house and just missed the pump house, which her family used to get water. But Ms. Caulder, who had stayed at the shelter with 12 relatives, said she was still worried about flooding. During Hurricane Matthew, she said, the nearby Lynches River had sent water into her mobile home. All 13 members of the family would be staying at the house that night, she said, since only her place still had power. “But if I see water come up in the backyard, I’m out of here,” Ms. Caulder said.","The storm has sped up, leaving less time for its drenching rains to saturate the places in its path.",2018-09-16T12:37:21Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Tropical Depression Florence Updates: Rivers Swell as Death Toll Rises,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/16/us/hurricane-florence-path.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/us/17florence-01sub/17florence-01sub-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,tropical,1
Jessica Boddy,"The ancient Maya were an innovative people. They constructed intricate cities throughout the tropical lowlands of the Yucatán Peninsula, communicated using one of the world’s first written languages, and created two calendar systems by studying the stars. But despite their achievements, the thriving Mayan civilization mysteriously collapsed sometime between the eighth and ninth centuries. We still don’t know exactly why. The general consensus is that the Mayan collapse was caused by a number of things, including disease, war, and other sociopolitical conflicts. One natural factor may have contributed to all of these issues: drought. A particularly bad drought would have made it difficult for the Maya to collect enough drinking water and to irrigate their crops. It also could have encouraged the spread of disease and increased the strain between Mayan leaders and their people. Now, a new study quantifies just how harsh the Mayan droughts were. “We already knew that final stages of the Terminal Classic Maya period were characterized by severe droughts,” Fernando Gázquez-Sánchez, a study author and geochemist at St. Andrew University in Scotland, told Gizmodo. “However, our investigation evaluates the intensity of these dry periods.” By analyzing sediment from Lake Chichancanab in the Yucatán Peninsula, Gázquez-Sánchez and his colleagues found that compared to today, annual rainfall decreased by between 41 percent and 54 percent over the multi-decade Mayan drought. When the drought was most severe, rainfall plummeted by as much as 70 percent, the researchers wrote in their study published Thursday in Science. “This really represents the next step in understanding how drought affected the Ancient Maya,” Peter Douglas, a geochemist from McGill University who did not work on the study, told Gizmodo. “The authors are using very refined analytical techniques... and the result is that the droughts must have been very bad.” The team also found that the region’s relative humidity fell by somewhere between 2 percent and 7 percent compared to today’s climate. Those numbers have less direct implications for ancient Mayan crops, but they are an indicator that climate change was happening on a larger scale, Cambridge paleoclimatologist and co-author Nick Evans told Gizmodo. The key to unlocking all of these figures is a mineral in the lake sediment called gypsum. Gypsum forms down at the bottoms of lakes during droughts or dry conditions. In doing so, it traps water molecules in its structure, effectively preserving them like a “water fossil,” said Evans. The team developed a method to extract that thousand-year-old water and study the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes inside. During drought conditions, lighter water isotopes evaporate first, and the heavier isotopes are left to be trapped in gypsum. By tallying when those heavy isotopes were more common, the researchers were able to create rainfall and humidity estimates. Gázquez-Sánchez said this method of analyzing “fossilized water” could reveal a lot about worldwide climates ranging back millions of years. It could even tell us about the climate histories of other planets: Mars, for instance, also has gypsum deposits. “Our method could be used to analyze gypsum either onboard a rover vehicle, or eventually on Earth from a sample return mission,” Gázquez-Sánchez told Gizmodo. “This may open the door to reconstruct the past climate on Mars.” There’s still a lot the method could reveal about the ancient Mayan civilization collapse, too. Douglas told Gizmodo the new study is definitely a preliminary one, and is more of a jumping off point. But it is promising. “To move forward, we need better information on when and where drought happened,” he said. “If we can repeat these techniques in more locations, and get more precise ages for these kinds of geochemical signals, then climate scientists can really begin to work closely with archaeologists to understand how drought impacted the Maya in detail.” [ Science ]","The ancient Maya were an innovative people.

Andrew Freedman,"La Niña is back, ya'll. And it may have major implications for your winter weather, depending on where you live. La Niña conditions were formally declared present in the tropical Pacific Ocean on Thursday, in a statement from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The agency's scientists found a large expanse of the equatorial tropical Pacific Ocean to feature cooler than average waters both at the surface and extending into deeper waters. The atmosphere is responding to this in ways that match expectations for a La Niña event. In fact, the weather for much of the fall across parts of the U.S. has featured La Niña-like fingerprints, with milder than average conditions across the South and East, in particular. SEE ALSO: Crucial Arctic monitoring satellites are blinking out just when we need them most La Niña is the lesser known sibling of El Niño, which features unusually mild sea surface temperatures across the tropical Pacific. Strong El Niño events can reverberate globally, altering prevailing weather patterns from California to Indonesia. Together, El Niño and La Niña are part of a broader climate cycle, known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, that is a leading architect of weather patterns in North America, particularly during the winter. Therefore, La Niña is a main factor that NOAA forecasters examine in making their winter forecasts. Temperature anomaly patterns averaged across all La Niña events since 1950. Image: climate.gov While La Niña also affects weather patterns spanning from the Pacific to the Atlantic Oceans — including generating less rain over the central Pacific, but dumping more on Indonesia — it's never garnered the same media attention as its sibling. It was El Niño, after all, that got the Saturday Night Live treatment due to an intense 1998-99 event and the late comedian Chris Farley. Weather geeks young and old have that brief sketch memorized. Despite the publicity gap, if you live in the U.S. or Canada, in particular, you're likely to feel the effects of the 2017-18 La Niña event. La Niña winters tend to feature cooler-than-average conditions from Alaska down across the provinces of northwest and western Canada, and into the northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Typical La Niña winter weather pattern. Image: climate.gov Milder-than-average conditions tend to be found across the southern tier of the country during such winters, often extending into the Mid-Atlantic. Wetter-than-average conditions during La Niña winters tend to be found across the Pacific Northwest, and in the Midwest. For skiers, La Niña years can be blockbuster seasons for the Pacific Northwest ski areas as well as resorts in the Canadian Rockies, though there is a risk of rain events at lower-lying mountains. However, there's a caveat. The temperature influence of La Niña is becoming somewhat muted due to global warming, as colder-than-average winter conditions become rarer even in the northern Plains. From this, one might think that there will be less snow than average in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. But that's not a guarantee by any means, because other air and ocean cycles play a larger role in determining winter weather conditions in these areas, particularly the North Atlantic Oscillation, which can only be reliably predicted about two weeks ahead of time. It's possible that cities from Portland, Maine, to Washington, D.C., will end up having quite a snowy winter, despite what the La Niña signals might suggest, but the odds of this are somewhat lower than for an average winter. La Niña temperature anomaly comparisons between older and more recent events. Image: climate.gov The La Niña news also provides a clue to how global temperatures may rank in 2018. Whereas El Niño events tend to add heat to the global climate, making the odds of a record warm year even higher than they already are from human-caused climate change, La Niña pushes the climate in the other direction. Having a weak La Niña persist through early spring, which is what NOAA currently is predicting, would suggest that 2018 will end up being close to, or cooler than, 2017. Keep in mind, though, that 2017 is likely to rank among the top 3 warmest years since reliable global instrument records began in 1880. Given global warming, El Niño and La Niña years have been warming steadily. There's a decent chance that 2018 will set a milestone for the warmest La Niña year on record.","La Niña is back, ya'll.

Morgan Sung,"Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate were so destructive, no other hurricanes will be given the same names. The World Meteorological Organization announced Thursday that it's retiring the names Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate from its rotation because of 2017's devastating season. It's replacing the names with Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel instead. SEE ALSO: Shell knew truth of global warming in 1980s; foresaw a Hurricane Sandy scenario WMO names each hurricane based on an alphabetical rotation of names, alternating between male and female names. The selection of names for each rotation is usually used every six years, so we won't see Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel come into use until 2023. If a hurricane is especially fatal and causes significant damage, its name is taken off the rotation and replaced with a different one. According to the WMO's FAQ, this naming system makes it easier for news outlets to report on the storms and increases community preparedness. ""Experience shows that the use of short, distinctive given names in written as well as spoken communications is quicker and less subject to error than the older more cumbersome latitude-longitude identification methods,"" WMO's FAQ says. WMO says that the 2017 hurricane season was ""one of the most destructive on record,"" with damages in the United States alone costing $250 billion. The 2017 hurricane season was one of the most destructive on record. Image: world METEOROLOGICAL organization The hurricanes taken off the WMO's rotation of names caused 224 deaths during their tropical cyclone phases. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria were the first Category 4 storms to make landfall in the United States on record. Irma and Maria both reached Category 5 storms when they made landfall on the Caribbean islands. The damage caused in the Caribbean is likely to take years to recover, according to WMO. Seventeen tropical storms were named in 2017, and 10 of those storms became hurricanes. Six reached ""major hurricane strength"" and clocked in at Category 3 or higher. This is above the average for annual storms; from 1981-2010, the average was 12 tropical storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. Harvey made landfall over or near Texas last August as a Category 4 hurricane. It lasted for four days, devastating Houston and causing the deaths of 68 people. It was the costliest hurricane after Katrina, causing an estimated $125 billion in damages. Irma caused significant destruction in the Caribbean as a Category 5 hurricane, nearly wiping out Barbuda. It was the first hurricane to make landfall in Cuba since 1932, and it prompted the evacuation of about 6 million people in southern Florida. Maria ripped through Dominica and Puerto Rico in September. Dominica's damages are estimated at $1.3 billion, or about 224 percent of its GDP according to WMO. The entire island of Puerto Rico lost power, which one report concluded was the second largest blackout in history. Nate crossed from Nicaragua to Honduras as a tropical storm, but made landfall as a category 1 hurricane. The rainfall from Nate caused 44 deaths in Central America. 2017 retired almost as many names as 2005, when the severe hurricane season resulted in WMO removing Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan, and Wilma from the rotation.","Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate were so destructive, no other hurricanes will be given the same names.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Grizzly bears, dogs, and even cockroaches fart. Do sea anemones? Nope. As for spiders, no one knows. Daniella Rabaiotti and Nick Caruso’s new book, Does It Fart?, is illustrated by Ethan Kocak and debuts tomorrow in the United States. The book lists a number of animals, answers the titular question, and offers some insight into animal digestions. Like many silly ideas, it all started with a tweet—but it’s all real science, we promise! “There’s a lot we don’t know about animal farts, and that means a lot we don’t know about animal digestion,” Rabaiotti, a Ph.D student at University College London and the Zoological Society of London, told Gizmodo. “It’s hopefully a lighthearted way to learn a lot of cool stuff you might not have known about animals.” The book started with Rabaiotti’s tweet, which soon became an editable spreadsheet with the help of Caruso, a hashtag (#DoesItFart), and even a Gizmodo story. But this is a book which means it’s, well more than a tweet. For example, did you know that: Blue whales have very large farts, very likely the largest in volume of any species. But these expulsions have only been caught on camera a few times. Millipedes release much tinier toots. Their simple digestive tract contains methane-producing bacteria to aid in processing food. Tropical millipede species produce more gas than non-tropical species, since they’re bigger. And sea cucumbers don’t fart, but there are species of pearlfish that live (and feed) on their genitalia. Rabaiotti isn’t worried about what a fart book might do to her professional career. In fact, she’s writing another book soon. She told Gizmodo: “It might be loosely poop-themed.”","Grizzly bears, dogs, and even cockroaches fart. Do sea anemones? Nope. As for spiders, no one knows.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","In a year of wild heat waves, wildfires, and record-setting hurricanes, why not add one more weird weather phenomenon to the list? Tropical Depression Rosa made landfall in Baja California on Monday and is crawling into the Southwest, bringing with it the threat of flash floods from southern Arizona to Idaho. All told, 9 million people are under a flash flood watch or warning as of Tuesday morning Mountain Time as Rosa lumbers inland. The storm attained Category 4 status at its peak late last week, but has lost steam since then (at least in the wind department). It made landfall as a tropical storm in Baja California late last night and has since become Rosas lowly remnant low. But the winds were never the biggest concern for the Southwest. Instead, its the threat of torrential rain as the storm brings tropical moisture to an arid landscape. More than half an inch of rain has already fallen in and around Phoenix, making this one of the heaviest rain events to hit the city since 1990. Phoenix is already up to its seventh-wettest October on record despite it being just Oct. 2. With the heaviest bands of rain to come in the afternoon, the storm is likely to continue climbing the record books. All told, up to six inches of rain are expected in Arizonas mountains. That may not sound like a lot, especially after Florences recent deluge in the Carolinas, but the parched soil ups the risk of runoff. The scenic slot canyons and dry washes that cut across the desert landscape are disguised highways for water, waiting for rain events like this to send torrents rushing downstream. A recent drought has hardened soils even further, which could help accelerate the runoff process. Large portions of the Four Corners area are in exceptional or extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Rosas rain will certainly help alleviate that drought, but it will also exact a toll on the desert landscape and those living in it. Indeed, footage from Phoenixitself chock full of impervious pavementand the surrounding area shows that roads are already becoming inundated as the aforementioned dry washes fill up with frothing, muddy water. The Utah National Guard has already been activated according to CBS News, and we could see more resources mobilized as flooding continues to unfold. Its weird but not unprecedented for tropical systems to amble into the Southwest. Tropical Depression Storm Newton reached Arizona in 2016, the last tropical system to hit the region. Rosas remnants are just the latest example of a growing problem: Heavy rain events are on the rise owing to a warmer atmosphere. Were seeing that trend driven by named storms like hurricanes Harvey, Lane, and Florence as well as random rain events like the one that hit Kauai in April. The Southwest has seen a five percent increase in heavy downpours since 1958 even as the region becomes drier, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment. This type of weather whiplash poses a huge infrastructure challenge as city and state planners have to figure out how to prepare communities both for downpours and water conservation in increasingly dry times.","In a year of wild heat waves, wildfires, and record-setting hurricanes, why not add one more weird weather phenomenon to the list?

The independent,"Timber company workers stand stranded on a damaged road in Chimanimani, eastern Zimbabwe, on March 18.
Hundreds killed and over 800 square miles covered in water
| The Independent | Tropical Cyclone Idai struck the Sofala province of Mozambique in the waning hours of March 14, causing damage and flooding that could make it one of the worst weather disasters to ever hit the Southern Hemisphere.
Idai left Sofala with what resembled an inland ocean stretching more than 30 miles wide and potentially about 20 feet deep. The tropical storm destroyed 90 percent of Beira, a port city of more than a half-million people. The confirmed death toll as of March 21 was 557 in Mozambique and neighboring Zimbabwe and Malawi, but with thousands still missing or at risk Mozambiques president Filipe Nyusi said the death toll could reach 1,000.
The Sofala province is historically prone to flooding, and floods occur every two to three years in Mozambique, according to the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. It also reports that Mozambique ranks third among African countries for exposure to weather-related hazards.
But the inland oceans created by Idai surpass those created by any previous storm. A total of 836 square miles were covered in water as of March 20, according to the United Nations Institute for Training And Research (UNITAR). If the entire country of Bahrain were covered in water, it would only be roughly a third the size of the area flooded in Sofala.
Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia said on March 24 that over 700 people were across Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi; 417 of them in Mozambique. The number of dead was expected to rise as many people remained unaccounted for. The officials will only be able to determine the final casualty figure once the flood waters have receded.
Meanwhile thousands remain trapped by the floodwaters, and many of the Mozambican government’s relief centres have only just started receiving food supplies.
Some 1.7 million people are said to be affected across southern Africa, with no electricity or running water in areas where homes have been swept away and roads destroyed by the floods, according to the BBC. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) were warning of the risk of other outbreaks, already noting an increase in malaria.
“We are living an unprecedented natural disaster. A disaster that only matches major disasters,” Correia said. “Unfortunately, no-one in the region and in the world could predict a disaster of this size.”

Andrew Freedman,"The East Coast ""bomb cyclone"" on Thursday looks both beautiful and sinister from space. While scientists have been tracking storms using satellites in orbit for decades, they now have a brand new tool at their disposal: GOES-16, also called GOES-East. The brand new satellite — which wasn't available to scientists last winter — is one of the most powerful weather-watching tools in history, able to take snapshots of the storm every minute. The result? Some truly astonishing images. SEE ALSO: A 'bomb cyclone,' explained The storm, which is bringing blizzard conditions to areas from Virginia to Maine, along with hurricane-force wind gusts and damaging coastal flooding, looks like a classic non-tropical storm. It took on a comma shape, drawing in moisture all the way from the Bahamas, and dumping it into an Arctic air mass in place over the Mid-Atlantic and East Coast. Its minimum central air pressure, a key measure of its intensity, has been falling by double digits every few hours, greatly exceeding the criteria needed to fit the definition of a weather ""bomb."" Such a term refers to the meteorological term ""bombogenesis,"" which combines the words ""bomb"" and ""cyclogensis,"" and means a storm that intensifies by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. The current storm has already seen a 53 millibar drop in just 21 hours, placing it in the top 5 percent of rapidly intensifying non-tropical storm systems. Computer model projections show that the minimum central pressure could fall to 947 millibars, which would be comparable to Hurricane Sandy when that storm made landfall in 2012. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, this storm, while not tropical in nature, has a massive wind field, bringing 60-mile-per-hour winds to New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Carolinas at the same time. The center of the storm even developed an eye-like feature, clearly seen in this satellite image: Image: colorado state university/noaa Impressive GOES-16 high resolution infrared satellite imagery showing explosive cyclogenesis/rapid intensification with the hurricane force low pressure system in the W Atlantic from late last night into this morning. pic.twitter.com/h3lLrYcWL8 — NWS OPC (@NWSOPC) January 4, 2018 It's not a hurricane but it has an ""eye-like"" feature where warmer air is trapped, encircled, or ""secluded"" by a bent-back warm front.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The countrys midsection is about to be hit by a rare, potentially record setting bomb cyclone that will bring everything from rain to snow to hurricane-force winds and could leave severe flooding in its wake from Texas to Minnesota. So if you live in that area, listen up!
The mayhem is already beginning as moisture streams from the Pacific into the Southwest, where winter storm warnings are in effect as of Tuesday afternoon. Up to two feet of snow could fall in New Mexicos Sangre de Cristo Mountains, accompanied by winds whipping across ridge tops at speeds of up to 75 mph, according to the National Weather Service. That alone would be pretty wild, but its only a precursor to Wednesdays weather mayhem.
As the storm pushes inland, its pressurewhich drops as storms get strongeris expected to dip into the range of 970 millibars. Thats roughly on par with an average Category 2 Atlantic hurricane and could challenge the all-time low pressure record for Kansas. The drop will be driven by the storms winds as they wrap around its core in a counter clockwise direction, bringing moist, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico in contact with cold air from the Upper Midwest and Canada. The movement of the winds is called cyclonic, and pressure is expected to drop more than 24 millibars in 24 hours, which means this storm is shaping up to fulfill the criteria for a rare inland bomb cyclone. It could even take on a hurricane-like appearance.
The fascinating thing about this storm is how quickly it will intensify and the possible record-low pressures it will produce in the Plains, Jason Furtado, a meteorology professor at the University of Oklahoma, told Earther. Another neat thing is that some models are indicating that this storm will strengthen so quickly, it could develop an eye-like feature in the center of the storm. This is a very rare for non-tropical systems and even more so for storms in the central U.S. (Its also rare for noreasters, which tend to be more comma-shaped.)
Weather geekery aside, the storm is going to make a mess of things. The area facing wind gusts up to 60 mphthe equivalent of a mature tropical stormstretches for more than 1,000 miles from Sturgis, South Dakota to the Texas-Mexico border. For comparison, the reach of Sandys tropical storm-force winds was 1,150 miles from edge to edge, although even thats not a perfect comparison, since tropical storm winds start at 39 mph.
So about those winds. The most intense blasts could rip up to 75 mph in the Rockies and Southern Plains. The rotation of the storm will also create what Furtado called a moisture pipeline straight out of the Gulf of Mexico. That means not only will it be windy, but also snowy. The National Weather Service is forecasting up to a foot or more of snow from Colorado to the Dakotas. Blizzard warnings are also in effect for large part of the region, and they could expand as the storm begins its onslaught.
Even after the storm clears out on Wednesday night, its impacts could linger. Aside from the heavy, blowing snow, areas on the Southern Plains could see wind-driven rain that could melt out what snowpack there is, aided by a blast of warm air on Thursday. Ed Vallee, the founder of Empire Weather, told Earther that flooding and melting snowpack is another unique impact could happen after the storm blows out into the Atlantic.","The country’s midsection is about to be hit by a rare, potentially record setting bomb cyclone that will bring everything from rain to snow to hurricane-force winds and could leave severe flooding in its wake from Texas to Minnesota.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Atlantic hurricane season may be slipping by to little fanfare ( so far ), but it’s a different story in the northwest Pacific. A dangerous super typhoon currently packing 170 mph winds could make landfall in Japan early next week. Typhoon Jebi, which started getting organized east of Guam on August 27, exploded to life over the last few days, intensifying from a Category 1 to a Category 5-equivalent storm between August 29-30. Currently located 300 miles northwest of Saipan, Jebi is moving northwest at 16 miles per hour, continuing its trek over open ocean into the weekend before making an expected northward veer early next week. That turn will place it on a direct course for mainland Japan. Recent model runs show a high chance of the storm making landfall near Kyoto, potentially as a powerful typhoon. “Jebi was in a fairly classic environment for rapid strengthening,” Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson told Earther via email, citing warm ocean waters and favorable upper level wind conditions. “Its forecast track is also a textbook case of recurvature,” with initial movement toward the west or northwest before curving around to the north at mid-latitudes. Henson added that because Japan’s islands run southwest to northeast, “a small change in the track could have a big impact on exactly where Jebi makes landfall.” East of Shioku and south of Honshu, the storm could kick up waves up to 10 meters (33 feet) high as it approaches Japan, creating a hazard for ships, according to AccuWeather. But the real concern is the impact on the heavily populated areas within the storm’s forecast cone of uncertainty, including Tokyo. Flooding, mudslides, and destructive winds are all possible impacts. If this feels familiar, it is because we’ve been here before. Japan has already seen heavy rainfall associated with two typhoons, a tropical depression and a tropical storm this month, AccuWeather notes. In July, western and central Japan experienced historic rainfall and deadly landslides brought on in part with Typhoon Prapiroon, with Typhoon Maria following closely on its heels and delivering even more rain to the nation’s southern Ryukyu islands. With northern hemisphere tropical cyclone activity often peaking in September and lasting through November, Japan may not be out of the woods for a while.","The Atlantic hurricane season may be slipping by to little fanfare ( so far ), but it’s a different story in the northwest Pacific.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Hurricane Florence, which was briefly downgraded to a tropical storm last week, was re-upgraded to hurricane status on Sunday and looks like it is destined to barrel straight at the U.S.’ East Coast. According to CNN, odds are good that it will have strengthened to Category 4 status—meaning sustained winds in the range of 130-156 miles per hour—before the time it makes landfall later this week, likely on Thursday or Friday. CNN wrote: “Maximum sustained winds are now 75 mph, and further strengthening is forecast over the coming days,” said CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen. “Florence continues on a track to impact the US mainland by Thursday or Friday.” The hurricane center said, “All indications are that Florence will be an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane while it moves over the western Atlantic toward the southeastern United States.” Florence was some 1,500 miles away from the East Coast and moving west at roughly six miles per hour on Sunday morning, according to CNN. It’s projected to pass between the Bahamas and Bermuda on its way to land. According to CNN, weather experts say the storm is most likely to hit in the Carolinas. However, the Washington Post noted that the hurricane’s exact placement is “within a large cone of uncertainty” and residents anywhere “Florida to southern New England” should be aware of the storm’s progression. The Post’s weather team noted that Florence will pass over oceans that are warmer than normal, which will provide fuel and “favors at least a Category 3 hurricane landfall on the Southeast coast by week’s end” (emphasis theirs). It’s possible it could become a Category 5 storm. The National Hurricane Center warned on Twitter that there may be a high risk of “storm surge at the coast and freshwater flooding from a prolonged heavy rainfall event inland.” Accuweather added that storm swells are expected to stretch for hundreds of miles around Florence and impact, and there’s a possibility that the storm could stall right as hits land, resulting in sustained battering of the coast and flooding. The Post wrote: In these coastal areas, heavy surf and elevated water levels arrive by Wednesday morning, and rainfall could begin by Thursday morning. Tropical-storm-force winds could reach the coastline as early as Wednesday night, at which point all outdoor preparations should be completed. Extremely dangerous hurricane-force winds could batter coastal locations Thursday into Friday. Hurricane to tropical-storm-force winds could extend inland depending on the storm’s exact track. Two tropical storms are following behind it: Isaac and Helene. Helene is expected to veer north well before coming close to the coast, though Isaac is expected to turn into a hurricane as it continues heading west towards the Windward Islands, the Miami Herald wrote. In preparation for the storm, the governments of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia have all declared states of emergency and are mobilizing resources. As Axios noted, many areas in the path of the storm have not seen hurricanes of this strength for decades—like Charleston, South Carolina, where the last Category 4 storm was Hugo in 1989. Thanks to rising ocean waters from climate change, the area is already prone to the phenomenon of “sunny day flooding” in good conditions. As Earther noted on Friday, this course is unprecedented. Almost all of the 57 named storms that have passed within 200 miles of Florence’s position at that time have curved out to sea, other than a handful which slammed into the Dominican Republic.

Andrew Freedman,"The Midwest and East Coast endured a record cold end to 2017 and start of 2018. Residents there should get ready to do it again, while those living in normally cold places, like the Arctic and Alaska, should prepare to see their weather flip back to much above average temperatures, along with the havoc wreaked by melting ice and snow at this time of year. SEE ALSO: 2017 was one of Earth's top 3 hottest years on record, which should come as no surprise To get a sense of weather conditions in the long range, meteorologists use ensemble models, which consist of a computer model that is run many times with varying initial conditions each time. Those models now show a remarkable consensus between the ensembles of two major computer models that forecasters use, the Global Forecast System, or GFS, and the European Model, known as the ECMWF. Both models show the building of an unusually strong ridge, or area of high pressure, in the middle and upper atmosphere across Alaska in the coming one to two weeks. The European model, in particular, is quite aggressive in projecting a powerhouse ridge that will extend from the North Pacific all the way into the Arctic. This could bring a resumption of warm winter conditions back to Alaska after the state recorded its warmest December in its history, and it will also redirect weather systems in ways that will have consequences for areas located thousands of miles away. The ridge will cause the jet stream to snap southward, directing frigid air from northern Canada and possibly even Siberia southward, crossing the U.S. border during the first week of February. An aerial view of a residential neighbourhood in Novosibirsk, Russia. Image: Kirill Kukhmar/TASS via Getty Images From there, things get more hazy, since this is a long-term forecast, but any time there is a huge buildup of extremely cold air in south-central Canada, one needs to consider the possibility that it will slide south, into the U.S., and gradually put cities from Minneapolis to Chicago to New York back into the deep freeze. In fact, the overall weather pattern, with the massive ridge off the West Coast, and another ridge off the East Coast, will be ideal for an Arctic outbreak in the U.S. Judah Cohen, the director of seasonal forecasting at AER, a Verisk company, said he foresees that part of the polar vortex itself will whirl its way south, above North America. He said the behavior of the polar vortex, which is an area of low pressure at upper levels of the atmosphere, whose circulation plays a key role in determining where the coldest air will be, reminds him of the notorious winter of 2013-14. That winter, referred to in much of the U.S. as the polar vortex winter, also saw the vortex slide south, taking the coldest air with it. Models do best when predicting amplified flow. Hard to imagine better agreement on large scale pattern of a 10-day forecast between GFS and ECMWF for North America than today's forecast. Consensus is #cold ! pic.twitter.com/2Y0fiJrrnY — Judah Cohen (@judah47) January 25, 2018 This winter, the polar vortex has affected Eurasia in particular, with impressive cold — on the order of minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit — taking hold in Siberia. Cohen said it's ""really pretty rare"" to see the vortex meander south into North America, including the U.S., but that may be what's about to happen. I would rather be tweeting about #PolarVortex splits but in the meantime still fascinated by GFS forecast of polar vortex displacement into North America (not including Greenland), which is highly unusual! pic.twitter.com/8vApIdG68D — Judah Cohen (@judah47) January 25, 2018 As for the sensible weather details, the core of the cold is likely to set up shop in the Northern Plains and Central Canada during the first 10 days of February. After that, it may slide east-southeast, toward the East Coast with time. The specific details of how cold it will get compared to average, and whether there will be any significant storms accompanying this weather pattern, much as the bomb cyclone did, will become clearer during the coming days because of the uncertainties involved with medium- to long-range forecasting. There's a tropical connection to the cold It may not be an accident that this weather pattern is occurring again during a La Niña event. Such events feature unusually mild waters in the Western Tropical Pacific Ocean, but cooler than average waters in the Central and Eastern Tropical Pacific. According to Michael Ventrice, a meteorologist for The Weather Company, which is part of IBM, such weather patterns tend to emerge when the Pacific Jet Stream is intensified by an uptick in showers and thunderstorms across the Western Pacific Ocean and Indonesia during La Niña years. The jet stream is the highway of air at the upper levels of the atmosphere that steers weather systems and separates air masses. Sea surface temperature anomalies, with the box highlighting the cold anomalies that are the hallmark of La Niña. Image: tropical tidbits ""These patterns commonly emerge when the Pacific Jet Stream is excited by enhanced tropical convection over the Maritime Continent into the West Pacific,"" Ventrice said. Another factor at play is known as the Madden-Julian Oscillation, or MJO, which is a cycle of enhanced showers and thunderstorms that travels eastward around the equator and gets back to its starting point within one to two months, on average. The MJO has further heightened showers and thunderstorms over the Western Pacific in recent weeks, Ventrice said in an email. ""This translates to an explosion of tropical convection over the Maritime-Continent and West Pacific. Essentially this is feeding the low-frequency La Niña base state gasoline... making the engine go into overdrive,"" he said. ""The last time we observed the MJO 'gas up' the La Niña state was back in late November through mid-December,"" he said. That was followed soon afterward by the record cold snap in the U.S. The interaction between the MJO and La Niña eventually will help create an unstable jet stream across the North Pacific. When it breaks down, which is predicted to happen during the next couple of weeks, unusually warm, tropical air pushes its way north toward Alaska and the North Pole, creating the mega-ridge of high pressure. ""That big blocking high over the North Pacific is what is going to disrupt the Arctic Circle, flooding the area with anomalous warmth,"" Ventrice said. ""This process displaces the cold air pooling over the North Pole down towards the U.S."" ""By flooding the North Pole with warm air, it displaces arctic cold air into the midlatitudes, with one specific pathway down across North America,"" he said. The Arctic is heading into this relative warm spell in a weakened state, with sea ice cover running near or at record lows for this time of year. The flip side to the upcoming Arctic warming will be colder weather in the lower 48 states. ""This means an increased frequency of bitter cold days in the U.S. looking ahead into February,"" Ventrice said. ""And with cold air comes winter storms... so expect snow cover to increase across the U.S. with a window for coastal Nor'easter snow storms (i.e., the #bombcyclone) between February 14 through March 6,"" he said. So, snow lovers, get excited. (Just not too excited, considering the uncertainties involved with long-range forecasting.)","The Midwest and East Coast endured a record cold end to 2017 and start of 2018.

Shannon Connellan,"'Alberto,' the first named storm of the 2018 hurricane season, has essentially demonstrated its version of a storm in a teacup.

Justin Ray Parker, a guest at Shores of Panama captured the little rampaging waterspout on their smartphone, even the moment when a pool float is tossed into the air. The storm, while projected to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to areas in Florida and some Gulf Coast states through Wednesday, will not become a hurricane, according to NOAA — in fact, it has already been downgraded to a subtropical depression. Alberto has, sadly, already killed two people, WYFF-TV anchor Mike McCormick and photojournalist Aaron Smeltzer, who were covering the storm.

Off the U.S. East Coast, a tropical depression meandered well out to sea from the North Carolina shore. Forecasters said it posed no immediate threat to land. TROPICAL UPDATE: Get the latest developments for the 2018 season The depression formed into Tropical Storm Chris, according to a National Hurricane Center tweet about 4 a.m. Sunday. Forecasters expect Chris to begin moving farther out into the Atlantic on Tuesday. That storm was centered about 160 miles (260 kilometers) south of Cape Hatteras late Saturday, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph). It was stationary and only minimal movement was expected in the next few days. Although Beryl, what had been the Atlantic season's first hurricane, was losing power, residents on islands hit hard by storms last year stocked up on food and water and prepared for possible damaging winds, rains and waves. A tropical storm warning was up on Guadeloupe and Dominica, while a tropical storm watch was issued for the French Caribbean territories of Martinique, St. Martin and St. Barts as well as St. Maarten, Barbados, St. Lucia, Saba and St. Eustatius. Puerto Rico, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September, remained under a state of emergency. HURRICANE HARVEY: A closer look at Houston's biblical floods, exclusively on HoustonChronicle.com On Dominica, which also was battered by Maria, the island's meteorological service warned residents that the weather would likely begin deteriorating Saturday late night and that at least four inches of rain could fall before the storm passed over or near Dominica on Sunday night. Dominican Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit told people to store water because the government would be shutting down the water system as a protective measure, and he warned them to stay alert despite's the storm weakening. ""They should not let their guard down,"" he said. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Beryl's maximum sustained winds remained 45 mph (75 kph) early Sunday. It was centered 240 miles (380 kilometers) east-southeast of Barbados and was moving west northwestward at 20 mph (31 kph). Long lines were reported Saturday at grocery stores on Dominica, Puerto Rico and elsewhere as people shopped for food and water3 ""Here's hoping it misses us,"" said one shopper, Sandra Whitcher, who owns the Coffeeriver Cottages on Dominica. She said workmen had fortified the roofs on all seven cottages that survived Hurricane Maria. ""I can't say I'm not scared, but I know we have prepared as much as we can possibly do."" Forecasters said Beryl would likely weaken further after crossing the Lesser Antilles. It was predicted to pass south of Puerto Rico on Monday as a tropical depression, but forecasters warned that the storm-wracked U.S. territory could see up to 30 mph winds and heavy rains that could cause flooding and mudslides.","Chron.com Weakened Beryl moving to Caribbean; Chris forms in Atlantic Chron.com SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Tropical Storm Beryl moved rapidly westward early Sunday, heading for the Lesser Antilles at the eastern entrance of the Caribbean Sea.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","Sunscreen is essential for any tropical trip. After all, no ones trying to return home with red, burnt skin. Your favorite brand may soon be illegal, however, if youre headed to Palau, a 500-island archipelago in the Pacific. Why? Because some sunscreens contain chemicals that are harmful to coral. On Thursday, the island nation passed a law thatll ban sunscreens containing 10 coral-damaging chemicals starting 2020, per the BBC. Any retailers who ignore the law and continue to sell their products featuring chemicals like oxybenzone, octocrylene, and parabens can face $1,000 fines, the AFP reports. While the BBC reports Palau is the first country to set such a ban, Hawaii has already moved ahead with a ban of its own. In May, the U.S. state finalized the ban to keep these chemicals off its reefs, which have been rapidly deteriorating. Sunscreen has played a tragic role. Chemicals like oxybenzone harm baby corals, in particular, as an international team of scientists found in 2016. Swimmers who wear sunscreen or other cosmetic products made with these chemicals may be making young corals more prone to bleaching, a phenomenon which typically occurs when warm waters force corals to expel algae, their main food source, causing them to turn white and starve. Juvenile corals exposed to oxybenzone can also suffer DNA damage, abnormal skeleton growth, and deformities, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The worlds reefs are already facing threats from a number of sources, including warming waters, plastic pollution, and ocean acidification. Sunscreen is just adding another layer of trouble. In Palau, which has some of the most diverse coral populations in the world, the reefs have been suffering since at least the late 1990s when the islands suffered a massive bleaching event that killed a third of the corals there. Some areas saw coral mortality closer to 90 percent, according to a report by the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme. Now, Palaus leaders are creating to policy to at least eliminate one problem. Taking sunscreen off a stores shelves may be much easier than stopping global warming, but its a start.

Jessica Boddy,"A leading theory of recent decades is that lemurs colonized Madagascar around 50 million years ago. As they dispersed throughout the island and made homes in its tropical rainforests, those ancestral lemurs evolved into the menagerie of species we see today. It’s certainly a romantic idea, but it might also be false, according to new fossil research. The newly analyzed fossils—three partial mandibles with teeth—came from Kenya, and date back to between 16 million and 23 million years ago, which is long after lemurs were thought to have departed Africa. The fossils were first studied back in the late 1960s by a paleontologist who thought they belonged to an ancient loris. He named the species Propotto leakeyi. (Lorises are big-eyed, cautiously climbing primates that share a common ancestor with lemurs.) But another paleontologist thought the fossils were from fruit bat ancestors, and that perspective stuck for 50 years. Then a third paleontologist entered the fray: the late Gregg Gunnell, formerly of Duke University and an author of the new study. An expert on both bats and primates, he saw the mandibles and immediately thought of an eerie-looking lemur called the aye-aye. “[Gunnell] wrote to me via email, and said, ‘there’s no way these things are bats,’” study author Erik Seiffert, a paleontologist at the University of Southern California, told Gizmodo. “‘It’s gotta be a primate, and the only primate I can think of that looks like this is the aye-aye.’” Seiffert was skeptical, but also thought the fossils looked like another extinct primate he’d studied called Plesiopithecus, a relative of the aye-aye. That would also make it a relative of Propotto leakeyi, if Gunnell was correct. Seiffert, Gunnell, and the rest of the research team decided to clarify the family tree by CT scanning the ambiguous Propotto leakeyi dental fossils and comparing them to the dental records of Plesiopithecus, other primates both living and extinct, and also fruit bats. After months of computer analysis, the resulting tree was clear: Plesiopithecus, Propotto leakeyi, and the living aye-aye all share a common ancestor, as reported in the study published Tuesday in Nature Communications. That means aye-aye ancestors may have separately colonized Madagascar sometime around 20 million years ago instead of 50 million, the data suggested. All other lemurs probably evolved from a common ancestor that migrated on another occasion from Africa to Madagascar anywhere from 40 million to 20 million years ago, Seiffert said. That’s around the time Madagascar’s other mammals, like giant jumping rats, mongooses, and tenrecs, arrived at the island. Current evidence suggests these animals rafted across the Mozambique Channel from Africa on logs or floating vegetation, and Seiffert thinks ancient lemurs and aye-ayes probably did the same—but not before all the other mammals, as previously thought. “If this analysis is correct, then this changes our whole idea of how this fascinating group of primates evolved,” Phil Cox, a zoologist at the University of York who was not involved with the study, told Gizmodo. “It all changes. You have to come up with a whole new scenario. But it’s certainly possible, it’s not crazy to think this happened.” Cox said he is wary of the results because “they’re all based on teeth.” If there were skeletal remains or bigger parts of the skull from Propotto leakeyi, he’d be more eager to accept the rewritten lemur history. But he said he still finds the results compelling because ancient lemur fossils are so scarce; any new fossil evidence like this has the power to make some pretty large shifts in what we know about lemur evolution. In fact, not a single ancient, land-dwelling mammalian fossil has been found in Madagascar. “Aside from some marine sea cow fossils, there hasn’t been a shred of evidence there,” Seiffert told Gizmodo. He added that they’re so elusive because the low tectonic activity near Madagascar keeps fossils unexposed and embedded deep down in layers of rock, if they exist at all. Seiffert acknowledged that the study would be stronger with more fossils. And future study of lemur evolution, he said, will hinge on being able to find some. “There’s a possibility more could be sitting in collections in Kenya, where Propotto is from,” he said. “There could be drawers of unidentified mysteries.” “The thing is, we really analyzed these fossils to death. We did everything we could,” he told Gizmodo. “The only thing we want is more fossils. That’s always the answer.” [ Nature Communications ]","A leading theory of recent decades is that lemurs colonized Madagascar around 50 million years ago.

,"At a Glance Tropical Depression Three formed several hundred miles east of the Carolinas Friday. It is likely to linger near or off the coast of the Carolinas well into next week. This system may become a hurricane during the middle of next week. It will eventually get pulled to the east into the Atlantic Ocean next week. At least several days of high surf are possible. Tropical Depression Three is slowing down more than 100 miles southeast of North Carolina and will become Tropical Storm Chris this weekend. (The highest cloud tops, corresponding to the most vigorous convection, are shown in the brightest red colors. Clustering, deep convection around the center is a sign of a healthy tropical cyclone.) Infrared satellite imagery indicates showers and thunderstorms have increased early Saturday morning, possibly meaning that it is beginning to become better organized. Intensification is likely over the next few days, and it could become a hurricane on Tuesday or Wednesday. Several hurricane hunter flights have been scheduled to see how well organized and how strong the system is. The first of these flights is scheduled for Saturday morning. ( MORE: Hurricane Season Outlook Update ) Stalling Out The rest of the forecast at this time is tricky. Here's what the National Hurricane Center is currently forecasting followed by our forecast reasoning. This system isn't going to move much this weekend. Stalled tropical cyclones, such as Debby in 2012, are notoriously difficult to forecast. Tropical Depression Three is too far south to be grabbed by the southward dip in the jet-stream currently bringing heat relief to the Northeast. When that jet-stream dip goes by this weekend, it will be replaced by another expanding heat dome of high pressure aloft building into the Midwest and East. This new heat dome will trap the depression near or off the Carolina coast into early next week. Why this tropical system will likely stall out. Exactly where this system stalls remains uncertain and will hold the key to some impacts. The only likely impacts at the coast from southeast Virginia to the Carolinas will be building surf, rip currents, potentially some coastal flooding at high tide, and occasional showers this weekend into early next week. If it stalls closer to the coast, some areas may experience heavy rainfall and stronger winds. Indications are that the strongest winds will be to the east of the center, well away from the U.S. coast. Then there's the intensity forecast. A stalled tropical system over the Gulf Stream, where surface water temperatures are above average, will likely allow this system to become a strong tropical storm or hurricane, assuming wind shear is not too strong and dry air doesn't impact the system. But, if this system remains too stationary, it could upwell colder waters and cause itself to weaken. By midweek, another southward plunge of the jet stream is expected to grab this system and send it into the north Atlantic Ocean. For now, interests along the coast from southeast Virginia to North Carolina should monitor this system.

"Holly Yan, CNN","(CNN) Deserts aren't supposed to get much rain, but Tropical Storm Rosa is flipping the script. Rosa is forecast to make landfall early Tuesday with more than 11 million people under a flash flood watch in the Southwest, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said. It'll drench Baja California with 3 to 6 inches of rain, with some spots getting up to 10 inches, the National Hurricane Center said. As it moves northeast, Rosa will also dump 2 to 4 inches of rain on much of Arizona, with up to 6 inches in the mountains. A flash flood watch is in effect for parts of Arizona until Wednesday as the storm's remnants move across the state, the National Weather Service said. ""These rainfall amounts may produce life-threatening flash flooding,"" the National Hurricane Center said. ""Dangerous debris flows and landslides are also possible in mountainous terrain."" Historically, it's unusual for the US Southwest to get pummeled by a hurricane or tropical storm. But ""these events have begun to increase in recent years,"" CNN meteorologist Gene Norman said. Research indicates that global warming contributes to tropical storms getting ""more intense, bigger and longer-lasting, thereby increasing their potential for damage,"" said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. While there might not be a direct link between global warming and the recent increase of severe storms in the US Southwest, ""it is possible that this could be a side effect of climate change,"" Norman said. ""Warmer oceans are allowing eastern Pacific storms to reach higher latitudes,"" he said. ""This was not the case earlier.

Tropical depression No. 14 could officially become Tropical Storm Michael by Sunday afternoon or Monday morning, according to Channel 2 Action News meteorologist Brian Monahan. For now, the system is a disorganized group of thunderstorms in the Caribbean. It is on track to strengthen early this week and make landfall around the Florida Panhandle close to Wednesday. Severe Weather Team 2 Meteorologist Katie Walls is tracking this tropical system. From there, it is expected to make its way into Georgia and bring “windy weather and wet weather” into the region by Wednesday or Thursday, Monahan said. Several inches of rain are possible in metro Atlanta, accompanied by a long-awaited dip in temperatures. “This storm will move quickly … I expect our rain changes to really ramp up,” Monahan said.

Tropical storm warnings are posted for south Florida and the northern Gulf Coast. Heavy rain, storm surge flooding and strong winds are likely impacts from Gordon on the Gulf Coast. A storm surge watch is in effect for a part of the northern Gulf Coast Tropical Storm Gordon has developed near southern Florida where it will continue to bring heavy rain and gusty winds on Monday before heading for a northern Gulf Coast landfall on Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) has issued tropical storm warnings for south Florida, from Golden Beach on the southeast coast to Bonita Beach on the southwest coast as well as the Keys from Craig Key to Ocean Reef. Tropical storm warnings are also posted from the Alabama-Florida border westward to east of Morgan City, Louisiana, including Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas. A tropical storm warning is typically issued when tropical-storm-force winds (39-plus mph) are expected in 36 hours or less. (A tropical storm watch means tropical storm conditions are possible within 48 hours. A warning means those conditions are expected within 36 hours.) ( MORE : Hurricane Central ) Current Status and Forecast Gordon is currently centered near Key Largo, Florida, and is producing numerous showers and thunderstorms in southern Florida. (The highest cloud tops, corresponding to the most vigorous convection, are shown in the brightest red colors. Clustering, deep convection around the center is a sign of a healthy tropical cyclone.) Localized flooding is possible and the National Weather Service has issued a flood watch for south Florida into Monday night. In addition, tropical-storm-force winds (39 mph or greater) are possible in the tropical storm warning area in southern Florida on Monday. A wind gust to 51 mph was reported at Miami's Opa-Locka airport on Monday morning. An isolated tornado threat cannot be ruled out in southern Florida, as well. Current Radar, Watches and Warnings (Watches and warnings are issued by the National Weather Service.) Conditions should begin to improve Monday night in south Florida. Steered by high pressure aloft parked over the eastern United States, Gordon will move through the eastern Gulf of Mexico Monday night through Tuesday. Gordon is forecast to be at tropical storm strength when it makes landfall on the northern Gulf Coast Tuesday night, most likely in southeast Louisiana or southern Mississippi. (The red-shaded area denotes the forecast path of the center of Gordon. Note that impacts (particularly heavy rain, high surf, coastal flooding) from Gordon may spread beyond its forecast path.) Regardless of how well organized Gordon becomes, there will still be impacts on the northern Gulf Coast. Northern Gulf Coast Impacts Here's a look at the current forecast impacts for Gordon but keep in mind changes are possible based on future adjustments to track and intensity. Rainfall Parts of the northern Gulf Coast could see 3 to 6 inches rainfall Tuesday-Wednesday, from southeast Louisiana into far southern Mississippi and far southern Alabama. Localized totals of 6 inches or more are possible in some areas. As a result, there could be flooding in this region, including the New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama, metro areas. A flash flood watch has been posted by the National Weather Service for parts of southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi. Separate flash flood watches are in effect in southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana due to heavy rain from another weather system affecting that region on Monday. (This should be interpreted as a broad outlook of where the heaviest rain may fall. Higher amounts may occur where bands or clusters of thunderstorms stall for over a period of a few hours.) Storm Surge, Rip Currents and High Surf A storm surge watch has been issued from the Mississippi-Alabama border westward to the mouth of the Mississippi River. Storm Surge Watches and Warnings The NHC said water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide: Destin, Florida, to the Mississippi-Alabama border: 1 to 2 feet Mississippi-Alabama border to the mouth of Mississippi River: 2 to 4 feet Mouth of the Mississippi River to the Louisiana-Texas border: 1 to 2 feet High tide this week on the Louisiana and Mississippi coastline is in the early morning hours. Tuesday morning through Thursday evening is the timing for potential coastal flooding in the storm surge watch area, according to the National Weather Service. The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves, according to the NHC. An onshore wind flow will continue a risk of dangerous rip currents on the northern Gulf Coast into midweek, and swimmers are encouraged to stay out of the water. Seas are expected to build to 6 to 10 feet by Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service in Mobile, Alabama. Wind Tropical-storm-force winds (39-plus mph) are possible in the tropical storm warning area in south Florida on Monday.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Religious persecution has forced thousands of Rohingya people to flee their homes in Myanmar for Bangladesh over the past 11 months. Now the 900,000 people who settled in refugee camps near Cox’s Bazar are facing another threat: heavy rain and landslides as the monsoon season picks up. The monsoon has been dubbed one of the most important climate patterns in the world. The rains spread from southeast to northwest over the course of the summer, nourishing fields across South Asia that provide food for many of the 1.76 billion people who live there. But they also pose an existential threat to refugees. As the refugee camps swelled, the forests in and around them quickly vanished as people sought wood for housing and building fires to cook. Makeshift structures of bamboo and tarps sprung up. Ditches were also dug for sanitation. Now with the onset of monsoon season, the haphazard infrastructure and lack of ground cover has put people living in the camps in grave danger as the rains have picked up. “Last week there was a strong monsoon depression over North Bay of Bengal which cause heavy rains over Cox Bazar area,” Nachiketa Acharya, a climate scientist at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society, told Earther. The United Nations reported that more than 15 inches of rain fell between Sunday and Tuesday, the equivalent of what normally falls over 20 days in June. With no trees to slow the runoff, 37 landslides occurred that affected 11,000 people. The Guardian indicates at least three are dead following the rains. Aerial mapping done by the United Nations shows an estimated 200,000 refugees could be at risk of landslides and floods, and more than 41,000 of them are living in areas with a high risk of landslides. In addition to the physical dangers, waterborne diseases are a growing risk, particularly without adequate sanitation. Acharya said the forecast for the rest of the monsoon season indicates increased odds of more rainfall that normal. That increases the risk of landslides, which is why the United Nations is pushing ahead for what they’re referring to as “mid-term shelters” with concrete moorings built on flat ground that can withstand the heavy rains and some landslides. “We need government approval for mid-term shelters and in view of the current weather and urgency to quickly provide more shelters to relocate families most at risk of landslides, we are focussing [sic] on this right now,” Caroline Gluck, a senior public information officer with the United Nations High Commission on Refugees in Cox’s Bazar, told Earther. The agency has also been working to help get families upgraded shelter kits including tarps, wire, rope, and bamboo. These kits have been supplied to more than 185,000 households. While they offer a modicum more security against the rains, they’re no match for landslides or winds that could come if a tropical cyclone hits the camp—a distinct risk. According to data maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 63 tropical systems have passed within 100 nautical miles of Cox’s Bazar. The most recent to make a nearby landfall was a tropical depression that hit in October 2011. One of the biggest impediments to speeding the whole process up is money. Earlier this year, the United Nations requested $951 million to “meet the immediate needs of more than 880,000 refugees and over 330,000 Bangladeshis in communities affected by the crisis.” Of that $136.6 million would be used for shelters. To date, only 13 percent of that funding has been provided.","Religious persecution has forced thousands of Rohingya people to flee their homes in Myanmar for Bangladesh over the past 11 months.

Kyle Orland,"Enlarge / A screen capture from Nintendo.com shows no ""Buy Digital"" option for Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze on the Wii U. reader comments 3 This week sees the re-release of Donkey Kong: Tropical Freeze on the Nintendo Switch, giving millions more people the opportunity to catch an enjoyable platformer they might have missed when it was first released in 2014 on the Wii U. Surprisingly, though, Wii U owners who want to purchase that original version of the game can no longer do so through Nintendo's online eShop. While Reddit user bgold101 alerted the Internet at large to the Wii U version's online removal on Monday, the title appears to have come down well before that. Captures from the Internet Archive show the ""Buy Digital"" option for Tropical Freeze on Nintendo's website disappeared sometime between October 22, 2017 and February 25, 2018, suggesting Nintendo made this move well ahead of Friday's Switch re-release. (Incidentally, the Switch version of Tropical Freeze was publicly announced on January 11 ). And while there are scattered reports that the game has returned to the eShop today, Ars has confirmed it is not available either via the website or the Wii U's own online store as of press time. Nintendo has yet to respond to a request for comment from Ars. Timing aside, it's odd that Donkey Kong: Tropical Freeze would be removed from the Wii U eShop at all. Games like Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon are still available for Wii U download, even though new versions of both games are also available on the Switch. Users who previously purchased Tropical Freeze on the Wii U report they are still able to re-download the game through the ""Your Downloads"" history page, so the digital files haven't disappeared entirely from Nintendo's servers (unlike sought-after PS4 horror demo P.T. 's removal from PSN, for instance). While legal issues like music rights sometimes force games off of digital storefronts, there's little reason to think such issues affect a wholly original first-party game from Nintendo. The Wii U version of Tropical Freeze is still being sold as a new physical disc at the bargain price of $20 (compared to $60 for the Switch re-release), so new players still have access to the original version of the game. The eShop removal, though, is yet another sign that when it comes to purely digital games, there's no guarantee that what's available one day will be available the next.",2014 release now only available as $20 disc ahead of $60 Switch launch.,2018-05-01T15:25:12Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","As Donkey Kong: Tropical Freeze comes to Switch, it disappears from Wii U",https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/as-donkey-kong-tropical-freeze-comes-to-switch-it-disappears-from-wii-u/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screen-Shot-2018-05-01-at-10.56.54-AM-760x380.png,ars-technica,Ars Technica,tropical,1

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","It’s been a year of unique weather to say the least. The latest potentially bizarre weather happening to add to the list? Florence, the first major hurricane of the season, could follow a highly unusual route from the center of the Atlantic into the heart of the Eastern Seaboard thanks to a weird atmospheric setup. There are a lot of factors that will affect the storm’s track over the coming days, and slight shifts in any of them could have major consequences. A U.S. landfall is not a given by any means, but Florence is a storm that bears watching into next week, especially with the latest model runs. The storm has already had a wild ride. On Wednesday, it whipped up into a Category 3 hurricane before running into turbulent winds that are part of the subtropical jet stream, a fast-flowing river of air in the atmosphere. By Thursday, Florence had weakened back to a tropical storm. It continued its subdued simmer into Friday with winds at 65 mph. That weakening is the start of the potential bad news for the East Coast, but it also means Florence will in all likelihood spare Bermuda. Hurricanes in the Atlantic usually follow a track that looks roughly like a backwards C owing to steering winds and the location of high pressure system known as the Bermuda High that generally sits parked in the middle of the Atlantic. If the storm had kept tracking northwestward, it would eventually have gotten sucked in by the high and spit back out into the North Atlantic, potentially clipping Bermuda in the process. But weaker winds and the storm’s interaction with the jet stream have nudged it on a more westerly track that’s very unusual. “It’s so far north for that longitude that storms in the area are historically in the process of recurving toward the north,” Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami, told Earther. “Not Florence.” Of the 57 named storms that have passed within 200 miles of Florence’s location as of late this morning, none have come close to striking the U.S. Most have curved out to sea with the exception of a few freak storms that skirted southwest toward the Dominican Republic. Florence’s northerly position is the East Coast’s first piece of bad news. The second is that an exceptionally strong ridge of high pressure air is building to the north that could essentially bottle up Florence and keep it rumbling westward. “No hurricane can turn north into that,” McNoldy said. In other words, if the ridge comes to bear at the strength recent model runs are showing, it would put Florence on a collision course with the East Coast. Not only that, it would steer the storm over a pool of very warm water, allowing it to roar back to life and potentially reach major hurricane status again. The vaunted Euro model has pretty consistently been pointing toward an East Coast landfall and the American weather model known as the GFS has been nudging that way, too. The Friday afternoon ensemble run of the Euro pushes Florence further westward with a likely landfall in the Southeast or Carolinas. If it happens, the storm will have essentially taken an unprecedented track across the Atlantic. Still, this is not the time to freak out. Florence remains 1,800 miles east of Florida. There are still a number of moving parts that will have to fall into place to make things go wrong for East Coasters. That said, it’s the time to listen to the National Hurricane Center and weather professionals and think about how you’ll prepare if the forecast continues to shape up poorly.","It’s been a year of unique weather to say the least.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - A tropical storm is likely to develop in the northwestern Caribbean late Sunday and bring storm surges and heavy rainfall to the U.S. Gulf Coast by midweek, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. It is still too early to say how strong the storm could be, but the system is set to bring heavy rain and flash flooding to areas of Central America, western Cuba and Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula in coming days, the center said in an early morning advisory on Sunday. The storm, called “Potential Tropical Cyclone 14”, was about 280 miles (450 KM) south southwest of the western tip of Cuba at 2 a.m. eastern time (0600 GMT), with sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km), the National Weather Service said. If it develops into a tropical storm, it will be called Michael, the next name in the list from the hurricane center. A hurricane center graphic showed the disturbance gaining storm-level winds of over 39 mph late Sunday and maintaining those speeds as it potentially hits the Florida coast east of Pensacola on Wednesday. Winds were forecast to drop in intensity as the system tracks northeast over Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina, reaching North Carolina by Thursday. “There is still too much uncertainty to discuss specific impacts, but we do know there will be a HIGH rip current risk, high surf, and increased rain chances beginning Monday,” the National Weather Service Mobile/Pensacola said.

https://fox13now.com/facebook/,"(CNN) — A potential tropical cyclone is looking to wreak havoc on Central America in the next few days. Known as “Potential Tropical Cyclone 14” by the National Hurricane Center, the storm is expected to form in the northwestern Caribbean Sea on Sunday, with heavy rains heading for western Cuba. Track the storm The system is expected to become a tropical depression late Saturday or Sunday and become a tropical storm by Sunday night, the center said. On the current forecast track, the center said the system is expected to move across the Yucatan Channel near the eastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula through Sunday night, and then move into the southern Gulf of Mexico on Monday. There is a tropical storm watch for the coast of Mexico from Tulum to Cabo Catoche, where tropical storm conditions are possible Sunday and Monday. There is also a tropical storm warning for the Cuban provinces of Pinar del Rio and the Isle of Youth. Currently, the storm is moving north at 7 mph. It is 120 miles south of Cozumel, Mexico, and is 240 miles south-southwest of the western tip of Cuba, according to the hurricane center’s 11 p.m. ET update Saturday. The storm may also produce 3 to 7 inches of rain in western Cuba and 2 to 4 inches over the Yucatan Peninsula, Belize and northern Honduras through Tuesday. Western Cuba could see isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches, the center said.

NBC 6 South Florida,"Tropical Depression 14 formed by the Yucatan Peninsula and could strengthen into a hurricane as it churns toward the Florida Panhandle, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is located about 100 miles east-northeast of Mexico's Chetumal city – moving north at a speed of 3 mph with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph, according to the NHC's 7 a.m. Sunday update. A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for the Cuban provinces of Pinar del Rio and the Isle of Youth, as well as the coast of Mexico from Tulum to Cabo Catoche. The NHC said tropical storm conditions are expected to reach the coasts by this evening, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous. ""On the forecast track, the center will move through the Yucatan Channel Monday morning and then across the eastern Gulf of Mexico late Monday through Wednesday,"" the NHC said in a statement. ""Some strengthening is forecast during the next several days, and the depression is expected to become a tropical storm later today. The system could become a hurricane by Tuesday night or Wednesday."" Up to 7 inches of rain is expected to fall over western Cuba and up to 4 inches is expected over the Yucatan Peninsula, Belize and northern Honduras. The NHC said life-threatening flash floods are possible due to very heavy rainfall along the Pacific coast of Central America and Mexico, including western Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, and the state of Chiapas in Mexico. Outer rain bands from the storm system could produce up to 4 inches of rain in the Florida Keys through Monday. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said he would issue an order declaring a state of emergency on Sunday for counties in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend.

Hanna Krueger,"Forecasters continue to increase the potential for the tropical wave currently near the Bahamas to develop into a tropical depression in the Gulf of Mexico. The disturbance is causing disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the southeastern and central Bahamas and adjacent Atlantic waters, including the Straits of Florida. Forecasters expect the system to move west-northwestward and will likely turn into a depression within the next day or two. In the past 24 hours, the chance of the wave transforming into a depression within the next 48 hours has been increased from 50 percent to 70 percent, according to the latest statement Sunday (Sept. 2) from the National Hurricane Center. The Hurricane Center said an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled to investigate the system Monday. This system will produce locally heavy rains and gusty winds across the central and northwestern Bahamas, southern Florida, and the Florida Keys during the next day or two. Local forecasters are warning of the potential for heavy rain in the New Orleans area starting Tuesday night as the system makes a ""beeline"" for the region. The amount and intensity of rain will depend on the strength of the system, which is still uncertain at this point. Right now, forecasters predict 3 to 5 inches of rain, but changes could happen fast and without warning. Flash flooding is probable, according to the National Weather Center. A tropical storm watch could be issued for portions of the northern Gulf Coast tonight as the storm continues to move northwestward. Within the next five days, the storm has a 90 percent chance of transforming into a tropical depression. In a Saturday statement, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged residents to be vigilant. She said the city is monitoring the weather and is prepared. St. Charles Parish said it has opened locations for residents to get sandbags. Locations are at the East and West Bank Bridge Parks and Louisiana 306 at Badeaux Lane East in Bayou Gauche. Residents are asked to bring their own shovel. The parish's Department of Public Works was putting up HESCO Baskets along Bayou Des Allemands and sandbagging the Des Allemands boat launch. The Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, or GOHSEP, said on Saturday that is has activated its Crisis Action Team to monitor the weather and respond to emergency managers across the state.

Paulina Dedaj,"After Tropical Storm Gordon drenched parts of South Florida on Monday, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for parts of the Gulf Coast -- where the storm is expected to roar ashore as soon as late Tuesday. Meteorologists have warned Gordon likely will strengthen into a hurricane by the time it reaches coastal Mississippi and Louisiana. Voluntary evacuation orders were issued on Monday for parts of Louisiana for residents in areas outside the levee protection system. Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Monday and said 200 National Guard troops will be deployed to southeastern Louisiana. The National Hurricane Center said at 8 p.m. ET that the storm was centered 95 miles west of Fort Myers, Florida. Maximum sustained winds were clocked at 60 mph. After making landfall, it is expected to charge inland over the lower Mississippi Valley on Wednesday. The hurricane warning was placed into effect for the area stretching from the mouth of the Pearl River in Mississippi to the Alabama-Florida border. As much as 8 inches of rain could fall in some parts of the Gulf states through late Thursday. The National Hurricane Center reported that the storm could unleash ""life-threatening"" storm surge to portions of the central Gulf Coast. A storm surge warning has been issued for the area stretching from Shell Beach, Louisiana, to Dauphin Island, Alabama. The warning means there is danger of life-threatening inundation. The region could see rising waters of 3 to 5 feet. ""The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large waves,"" the center said. Gordon is expected to dissipate by Saturday somewhere in the central U.S. After periods of heavy rainfall, flood advisories were in effect for parts of South Florida late Monday.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright DANIEL O'BRIEN Image caption Victoria has seen a spike in recent cases of the Buruli ulcer Doctors in Australia have called for urgent research into why a flesh-eating ulcer has become a ""worsening epidemic"" in the state of Victoria. Local cases of Buruli ulcer, a skin disease most commonly found in Africa, have surged by 400% in the last four years, experts say. Infections have also become more severe and spread to new areas. Doctors do not know how to prevent the disease, which is caused by bacteria that breaks down tissue. WARNING: Graphic image below A record 275 new infections were recorded the state last year, marking a 51% increase on 2016. Infectious diseases expert Dr Daniel O'Brien said cases of the Buruli ulcer, or Mycobacterium ulcerans disease, had become ""frighteningly more common and also more severe"" in the region. It was unclear why the ulcer, typically found in tropical areas, had emerged in the temperate climate of Victoria, he said. What is the Buruli ulcer? A skin disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans. The bacteria emits toxins that destroy skin cells, small blood vessels and the fat under the skin, leading to ulcers forming and skin loss. The ulcer gets bigger with time and can lead to permanent disfigurement or disability. Usually affects limbs but can also be found on the face and body. Doctors do not know how the disease is transmitted to humans but it's believed to arise from the environment and soil. There are also theories that mosquitoes can carry the bacteria. Writing in the Medical Journal of Australia, doctors have called for government funding to research the disease and its causes. ""No one understands what's happening and what's driving this epidemic,"" Dr O'Brien, a co-author, told the BBC. ""We can offer clues but not definitive advice. It's a mystery."" He said some theories involved factors such as rainfall, soil type and wildlife. Last year, authorities found traces of the bacteria in local possum faeces. Image copyright ELLA CROFTS Image caption The Buruli ulcer attacking a patient's knee ""The problem is, we don't have the time to sit around and pontificate about it - the epidemic has reached frightening proportions,"" he said. The ulcers are difficult to treat and patients often experience a recovery period of between six and 12 months. Many people also have to undergo reconstructive surgery, Dr O'Brien added. Victorian health authorities say they have spent more than A$1m (£550,000; $780,000) on researching the disease, and have started education campaigns to raise awareness about it. Until a few years ago, infections were more commonly reported from tropical regions in Queensland with occasional cases in other states.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","After plowing into the North Carolina coast late last week, Florence lingered over Carolinas all weekend like an unwanted house guest. Though its winds had slackened to a tropical depression by Sunday, the record-setting rains it unleashed have created a flooding catastrophe that is still unfolding. The scale of that catastrophe is now becoming apparent in aerial photographs. The storm has set tropical rainfall records for both South and North Carolina. Multiple locations in North Carolina saw more than 30 inches of rain, making this the wettest tropical system to ever hit the East Coast. The relentless rain also helped Wilmington, North Carolina break its annual rainfall record with three months left to go in the year. As Florence stormed ashore, it backed up rivers with its powerful surge. It also dumped copious rain inland, leaving water with nowhere to go but over the banks of rivers and streams. More than two dozen rivers in the Carolinas are currently in a major stage of flooding, and they could take all week to recede. One of the big concerns with Florence was the storm’s potential to wreak havoc on industrial farms and coal ash sites. At least one coal ash site has started leaking, and more could be in danger as water continues to worm its way into the earthen dams that hold it back. All this is to say Florence was everything forecasters expected and more. And with climate change increasing the odds of extreme precipitation and raising sea levels, we’ll almost certainly see more storms that can cause this kind of destruction.

But it turned out the ""gas"" that students smelt at a Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology library was a rotting durian found in a cupboard. The durian is a tropical fruit known for its strong, stinky smell. Firefighters said the smell had moved through the building via the air conditioning system. The building has now been reopened, Melbourne's Metropolitan Fire Brigade said in a statement. 'Turpentine and onions' After staff and students at the university reported a smell they thought to be gas in a library building, they were evacuated by the local police force. The fire brigade said the building stores potentially dangerous chemicals, triggering an investigation into the source of the smell. After what the fire brigade described as a ""comprehensive search"", they discovered that the smell was not a chemical gas but rather that it came from a durian that was going off. Durians are a prized fruit in South East Asia with a sweet and creamy flesh, but their smell can take some getting used to.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Tropical Storm Mangkhut was on the move Monday as it made its way through Southeast Asia. The former Super Typhoon, which at its peak became the strongest storm to form on Earth this year so far, has been pummeling Hong Kong, Macau, and the Philippines all weekend. Heavy rainfall from has triggered landslides throughout northern regions of the Philippines where Mangkhut struck on Saturday, and the government is blaming the mining industry—namely, small-scale mines that opereate illegally. At least 34 miners who sought refuge in a bunker were discovered dead; another 30 are still missing, reports the Guardian. Now, President Rodrigo Duterte is calling for the halt of all mining activities, per Reuters. In total, at least 64 people are dead in the Philippines, but Hurricane Maria in the U.S. taught us that death tolls can increase dramatically weeks or even months after a storm passes through. Mangkhut’s trail of destruction didn’t stop in the Philippines, however. The storm continued its way north, going on to strike Hong Kong and Macau on Sunday with 100 mph gusts. Australian news station SBS News posted a video to Twitter on Sunday that shows the power of that wind: Construction cranes were falling from high-rise buildings in Hong Kong as entire buildings swayed. For the rest of the week, the China Meteorological Administration is forecasting heavy rains along the storm’s projected path inland from the southeastern coast. Anywhere between four to six inches are expected to pour onto southern Chinese regions as the storm deteriorates. It’s too soon to know the direct role climate change has played in this disaster, but with warmer waters come stronger storms.

http://www.facebook.com/fox6news,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Gusty winds began to hit the eastern Caribbean on Sunday as Tropical Storm Beryl advanced rapidly toward a region struggling to recover from last year’s deadly hurricanes. The government of Dominica said it would shut down its water system and Puerto Rico’s governor warned of likely new power outages. People on islands across the region stocked up on food and water and prepared for possible damaging winds, rains and waves. Intermittent rainstorms already were hitting Dominica early Sunday, and the U.S. National Hurricane Center said 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 centimeters) of rain could fall as the storm moves through or near the island on Sunday night. Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit told people to store water because the government would be shutting down the water system as a precaution, and he warned them to stay alert despite the storm weakening. “They should not let their guard down,” he said. Meteorologist Marshall Alexander told The Associated Press that officials were worried about those still living with tarps on their roofs after Maria slammed into Dominica as a Category 5 storm last year, killing dozens of people. “We are in a vulnerable state,” he said. “The system can still cause a lot of damage regardless of whether it’s a tropical storm or a hurricane.” Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Chris formed off the Carolinas, and the U.S. National Hurricane Center said it was likely to grow into a hurricane while heading to the northeast, roughly parallel to the coast. It wasn’t projected to directly threaten land over the next few days, though forecasters said it could kick up dangerous surf and rip tides. In the Caribbean, a tropical storm warning was up on Guadeloupe and Dominica and long lines were reported at grocery stores on several islands as people shopped for food and water. “We can’t take chances with weather,” Jeffrey Xavier, manager of Mr. Clean Bed &amp; Breakfast in Dominica, said in a phone interview. “There was a lot of buying.” Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello said in a press conference late Saturday that the island could experience power outages and urged people without sturdy roofs to move in with relatives or a government shelter. More than 1,500 power customers remain in the dark more than nine months after Maria, and some 60,000 people still have only tarps for roofs. “I’m praying for all the brothers who are still living under a plastic roof,” said 79-year-old Alfonso Lugo in the southeastern Puerto Rico town of Humacao. “They’re the ones who are suffering the most now. They’re the ones who have been forgotten.” Lugo lost his roof and two walls to Maria, and was waiting on Sunday for volunteers to secure his new roof before Beryl arrives. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Beryl had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph) Sunday. It was centered 210 miles (335 kilometers) east of Martinique and was moving west-northwestward at 23 mph (37 kph). The storm was forecast to weaken into a low-pressure system Monday by the time it reaches seas just south of Puerto Rico, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September. Forecasters warned that the U.S. territory could see between 15 to 25 mph (25 to 40 kph) winds, as well as heavy rains that could cause flooding and mudslides. National Weather Service meteorologist Carlos Anselmi told the AP that 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) of rain was expected across Puerto Rico, with double that in isolated areas. Off the U.S. East Coast, Tropical Storm Chris was centered about 160 miles (260 kilometers) south of Cape Hatteras, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph). It was expected to remain almost stationary over the next few days before growing to hurricane force and moving to the northeast.","fox6now.com Tropical Storm Beryl speeding toward eastern Caribbean fox6now.com SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Gusty winds began to hit the eastern Caribbean on Sunday as Tropical Storm Beryl advanced rapidly toward a region struggling to recover from last year's dea…",2018-07-08T16:07:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Fox6now.com'}",Tropical Storm Beryl speeding toward eastern Caribbean - fox6now.com,https://fox6now.com/2018/07/08/tropical-storm-beryl-speeding-toward-eastern-caribbean/,https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/s096131537.jpg?quality=85&strip=all,,Fox6now.com,tropical,1
,"At a Glance Kirk has made a comeback as a tropical storm east of the Lesser Antilles. Tropical storm watches and warnings have been issued. Kirk will arrive in the Windward Islands on Thursday. Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides are the biggest danger. Kirk is then expected to be ripped apart by stronger wind shear in the Caribbean Sea this weekend. Tropical Storm Kirk is now quickly approaching the Lesser Antilles and will bring a threat of flooding rain, mudslides and some tropical-storm-force winds to parts of the Windward Islands beginning Thursday. The National Hurricane Center said convection had become better organized, prompting it to begin reissuing advisories on Tropical Storm Kirk. Kirk had lost its center of circulation Monday in the eastern Atlantic Ocean after first developing Saturday morning south of the Cabo Verde Islands. Data from the U.S. Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters indicated that Kirk has weakened again to a moderate tropical storm. Kirk is now located just over 150 miles east of Barbados, moving rather quickly west-northwestward. Tropical storm warnings have been posted for Barbados, St. Lucia, Dominica, Martinique and Guadeloupe, meaning tropical-storm-force winds (39-plus mph) are expected in these areas within 36 hours. Tropical storm watches are in effect for St. Vincent and the Grenadines, meaning tropical-storm-force winds are possible within 36 hours. (A watch is typically issued when tropical storm or hurricane conditions are possible within 48 hours. A warning is issued when those conditions are expected within 36 hours.) Forecast Steered by high pressure to the north, Kirk will arrive in the Windward Islands Thursday, first in Barbados, then in the rest of the Windward Islands covered by warnings. Little change in strength is anticipated before striking the Lesser Antilles. (INTERACTIVE: Kirk's Status, Forecast Path ) Current Storm Status and Projected Path (The red-shaded area denotes the potential path of the center of the tropical cyclone. It's important to note that impacts (particularly heavy rain, high surf, coastal flooding, winds) with any tropical cyclone usually spread beyond its forecast path.) The most serious threat from Kirk, however, will be from rainfall. Rainfall totals from 4 to 6 inches, with isolated totals up to 10 inches, are possible through Friday from Barbados and St. Lucia to Martinique, Dominica and Guadeloupe. Puerto Rico can expect 2 to 4 inches of rain as whatever is left of Kirk slides by to the south. This heavy rainfall over these mountainous islands will likely trigger life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides. (This should be interpreted as a broad outlook of where the heaviest rain may fall and may shift based on the forecast path of the tropical cyclone. Higher amounts may occur where bands of rain stall over a period of a few hours. ) Fortunately, Kirk is expected to encounter a formidable wall of wind shear the change in wind speed and/or direction with height in the Caribbean Sea this weekend. (MORE: Weird Aspects to the 2018 Atlantic Hurricane Season ) Current Satellite and Wind Shear (Areas of clouds are shown in white. Areas of strong wind shear, the difference in wind speed and direction with height, are shown in purple. High wind shear is hostile to mature tropical cyclones and those trying to develop.) This should eventually rip Kirk apart before it can threaten other areas of the Caribbean, as it did to Tropical Depression Eleven last weekend east of the Lesser Antilles. Just over three years ago, Tropical Storm Erika dumped up to a foot of rain in just 12 hours on Dominica, producing catastrophic flooding and mudslides, killing 30, damaging or destroying 271 homes and damaging roads, bridges and other infrastructure on the island, according to the National Hurricane Center's final report. Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit said Erika's damage set the nation's developmental progress back 20 years. A river overflows, affecting some homes along its banks, due to Tropical Storm Erika in Roseau, Dominica, Thursday, Aug. 27, 2015. Streets across Dominica turned into fast-flowing rivers that swept up cars as the storm pummeled the eastern Caribbean island. (AP Photo/Carlisle Jno Baptiste) The destruction Erika left behind was sufficient to prompt a committee of the World Meteorological Organization to retire the name Erika from use for future Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes. Erika was only the second name retired for an Atlantic tropical cyclone which never reached hurricane status since names were first retired in 1954. Allison in 2001 a multi-billion-dollar flood event in metro Houston was the only other tropical storm whose name was retired. Like Kirk, Erika fought wind shear through its life cycle, but rainfall potential of any tropical cyclone is not a function of the intensity of the storm. The rainfall flood threat from Kirk should be taken seriously.

Gina Cherelus,"(Reuters) - Gulf Coast residents should “take this storm seriously”, the National Weather Service said early on Sunday, as Subtropical Storm Alberto drove north, threatening heavy rains and winds to the southern coastal states. Florida, Alabama and Mississippi declared states of emergency on Saturday as the storm threatened up to 12 inches of rain over the Memorial Day weekend and tidal surges and damaging winds, according to Patrick Burke of the weather service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. “This is jogging more to the east and will hit the Florida panhandle,” Burke said. “We’re talking eight to 12 inches of rain this weekend, and storm surges on the Gulf Coast.” “It’s heavy rainfall on the entire coast,” he said. The first named Atlantic storm of 2018 is expected to intensify and bring wind speeds of up to 65 miles per hour to the Gulf Coast when it approaches over the holiday on Monday, he said. A tropical storm warning has been issued for the Mississippi/Alabama border to the Aucilla River in Florida. Rainfall totals of between 5 and 10 inches, with up to 15 inches, are possible from eastern Louisiana to Mississippi, Alabama, western Tennessee and the western Florida panhandle, the NWS said. All 67 Florida counties were issued the emergency notice to give state and local governments enough time and resources to prepare, Florida Governor Rick Scott said in a statement. “As we continue to monitor Subtropical Storm Alberto’s northward path toward Florida, it is critically important that all Florida counties have every available resource to keep families safe and prepare for the torrential rain and severe flooding this storm will bring,” Scott said. His Mississippi and Alabama counterparts also declared states of emergency, citing the threat of coastal and inland flooding from storm rains. Alabama Governor Kay Ivey issued a state of emergency covering 40 counties beginning at 6 a.m. on Sunday. “Whether you’re a resident of this state or just visiting, you need to stay updated on this evolving tropical system,” Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant said in a statement. “I ask everyone to please make final preparations to your family emergency plan, especially those that live in mobile homes and low-lying areas.” On Saturday evening, the storm was located about 95 miles north of the western tip of Cuba and 275 miles southwest of the Dry Tortugas, which is almost 70 miles west of Key West, Florida, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC). Alberto, which spun up days before the formal start of the 2018 hurricane season, was moving north at about 13 mph with maximum sustained winds near 40 mph, and higher gusts, on Saturday, the NWS said. Gradual strengthening is forecast until the system reaches the northern Gulf Coast. Alberto’s projected storm track has shifted eastward since Friday, lessening its threat to the active oil production areas in the Gulf of Mexico. Royal Dutch Shell plc and Exxon Mobil evacuated some personnel from offshore Gulf oil facilities on Friday.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Hurricane season is in full swing, and the Atlantic is raging. If you live on the coast, you owe it to yourself to pay attention to what storms are out there, where they’re headed, and what the impacts could be. Whether you’re new to hurricane watching or a weather geek, Earther has you covered. These are the definitive sources and handy tools to have at your disposal to know what’s going on when the tropics get roaring, as well as where to find the most jaw-dropping images of nature’s cyclonic terrors. National Hurricane Center The National Hurricane Center is the gold standard one-stop shop for information on specific storms, from when they have a chance of forming up to where they’ll come ashore. There are maps, there are words, there are technical discussions, there are lay people discussions. There is A Lot, but it’s all relevant if you’re in the path of a hurricane or tropical storm, so bookmark it. Among the many things you’ll find on this website: Information on where watches and warnings have been issued, forecasts for wind speed, forecasts for rainfall totals, and forecasts for storm surge. The latter two are particularly important since water is the deadliest part of a hurricane despite, the fact that the Saffir Simpson scale used to classify hurricane categories is only based on wind. But that’s a topic for a whole other post. Onwards! Satellite Loop Interactive Data Explorer in Real-time Colorado State University may be landlocked, but it offers one of the best ways to see hurricanes from space. The Satellite Loop Interactive Data Explorer in Real-time (dubbed SLIDER because every good research tool needs an acronym) visualizes data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) GOES 16 and 17 weather satellites, which together cover the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific, in near-real time. That includes views of the big picture as well as “floaters,” weather geekspeak for zoomed in views on tropical storms. Bonus points: it includes Pacific imagery from Japan’s Himawari-8 satellite so you can track tropical cyclones on the other side of the world, too. Tropical Tidbits If you want a peek under the hood at how the National Hurricane Center makes its forecast, check out the weather models on Tropical Tidbits. The site is maintained Levi Cowan, a meteorology graduate student at Florida State University, and it is deep. You’ve got models, sets of models known as ensembles, Hurricane Hunter tracks and data collected by the brave souls at NOAA who fly into tropical storms for science. And Cowan uploads discussions of the storms. Another great spot to see model runs is wx.graphics. It’s all super insightful, but a word of caution about models if you’re not a meteorologist: They’re helpful but they aren’t a forecast. Forecasts are created by people who understand what they’re looking at across the models and work to find the best solution. So do not take what you see in one particular model run as gospel or make a plan based on it. Listen to the professionals. The International Space Station Live Cam Satellites are cool and all, but there’s a much closer source of space wonderment. The International Space Station has a live HD camera pointed at Earth. It circles the planet every 90 minutes, which means you have an excellent chance of spotting a hurricane on the flyover. Its views really convey the immensity of storms that may get lost from the satellite snaps taken in much more distant orbits. And if you miss a pass over a storm live, don’t worry. Just watching the Earth from space live is a pretty chill treat in itself, plus astronauts frequently snap epic pictures that find their way on the station’s Twitter account. Earth Wind Map If you like your weather presented in the style of Van Gogh, the Earth wind map is for you. It’s based on data from the American weather model known as the Global Forecast System (GFS). While it’s not as ballyhooed as its European counterpart and (again) should not be considered an official forecast, it’s still hella nice to look at. You can also overlay wind speeds at different layers of the atmosphere and ocean temperatures to get a better sense of the dynamics at play. Ventusky, a Czech meteorology firm, offers a similarly spellbinding map. Your Local TV Weather Person It may sound decidedly less cool than the wind map and hurricanes from space, but I can’t stress enough how important these folks are as resources. They’re the closest thing you’re going to get to a scientist in your living room. They know how to read models, they know your region, and they understand the specific risks hurricanes can pose to towns or, say, your nearest industrial hog farm. If you don’t own a television (raises hand), you can almost certainly find them on Twitter. Many also have blogs on their station website. A number of local news sites also have a weather section. Capital Weather Gang is the pioneer for the Washington, D.C. metro area but plenty of other places have their own version (the Roanoke Times has Weather Journal run by seasoned meteorologist Kevin Myatt for example). Ditto for your local National Weather Service (NWS) office. These folks work tirelessly during storms, and their sole mission is to provide “weather, water, and climate data, forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property and enhancement of the national economy.” So listen to them, don’t give them too much grief if the forecast doesn’t pan out, and maybe even send them pizza when the clouds blow over and the waters recede.","Hurricane season is in full swing, and the Atlantic is raging.

Mark Kaufman,"Cyclone Idai left death, destruction, and a sprawling inland sea in its wake. 
The powerful tropical cyclone which struck Mozambique last Thursday as the equivalent of a Category 2 or 3 hurricane with winds of around 100 mph has left at least 150 dead and 600,000 in need of help in the flooded nation said the EU, though the Associated Press reports over 300 fatalities as of March 21 when accounting for deaths in neighboring Zimbabwe.
The cyclone's widespread flooding in part overshadowed by simultaneous and historic flooding in the Midwest has left behind an inundated area some 200 square miles in size (518 square kilometers), with the inland sea reaching up to 15 miles wide, according to satellite images from the European Space Agency (ESA). 
The destruction is particularly severe around Mozambique's fourth largest city, Beira. 
SEE ALSO: The West accepts its drought-ridden future, slashes water use
""The situation is terrible. The scale of devastation is enormous. It seems that 90 per cent of the area is completely destroyed,"" said the Red Cross's Jamie LeSueur, who is working in the region. 
Though there's little evidence showing that the planet is experiencing more cyclones and hurricanes, there is mounting evidence that illustrates these storms are growing stronger compared to storms in the 21st century.
What's more, cyclones, like any big storm today, can now carry more water: The world has warmed by 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1 Celsius, over the last century, and for every 1 degree C of warming, the atmosphere holds seven percent more water.

Associated Press,"HONOLULU – The Latest on Tropical Storm Lane (all times local): 4 a.m. Federal officials say Hawaii residents shouldn't let their guard down now that a once-powerful hurricane that threatened the island state has become a tropical storm. The head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator says that although Lane is no longer a hurricane, tropical storms themselves can still be very dangerous. Brock Long says during a briefing that ""Hawaii is not in the clear from Tropical Storm Lane at this point."" Long says torrential rains will be the largest threat facing Hawaii during the next 48 hours. Lane churned toward the island chain early this week as the most powerful type of hurricane measured: a Category 5. But upper-level winds tore the storm apart and, by late Friday, the National Weather Service had downgraded Lane to a tropical storm. ___ 6 p.m. Friday A powerful hurricane that threatened Hawaii for a week is weakening and is now a tropical storm. But meteorologists are warning heavy rains could still wallop the islands with flash flooding and landslides. Lane dumped nearly 3 feet of rain on parts of the Big Island of Hawaii over the past two days, forcing residents to flee their flooded homes in waist-high water. Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell said Friday that people need to be vigilant and not let their guard down. But he says the good news is Lane got weak and fell apart.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Super Typhoon Mangkhut (known locally as Ompong) as it approaches the Philippines. GIF: CIMSS While the world watches Florence make a historic landfall in the Carolinas, there’s another storm on the other side of the planet worthy of our attention. Super Typhoon Mangkhut is the biggest, baddest storm on the planet, and it’s bearing down on the Philippines’ most populous island. After ripping apart houses in Guam like tin cans, Mangkhut—known as Ompong in the Philippines, which uses a different typhoon naming system—has continued its westward march across the Pacific. The storm is packing wind gusts up to 200 mph, taking the title from Super Typhoon Jebi for the strongest cyclone to grace our fair planet this year. Tropical storm-force winds radiate roughly 300 miles out from its center. The forecast indicates that the storm will likely make landfall overnight or early Saturday morning in the northeast corner of Luzon, an island that’s home to 43 million. The huge wind field means that even Manila, located 250 miles south, could still feel the impacts of Mangkhut. But those in the direct vicinity of Mangkhut’s landfall will have to contend with much more than that. The storm could produce nearly 20 feet of storm surge according to the Red Cross, creating deadly conditions along the coast. The Philippines meteorological service warned that all evacuations should already have taken place and that the “situation is potentially very destructive.” The group notes that trees could be uprooted, coconut plantations could be destroyed, and that the electrical system and homes and commercial buildings are likely to see “severe” damage. Mangkhut has drawn comparisons to Super Typhoon Haiyan, which is a really ominous sign. That storm tore through the Philippines in 2013, leaving 6,000 dead and obliterating entire communities. Mangkhut, however, isn’t quite as strong and is forecast to take a more northerly path through the island nation, passing over a less densely populated region. While there hasn’t been any work to attribute Mangkhut specifically to climate change, the warmer oceans and higher seas that are both hallmarks of our warming world are clear links. Mangkhut is passing over waters that are up to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above normal, providing the fuel it needs to stay strong. The Philippines is also a sea level rise hot spot, with waters rising five times faster than the global average. The Philippines is also a hot spot for typhoons owing to its tropical location. The nation has been hit by more tropical cyclones than any other country save China since 1970.","While the world watches Florence make a historic landfall in the Carolinas, there’s another storm on the other side of the planet worthy of our attention.

Patrick Phillips,"CHARLESTON, SC (WCSC) - Tropical Storm Kirk formed Saturday morning well south of the Cabo Verde Islands. Kirk is expected to move quickly westward across the deep tropical Atlantic. As of 11 a.m. Saturday, the storm was located about 450 miles south of the southernmost Cabo Verde Islands. The storm’s center was located near latitude 8.3 North, longitude 23.6 West. Kirk is moving toward the west near 14 mph and a westward to west-northwestward motion at a similar forward speed is expected to continue through Saturday night. A faster westward motion across the deep tropical Atlantic Ocean is expected Sunday through Tuesday. TROPICAL STORM KIRK FORMS Next up: Kirk! Tropical Storm Kirk becomes the 11th named storm of the 2018 hurricane season. Kirk is located south of the Cabo Verde Islands and could approach the Lesser Antilles late next week. #chswx #kirk pic.twitter.com/xxDUBlGvU2 — JoeyLive5 (@JoeySovine) September 22, 2018 Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph with higher gusts. Some strengthening is forecast through Sunday, with little change in intensity forecast on Monday and Tuesday. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles, mainly to the northwest of the center. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches). Tropical Depression 11 expected to dissipate The newest tropical depression, located about 485 miles east of the Windward Islands, is expected to be downgraded into a remnant low on Sunday and fall apart east of the Lesser Antilles Sunday night. At 11 a.m. Sunday, its center was located near latitude 13.2 North, longitude 53.8 West. The depression is moving toward the west near 3 mph. A westward to west-northwestward motion at a slightly faster forward speed is expected during the next couple of days. Two other areas also being watched The nearer of two other systems being watched has the lower chance of developing into a tropical system within the next five days. The broad area of low pressure located about 200 miles south of Bermuda is now producing some disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity. Strong upper-level winds and dry air are expected to limit development for the next day or so, but conditions could become more conducive for some development of this system by early next week while it moves westward and west-northwestward over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. By the middle of next week, upper-level winds are likely to increase again, which would limit additional development as the system turns northward and moves closer to the southeastern coast of the United States. Meteorologists say it has a 40 percent chance of formation over the next five days. Meanwhile, a frontal non-tropical low pressure system is located about 1000 miles west-southwest of the Azores. Conditions are expected to become conducive for this low to acquire subtropical or tropical characteristics during the next day or so, and a subtropical or tropical cyclone is likely to form by early next week while the low meanders over the central Atlantic Ocean. It has a 70 percent chance of forming over the next five days. After Kirk, the next names on the Atlantic Hurricane names list are Leslie, Michael, Nadine, Oscar and Patty. As of now, none of the systems poses a direct threat to the Lowcountry, Meteorologist Joey Sovine said.","Live 5 News WCSC FIRST ALERT: Tropical Storm Kirk forms in eastern Atlantic Live 5 News WCSC CHARLESTON, SC (WCSC) - Tropical Storm Kirk formed Saturday morning well south of the Cabo Verde Islands.

ERYN DION,"Tropical Storm Kirk, Subtropical Storm Leslie and a disturbance have all appeared in the Atlantic, with the disturbance set to aim at North Carolina. ATLANTIC OCEAN — After taking a week off, the tropics are back at it again with Tropical Storm Kirk and Subtropical Storm Leslie forming over the weekend and a disturbance aiming at the already storm-weary North Carolina coast. Of these, Tropical Storm Kirk will have the best chance of sticking around long enough for impact as the storm races west across the Atlantic Ocean at a brisk 21 mph and is expected to hit the accelerator around mid-week, picking up even faster westward motion by midweek, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is expected to reach the Lesser Antilles still at tropical storm strength by Friday, though some weakening is expected. The storm’s path after the islands is not clear as of yet. Subtropical Storm Leslie, with maximum sustained 40 mph winds, is nearly stationary in the middle Atlantic, moving at a mere 3 mph westward. The NHC forecasts Leslie will continue the slow crawl for the next few days until inevitably dissipating. While the storm itself is not particularly powerful, Leslie has a large area of effect, with tropical storm-force winds extending 270 miles out from the center. And a disturbance — a broad area of low pressure — sandwiched between Bermuda and the Bahamas may make a go at soaking the already water-logged North Carolina by mid-week. According to the NHC, this system is currently being hindered by some upper-level winds, but those winds are expected to die down in the next couple of days, giving the system a chance for some development. The disturbance will be traveling west and west-northwestward at about 10 mph, but will again encounter upper-level winds by Wednesday as it approaches the southeastern coast of the U.S. While some storms are just getting started, Tropical Depression 11 near the Windward Islands dissipated Sunday afternoon.","The News Herald Tropical Storm Kirk racing across Atlantic, Subtropical Storm Leslie forms The News Herald Tropical Storm Kirk, Subtropical Storm Leslie and a disturbance have all appeared in the Atlantic, with the disturbance set to aim at North Carolina.

Doug Phillips,"South Florida is again part of the Sunshine State — at least temporarily. The drudgery of constant rain has eased up a bit and the sun will be out on Wednesday, but that tropical disturbance heading for the Gulf of Mexico is threatening to ruin the weather for the Memorial Day weekend. The disturbance is currently a broad surface low centered just east of Belize. Because of strong upper-level winds, the system has a low chance of development over the next two days, according to the National Hurricane Center. However, environmental conditions are forecast to eventually become more conducive for development. The system has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical or subtropical depression during the next five days as it slowly moves into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane center said in an tropical weather outlook at 8 a.m. Wednesday. A big factor for South Florida is that the peninsula will be on the east side — or the wet side — of the weather system. “Regardless of development, locally heavy rainfall is possible across western Cuba, the Cayman Islands and much of Florida during the next few days, and over much of Florida and the northern Gulf Coast during the weekend,” hurricane specialist Eric Blake said in the outlook. Given that context, here is the current forecast — through Monday — from the National Weather Service : Wednesday A slight chance of showers, then a chance of showers and thunderstorms after 8am. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 84. Southeast wind 6 to 8 mph. Chance of precipitation is 30%. Wednesday Night A 30 percent chance of showers, mainly after 2 a.m. Mostly cloudy, with a low around 74. Southeast wind 5 to 7 mph. Thursday A 30 percent chance of showers. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 84. Southeast wind around 8 mph. Thursday Night Showers likely, mainly after 2 a.m. Cloudy, with a low around 74. Southeast wind around 7 mph. Chance of precipitation is 60%. Friday Showers likely. Cloudy, with a high near 82. Southeast wind 10 to 14 mph, with gusts as high as 18 mph. Chance of precipitation is 70%. Friday Night Showers likely. Cloudy, with a low around 74. Southeast wind 11 to 13 mph. Chance of precipitation is 70%. Saturday Showers likely. Cloudy, with a high near 82. Breezy, with a southeast wind 13 to 17 mph, with gusts as high as 23 mph. Chance of precipitation is 70%. Saturday Night Showers likely. Mostly cloudy, with a low around 75. Breezy, with a southeast wind 18 to 20 mph, with gusts as high as 25 mph. Chance of precipitation is 70%. Sunday Showers likely. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 85. South wind around 15 mph, with gusts as high as 20 mph. Chance of precipitation is 60%. Sunday Night A 50 percent chance of showers. Mostly cloudy, with a low around 76. Memorial Day Showers likely. Partly sunny, with a high near 85. Chance of precipitation is 60%.

Bryan Norcross,"PEMBROKE PARK, Fla. - The odds continue to increase that a depression or named storm will form in the northern Gulf of Mexico over the weekend. It might start as a subtropical depression -- the atmosphere is not in a wholly tropical state over the Gulf -- but if it sits over the warm Gulf waters long enough, it could well become Tropical Storm Alberto. INSIDE: Interactive Radar | Weather Warnings None of this affects the forecast for South Florida and the Florida peninsula, however. The threat continues to be for periods of heavy rain. The Gulf system, whatever form it takes, will draw deep tropical moisture from the Caribbean directly over the peninsula beginning late Friday and increasing over the Memorial Day weekend. On the satellite picture, you see the low pressure area located over the Yucatan peninsula. The upper-level winds shown in blue are pushing the thunderstorms off to the east and creating an environment that is not conducive for organization. When the low moves to the northern Gulf, however, the environment will be more favorable, though still not ideal. So the odds of the system ever becoming a hurricane appear low. The National Hurricane Center map shows the cone-shaped area where the system is most likely to organize into a tropical or subtropical depression -- again, in the Gulf away from Florida. Finally, the rainfall forecast from now until early next week from the National Weather Service shows the extensive area with the potential for heavy rain covering all of Florida and the northern Gulf Coast, including South Florida. For South Florida, the forecast for the weekend calls for a total of 3-7 inches of rain and fairly breezy. The rain won't fall uniformly across the area, however. Some areas may get more, others less. Flooding due to the high water table from all the rain last week is the main concern.

Jolyn Rosa,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Lane, greatly diminished from the major hurricane it once was, drifted away from the Hawaiian coast on Saturday, but lingering showers threatened to trigger more flooding and landslides. The National Weather Service (NWS) lifted all remaining tropical storm warnings and watch advisories for Hawaii as trade winds finally began to nudge Lane off to the west. But a flash flood watch remained in effect for Oahu, home to the state capital Honolulu and 70 percent of Hawaii’s 1.4 million residents, through Sunday morning, emergency management officials said. Civil defence officials on the Big Island said more rain and flooding were also possible there, and a high-surf advisory was posted through the day for south- and east-facing shores of all the islands. Lane’s maximum sustained winds dropped to 50 miles (80 km) per hour, but residual moisture would produce excessive rainfall that could lead to “additional flash flooding and landslides,” a weather service bulletin said. Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas one year ago Saturday, then stalled over the Gulf Coast as it drenched the region in rain for several days, causing devastating floods. BIG ISLAND BEARS BRUNT OF RAIN Ahead of Lane, Hawaii residents had spent days stocking up on food, water, gasoline and batteries and boarding up their windows. The island chain was spared the calamity of a direct hit from a major hurricane as the storm steadily weakened on Friday. However, by then torrential showers had drenched the windward side of Hawaii’s Big Island for more than two days, unleashing severe flooding and mudslides that forced multiple road closures and damaged or destroyed a number of homes and other structures, authorities said. At least two neighbourhoods around Hilo, the largest city on the Big Island, were evacuated on Friday, and emergency teams have rescued more than 50 people trapped by high water since Thursday, Hawaii County Civil Defence spokeswoman Kelly Wooten told Reuters by phone. “I’ve never seen this, so much devastation of the river flowing down off of Komohana,” said one long-time Hilo resident, Tracy Pacheco. “I just came from Pahale Park, and there’s no park.” Rains finally abated on the Big Island on Saturday, she said. Hilo received more than 31 inches (79 cm) of rain from Wednesday through Friday, its largest three-day total since records began in 1949. Some areas received more than 45 inches, the weather service said. Forecasts predicted that Lane, which peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with top sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph) earlier in the week while far from Hawaii, would diminish into a tropical depression by early on Sunday. By Saturday morning the water had receded enough that many residents of Hilo were mopping up several inches of mud. Jillane Bosscher, a 45-year-old chef, and her family spent Thursday night and Friday in a local shelter. By Saturday the water had receded enough that they were able to return home and start cleaning. In another sign of improving conditions, most harbours around the state were reopened or placed on “hurricane preparedness” status allowing shippers to resume operations with caution, a according to the state Transportation Department. On the islands of Maui, Molokai and Lanai, evacuees have returned home from emergency shelters, and those facilities were being closed, local officials reported.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"The drive to the Arecibo Observatory from San Juan is breathtaking in both beauty and treachery. The hour-long journey follows a roller-coaster-like path of humps and switchbacks through the dense tropical forest on what should be, but is not, a one-way road. Houses remain covered in tarps, awaiting repairs to their storm-ravaged roofs, and at least one sported anti-FEMA graffiti. Though Puerto Rico’s huge, historic observatory survived Hurricane Maria with little damage, its future is now in jeopardy. Recently, the University of Central Florida revealed itself as the leader behind a mysterious consortium that would take over management of the storied telescope—the world’s second-largest single dish. Six months after Hurricane Maria, which killed hundreds of people and left Puerto Rico with widespread power outages that continue today, Arecibo could potentially be in a better place than it was before the storm, as it transitions to new management with more private funding. But there’s work left to be done before the Arecibo is out of the woods. At 1,000 feet wide, Arecibo was the largest single-dish telescope from 1963 until 2016, when it lost its title to the 1640-foot FAST telescope in China. It’s responsible for years of asteroid imaging, exoplanet and pulsar studies, and atmospheric research. It sent the famous Arecibo Message meant for extraterrestrials in 1974. Its observations earned two scientists the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering binary pulsars, a tool that could be used to further study how stars emit gravitational waves. Arecibo appears as alien on the Puerto Rican landscape as the beings it attempted to contact back in the 1970s. Three support towers, all taller than 200 feet, suspend a massive ring with a dome and antennae over the thousand-foot-dish, built into a sinkhole in the area’s hilly topography. It looks like a hidden Cold War-era weapon with its dark, dirty panels, but this doesn’t get in the way of the cutting-edge science conducted there (and the panels are currently getting a cleaning). Its look earned it a spot in the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. The telescope’s troubles began long before Maria. The federal government discussed budget cuts as early as 2006, reports the Associated Press, as the National Science Foundation has hunted for ways to free up money by letting go of older projects. The NSF previously funded two-thirds of Arecibo’s $12 million budget, as Nature has reported, and has been looking for a way to reduce its contribution. Maria struck Puerto Rico as a category 4 hurricane on September 20, 2017. Much of the island lost power, and hundreds of thousands were still in the dark as of last month. The telescope seemed to weather the storm miraculously, only losing part of one of its instruments, which crashed down into its dish, breaking 30 of the nearly 40,000 reflective aluminum panels that focus radio signals into the telescope’s antennae. But good news came in November: The NSF announced a way forward that wouldn’t require shutting down the observatory. Over the next five years, the NSF would decrease its annual funding from $8.2 million to $2 million, while private backers would take over the rest. More recently, the telescope’s management team announced a restructuring, as a cooperative agreement with managers SRI International, the Universities Space Research Association, and Universidad Metropolitana (UMET) was set to end on March 31. Instead, a consortium led by the University of Central Florida, with help from a private company called Yang Enterprises, will take over, with UMET remaining involved. NASA will continue to fund around $4 million of the telescope’s costs per year to support its own research. Next steps for the telescope are fraught. Physics Today reported that all employees will need to reapply for their jobs by the end of this month; that the University of Central Florida doesn’t currently have scientists with the expertise required by Arecibo; and that the consortium is looking for other options for more funding, too, such as partnerships with the Department of Defense (who does fund some science research through programs like DARPA) or arrangements for scientists and agencies to pay to use the telescope. Gizmodo reached out to Francisco Cordova, Arecibo’s director, for comment about the Physics Today article, and we will update the post when we hear back. Then of course, there’s how Arecibo fits into Puerto Rico as a whole. The telescope’s local staff of around 120 was responsible for clearing the roads and ensuring things were back up and running a week after the storm. But the island still faces power outages and its own long road to recovery. Some worry the island is being forgotten. “It’s easy for the government to focus its energy on things that are easy to fix,” planetary radar astronomer Alessondra Springmann from the University of Arizona told Gizmodo. “But it’s also easy for the US to forget.” Back at the telescope, some of the observatory’s users are more optimistic. After all, the future may be hazy, but at least there’s a future. “I think things will get much better,” Abel Mendez, planetary astrobiologist at the University of Puerto Rico, Arecibo told Gizmodo. “This is a setback, but with the plan that the observatory is making, that NASA is putting faith in it—I think in the long run, we’ll have a better telescope.”","The drive to the Arecibo Observatory from San Juan is breathtaking in both beauty and treachery.

Sasha Lekach,"Before Hurricane Florence hit, Tesla gave its electric cars a boost by extending the range of their batteries to help people evacuate. Florence made landfall in North Carolina on Friday before being downgraded to a tropical storm. SEE ALSO: There's a glaring weakness in electric vehicles. (It's range anxiety.) As NPR reported, Tesla can remotely tap into the max capacity of its 75 kWh batteries in Model S and X vehicles, adding about 30 more miles of range. In any natural disaster situation like this, our policy is to make Superchargers free of use in order to optimize evacuation routes for affected customers https://t.co/SOUlKv3UUZ — Tesla (@Tesla) September 13, 2018 Tesla owners were notified that Tesla had enabled the additional battery capacity. They were also offered free Supercharging, which gets batteries to 80 percent in about 30 minutes. ""We hope that this gives you the peace of mind to get to a safe location,"" the notification read. Normal battery configurations will return mid-October. Tesla also extended battery range last year during Hurricane Irma. On GM vehicles from Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac, all OnStar members have access to Crisis Assist services during disasters like Florence even if they don't usually subscribe. That means people can use their cars to navigate out of disaster zones, find hotels, gas, or use their vehicles as a WiFi hotspot. Mary Ann Adams, disaster response and crisis incident manager for OnStar, said in a phone call Friday that 25,000 calls had come in since Tuesday through the Crisis Assist service to always-available response teams. ""Since cars are connected they provide connections they may not have,"" she said about people in the storm zone. For many the OnStar tools mean access to a working phone and a charging source. For others it's a way to find a hotel or the latest storm updates. ""I think of it as another tool to survive the storm and navigate the storm,"" she said. After a storm, calls tick up again as damage is assessed and further evacuations may be required. For some it's a matter of checking to see if they can return home. If they can, signage and roads may be destroyed, prompting more calls to the command center. As of Friday afternoon, according to the New York Times, four deaths have been linked to the storm. It's supposed to move southwest into South Carolina before heading north.","Before Hurricane Florence hit, Tesla gave its electric cars a boost by extending the range of their batteries to help people evacuate.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The wait for El Niño continues, but scientists are already gearing up for its impacts. Chief among those is how it warms the planet as a whole. In this age of climate change, 2019 is already shaping up to be an extremely hot year, but El Niño could give it a little boost. El Niño is characterized by warming waters in the tropical Pacific. Forecasters have been watching the region intensely for months as El Niño-like conditions have slowly developed. To official declare El Niño on, a region of the Pacific dubbed NINO3.4 has to have three consecutive months where waters are a half degree Celsius above normal. Were not there yet, but were close, and El Niño is likely to be official by this winter. With El Niño come a whole range of impacts, including a general uptick in the global average temperature as the tropical Pacific radiates heat into the atmosphere, altering the climate system for months even after El Niño ends. Using the official forecast of El Niño conditions over the coming three months, NASA climate scientist Gavin Schmidt tweeted a graph on Thursday showing where 2019 is likely to land in the pantheon of global average temperatures. It shows next year will almost certainly continue the string of years where the planet is more than 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial era. Next year is also likely to be hotter than this year, and has a 33 percent chance of being the hottest year on record according to Schmidt. (That distinction which currently belongs to 2016, another El Niño year). Climate change has created a steady drumbeat of ever-rising temperatures. El Niño is only providing the bump. Thats what makes the chances that 2019 could be record hot so striking. You see, 2016 wasnt just any old El Niño. It was a Super El Niño among the strongest ever recorded that lasted over multiple years. In contrast, the coming El Niño is only forecast to be a weak one according to the latest update from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC). That 2019 could be record warm shows that we only need tiny nudges from natural climate shifts now to create big, new records. In addition to cranking up the heat around the world, El Niño will also have widespread impacts on weather. CPC is already forecasting a wetter than normal winter across the southern U.S., for example, a common pattern when El Niño is around. Elsewhere, its likely that Australia will see hot, dry conditions and coral reefs could face warmer oceans and possibly bleaching.","The wait for El Niño continues, but scientists are already gearing up for its impacts.

Mark Kaufman,"Hurricane Lane, which is currently bearing down on Hawaii, is ""not a well behaved storm,"" according to the state's governor David Ige. Spinning in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the hurricane has grown into a monstrous Category 5 storm, the most powerful type of hurricane with winds now reaching 160 mph. Tuesday evening, the National Hurricane Center called the cyclone ""an impressive hurricane,"" and forecast that the storm will ""move dangerously close to the main Hawaiian Islands as a hurricane Thursday through Saturday."" SEE ALSO: Why Trump's EPA wants to kill the nation's most ambitious climate change plan Hawaii's residents should ""prepare for a significant impact"" from Hurricane Lane, Ige said. National hurricane scientists emphasize that even if the center of the storm — where winds are strongest — doesn't pass directly over the islands, the state could still face serious problems from the storm. A storm this sprawling and powerful can bring threatening downpours and winds ""well away from the center of the hurricane, and impacts could be felt on any of the islands,"" the National Hurricane Center said. It's rare for powerful storms to veer near these well-populated tropical islands, in large part because hurricanes feed on warmer waters, and the oceans around Hawaii are often relatively cool for tropical seas. Yet, the National Hurricane Center notes that ocean waters along the storm's predicted track are currently ""warm enough to support a major hurricane."" Hurricane Lane is only the sixth Category 5 hurricane ever recorded in the central Pacific, Federal Emergency Management Agency atmospheric scientist Michael Lowry tweeted. But, Lane is the closest Category 5 storm to Hawaii that scientists have ever observed, he added. Although any year can bring warmer waters to a marine region, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and university scientists published research last year arguing that the tropical Pacific will likely see more ""extremely active"" hurricane seasons as human-caused global warming boosts ocean temperatures. As the planet continues an accelerated rate of warming due to human-caused climate change, around 95 percent of accumulated heat gets absorbed by the oceans, increasing the background levels of ocean warming and making warmer-than-normal temperatures more likely. ""Global warming is really ocean warming,"" Josh Willis, an oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, recently said in an interview. A classic hurricane killer is wind shear — winds that hit hurricanes on their sides and can tilt them or blow off their top. But as of Tuesday night, government forecasters didn't expect increasing wind shear around Hawaii until Thursday evening, after some major effects are likely already felt in the state. As the storm skims the islands, or perhaps even makes landfall, severe and potentially historic flooding is expected. According to the National Hurricane Center, there will certainly be battering waves on the coast and potentially ""life-threatening flash flooding from heavy rainfall"" as water pours down the famously mountainous Hawaiian terrain.","Hurricane Lane, which is currently bearing down on Hawaii, is ""not a well behaved storm,"" according to the state's governor David Ige.

Reuters Editorial,"MANILA (Reuters) - The death toll from landslides and devastating floods in the central Philippines triggered by a tropical depression climbed to 85, officials said on Wednesday, and 20 people were missing as rescuers slowly reached cut-off communities. 
The casualties, including young children, were mostly killed when their homes collapsed in landslides after days of heavy rain in several provinces in the central Philippines, said Ricardo Jalad, executive director of the national disaster agency. 
“If we don’t recover the missing or we recover them dead, that is 105 deaths, which we hope not,” Jalad said. 
The tropical depression, which weakened into a low pressure system before leaving the Philippines on Sunday, brought heavy rain that triggered landslides and flooding in the Bicol and eastern Visayas regions. 
Officials put three provinces under a “state of calamity” to give them access to emergency funds. 
Bicol, with a population of 5.8 million, was the hardest hit, with 68 killed in intense rains and landslides. Damage to agriculture in Bicol, which produces rice and corn, was estimated at 342 million pesos ($6.5 million). 
Rescuers, including the police and military, used heavy-lifting equipment to clear roads leading to landslide sites and entered flooded communities using rubber boats. 
“The sun is already out, with occasional light rains. We hope floods will subside,” Ronna Monzon, a member of the operations personnel at the disaster agency in Bicol, told Reuters. 
About 20 tropical cyclones hit the Philippines every year, with destroyed crops and infrastructure taking a toll on human lives and weighing down one of the fastest growing economies in Asia.

SEE ALSO: 2018's hurricane season will be active, but probably not as bad as last year The storm, while projected to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to areas in Florida and some Gulf Coast states both this weekend and into early next week, will not become a hurricane, according to NOAA.

Yesterday, the National Hurricane Center released its 2018 hurricane forecast, and they expect 2018 to be an ""active season,"" with between 10 to 16 named storms, five to nine of which being hurricanes. ""This is a fair amount of activity we’re expecting."" Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said in an interview.

Hurricane forecasters analyze a combination of short and long-term climate trends, along with sophisticated computer models when making their predictions for a hurricane season. Since 1995, the Atlantic and Caribbean have seen ""very active"" seasons, said Bell, as a decades-long climate trend in the Atlantic Ocean has kept water temperatures warmer, contributing to a higher number of storms. In addition to this effect, NASA says that modern storm research shows hurricanes are getting stronger, lasting longer, and dumping significantly more rain. Rising sea levels, an indisputable result of human-induced climate change, exacerbates the effect of already damaging storms by producing higher surges of water. As for Alberto, the National Hurricane Service recommends that Gulf Coast residents watch for the agency's regular updates, found easily on either their homepage or Twitter account.","The National Hurricane Center has named the first storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, precisely one week before the season is expected to begin on June 1.

"Juan Ortega, Brett Clarkson","For a Monday in the usually quiet July, the tropics is an interesting place. Here’s what’s been happening out there. Tropical Storm Chris was over 200 miles off the coast of the Carolinas and not moving much on Monday, according to the latest update Monday from the U.S. National Hurricane Center. But Chris was expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Tuesday and head northeast toward Canada, prompting Canadian weather officials to also monitor the storm. “By late Tuesday it is forecast to attain hurricane status,” said a statement issued Monday by Environment Canada, that country’s official government weather service. “At this time it appears this storm could approach Nova Scotia by Thursday, likely weakening slightly as it does so.” Meanwhile the former Tropical Storm Beryl dissipated in the Caribbean Sea. The remnants of Beryl, which comprise an area of showers and thunderstorms, are forecast to pass over the Virgin Islands Monday and Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Monday night, bringing heavy rain to those areas. Beryl could make a comeback. According to the National Hurricane Center, the remains of Beryl have a 40 percent chance over the next five days of regenerating into a tropical cyclone as those remains are expected to turn northward over the Bahamas and western Atlantic Ocean. Beryl had been the first hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. It weakened from a tropical storm Sunday afternoon, no longer posing a threat to Florida or the continental United States. Beryl had been projected to follow a somewhat similar path as 2017’s Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, still was recovering from the devastation of Maria, which struck the island on Sept. 20 as Category 4 hurricane with maximum wind speeds of 155 mph. Maria also inflicted significant damage on Guadeloupe, Dominica, and the U.S. Virgin Islands — all places expected to be drenched with rain by what remained of Beryl. Through Tuesday, what’s left of Beryl was forecast to dump 2 to 3 inches of rain on the Leeward Islands, which separate the northeastern Caribbean Sea from the western Atlantic Ocean and include Guadeloupe and Dominica. The same amount, 2 to 3 inches, also was expected to fall on the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, with up to 5 inches possible in some areas. jcortega@sunsentinel.com, 561-243-6527 or Twitter @JuanSunSentinel","Sun Sentinel Tropical Storm Chris expected to become a hurricane; Former Beryl could make a comeback Sun Sentinel For a Monday in the usually quiet July, the tropics is an interesting place.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","For the third time in two weeks, a powerful nor’easter is bearing down on the the Boston area. For the third time this winter, we’re using the term bomb cyclone to describe the storm. But neither of those facts are what’s got meteorologists glued to their radar maps today. They’re watching the snow. There’s going to be a lot of it. “This one’s main impact is going to be snow,” NWS meteorologist Kim Buttrick told the Associated Press of the storm. A blizzard warning is in effect for coastal Massachusetts, where total snowfall accumulations of up to nearly two feet are expected. The snow is is falling fast, at rates of up to 1-3 inches per hour, which, combined with wind gusts veering well into tropical storm-force territory, sets the stage or whiteout conditions that could make travel “very dangerous,” the National Weather Service warns. In Boston proper, more modest snowfall totals of 17 to 18 inches are expected. That’s still no fun to dig your car out of, mind you. Boston is no stranger to snowy winters. ““We don’t see snowfall rates of 1-3 inches per hour every day in New England, but neither are they unheard of,” Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson told Earther via email. “Likewise, the expected accumulations are impressive but not necessarily record-smashing.” But combined with the fact that this is the third nor’easter the region has seen in the past few weeks, and combined with the fact that meteorologists are already talking about a potential fourth, March 2018 is almost certainly going down as one of the snowiest in Boston’s history. “We’re definitely seeing an anomalous event for this time of the year with respect to snowfall,” meteorologist Ed Vallee told Earther, noting that Boston’s number one snowstorm for March and April, on April Fool’s Day ‘97, saw about 22 inches of snow. Vallee told Earther that the city has already seen seven inches of snow this month and that he’d add “at least another foot” after today’s storm. “Especially late in the winter, it often takes a highly dynamic system to chill the atmosphere to snow-producing temperatures, and those strong dynamics can also lead to very heavy snowfall rates,” Henson said. So let’s talk about those dynamics a bit. Henson told Earther the volley of storms we’ve seen in recent weeks is likely connected to a record strong phase of the Madden-Julien Oscillation, which NOAA describes as “a major fluctuation in tropical circulation and rainfall that moves eastward along the equator and circles the entire globe in a span of 30–60 days on average.” This atmospheric disturbance is distinct from the El Nino Southern Oscillation, which is stationary in the tropical Pacific. As Henson explained, a strongly active MJO “fed into a split of the stratospheric polar vortex in February” that’s still having atmospheric reverberations, including the recent “ Beast from the East ” cold outbreak over Europe and record cold in Siberia. The MJO is also a strong contributor to Arctic air outbreaks across the central and eastern U.S., according to NOAA. In addition to the legacy of the MJO, another atmospheric pattern called the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) veered into record low territory earlier this month. A negative NAO is characterized by a ridge of high pressure air over Greenland, something meteorologists call the Greenland block. Vallee explained that the Greenland block leads to a trough of low pressure further south and west. “That’s a very conducive pattern for nor’easters to form,” he said, noting that the Greenland block not only enhances the pressure gradient fueling these storms, but can slow their progress out to sea. The nor’easter that drove massive coastal flooding in Boston at the beginning of the month was slow to get out of the city’s way thanks to the Greenland block, Weather Underground reported at the time. This time around, at least, the coastal flooding risk for Massachusetts is much fairly low. Weather Underground reports that the strongest winds from today’s nor’easter will be further offshore, with peak land gusts of about 60 miles per hour forecast to blow across Cape Cod and Nantucket. This storm, unlike its predecessors, also happens to coincide with some of the lowest astronomical tides of the month. So, while Massachusetts will wind up buried in snow today, at least folks’ basements won’t be flooding, too? Small miracles, I guess.","For the third time in two weeks, a powerful nor’easter is bearing down on the the Boston area.

,"Tropical storm Kirk is intensifying as it makes its way towards the eastern Caribbean with several countries being put on a tropical storm warning. The Miami-based National Hurricane Centre (NHC) said that the storm, which earlier this week had degenerated into a depression, was now packing winds of 50 miles per hour and was located 360 miles east south east of Barbados and 485 miles east south east of the French island of Martinique. Tropical storm warnings have been issued for Barbados, St. Lucia, Dominica, Martinique and Guadeloupe, with the NHC saying tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours. A tropical storm watch remains in effect for St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the NHC said that residents in other countries, particularly in the central and northern Lesser Antilles, should monitor the progress of Kirk as additional warnings or watches could have been issued later yesterday. According to the NHC, the centre of Tropical Storm Kirk was located near latitude 12.1 North, longitude 54.3 West and was moving toward the west near 18 mph. A westward to west-northwestward motion is expected over the next few days. On the forecast track, the centre will move over the Lesser Antilles within the tropical storm warning area Thursday night. Get caught up with news from the news leader Subscribe now and get access to the Trinidad Express E-paper SUBSCRIBE/ LOG IN NHC said that little change in strengthening is forecast until Kirk crosses the Lesser Antilles, followed by weakening over the eastern Caribbean Sea. It said that tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the warning area by this afternoon, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous. Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area by Thursday afternoon or evening, it said, adding that Kirk is expected to produce total rainfall of four to six inches across the northern Windward and southern Leeward Islands, with isolated maximum totals up to ten inches across Martinique and Dominica.

Alexis Shaw,"July 9 (Reuters) - Tropical storm Chris, slowly moving along the coast of the Carolinas, is expected to build into a full-blown hurricane on Monday, while the former Hurricane Beryl dwindled into a heavy rainstorm as it crossed the northeastern Caribbean, the National Hurricane Center said. Chris, which formed off the North Carolina coast early on Sunday, is only expected to get stronger, the NHC said. Early Monday, it was blasting winds of 60 miles per hour as it moved at about 2 mph northward some 200 miles southeast off the coast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. ""Swells generated by Chris are expected to increase and affect portions of the coasts of North Carolina and the mid-Atlantic states during the next few days,"" the NHC said. ""These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions."" The leftover bits of Beryl looked set to bring two to three inches of rain to Puerto Rico, along with wind gusts up to 40 mph. SEE ALSO: NHC: Hurricane Beryl weakens to tropical storm as it approaches eastern Caribbean Sea The chances of Beryl reforming into a tropical storm were put near zero. The weather service discontinued posting advisories about the storm late Sunday. Tropical Storm Chris was expected to remain well off the U.S. coast, and the latest projections show it possibly making landfall in Nova Scotia late Wednesday or early Thursday. But the National Weather Service maintained a hazardous weather outlook for Puerto Rico, the U.S. territory still recovering from the devastation wrought last year by Hurricane Maria, warning of thunderstorms and wind gusts.

"HNN Staff, Ben Gutierrez","HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - A tropical storm watch was issued for Hawaii Island on Monday as Hurricane Hector continued moving westward across the Central Pacific as a powerful Category 4 storm. A tropical storm watch means that tropical storm conditions are possible for the area within a 48 hour time period. The latest forecast advisory, issued at 2 p.m. Monday, said continued to pack maximum sustained winds of 155 miles per hour, with occasional higher gusts. The storm was moving west at 16 m.p.h. According to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, the center of the storm was located about 800 miles southeast of Hilo, or about 1,000 miles southeast of Honolulu. An updated forecast projects the center of the storm to move on a slightly more southerly course than previous tracks, and forecasters say it is expected to pass roughly 150 miles south of the Big Island sometime on Wednesday. However, the margin of error still takes the center very close to the southern Big Island, and while it's still too early to specify exact impacts on the islands, there's still a chance for tropical storm force winds and heavy rain for much of the island. For now, there could be enhanced heavier showers for east Hawaii island starting Wednesday morning. Big surf from Hector could also impact east and southeast-facing shores of the Big Island and East Maui. Waves could increase as soon as late Monday. ""While the official forecast track continues to lie south of the Hawaiian Islands, it is too soon to determine what kind of impacts might occur in the state, since track errors can be large at long time ranges,"" the National Hurricane Center said in a recent update. ""This remains a good time for everyone in the Hawaiian Islands to ensure they have their hurricane plan in place."" Forecasters note that hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles from the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles. Gradual weakening is forecast over the next few days. Remember that the forecast track and intensity can and will change.

"Carlie Kollath Wells, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune","A tropical storm is possible in the Atlantic Ocean in the next few days, hurricane forecasters said Monday morning (Nov. 12). Its still too early to tell if the system could pose a threat to New Orleans and the rest of the Gulf Coast. As of 7 a.m. Monday, forecasters were watching a vigorous tropical wave about 200 miles east of the Leeward Islands. It was producing a large area of disturbed weather over much of the western Atlantic. Storm activity with it had become more concentrated as of Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center said. Weather conditions are expected to become more conducive for the development of a tropical depression or tropical storm during the next day or so, the National Hurricane Center said. The disturbance has a 90 percent chance (high) of developing into a tropical depression within five days. It has a 50 percent chance of developing into a tropical depression within 48 hours. The categories, in increasing strength, are depression, storm and hurricane. The disturbance is expected to move west for the next few days, passing near or north of the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and the southeastern Bahamas, the National Hurricane Center said.

Leigh Morgan,"Now there's Tropical Storm Chris. The National Hurricane Center said the third named storm of 2018 in the Atlantic had formed on Sunday morning about 150 miles off the coast of North Carolina. It's expected to become a hurricane, but the current forecast path turns the storm away from the coast of the United States. As of 4 a.m. CDT Sunday, Tropical Storm Chris was located about 150 miles south of Cape Hatteras, N.C. Chris had winds of 40 mph and was not moving, according to the hurricane center. Forecasters there said those along the North Carolina coast should keep an eye on Chris. The hurricane center noted early Sunday that many forecast models have shifted the path for Chris south and westward. The official track has also been adjusted some, but forecasters said they will wait to see more consistency in the models before making any bigger adjustments. The potential track area still does not include any part of the U.S. coast. The long-range path does move the storm over Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Chris is expected to meander off the coast for the next couple of days, then head northeast starting on Tuesday. It could be a hurricane by then, according to the hurricane center. While Chris isn't expected to make landfall in the U.S., rough seas churned up by the storm could cause deadly rip currents along the North Carolina and Mid-Atlantic coasts this week. Areas in North Carolina and Pamlico and Albemarle sounds could also have to deal with gale-force winds over the next day because of the pressure gradient between Chris and an approaching trough of low pressure. Chris isn't the only storm in the Atlantic. A weak and disorganized Tropical Storm Beryl continued to track westward toward the Lesser Antilles on Sunday with 45 mph winds.

Jenny Gathright,"Alberto, which is moving north through the Gulf of Mexico at a rate of 15 miles per hour, is still categorized as a Subtropical Storm. But the National Hurricane Center said Sunday morning that ""it is gaining some more tropical characteristics."" According to an update from the National Hurricane Center, the center of the storm is predicted to reach the northern U.S. gulf coast as early as Sunday night, and once it makes landfall, it is expected to weaken to a tropical depression. The storm currently has maximum sustained winds of nearly 45 miles per hour. In its advisory issued at 8:00 a.m. ET Saturday, the National Hurricane Center maintained a storm surge watch along the U.S. gulf coast from Crystal River in western Florida to the Mississippi-Alabama border. The water could reach heights of 2 to 4 feet, with the deepest water expected along the immediate coast. A tropical storm warning is in effect for the Dry Tortugas off of Florida's gulf coast, which has already started to experience tropical storm conditions. The Tropical Storm warning extends to the area from Florida's Bonita Beach to the Mississippi-Alabama border. A tropical storm watch is in effect along the Mississippi-Alabama border to the mouth of the Pearl River in the Gulf of Mexico. The National Hurricane Center also warns of possibly life-threatening flash floods and mudslides in Cuba, where Alberto could bring an accumulation of 5 to 10 inches of rain and isolated storm totals of up to 20 inches of rain. On Saturday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for all 67 counties of Florida. In an update on preparedness efforts issued Saturday, Scott said the Florida National Guard has 5,500 guard members on call to help with storm-related emergencies. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey has also issued a state of emergency, effective 6:00 a.m. local time Sunday, for several counties in Alabama: Autauga, Baldwin, Barbour, Bibb, Bullock, Butler, Chambers, Chilton, Choctaw, Clarke, Coffee, Conecuh, Coosa, Covington, Crenshaw, Dale, Dallas, Elmore, Escambia, Geneva, Greene, Hale, Henry, Houston, Lee, Lowndes, Macon, Marengo, Mobile, Monroe, Montgomery, Perry, Pickens, Pike, Russell, Sumter, Tallapoosa, Tuscaloosa, Washington and Wilcox. Water, not wind, tends to be the deadliest factor in storms like Alberto, according to a 2014 study by Dr. Ed Rappaport of the National Weather Service. Rappaport found that during the 50-year period of 1963 to 2012, about half of all U.S. deaths from tropical cyclones were caused by storm surge. In addition, about 90 percent of the deaths happened in water-related incidents, most often drowning. The Atlantic hurricane season officially starts June 1 and ends Nov. 30. The NOAA's Climate Prediction Center's annual forecast says up to four hurricanes could form in the Atlantic this hurricane season, and that overall the intensity of this hurricane season will probably be near or above normal. According to NPR's Camila Domonoske, even an average hurricane season can be tremendously harmful, especially for places like the Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico, which were hit hard by the hurricanes Harvey and Maria last year. ""The seasonal outlook can't predict landfall areas, but the forecasters warn that even an average season involves 'quite a few hurricanes.' "" 'We know certain areas have been compromised from last year's storm, and that makes hurricane preparedness... even more important this year,' says Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane season forecaster at the Climate Prediction Center."" Another update on Alberto from the National Hurricane Center is expected at 11 a.m. ET Saturday.","The storm, which is predicted to reach the northern U.S. gulf coast Sunday night or Monday, is currently moving through the Gulf of Mexico at a rate of 15 miles per hour.",2018-05-27T14:19:57Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Subtropical Storm Alberto 'Is Gaining Some Tropical Characteristics',https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/27/614822344/subtropical-storm-alberto-is-gaining-some-tropical-characteristics,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/05/27/subtropical-storm-alberto_wide-2f51ec901f78d05ff73c4502fde6b4180738d84b.png?s=1400,,Npr.org,tropical,0

Tim Cebula / Cooking Light,"The cold got you down? Slip into a spring break state of mind with tropical flair at home, from a tuna poke recipe to luau-ready drinkware. 1. Indulge in exotic dragon fruit. This unique, dazzling tropical cactus fruit—also known as pitaya—has juicy, seeded flesh that’s sweet and mild, like a cross between kiwi and pear, with a touch of earthiness. Here’s what you need to know: + HOW TO BUY Find dragon fruit with exotic fruit at supermarkets or at Asian or Latin markets. Choose unbruised fruit with smooth red skin and green tips on the scales. + HOW TO STORE Keep at room temperature. The red skin deepens in color as it ripens. Ripe dragon fruit yields slightly to pressure. + HOW TO EAT Slice in half to reveal white or pink flesh inside, which is studded with edible black seeds. Pare away skin or scoop the flesh out with a spoon. You can cut it up and put it into salads, use as a yogurt topping, or mix into a smoothie with strawberries, pineapple, and bananas. 2. Try Some Hawaiian tuna poke. The tuna and avocado make this dish a potassium powerhouse. You can find fresh or frozen wakame seaweed on Amazon or at most Asian markets. You can also use fresh or frozen premixed seaweed salad. Serve the poke atop brown rice, if you like. 3. Go bananas with these retro-chic island-style table linens. Amp up the island vibe of your party spread with this old-school tablecloth (from $32). It’s made of resilient and stain-resistant oilcloth, which makes for easy cleaning with just a sponge. And the bold fruit-and-floral patterns can warm up a room all winter long. Available in square and rectangle sizes. 4. Whip up fruity cocktails by the pitcherful with Breville’s newest juicer. Tropical drinks need fresh fruit juice, and lots of it. Breville’s latest and greatest juicer, the Juice Fountain Cold XL ($350), delivers up to 70 ounces of fresh juice five times faster than cold-press machines. This model raises juice temperature less than 2°F, so heat won’t kill the nutrients or mute the flavor. Its high-powered yet surprisingly quiet motor churns out vibrant juice for huge batches of festive beverages. And fruit is just the beginning: Squeeze the goodness out of all sorts of fresh produce, from rhubarb stalks to leafy greens. 5. Sip in style with tropical beverage gear. Red plastic cups were fine for college parties, but now that you’re adulting, it’s time to bring a little panache to that piña colada. Patio Party Coasters Rosanna’s porcelain drink rests ($48/set of 4) set the mood for a backyard tiki party or living room limbo. They’re labeled with tropical drink names in fonts with retro-chic flair. Royal Hawaiian Pineapple Tumbler This sculpted metal cup ($37 for two) looks cool, and copper keeps drinks ice-cold. Bonus: The top becomes a drink stand either way you turn it. Cocktail Parasol Drink Umbrellas No tropical tipple is complete without that most garish garnish, the drink umbrella (calling it a parasol does not make it tasteful). The box of 188 ($6) should last a few luaus.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The East Coast is bracing for another nor’easter this week, with the National Weather Service in Boston warning that the city and nearby coastlines could see three to four feet of storm surge flooding. This, in the same winter that the bomb cyclone turned many of Boston’s streets into frozen soup. Parts of the Northeast are getting hammered by frigid temperatures right now, just 24 hours after a … Read more Read Is it the latest sign of the end times? Not really. Winter storms like nor’easters, it turns out, routinely deliver worse flooding than hurricanes to this part of the world, a reality confirmed by a study published earlier this year, the Washington Post ’s Capital Weather Gang noted today. Why’s that, you might ask? The reason has everything to do with the difference in how nor’easters and hurricanes form—a difference that allows nor’easters to maintain hurricane-like central pressures and rip-roaring winds at latitudes where their tropical cousins typically fizzle out. “By the time a hurricane gets off New England, it’s over very cold water and starts to decay,” Jeff Masters, meteorologist and blogger with Weather Underground, told Earther. Hurricanes get their strength from oceanic heat, forming in warm equatorial regions where there’s plenty of evaporating water to condense into storm clouds. Nor’easters get their energy from an entirely different source: as Masters put it, the contrast in density between warm, moist air from the ocean and cold, dry air from the land. When these contrasting air masses collide, the cold dry air sinks, and releases energy. The technical term for the atmospheric set-up that drives the formation of a nor’easter is ‘ baroclinic instability.’ Unlike hurricanes, which form and thrive in tropical waters and feature a warm core, nor’easters form at mid-latitudes, and their cores are cold. Because they don’t rely on ocean heat for their energy, they can maintain hurricane-like central pressures and wind strengths at latitudes where hurricanes struggle to. This can lead to some very bad flooding. “Occasionally you get a strong hurricane up there [in the northeast], but they’re pretty uncommon,” Masters said. “It’s the big ‘nor’easters that dominate the record storm surge,” for the region. Models are calling for this week’s nor’easter to deliver damaging winds, heavy rain, and snowfall to the Eastern seaboard beginning on Thursday night, although the storm’s exact track remains uncertain, the Weather Channel reports. A coastal flood watch is in effect from Friday morning through Saturday afternoon for eastern Massachusetts, with the NWS warning that “moderate to major” coastal flooding that could inundate roads and basements and tear up beaches. Coastal flood watches are also in effect for much of Delaware and New Jersey, and parts of Queens and Long Island. Exacerbating the flood risk is the fact that this storm is due to coincide with the astronomical high tide—the full moon rises tomorrow. When the Sun, Moon and Earth are perfectly aligned, the gravitational tug-of-war causes the most extreme tides of the month. The coastal flood risk is expected to persist over three high tide cycles, thanks to the long-lived nature of this storm. “All three tides are expected to be in the top ten on record [for Boston], maybe in the top five,” Masters said said. Lastly, just in case you thought we were going to get through an entire weather post without mentioning climate change, you should know that for nor’easters as for hurricanes, sea level rise is adding inches to storm surge and making the coastal flooding threat worse. A recent study in Nature found that sea levels along the northern half of the Eastern seaboard have risen about an inch per decade since 1980, three to four times the global average rate. “That makes it a lot easier to get a record-high water level causing substantial damage,” Masters said.

"Jay Croft, CNN","How are you preparing for Hurricane Florence? Text, iMessage or WhatsApp your videos, photos and stories to CNN: 347-322-0415 (CNN) Forecasts generally have Wilmington, North Carolina, as the city most likely to bear the brunt of powerful Hurricane Florence as it makes landfall. But no matter where the monster storm ultimately crosses the southern East Coast of the US, Florence's high winds and heavy rains will hit communities for miles north, south -- and even west. Damaging effects from the storm are expected to be felt far inland, particularly as it's projected to stall once it crosses the coastline. A big worry with Florence is that the system could linger for days, similar to the manner in whch Harvey hovered over Texas last year. That means high rainfall totals and consequent inland flooding could become a huge concern. The current forecast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration calls for more than 20 inches of rain where the storm makes landfall. But more than 10 inches is forecast for a larger area, including most of eastern North Carolina inland to just north of Richmond, Virginia. A new National Hurricane Center map predicting the likelihood of tropical storm-force winds stretches from northern Florida to eastern Kentucky and Ohio, and even up to the New York City area -- although there's only a 5% to 10% chance of those conditions stretching that far north. Tropical storm force winds have sustained speeds of at least 39 mph. CNN's Judson Jones contributed to this report.","Forecasts generally have Wilmington, North Carolina, as the city most likely to bear the brunt of powerful Hurricane Florence as it makes landfall.

Shannon Liao,"Walmart is hiring robots to replace human tasks that humans didn’t “enjoy doing.” In a bid to save on labor costs, it’s betting on robots to clean floors, sort inventory, and replenish out-of-stock items in its stores, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. Walmart has several jobs in mind for the new robots. Robot floor cleaners are coming to 1,500 stores. (The company says that floor scrubbing was previously a task that could take a human worker two to three hours each day to complete.) Walmart is also adding 600 conveyor belts that can sort inventory automatically, and at least 300 bots that can check if shelves are running out of stock after Walmart initially began to test this technology in 2017. All of this is coming at the cost of human labor. The more robots Walmart hires, the fewer people it needs for each task, and the more money it saves across its 4,600 stores in the US. Walmart says that although it’s cutting down on labor for tasks like flooring cleaning, it is hiring employees to focus on growing its online grocery business. The move also comes after retail companies like Target and Walmart announced slight wage increases for store workers. Walmart appears to be trying to make its online grocery service competitive to AmazonFresh and Amazon Prime Now’s Whole Foods delivery, both of which are still expanding. It’s part of a long feud between the two retail giants. While the brick-and-mortar Walmart has been pushed to acquire Jet.com and establish more of an online presence, Amazon has added physical stores to its e-commerce offerings and began to follow the playbooks of more traditional brands. Just last week, Amazon announced a new round of price cuts at Whole Foods stores around greens and tropical fruits. The company also reportedly has plans to expand grocery stores in major US cities later this year.","Walmart is hiring robots to replace human tasks that humans didn’t “enjoy doing.” In a bid to save on labor costs, it’s betting on robots to clean floors, sort inventory, and replenish out-of-stock items in its stores, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.",2019-04-09T19:13:19Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Walmart is hiring more robots to replace human tasks like cleaning floors and scanning inventory,https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18302356/walmart-robots-labor-costs-replacing-human-tasks-floors-scanning-inventory,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3utT8F4TMkkdJCHnd6ZJ9TEX2KI=/0x204:3500x2036/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16020387/964537032.jpg.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,tropical,0
Herb Scribner,"SALT LAKE CITY Flash floods are possible this week for much of the Southwestern United States, including Utah. Tropical Storm Rosa will likely cause flash floods and storm warnings along the California coast and across the Southwestern United States after it pummels northwest Mexico, according to the Associated Press. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Rosa should hit the Baja California Peninsula and Sonora state on Monday with flooding rains. Utah will be impacted, too. Whats happening: The National Weather Service already announced flash flood watches through Wednesday for southern Nevada, southeastern California, southwestern and central Utah and the western two-thirds of Arizona. Heavy rain, thunderstorms and flooding are all expected in the Beehive State from Monday through Wednesday morning. Southern and central Utah will likely see flooding in slot canyons and normally dry washes. Main stem rivers will likely see rises, according to NWS. There could be debris flows from burn scars and roadways could see flooding as well, according to the NWS.

Prepare yourself for the potential of flooding Monday through Wednesday! pic.twitter.com/OuhfSlCWLK WeatherNation (@WeatherNation) September 29, 2018 Arches National Park said in a tweet it has already seen rain, adding that park roads may become impassable. When does it start?: NWS Salt Lake City said thunderstorms would develop in northern Utah Monday afternoon. ""We are monitoring these thunderstorms as they are developing near several recent burn scars. There are no imminent threats for debris flows,"" NWS tweeted. Bigger picture: The NWS said this week that the Beehive State set records for the lack of rain. But this week, theres expected to be a bunch of rain. See the comparison below: History: Utah experienced a tropical system back in 1997, according to KSL-TV meteorologist Grant Weyman. Tropical Storm Nora brought rain and strong winds to Utah, following a similar path as Tropical Storm Rosa. Stay safe: The NWS suggested those in at-risk areas prepare for debris flow and to ""get your action plan together now."" Comment on this story ""Flash flood watch means: prepare. A flash flood warning means get to a safe location ASAP if in an area impacted at threat of debris flows,"" according to the NWS. The Bureau of EMS and Preparedness offered some tips for cleaning up floods, including wearing rubber boot and gloves, as well as goggles to avoid contact with floodwaters, which can be full of bacteria and other damaging material. Depending on what happens after the floods, residents will want to monitor potential mold growth. Itll also be important to clean up damp toys and products affected by the floods. Prepare everyone.

Patricia Kitchen,"Long Islanders can expect heavy rain and potential flash flooding Thursday as a cold front from the west interacts with tropical moisture from the south, forecasters said. Associated with Tropical Storm Michael, the moisture, surging northward from eastern North Carolina and Virginia, will move up into the area this afternoon and tonight, the National Weather Service said in a flash flood watch. The watch is in effect for the entire metropolitan region. On Long Island, the watch lasts from noon through late Thursday. The storm itself will stay to the south, moving off the coast and into the mid-Atlantic later in the day, according to the National Hurricane Center track. Look for showers and a few thunderstorms starting late morning to early afternoon, said Joe Pollina, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Upton. Long Island is looking at 1.5 to 2 inches of rain Thursday, with 2 to 4 possible in some spots, the watch said. Any heavy precipitation falling within a one- to three-hour time frame could result in flash flooding. With the Island already having had an abundance of recent precipitation, the ground is still rather moist and with up to 2 inches of rain or even a bit more possible, there will be some local flooding to contend with, said News 12 Long Island meteorologist Bill Korbel. Isolated minor coastal flooding is expected with the morning to early afternoon high tide cycle, particularly for the most vulnerable spots along the South Shore bays of Nassau County.

It is only the second time in history that two cyclones are predicted to strike the country at the same time. 
Having already lashed the far north of Queensland, Tropical Cyclone Trevor is expected to hit the communities of Numbulwa and Borroloola in the Northern Territory on Saturday morning. 
The storm could bring a year's worth of rain in just a couple of days.

In the biggest ever evacuation ahead of a cyclone, people living in its the path have moved into tented sites in Darwin and Katherine. 
Emergency services and the military were called in to rescue residents from the island of Groote Eylandt, off the north coast on Thursday. 
The last evacuation of a similar scale was for Tropical Cyclone Tracy, which killed 49 people in Darwin in 1974. 
Cyclone Veronica is due to hit the northwest coast of Australia between Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning. 
Very strong gusts are expected and the Bureau of Meteorology in Western Australia said a ""severe impact"" is likely.

Jannette Pippin,"Updated at 8:47 p.m. With tropical storm Michael nearing the border of North Carolina and Virginia Thursday night, National Weather Service officials said conditions are expected to improve by Friday morning. “There could be some wider showers, but I think we’re entering the dry portion,” John Elardo, a meteorologist with NWS Newport said. Flood warnings for ENC were cancelled about 5 p.m. as rain traveled more westward, Elardo said. He said any chance of rivers flooding is low as of Thursday evening, since the area received less rain than expected. While windy conditions already caused some scattered power outages throughout the state, Elardo said winds would decrease Friday morning as well. “It might be a little gusty, but it will be nothing like what we have now,” Elardo said. And with the gusts, lower temperatures may be coming, he said. Lows in Jacksonville will be in the mid-70s and temperatures are expected to stay in that range through the weekend. Inland, Elardo said lows Saturday night may dip to 40 degrees. “The weather will be more fall-like (this weekend),” Elardo said. At 7 p.m., Carteret-Craven Electric Co-op had about 6,500 outages as Tropical Storm Michael pushed through the area. “As expected, the storm has toppled weakened trees and dangling limbs left in the wake of Hurricane Florence in mid-September,” said CCEC Communications Director Lisa Galizia. “We have crews working across our service area to restore power. They will work unless it becomes unsafe for them to do so.” The cooperative has substation and meter monitoring systems that indicates when and where outages occur. Before calling to report an outage, CCEC encourages members to check its outage map at http://outage.carteretcraven.coop before calling. While extra personnel are on hand to answer phones are extremely high. “We also encourage people to stay inside until the storm passes,” Galizia said. “Better yet, wait until daybreak to avoid any downed power lines.” Duke Energy reports 1,926 customers without power in Carteret County and 813 in Duplin County. They also report 1,150 without power in Jones County and 4,539 in Onslow. Jones Onslow EMC reports 2,574 without power in Onslow, 13 in Pender and 34 in Jones County. _________ Update 4:57 p.m. It took about two days for the water to recede to normal levels after Florence, Shoreline Drive resident Jamie Boyd said as he waded through water a foot deep in some places to get to his house from his neighbor’s. Florence left mud in his yard and mold in his basement. He still has a humidifier running in his three-story house that he dumps about five times daily. He had not returned his boat to its regular docking location when Hurricane Michael appeared in the forecasts. “It’s at my office downtown,” Boyd said of his boat. “It’s been there since before the first storm.” With Florence only recently passed, residents of Onslow County are still in the process of recovery. Although downgraded to a tropical storm, Michael may still add insult to injury as it passes over the state. By noon on Thursday, the water had already covered Boyd’s backyard. “All this is grass — beautiful grass — normally,” Boyd said about the half foot of water he was standing in. On the other side of Shoreline Drive, the homes have all been tagged by yellow warning signs from the city. “It’s not condemned,” Seth Hall, a resident of one such house, said. “We made enough complaints that they’re not saying it’s condemned anymore. They’re letting us rebuild. I just got power back two days ago.” Hall is only allowed to run two outlets in his house, however, and these are located in the striped remnants of what used to be his first floor bedroom. Hall learned from his father how to repair homes, and said he was thus able to do most of his repairs himself. For what he couldn’t do, he would have to rely on government assistance. “FEMA gave us $4,000,” Hall said. “We got quoted that this is going to cost $22,000.” The roof caved in over his bathtub, Hall explained. If it had caved in as little as one foot over, his house would have been flooded and his insurance would have paid for the damages. Over on North Topsail Beach, Cody Atchison and his team were repairing a home on River Inlet Road. An employee of Kustom Disaster Recovery and Recreation, Atchinson and his team had spent the day in the windy makeshift sandstorm the town was being plagued by ahead of Michael’s onset. “We’re getting covered in sand (but) so far we’re good,” Atchinson said. “We’re hoping that it won’t hit us so bad.” Atchinson said he wasn’t too concerned with damages from what the tropical storm to the houses his team was repairing. After all, they had survived Florence. “The only thing we would worry about is windows and doors — the main issue from the first storm,” Atchinson said. Things on Shoreline Drive were more questionable. Hall said that his neighbor, whose firewall was damaged by flooding in the hurricane, was quoted $9,000 to replace said drywall. Hall’s own two firewalls survived, but the sheetrock and insulation that were protecting the firewall were destroyed. “Now it’s just bare firewall,” Hall said. “So if it floods in it’ll breach the firewall and it will be $18,000.” Boyd said he didn’t think Michael would cause too much more damage. “We’re at low tide here at about 6 p.m., so hopefully by midnight when the tide gets high again (Michael will have passed),” Boyd said. “If it was high tide right now it would be way in our garages, absolutely.” ________________ Updated at 3:46 p.m. Onslow County is currently seeing the worst of the wind gusts it should see from Tropical Storm Michael. “We’re seeing peak winds now,” said meteorologist Tom Lonka with the National Weather Service in Newport. “Jacksonville had gusts of 58 mph about an hour ago and wind speeds should start decreasing this evening.” The direction of the winds should also change. Lonka said the direction of the wind is pushing the water level up along the New River, which has likely contributed to some flooding reported along Shoreline Drive in Jacksonville. “The wind will come around southwest later, which should alleviate some of the surge,” Lonka said. Rainfall amounts have not been as high as forecasted and the Onslow County area has seen about an inch of rain. According to the latest NWS briefing, poor drainage issues are possible due to saturated soils and leftover debris from Florence but rainfall amounts are not expected to cause widespread issues. Based on the current track and rainfall projections, river flooding is not expected at the Neuse River at Kinston and Tar River at Greenville, but water may become elevated next week as the water drains from upstream. ________________ Updated at 2:36 p.m. North Topsail Beach officials are reporting washout from Tropical Storm Michael. Town officials posted on their Facebook page that they expect more road hazards as Thursday progresses and, as a result, they were sending town staff home for their safety. ""If you are traveling today, please use precaution. If travel is not necessary, consider rescheduling your plans for a later date."" Updated 2:10 p.m. Power outages have been reported around Onslow County as winds from Tropical Storm Michael, which had weakened to a tropical storm Thursday, have knocked down trees and limbs into power lines. As of 1:45 p.m., the Jones Onslow Electric Membership Corporation outage map showed 561 Onslow County customers without power and 111 in Pender County. JOEMC spokesman Steve Goodson said Thursday that JOEMC has crews out working and they will continue to respond to calls as long as it is safe to do so. ""All of the outages have been wind-related, with the wind blowing limbs loose and into power lines,"" Goodson said. While they aren’t expecting outages to the extent of Hurricane Florence, Goodson said the ground is already saturated and more wind and rain can bring down more trees and damage power lines. The Duke Energy outage map showed 174 customers without power, most in the Richlands area. ----------- Eastern North Carolina is likely to see the effects of Hurricane Michael, which has been downgraded to a tropical storm, by late this afternoon. According to Hal Austin, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Newport, Michael is moving through South Carolina as of Thursday morning. Michael will proceed through the central part of the state, hitting areas like Fayetteville and Raleigh the hardest, before exiting off the mid-Atlantic coast. “It’s going to move to our west and northwest during the day today,” Austin said. This afternoon Eastern North Carolina is likely to see sustained winds of 25 mph and could gust up to 40 mph, according to Austin. The storm is currently moving at 21 mph. The rain Onslow County experienced yesterday, Austin said, was the outer fringes of the larger circulation, but not the storm itself. The Kinston and Jacksonville areas will likely see an inch of rain from Michael as it passes through. Friday, according to Austin, is going to be a dry day, mostly sunny with highs in upper 70s and winds northwest around 10 mph. “It’s going to be moving through quickly,” Austin said of Michael. “We’ll see winds start to diminish after midnight tonight as the storm moves away.”","Jacksonville Daily News UPDATE: Power outages reported as TS Michael passes through NC Jacksonville Daily News Updated 2:10 p.m..

Vy Tran,"Located on the Riviera Nayarit, the W Punta De Mita is a tropical getaway to Mexico’s Pacific Coast that celebrates the region’s historic culture. This colorful hotel was a joint collaboration with Oakland-based design studio Mister Important Design, ASET/AOMA, and Starwood’s own award-winning design team. The design of the W Punta De Mita was inspired by the area’s surf culture and native history. Throughout the hotel, you’ll find traditional patterns of the Huichol people (the indigenous people of Nayarit), Mexican tiled floors, woven furniture, decorative motifs found on everything from the screens to the tuktuk carts, and figurines on the walls and tables. Instead of a traditional hotel lobby, the hotel embraces an open concept living room that leads to a central bar and is surrounded by indoor lounge spaces where guests can enjoy signature cocktails and the resident DJ. The blue and green Camino Huichol guides guests from the living room to the outdoor pool, bar, lounge area and, of course, that beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean. The hotel consists of 119 guest villas and suites that have been decorated with a Mexican touch. Indicative of the active lifestyle of the area, the headboards are made from surfboards, or punctured tin by local artists. Wall decals, throw pillows and accent furniture add a playful touch. The hotel offers five different dining spaces: Mesa 1, an exclusive private dining on an island in the middle of the lake; the Spice Market Beach, the onsite restaurant catering Pan-Asian cuisine with a tropical twist by Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten; the Chevricheria, the beach-front 1950s Chevrolet truck serving signature ceviche and craft beers; the Venazu, a casual restaurant serving traditional Mexican food; and the WET Deck which serves cocktails and bites by the pool. The living room bar is adorned by a chandelier made with nearly 500 hanging LED lights and hand-crafted bead strands.

MATT STEVENS,"Forecasters said they expect the Florida Panhandle as well as parts of eastern and central Alabama and western Georgia to get between four and eight inches of rain through Tuesday, with some isolated areas getting as much as a foot; they warned that flash flooding was possible in Florida, much of Alabama, and western Georgia. Storm surge in Florida could cause water to rise as high as three feet from the Aucilla River to Mexico Beach, they said. Isolated tornadoes were also possible over parts of Georgia and southeast Alabama. After the exceptionally destructive season last year, forecasters said last week that the possibility of a weak El Niño, along with near-average sea surface temperatures, suggest that this year’s hurricane season will be normal or only slightly more active than average. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s forecasters predicted a 70 percent likelihood of 10 to 16 named storms this year with winds of 39 miles per hour or higher. Hurricane season runs from June 1 until Nov. 1 and peaks from mid-August through late October. Last year, there were 17 named storms, 10 of which became hurricanes ; the first named storm was Arlene — a rare preseason tropical storm that arrived in April. “We’re not expecting the season to be one of the most active on record,” said Gerry Bell, lead hurricane season forecaster with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. But, he added, “It’s time to start getting prepared.”","The storm struck Laguna Beach, Fla., just before 5 p.m. with wind speeds of about 45 m.p.h.

INYOUNG KANG,"The Oxford English Dictionary, a.k.a. the OED, is one of the best-known references on the English language. Yet a devious clue — “It ends with ‘zyzzyva,’ in brief” — stumped many of our solvers in the May 3 puzzle. It has appeared in The Times Crossword a total of 139 times. The OED was the 1857 brainchild of the Philological Society of London, which decided that existing English language dictionaries were incomplete and deficient. It was a slow and laborious process, as their attempt was to “include all English language vocabulary from the Early Middle English period (1150 AD) onward, plus some earlier words if they had continued to be used into Middle English.” The first part, or “fascicle,” was published in 1884. The “complete” dictionary — entries are always being added — was published in 1928, and the OED, which is published by the Oxford University Press, just celebrated its 90th birthday. By the way: A zyzzyva is “A genus of tropical weevils (family Curculionidae) native to South America and typically found on or near palm trees.” Deb Amlen wrote today’s Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Tropical storm Florence lumbered inland on Saturday, knocking down trees, flooding rivers, and dumping sheets of rain in the Carolinas where five people have died. It diminished from hurricane force as it came ashore, but forecasters said the 350-mile-wide storm’s slow progress across North and South Carolina could leave much of the region under water in the coming days. “This storm is relentless and excruciating,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told CNN late on Friday. “There is probably not a county or a person that will not be affected in some way by this very massive and violent storm.” A mother and baby were killed when a tree fell on their home in Wilmington, North Carolina. The child’s injured father was taken to hospital. In Pender County, a woman died of a heart attack; paramedics trying to reach her were blocked by debris. Two people died in Lenoir County. A 78-year-old man was electrocuted attempting to connect extension cords while another man died when he was blown down by high winds while checking on his hunting dogs, a county spokesman said. In New Bern, North Carolina, the storm surge overwhelmed the town of 30,000 which is located at the confluence of the Neuse and Trent rivers. Officials in New Bern, which dates to the early 18th century, said more than 100 people were rescued from floods and the downtown was under water by Friday afternoon. Resident Jay Manning said he and his wife watched with alarm as water filled the street. “We moved all the furniture up in case the water comes in but the water seems to be staying at the edge of the driveway,” he said, adding that if the wind picks up and the rain keeps coming, that could change. “My wife’s in a panic right now.” Dan Eudy said he and his brother were awakened on Thursday night by the sound of a boat ramming against his front porch. Eudy said his family stayed in their home partly to protect their house. “And we had no belief it would be as significant an event as it was,” he said. “This is a 500- or 1,000-year event.” HEAVY RAIN Florence was a Category 3 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale with 120-mph winds on Thursday. It was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane before coming ashore near Wrightsville Beach close to Wilmington, North Carolina. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) downgraded it to a tropical storm on Friday, but warned it would dump as much as 30 to 40 inches (76-102 cm) of rain on the southeastern coast of North Carolina and part of northeastern South Carolina. About 10 million people could be affected by the storm. More than 22,600 people were housed in 150 shelters statewide, including schools, churches and Wake Forest University’s basketball arena. “This rainfall will produce catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged, significant river flooding,” the hurricane center said. Atlantic Beach on North Carolina’s Outer Banks islands had already received 30 inches of rain, the U.S. Geological Survey said. North Carolina utilities estimated that as many as 2.5 million state residents could be left without power, the state’s Department of Public Safety said. (Graphic: Hurricane Florence to pummel U.S. Southeast for days - tmsnrt.rs/2oZFKSb ) The White House said on Friday that President Donald Trump had spoken with state and local officials, assuring them the federal government was prepared to help. Trump plans a visit to the region next week. Florence was moving west-southwest at about 5 mph (7 km/h), with its center located over eastern South Carolina. The storm is expected to turn west and then north moving through the Carolinas and the Ohio Valley by Monday, the NHC said early on Saturday. Significant weakening was expected over the weekend. Florence was one of two major storms threatening millions of people on opposite sides of the world. Super Typhoon Mangkhut was expected to hit an area in the Philippines on Saturday that would affect more than 5 million people.

Reuters Editorial,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - All coastal weather warnings and watch advisories for the Hawaiian Islands were lifted on Saturday as Tropical Storm Lane weakened further and drifted to the west, away from land, the National Weather Service (NWS) said.

Alexander Kay,"Tropical Storm Gordon on Tuesday barreled toward central U.S. Gulf Coast, where it was expected to become a hurricane and bring high winds and heavy rain to the region, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. The storm was gaining strength and was expected to become a hurricane as it comes ashore late on Tuesday near the border between Louisiana and Mississippi, and drop as much as 8 inches (20 cm) of rain in some areas of the U.S. South still reeling from hurricanes a year ago. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency, saying 200 Louisiana National Guardsmen were being deployed, along with 63 high-water trucks, 39 boats, and 4 helicopters. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency warned of storm surges of between 3 and 5 feet (1 and 1.5 meters) and told South Mississippi residents to be prepared to evacuate. Gordon was generating winds of 65 miles per hour (105 km per hour) on Tuesday as it steamed west-northwest at 17 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. Gordon was located about 280 miles (450 km) east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River and was packing maximum sustained winds of 65 miles per hour (100kmh), the Miami-based weather forecaster said. By Monday afternoon the storm had passed over Florida's southern tip. There were no reports of any injuries or deaths or any damages to buildings, said Alberto Moscoso, a spokesman for the Florida Division of Emergency Management. Hurricane Hugo, 1989: 21 deaths Hurricane Hugo made landfall as a Category 4 storm in South Carolina. It caused 21 deaths in the US and resulted in $7.1 billion of damage. At the time, it was the costliest storm in US history.

The storm started over the Gulf of Mexico near Texas, then traveled east, causing floods like the one pictured here in Houston, Texas. Photo courtesy: NOAA Hurricane Irene, 2011: 56 deaths Hurricane Irene, the first storm to hit the US since Ike three years earlier, made landfall in North Carolina as a Category 1 storm. The storm eventually made its way up to New York City, bringing flooding -- like the kind pictured here in Puerto Rico -- and causing $7.3 billion in damage overall.

Last year, powerful hurricanes walloped Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, causing thousands of deaths, hundreds of billions of dollars worth of damage, massive power outages and devastation to hundreds of thousands of structures. At the mouth of the Mississippi River, around the area of New Orleans, the storm could generate a surge of up to 4 feet(1.2 meters) and smaller surges could hit coastland along other parts of the Gulf Coast, the Miami-based hurricane center said. U.S. oil producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp on Monday evacuated workers and shut production at two offshore oil platforms, and other companies with production and refining operations along the Gulf Coast said they were securing facilities. The U.S. Coast Guard also warned that the ports of New Orleans as well as Gulfport and Pascagoula, Mississippi, may have to close within 48 hours when gale force winds from Gordon are expected to arrive.

,"At a Glance In less than a day, Beryl went from an area of interest to the first hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. This tiny hurricane may strengthen a tad more into early Saturday. It will then encounter wind shear this weekend, causing it to weaken rapidly. Beryl should reach the Lesser Antilles by late Sunday or Monday. An increase in showers and gusty winds is expected in the Lesser Antilles. Hurricane Beryl has rapidly intensified to become the first hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic season well east of the Lesser Antilles, going from a tropical depression to hurricane in less than 24 hours. This tiny hurricane is currently located over 1,100 miles east-southeast of the Windward Islands, moving west. (The highest cloud tops, corresponding to the most vigorous convection, are shown in the brightest red colors. Clustering, deep convection around the center is a sign of a healthy tropical cyclone.) Beryl was upgraded to a hurricane based on microwave and infrared satellite imagery showing a ""pinhole eye"" had developed. Its tropical storm-force winds extend only up to about 35 miles from its center. Beryl's Current Wind Field (The orange circle shows the extent of the system's tropical storm-force winds (at least 39 mph). The purple circle indicates the extent of hurricane-force winds (at least 74 mph), according to the National Hurricane Center.) Tropical cyclones as tiny as Beryl are prone to intensify faster than forecast. Given barely enough ocean heat content (sea-surface temperatures around 80 degrees Fahrenheit), low wind shear, and its location south of a plume of sinking, dry air known as the Saharan air layer, Beryl intensified quickly from a tropical depression at 11 a.m. EDT Thursday to a Category 1 hurricane just 18 hours later. According to the National Hurricane Center, these favorable conditions may remain in place through early Saturday, and Beryl could gain even more intensity. However, upper-level winds will become hostile before Beryl approaches the Lesser Antilles this weekend. These shearing winds should weaken this system as it draws closer to the Lesser Antilles. Current Satellite and Wind Shear (The current tropical system is shown by the icon at lower right. Areas of strong wind shear, the difference in wind speed and direction with height, are shown in purple. High wind shear is hostile to tropical cyclones and those trying to develop.) Dry air is also plentiful ahead of Beryl and may also play some weakening role. Water Vapor Satellite Image (Dry air is shown by the progressively deeper orange and red colors. Progressively more moist air is shown by the gray, white, pink and blue colors.) While allowing Beryl to rapidly strengthen, its small size also makes it more fragile compared to larger systems. This should make Beryl's eventual weakening more rapid. The question is how fast will that occur. There is some chance Beryl may still be a tropical storm by the time it reaches the Lesser Antilles late Sunday into Monday. However, there's also a chance tiny Beryl may be ripped apart by the aforementioned combo of wind shear and dry air. Even if the system degenerates into a tropical wave, an uptick in shower activity, including some locally heavy rain, and gusty winds are expected in the Lesser Antilles late Sunday into Monday. (The red-shaded area denotes the potential path of the center of the tropical cyclone. It's important to note that impacts (particularly heavy rain, high surf, coastal flooding, winds) with any tropical cyclone usually spread beyond its forecast path.)

DAN LEVIN,"The Oxford English Dictionary, a.k.a. the OED, is one of the best-known references on the English language. Yet a devious clue — “It ends with ‘zyzzyva,’ in brief” — stumped many of our solvers in the May 3 puzzle. It has appeared in The Times Crossword a total of 139 times. The OED was the 1857 brainchild of the Philological Society of London, which decided that existing English language dictionaries were incomplete and deficient. It was a slow and laborious process, as their attempt was to “include all English language vocabulary from the Early Middle English period (1150 AD) onward, plus some earlier words if they had continued to be used into Middle English.” The first part, or “fascicle,” was published in 1884. The “complete” dictionary — entries are always being added — was published in 1928, and the OED, which is published by the Oxford University Press, just celebrated its 90th birthday.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Tropical Storm Michael is bringing damaging winds and life-threatening flash flooding over portions of North Carolina and Virginia before heading off into the Atlantic Ocean, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Thursday. The center of Michael will bring gale- to storm-force winds over portions of southeastern Virginia, extreme northeastern North Carolina, and the Delmarva Peninsula late on Thursday night and on Friday morning when it becomes post-tropical off the Mid-Atlantic coast, the Miami-based weather forecaster said. Michael, the third most powerful hurricane ever to hit the U.S. mainland, smashed into Florida’s northwest coast near the small town of Mexico Beach on Wednesday as a Category 4 hurricane with 155-mile-per-hour (250-kilometer-per-hour) winds. It left at least 7 dead and tore apart coastal towns. By 8 p.m. (0000 GMT) on Thursday, the storm was located about 5 miles (10 km) northwest of Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, with maximum sustained winds of 50 miles-per-hour (85 kph). Reporting by K.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","After nearly four months of waiting for El Niño, the switch is likely to be flipped on this winter. Rejoice, my fellow Ninoheads. There are signs that El Niño, a climate phenomenon characterized by a warming of waters in the eastern tropical Pacific, is imminent according to an update released on Thursday by the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI). It will arrive just in time for winter to rearrange the worlds weather, including ushering in a warmer-than-normal winter for much of the U.S. The latest update on El Niño that included input from human researchers at IRI and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was released on Oct. 11. It gave strong odds that El Niño would form in the next month or so. The update released on Thursday uses models only, and finds the odds to be even higher. It puts the chances well see an El Niño from winter until early spring of 2019 at an 85-90 percent. The conditions in and above the Pacific seem to agree. NOAA defines El Niño as when ocean temperatures in a region of the eastern tropical Pacific (dubbed NINO3.4 in climate nerd talk) are 0.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal for three months in a row. That region is currently just over that threshold, and a big pulse of warm water below the surface thats working its way across the Pacific should help El Niño conditions blossom. Its not likely to be a blockbuster El Niño, but it should still have enough of an impact as it propagates through the atmosphere to affect weather patterns elsewhere. And as it so happens, the El Niño update on Thursday coincided with NOAAs winter weather outlook. Meteorologists know how El Niño can tip the odds one way or the other for certain types of weather, so the outlook is pretty confident in showing higher odds of warmth across much of the U.S. save the Southeast. The outlook also shows wet weather for the southern tier of the country, while the Northern Rockies are likely to be drier than normal. The wet weather in the Southwest would certainly be a relief, since the region is in the grips of an intense drought. El Niño is far from the only natural climate shift to affect weather. Youve got your Arctic Oscillation and your Madden-Julian Oscillation (to say nothing of the unnatural shift driven by human-caused climate change). And a forecast for, say, increased odds of a warmer-than-normal winter in Spokane does not mean there will be no cold spells. Sometimes winter just has to winter.","After nearly four months of waiting for El Niño, the switch is likely to be flipped on this winter. Rejoice, my fellow Ninoheads.

Jolyn Rosa,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Lane threatened to drench Hawaii’s most populated island of Oahu on Saturday, after lingering just south of the U.S. state and unleashing torrential rains and flooding on the Big Island, weather and civil defense officials said. Hawaii was spared a direct hit by a major hurricane as Lane, once a monster tempest, weakened on Friday into a tropical storm with sustained winds of 65 miles per hour (100 kph). Early on Saturday it remained south of Hawaii and was moving slowly north-northwest through the Pacific Ocean, its outer rain bands producing severe flooding across parts of the islands. “Regardless of the storm’s track, life threatening flash flooding, along with locally strong winds and possible isolated tornadoes, will continue to extend far beyond the center’s location,” the National Weather Service’s Honolulu office said. “Do not focus on the exact forecast track or intensity of Lane.” Hawaii’s Big Island, properly called the island of Hawaii, was hard hit on Friday and much of it remained vulnerable to flash floods, the weather service said. Hilo, the Big Island’s largest community, received more than 31 inches (79 cm) of rain from Wednesday through Friday, its largest three-day total since records began in 1949. Some areas received more than 45 inches, the weather service said. Police and emergency crews conducted numerous rescues of people stranded in vehicles and homes by high water on Friday. On Saturday, Lane was creeping north-northwest at 3 mph (5 km/h), NWS meteorologist Chevy Chevalier said by phone. It was expected to turn to the west, away from Hawaii, later on Saturday, he said. “We have to get this thing out of here, and the biggest reason is the Big Island doesn’t need any more rain,” he said. NO INJURIES REPORTED No injuries were reported, but several structures were destroyed on the Big Island, said Melissa Dye, an NWS spokeswoman in Honolulu. She said two Hilo-area neighborhoods were evacuated. “I’ve never seen this, so much devastation of the river flowing down off of Komohana,” said one long-time Hilo resident, Tracy Pacheco. “I just came from Pahale Park, and there’s no park.” Oahu, home to the state capital of Honolulu and to 70 percent of Hawaii’s 1.4 million residents, could receive heavy rain later on Saturday if the storm lingers south of the state, forecasters said. More than 1,100 people stayed in emergency shelters in the city on Friday, according to its mayor, Kirk Caldwell. He told the Weather Channel that Honolulu is vulnerable to floods and mudslides because it is partly ringed by mountains. “We have asked our residents in these areas where they know it floods to be ready to leave,” Caldwell said on Friday. Forecasts predicted that Lane, which peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with top sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph) earlier in the week while far from Hawaii, will diminish into a tropical depression by early on Sunday. New Yorker Rigo Pagoada, 43, who was on vacation on Oahu with his family, said he felt lucky it had been largely spared, but that it was sad to see what had happened on the Big Island. “We’ve been very fortunate,” Pagoada said. Hawaii’s major airports stayed open during the storm, though some flights were canceled at Honolulu’s main airport and at Kahului Airport on Maui. Travelers should expect congestion at the airports through the weekend as a result, Hawaii Governor David Ige said.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are fewer than 70 Javan rhinos left The death of the world's last male northern white rhino has rendered the species ""functionally extinct"". The only hope of reviving the population is through scientific intervention via IVF. It is a ""uniquely bad situation"", according to Colin Butfield, head of campaigns at conservation charity WWF. The vaquita - a very rare porpoise discovered in 1958 - and the Javan rhino are most in danger of going the same way. But many other species - including the Sumatran rhino, black rhino, amur leopard, forest elephant and Bornean orangutan - are also considered critically endangered, some with fewer than 100 left. Image copyright WWF The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) produces a ""Red List"" dividing species of plant, mammal, bird, amphibian and marine life into seven categories from ""least concern"" up to ""vulnerable"", ""endangered"", ""critically endangered"" and ""extinct"". It currently considers 5,583 to be critically endangered. And at least 26 were newly considered critically endangered in 2017, having been in a less severe category the year before. In November 2016, the IUCN estimated there were about 30 remaining vaquita and they were likely to be extinct within the decade. It's not always possible to give an exact number when it comes to animal populations, but the organisations that provide data to the IUCN use a range of methods to produce best estimates. Image copyright WWF Image caption Amur leopards live in eastern Russia When counting land mammals, conservationists will use a combination of: GPS trackers disguised cameras that identify individuals' distinctive markings traces of kills faeces paw marks scratches on trees They will then do a calculation using this information alongside estimates based on things such as the availability of prey and how many of a species could be sustained in a given area. But calculating how many members of a species there are is not always uncontroversial. Every year, new species are discovered. That's not adding to the stock of the world's creatures - we're still losing wildlife at a rapid rate - but it does show how difficult it is to know exactly how many species are endangered, how big those species are and which are most under threat. Campaigners say some species will be extinct before we even know they exist. The Brazilian spix's macaw is considered to be extinct in the wild, but in 2016 a lone bird was spotted. When it comes to assessing how endangered a species is, it's not just about numbers, though. Are they all living in one area - and therefore more likely to be wiped out by a single cause - or are they geographically spread out? How long is their reproductive cycle and so how quickly could their population recover if there were enough breeding pairs? What are the range of threats they face? How genetically diverse is the population? How threatened is their habitat? A species with 500 animals left could be considered more endangered than one with only 300 left if that species is localised to one area and has a long reproductive cycle meaning the population cannot quickly grow. Compare creatures living in tropical rainforests with more temperate forests. In a tropical rainforest, there will be more species that don't exist anywhere else. If something happens to a single river system, a whole species can be immediately wiped out, regardless of how big that localised population was, and that then has a knock-on effect on other species in the same system.

Rod Nickel,"PANAMA CITY, Fla. (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Michael took its drenching rains to Georgia and the Carolinas on Thursday after devastating Florida’s Panhandle, killing at least two people, reducing homes to rubble and ripping up power lines and tree. Michael crashed ashore on Wednesday near the small town of Mexico Beach as the third most powerful hurricane ever to strike the U.S. mainland, carrying winds of up to 155 miles per hour (250 kilometers per hour) and causing deep seawater flooding. In large areas of Mexico Beach, homes were obliterated or reduced to stacks of rubble, aerial video from CNN showed on Thursday. Brock Long, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, called the town “ground zero” for the hurricane damage. One objective as recovery got under way was to help people who could be trapped in various areas along the coast, he told a news conference. In Panama City, 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Mexico Beach, buildings were crushed and boats were scattered around. Michael had left a trail of utility wires on roads, flattened tall pine trees and knocked a steeple from a church. Al Hancock, 45, who works on a tour boat, survived in Panama City with his wife and dog. “The roof fell in but we lived through it,” he said. Florida Governor Rick Scott told the Weather Channel the damage from Panama City down to Mexico Beach was “way worse than anybody ever anticipated.” It was not yet known what had happened to about 280 residents of Mexico Beach who authorities said had ignored evacuation orders as the storm approached the state’s northwest. The area is known for its small beach towns, wildlife reserves and the state capital, Tallahassee. Michael was a Category 4 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson hurricane intensity scale, just shy of a rare Category 5, when it came ashore. It weakened steadily as it traveled inland over the Panhandle. By 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT) Thursday it had been downgraded to a tropical storm with 50-mph (85-kph) winds as it pushed through Georgia into the Carolinas, the National Hurricane Center said. Parts of North Carolina and Virginia could get as much as 9 inches (23 cm) of rain and life-threatening flash floods, the NHC said. The Carolinas are still recovering from Hurricane Florence last month. The two people killed in the storm were a man who died when a tree toppled onto his house in Florida and a girl who died when debris fell into a home in Georgia, officials and local media said. Long said several hospitals in the Panhandle were hit by the hurricane and patients had to be evacuated. More than 830,000 homes and businesses were without power in Florida, Alabama and Georgia early Thursday. ‘SURREAL’ WIND The hurricane, the fiercest to hit Florida in 80 years, pummeled communities across the Panhandle and turned streets into roof-high waterways. “The wind that came through here was surreal. It destroyed everything,” Jason Gunderson, a member of a group of rescue workers that calls itself the Cajun Navy, told CNN early on Thursday from Callaway, a suburb of Panama City. “It’s unlivable. It’s heartbreaking.” Thousands of people hunkered down in shelters overnight after fleeing their homes ahead of the storm. An estimated 6,000 people evacuated to emergency shelters, mostly in Florida, and that number was expected to swell to 20,000 across five states by week’s end, said Brad Kieserman of the American Red Cross. Twenty miles (32 km) south of Mexico Beach, floodwaters were more than 7 feet (2.1 meters) deep near Apalachicola, a town of about 2,300 residents, hurricane center chief Ken Graham said. Wind damage was also evident. “There are so many downed power lines and trees that it’s almost impossible to get through the city,” Apalachicola Mayor Van Johnson said. Michael had rapidly intensified as it churned north over the Gulf of Mexico in recent days, growing from a tropical storm into a Category 4 hurricane in about 40 hours and catching many by surprise. With a low barometric pressure recorded at 919 millibars, the measure of a hurricane’s force, it ranked as the third strongest storm on record to make landfall in the continental United States. Only Hurricane Camille on the Mississippi Gulf Coast in 1969 and the so-called Labor Day hurricane of 1935 in the Florida Keys were more intense. U.S. President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for all of Florida, freeing federal assistance to supplement state and local disaster responses. About 3,500 Florida National Guard troops were deployed, along with more than 1,000 search-and-rescue personnel, Governor Scott said. Even before landfall, the hurricane disrupted energy operations in the Gulf, cutting crude oil production by more than 40 percent and natural gas output by nearly one-third as offshore platforms were evacuated before the storm hit.

Rich McKay,"(Reuters) - Tropical Storm Michael became a hurricane on Monday and was expected to strengthen rapidly before hitting the Florida Panhandle midweek, packing winds of at least 100 miles per hour (160 km per hour), the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Michael was currently a Category 1 hurricane but could make landfall as a Category 3 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale and bring 4 to 12 inches (10 to 30 cm) of rain with life-threatening flash flooding, according to forecasters. Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in more than 20 counties along the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend. Scott advised Gulf Coast residents to prepare for possible evacuation orders, and he has put more than 5,000 National Guard soldiers on alert. “Families should take the opportunity TODAY to make sure they have three days of food and water, as well as all needed medications,” Scott wrote on Twitter on Monday. “EVERY FAMILY must be prepared. We can rebuild your home, but we cannot rebuild your life.” Michael battered parts of Mexico and Cuba with powerful winds and drenching rains on Sunday and into early Monday. The storm was about 140 miles (220 km) east-northwest of Cozumel, Mexico with the maximum sustained winds of winds of 75 mph (120 kph), forecasters said. Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who is also the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in the Nov. 6 elections, said on Sunday he was cancelling his campaign events and returning to Tallahassee, the state capital, to focus on storm preparations. After hitting Florida, the storm is forecast to move northeast on Wednesday and Thursday along the Atlantic Coast and batter the Carolinas, which are still recovering from Hurricane Florence last month. BP and Exxon Mobil on Monday began evacuating personnel from Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production platforms. The Commodity Weather Group said Michael was not likely to cause much interruption to oil and gas production. The Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of daily U.S. crude oil output and 5 percent of daily natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. More than 45 percent of the nation’s refining capacity is located along the U.S. Gulf Coast, which also is home to 51 percent of total U.S. natural gas processing capability.

Kathy Finn,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Tropical Depression Gordon was expected on Thursday to dump more heavy rains that could cause flooding in central U.S. states as Hurricane Florence, a monster Category 3 storm, churned toward Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Downpours have flooded streets in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi as the storm headed north and threatened to bring heavy rains to the Mississippi Valley and the Midwest over the next few days, the NHC said. Some areas could get up to 5 inches (13 cm) of rain on Thursday and cause flash flooding, the center said. The storm, which made landfall late on Tuesday, has caused minimal property damage so far, the NHC said, but a 2-year-old girl died when a tree fell on a mobile home in Pensacola, Florida, authorities said. As of Wednesday night, more than 2,000 homes and businesses remained without power as utility companies restored service for tens of thousands of customers across the region. Energy companies and port operators along the Gulf Coast took steps to resume normal operations after Gordon shut 9 percent of the region’s oil and natural gas production. Oil prices fell about 1 percent on Wednesday, after fears about the storm eased. TRACKING TOWARD BERMUDA In the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Florence, a Category 3 storm on a five-step scale, barreled toward Bermuda on Wednesday, packing maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 kph). The first major hurricane of the Atlantic season will affect Bermuda’s surf by Friday, but it was too early to say whether it would hit land. “Swells from Florence could also reach the U.S. East Coast by early next week,” the NHC said. Florence was 1,235 miles (1,990 km) east-southeast of Bermuda on Wednesday night. Some weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, “but Florence is expected to remain a powerful hurricane through early next week,” the NHC said.

Reuters Editorial,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Seven refineries in eastern Louisiana plan to continue normal operations while keeping a careful eye on Tropical Storm Gordon, whose forecast path moved eastward on Tuesday with landfall in Mississippi, said sources familiar with plant operations. Being west of the storm, the refineries should be on the side of Gordon producing the least rain and wind, though all of the plants have prepared for high wind and possible flooding. At PBF Energy’s 190,000 bpd Chalmette, Louisiana, refinery, which is 72 miles (116 km) west of Biloxi, Mississippi, where Gordon is forecast to make landfall, scaffolding erected for planned maintenance has been removed until the storm ends, sources familiar with plant operations said. No change in operations were planned at the Chalmette refinery, the sources said. A PBF spokesman declined to discuss operations at the plant. The Valero Energy Corp 125,000 bpd plant in Meraux, Louisiana, also plans to keep running as usual overnight and into Wednesday. “Business as usual,” said a source familiar with plant operations at the Meraux refinery. A Valero spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment about operations at Meraux. Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s refineries in Convent and Norco, Louisiana, are prepared for high wind and rain, a company spokesman said. Operations at the 502,500 bpd Exxon Mobil Corp refinery in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were normal on Tuesday, said Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Nordin. The company has activated its storm preparedness plan for the refinery and adjoining chemical plant, Nordin said. Production is expected to continue normally overnight and into Wednesday at the Baton Rouge complex, said sources familiar with plant operations. Phillips 66’s 247,000 bpd refinery in Alliance, Louisiana, was operating normally on Tuesday, a company spokesman said.

Andrew Freedman,"This year will almost certainly rank as one of the planet's top five warmest years on record, according to new data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NASA. In fact, the top NASA climate scientist reported Monday that 2017 is likely to be the second-warmest year on record, behind 2016, which in turn displaced 2015 from the top spot. NOAA, on the other hand, predicts that, barring an unforeseen, large-scale cold snap, this year will rank as the third-warmest year in its database. These two science agencies use different methods to rank years, but base their information on similar underlying data comprised of thousands of surface weather stations and buoys at sea. SEE ALSO: Bucking Pentagon and intel agencies, Trump's security strategy omits climate change from list of major threats According to NASA climate scientist Gavin Schmidt, who heads up the agency's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, we're on track for the second-warmest year, with at least a 98 percent probability. NOAA found the year is tracking toward the third-warmest year since reliable thermometer records began in 1880, according to a statement from the agency. The warmest year in NOAA's database was also 2016, when global warming combined with a strong El Niño event to push global average surface temperatures to new heights. El Niño events are characterized by milder than average ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which can trigger a chain reaction of events that alter weather patterns worldwide. These climate events also add heat to the ocean and atmosphere. Even in the absence of El Niño, though, 2017 managed to stay incredibly warm, as far as average surface temperatures go. According to NOAA, the year-to-date has had a global average temperature anomaly of 0.84 degrees Celsius, or 1.51 degrees Fahrenheit, above the 20th-century average. Although a La Niña event is now underway, featuring cooler-than-average seas in the tropical Pacific Ocean, global average temperatures are in rare territory. Over time, global warming has caused both El Niño and La Niña years to become milder, making it more and more difficult to have a cooler-than-average year. Global average surface temperature departures from average from 1880 through 2017, along with the linear trend. Image: noaa/ncei In fact, the last cooler-than-average month on Earth was back in February of 1985. This means that anyone under the age of 32 has never witnessed a cooler-than-average month, at least when compared to a 1961-1990 baseline. This past year saw a host of noteworthy extreme weather and climate events, from the ongoing California wildfires to the devastating Atlantic Hurricane Season. In addition, a massive iceberg about the size of Delaware broke off the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica. While the cleaving off of that iceberg is not directly attributable to global warming, it served as a reminder of the stakes involved in addressing the problem.","This year will almost certainly rank as one of the planet's top five warmest years on record, according to new data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NASA.

Mark Kaufman,"The Puerto Rican government has a list of 64 dead from Hurricane Maria, the tropical cyclone that hit the island in September 2017. This number, however, is ""highly uncertain"" notes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A new study published Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine puts that number at an estimated 4,645 — 70 times higher than the official estimate. ""Our results indicate that the official death count of 64 is a substantial underestimate of the true burden of mortality after Hurricane Maria,"" write the authors, led by researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. SEE ALSO: Puerto Ricans never know if they'll have power. This is how they're surviving. NOAA says that the storm, which caused some $90 billion in damage, is the third costliest in U.S. history. But it's the deadliest in over a century, since a hurricane pummeled Galveston, Texas, in 1900, killing more than 6,000 people. Back then, both NOAA and the National Hurricane Center didn't exist, so people were largely unaware of the power brought by the coming cyclone. Puerto Rico knew what was coming, but the hurricane's wind and downpours ravaged the island's water system and electrical grid. The storm blew down more than 80 percent of the island's utility poles and transmission lines. ""Practically all cell phone service was lost and municipal water supplies were knocked out,"" said NOAA. While some fatalities were caused by drownings and people being carried away in unprecedented floodwaters, the researchers show that thousands more succumbed during the period between September 20 through December 31, 2017. Around a third of those died due to ""delayed or interrupted health care."" In the U.S., official deaths are documented by medical examiners, and in Puerto Rico, specifically, disaster-caused deaths are confirmed by the Institute of Forensic Sciences. This has proven difficult in Puerto Rico, the authors said, because the process often involves taking a dead body to be inspected in the capital. And the storm killed many people indirectly, such as from a lack of medical treatment for chronic disease. It can be challenging for medical examiners to identify such deaths as being cyclone-caused. NOAA satellite GOES-16 captures an image of Hurricane Maria hitting Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. Image: cira/noaa For this reason, the researchers relied upon a survey of 3,299 randomly chosen homes all over Puerto Rico, asking residents about the causes of death and other factors, like whether or not they were forced to leave their houses. Only 7 percent of households involved did not complete the survey. Once the surveys were reviewed, the researchers compared the rate of deaths that occurred between September 20 and December 31 in 2016 and 2017, finding that there were more than 4,500 ""excess deaths"" in 2017 — i.e., deaths that would not have occurred without the devastating impacts of Hurricane Maria. ""These numbers will serve as an important independent comparison to official statistics from death-registry data, which are currently being reevaluated, and underscore the inattention of the U.S. government to the frail infrastructure of Puerto Rico,"" write the authors. If the official government report approximates this latest estimate by researchers outside the government, it may persuade current and future U.S. lawmakers to address the aftermath of a tropical cyclone more promptly, and with a heightened awareness of the necessary resources. NOAA forecasts the coming 2018 Atlantic hurricane season to be ""active,"" with between five and nine hurricane-level storms.","The Puerto Rican government has a list of 64 dead from Hurricane Maria, the tropical cyclone that hit the island in September 2017.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright NASA/NOAA The past year has been a busy one for hurricanes. There were 17 named storms in 2017, 10 hurricanes and six major hurricanes (category 3 or higher) - an above average year in each respect. The 10 hurricanes formed consecutively, without weaker tropical storms interrupting the sequence. The only other time this has been recorded was in 1893. Are these storms getting worse? And does climate change have anything to do with it? A year of records This Atlantic hurricane season has been particularly bad. There was Harvey, which pummelled the United States in August. It brought the largest amount of rain on record from any tropical system - 1,539mm. It caused the sort of flooding you'd expect to see once every 500 years, causing $200bn of damage to Houston, Texas. Ironically, this was the third such ""one every 500 years"" flood Houston had suffered in three years. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Usually hurricanes might last a day or two, but the torrential rain from Harvey lasted a week. September brought Irma, which devastated Caribbean communities. It was the joint second strongest Atlantic hurricane ever, with sustained winds of 185mph. Those winds were sustained for 37 hours - longer than any tropical system on record, anywhere in the world. Next came Hurricane Maria - another category 5 hurricane, with sustained winds of 175mph - which destroyed Puerto Rico's power grid. Finally, Hurricane Ophelia span past Portugal and Spain - the farthest east any major Atlantic hurricane has ever gone. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ophelia carried Saharan dust as far north as London, darkening the sky in the middle of the day Despite this, 2017 wasn't the worst year in some key respects. It didn't produce the strongest storm - that was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with sustained winds of 190mph. Nor did it have the greatest number of storms - that was 2005, which saw an incredible 28 named storms, including seven major hurricanes. One of them was the infamous Hurricane Katrina. But 2017 was probably the costliest. Estimates for the cost of the hurricane season vary and continue to be revised, ranging up to $385bn. By comparison, 2005 racked up $144bn in damage according to the National Hurricane Center - about $180bn today, adjusted for inflation. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey's persistent rain caused catastrophic flooding in parts of Texas It has certainly been a bad year. But over time, are hurricanes getting worse? There have been 33 of the strongest category 5 hurricanes since 1924. Eleven of these have occurred in the past 14 years. We know that hurricanes are powered by warm seas and over the past 100 years global average sea temperatures have risen by about 1C. But when you look at the total strength of storms in each year since records began, some years are more fearsome than others. Meteorologists use something called accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) to calculate the total wind power of all the storms in any given year. As you can see from the following chart, there's no clear upward trend. Why not? Even though seas are getting warmer, other factors can prevent hurricanes forming in particular years. Saharan dust can interfere with hurricane formation as can the close proximity of African storms to the equator. But one of the great weather ironies is that hurricanes hate strong winds. Strong winds in the Atlantic interfere with the circulation of air through a developing storm. This stops the storm growing into a hurricane. During a phenomenon called El Niño, the Pacific Ocean near the equator gets warmer than usual. This affects global wind patterns, leading to stronger winds in the Atlantic. That means El Niño years tend to be quiet years for hurricanes. But when the Pacific is cooler (known as La Niña), the reverse is true - making it easier for hurricanes to form. And 2017 is a La Niña year. In fact, the total storm strength in La Niña years has been rising decade by decade. Land drainage High winds are just part of the story. Climate change affects hurricane seasons in other ways, too. Rainfall during hurricanes can be devastating. Hurricane Harvey would have brought severe flooding to Houston regardless of climate change. But it is reasonable to assume that Harvey brought more rain than it would have done 100 years ago. Global air temperatures have also increased by about 1C in the past 100 years, and warmer air holds more water. That's likely to be behind the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events seen in the US in recent decades. Image copyright EPA Image caption Extreme rainfall events are becoming more common in the US, according to data from the EPA But the location of housing compounded the damage. Houston's population has more than doubled since 1960 to more than two million people. Housing developments are expanding into more marginal, poorly drained land. This puts more people in harm's way. Climate change is also causing seas to rise. Melting glaciers and land-based ice sheets contribute to higher sea levels. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Melting glaciers are causing sea levels to rise Also warmer water occupies a larger volume. So as seas warm up, sea levels rise. In the US, the largest sea-level rise is around the coast of the Gulf of Mexico - about 9.6mm each year at Eugene Island, Louisiana. All of this is increasing vulnerability to flooding when hurricanes and their associated storm surge reach land. A warmer world is bringing us a greater number of hurricanes and a greater risk of a hurricane becoming the most powerful category 5. There's an increased risk of flood damage - whether related to climate change, rising sea levels or more people moving into flood-prone areas. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Kathy Finn,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Gordon weakened after making landfall just west of the Alabama-Mississippi border and lashing the U.S. Gulf Coast with high winds and heavy rain early on Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Gordon was about 40 miles (70 km) west of Mobile, Alabama and was packing maximum sustained winds of 70 miles per hour, it said. As of early Wednesday morning, the storm had not reached 74 mph winds, the minimum to become a hurricane, and was weakening as it moved inland. The storm was expected to become a tropical depression later in the day, the NHC said. Hurricane and storm surge warnings and watches were in effect across the region, the NHC said. Though the Louisiana coast remained calm as of early Tuesday evening, Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency and companies cut 9 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production. “I’m asking all residents to do their part in getting ready for this storm,” New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said in a statement. “The city’s absolute No.1 priority is to ensure the safety of our residents.” Tropical-storm force winds were already lashing the Alabama and western Florida panhandle coastlines and some areas still recovering from last year’s storms could see 12 inches (30 cm) of rain. Beaches around Mobile, Alabama were washed by storm-driven waves, said Stephen Miller, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service. “We’re expecting an increase in winds,” Miller said in a telephone interview. “We could see flooding.” Sea levels could rise as much as 5 feet (1.5 m) from Shell Beach, Louisiana, to Dauphin Island, Alabama, forecasters said. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency told South Mississippi residents to be prepared to evacuate. EVACUATIONS At LaFrance Marina near Ansley, Mississippi, a mile north of Heron Bay on the Gulf of Mexico, marina owner Sue Cates said that a tidal surge is sure to push water into the marina’s low-lying campgrounds, making evacuation “the only choice” people have to protect themselves. Nevertheless, she said she and her husband will remain in their home, which sits on tall pilings, 24 feet above ground. Built after Hurricane Katrina, the home is made to withstand a 150 mile-an-hour wind, she said. “We’re way up here, and I think we’ll be OK,” Cates said. “People around here are well-trained for this sort of thing.” U.S. oil producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp evacuated workers and shut production at two offshore oil platforms on Monday, and other companies with production and refining operations along the Gulf Coast said they were securing facilities. The Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of U.S. crude oil and 5 percent of natural gas output daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The U.S. Coast Guard said the ports of New Orleans and Gulfport and Pascagoula, Mississippi, may have to close within 48 hours.

Alix Langone,"Tropical Storm Chris, the third named storm of this season, is forecast to become a hurricane by Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The tropical storm, which was named Sunday morning, is expected to continue gaining strength as it hovers over the Gulf stream’s warm waters in the Atlantic Ocean, AccuWeather.com reports. Chris formed off the coast of North Carolina on Friday and is currently about 160 miles off the coast of Cape Hatteras. It has been a mostly stationary storm so far, sustaining maximum wind speeds close to 45 mph, but is expected to remain “well offshore” of the U.S. coast. The winds extend at least 60 miles from the eye of the storm. “Swells generated by Chris are expected to increase and affect portions of the coasts of North Carolina and the mid-Atlantic states into early next week,” the NHC says. Chris is not expected to move over the next two or three days as it develops into a hurricane and there are no coastal warnings or watches in affect, according to the NHC. Still, Chris will “stir rough seas” along the central East Coast with heavy rains, thunderstorms and flash flooding also possible, AccuWeather.com forecasts. Residents of affected areas should be aware of possible danger. A man died on Saturday in rough waters in Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, according to AccuWeather.com. “The more likely scenario is that the storm gets swept away from the Northeast at midweek,” AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski reported, and will ultimately head towards Nova Scotia or Newfoundland. The first hurricane of the 2018 season, Beryl, was downgraded to a tropical storm on Saturday and is tracking in the general direction of Puerto Rico. Forecasters have warned that this year’s hurricane season may be worse than usual.",The tropical storm is expected to remain 'well offshore' of the U.S. coast,2018-07-08T16:02:18Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Tropical Storm Chris Forecast to Become a Hurricane Early This Week,http://time.com/5332725/tropical-storm-chris-forecast-to-become-a-hurricane-early-this-week/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/tropical-storm-chris-hurricane.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,tropical,1
Mark Kaufman,"The Atlantic Ocean is alive. Including Hurricane Florence, there are currently four named storms — tempests with winds of at least 39 mph — churning in the Atlantic. This ties the record for the most named storms in the Atlantic at any one time. And there could be more: There's yet another collection of thunderstorms off in the Gulf of Mexico that has a decent, 50 percent shot, of becoming the fifth well-developed, named storm. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Florence replaced its eyewall. What does that mean? While there's substantial evidence that climate change is having a major impact on the behavior of hurricanes, this current flurry of storms falls within the realm of expected activity for this time of year. After all, it's the peak of hurricane season. ""Hurricanes and tropical activity often comes in 'bursts' (internal variability), and that's what we're seeing now, coincident with the peak of hurricane season,"" Falko Judt, a research meteorologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said via email. ""This is the time of year when we expect a lot of activity — though not always 4 simultaneous named storms!"" added Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. During the peak of hurricane season, there's generally a more favorable environment for these types of storms to form than at other times of year. For one, water in the tropics are at their warmest in September, and hurricanes can't survive without warm, bathtub-like waters. Secondly, wind shear — winds that hit hurricanes from their sides and break them apart — is typically lighter this time of year. Hurricane Florence has been feeding off some unusually warm ocean waters, which played a role in its sustained and atypical westward trek towards the Carolinas. ""Florence was by far the storm that could best take advantage of higher water temperatures, given its path,"" said Judt. Sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic showing cooler tropical waters. Image: tropicaltidbits.com But overall, warmer waters aren't responsible for stoking the other storms in the Atlantic, which form in the tropics. In fact, ""most of the tropical Atlantic is actually colder than normal right now,"" Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane scientist at Colorado State University, said over email. Instead, Klotzbach notes that wind shear, a notorious hurricane-killer, ""has been generally quite low."" What's more, Klotzbach said that a seasonal weather pattern near the equator, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), has driven wind shear down to ""anomalously low"" levels. But in about a week, the opposite will occur, likely leading to less cyclone activity in the tropics, he said. Although this burst in storm activity — which will potentially break the record for named storms at any one time — is driven largely by expected weather patterns, individual storms like Florence can be enhanced by climate change. Earth's average temperature is increasing, and it's well understood that warmer air is capable of holding more water. Specifically, for every 1 degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, of warming, the air can hold 7 percent more water. This means storms can suck up more water from the air, giving them more fuel for heavier downpours. Perhaps worse is the reality that storms around the world are slowing down, as was recently illustrated by NOAA atmospheric scientist Jim Kossin. ""Nothing good can come of a slower storm, Kossin explained. Hurricane Florence is forecast to do just this as it stalls over the Carolinas this weekend. The National Hurricane Center expects extreme deluges and a good shot at toppling rainfall records. There is, however, some good news. Once this batch of storms dies off, ""it might be a while until the next one,"" said McNoldy.","The Atlantic Ocean is alive.

Johnny Lieu,"Banana fiends, this could be a-peel-ing to you. A Japanese company has developed and begun selling a banana with an edible skin, dubbed the Mongee (pronounced ""mon-gay""). SEE ALSO: This avocado looks like a pickle and has no pit Developed by D&amp;T Farms, the creation started out as a ""hobby"" for the company's technical development manager Setsuzo Tanaka, according to a D&amp;T spokesperson who spoke to the NY Post. The secret to the edible skin comes from growing the banana trees in a minus 75 degrees Fahrenheit (-59 degrees Celsius) environment, then is thawed and replanted. It means the fruit grows rapidly and leaves the skin with a ""lettuce"" like texture. D&amp;T claims on its website the peel is an excellent source of vitamin B6, magnesium, and tryptophan, the latter being a precursor to serotonin. OK, but what's with the taste? According to reporters from RocketNews24, who tried the product, it turns out there's ""little flavour"" to the skin. But the flesh itself has a stronger tropical taste to it, which is almost ""pineapple-like."" There's also another caveat: You'll have to wait until the banana ripens properly, which in the case of the Mongee means the peel needs to have those little brown dots on it. Oh and another thing, they're kinda expensive and rare. One banana costs about $5.75, and the only store that stocks it, Tenmanya Okayama, gets a Mongee shipment of 10 a week.

Andrew Freedman,"A disastrous hurricane season combined with wildfires and other extreme weather events inflicted a record-setting toll on the U.S. in 2017, with 16 billion-dollar weather and climate events costing a total of $306 billion in damage. These events caused 362 direct deaths. These figures come from a new report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), released on Monday morning. The previous costliest year for the U.S. was 2005, when losses totaled $215 billion, largely due to the three major hurricane strikes of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. SEE ALSO: Disastrous 2017 Atlantic hurricane season ends, with hard-hit areas still reeling The number of billion-dollar events tied 2011 for the most such disasters in a single year. The Western wildfire season alone, which scorched California in particular, cost at least $18 billion, NOAA said, tripling the previous record annual wildfire cost. Hurricane Harvey, which caused the most extreme rainstorm ever observed in the U.S., had total costs of $125 billion, just behind Hurricane Katrina in the 38-year period of record for billion-dollar disasters. Insurance companies are still tallying the damage for some of these events, so these costs may yet rise further. Hurricanes Maria and Irma had total costs of $90 billion and $50 billion, respectively, and Hurricane Maria, which demolished Puerto Rico's power grid, ranks as the third-costliest weather and climate disaster on record for the nation. The spike in costs for 2017 isn't directly tied to global warming, but numerous recent studies have found that extreme heat, wildfire, and rainfall events are becoming more likely and more severe due to climate change. This could, in turn, make such disasters more expensive, depending on how vulnerable the impacted areas. In deluging Houston with up to 60 inches of rain in just a few days time, Hurricane Harvey, for example, hit one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the U.S., where rampant urban development did not take into account the threat of heavy rainfall. Third-warmest year for the U.S. The NOAA report also found that 2017 was the third-warmest year on record for the lower 48 states, with an average annual temperature that was 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th Century average. This was slightly cooler than 2012 and 2016, but it marks the 21st straight warmer-than-average year for the country. In other words, if you were born in the U.S. in 1997 and remained here since, you've never experienced a cooler-than-average year in the U.S. In fact, the globe has not experienced a cooler-than-average month since December of 1984. Strikingly, the five warmest years on record for the contiguous U.S. have all occurred since 2006, NOAA found. This year, every state across the lower 48 and Alaska had an above-average annual temperature, and five states — Arizona, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, and South Carolina — had their warmest year on record. Thirty-two additional states, including Alaska, had a top-10 warmest year. One way that NOAA measures extreme weather is via the Climate Extremes Index, which takes into account temperatures, precipitation, tropical storms and hurricanes, and other factors. In 2017 it had the second-highest value in the 108-year period of record, which was more than double the average. Only 2012 had a higher value on this index, NOAA said. Extremes in warm maximum and minimum temperatures, one-day precipitation totals, days with precipitation and landfalling tropical cyclones contributed to the elevated extremes index, NOAA found. According to NOAA, during the past 38 years, the U.S. has sustained 219 weather and climate disasters where the overall damage costs reached or exceeded $1 billion. The cumulative costs for these 219 events exceed $1.5 trillion.","A disastrous hurricane season combined with wildfires and other extreme weather events inflicted a record-setting toll on the U.S. in 2017, with 16 billion-dollar weather and climate events costing a total of $306 billion in damage.

ALAN BLINDER,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The center of Tropical Depression Florence has left the Carolinas. But the chaos that the storm unleashed is nowhere near finished. Days of record-breaking rain have pushed rivers over their banks, and water levels — still rising in some places — are unlikely to recede fully for days. The authorities and volunteers in North and South Carolina are carrying out rescues by air and water, curfews are in effect, and many thousands of people remain out of their homes. Here are the latest developments: • Wilmington, N.C., a city of about 119,000 residents, has been cut off, with roads leading to it submerged. Emergency officials are making plans to deliver supplies to the city, but some worries, including a threat to water service, have lifted. • Evacuation orders are still being issued as rivers rise and dams are tested. The authorities in Hoke County, west of Fayetteville, told residents late Sunday to flee “due to the possible breach of the dam.”","Floodwaters are still rising and people are still being rescued, even as the remnants of Hurricane Florence move out of the Carolinas.

Failed Architecture,"Beached cruise ship, fallen flying saucer, futuristic ruin; sitting amid the slums of San Agustín, in south-central Caracas, El Helicoide de la Roca Tarpeya looks different from every angle. So too do the many stories that haunt this construction, all as convoluted as its magnificent, double-spiral coils. Like its Babylonian inspiration, El Helicoide too was an ambitious project stopped short, in its case by the less-than-divine designs of politics. Like its famous predecessor, this concrete buildingconstructed in 1960 as a drive-in mall, the only one of its kind, where drivers could spiral up and down, parking right in front of the business of their choicewas halted shortly before completion. It was then abandoned to a fate that included oblivion and decay; multiple failed governmental projects; occupation by squatters and intelligence police; and episodes of drugs, sex, and torture; all sources for an endless number of legends, each more fascinating than the last.
In the 1950s, the combination of thirty years of oil revenues and a dictator, General Marcos Pérez Jiménez, bent on modernizing Caracas, made Venezuela into a haven for foreign architects. Some, like Graziano Gasparini or Federico Beckhoff, came looking for new opportunities and adopted the city as their permanent home. Others, including Gio Ponti and Oscar Niemeyer, visited briefly and were taken by the citys modern orientation. The former contributed the famous Villa Planchart, kept intact as a 1950s icon to this day; the latter proposed a huge inverted triangle for the citys museum of modern art, a project that was never executed. A few collaborated with local counterparts to design one-of-a-kind buildings. This was the case with Marcel Breuer and Herbert Berckhard, who partnered with Ernesto Fuenmayor and Manuel Sayago on El Recreo, a business and commercial complex that was also never realized, and with Dirk Bornhorst and Pedro Neuberger, two young German-born Venezuelan architects who were taken under the wing of Jorge (Yoyo) Romero Gutiérrez to help build modern Caracas. There is so much to do, Romero Gutiérrez would say. Everything is possible.
And so they set to the task, joining the likes of Carlos Villanueva, whose Universidad Central de Venezuela, which boasts a modernist campus with fluid lines and integrated art (including works by Léger, Arp, Vasarely, and Calder), was declared a World Cultural Heritage site by UNESCO in 2000; the daring Fruto Vivas, whose splendid auditorium shell covering El Club Táchira is a prime example of organic architecture; or Tomás José Sanabria, designer of the cylindrical mountain hotel El Humboldt, named after the German explorer who witnessed a meteor shower on a visit to the country in 1799.
In 1955, Romero Gutiérrez firm, Arquitectura y Urbanismo, landed a juicy deal. The owner of La Roca Tarpeya, a 328,000 square-foot hill, wanted to build a series of small apartment buildings accessible via a steep street. Romero Gutiérrez and his partners devised an alternative plan, changing the original idea from a residential to a more lucrative commercial development, and proposing a street that would spiral upwards, the roof of the premises below acting as a platform for the lanes abovea more economical and efficient use of the available space. The street eventually became a two-and-a-half-mile road, with alternating ascending and descending levels that comprise two interlocking spirals that resemble the genetic double helix. One thousand parking spaces, two for each business in the complex, would line the way.
A modern shopping mall, El Helicoide: Centro Comercial y Exposición de Industrias, was designed to include large exhibition halls for the burgeoning national industries (oil, gas, iron, aluminum, agriculture); an automobile showroom; a gym and swimming pool; restaurants; nurseries; discotheques; a giant cinema; a first-rate hotel in which all the major airlines had offices; a heliport to fly passengers to and from the airport; and a full system of internal access with diagonal elevators and mechanical stairs. At its summit, under a dome designed by Buckminster Fuller, visitors could purchase souvenirs. The landscaping was to be designed by Roberto Burle Marx. El Helicoide was state-of-the-art, even by US standards.
The whole construction, as Bornhorst, its sole surviving architect, writes in his book El Helicoide, was conceived as an artistic urban sculpture, an architectural pièce de résistance, smoothly adapted to the rhythm of the surrounding hills, itself forming another rise within the urban topography in the valley of Caracas, whose hills made the architects dream of creating a tropical Acropolis. The budget for the 436,000-square-foot reinforced-concrete development was set at $10 million. By the time it was abandoned, costs had reached $24 million.
The model was inaugurated at the architects headquarters, the Centro Profesional del Este, in September 1955 with Pérez Jiménez in attendance, a questionable alliance whose extent is yet to be determined but which would eventually cost the project its life. Soon after, the colossal effort to raise the coiling tower began, with a plan as extreme as its shape: La Roca Tarpeya was sculpted inch by inch in order to fit El Helicoide hand in glove. This strategy dramatically constrained the building, as El Helicoide is literally sandwiched between the hill and the buildings enveloping road, providing no more than twenty-two to fifty feet of usable depth.
El Helicoide was an instant hit, its shape and scale attracting the attention of architects worldwide. Photos of the model appeared on the front page of foreign newspapers and occupied a prominent place at the Museum of Modern Arts 1961 Roads exhibition. (El Helicoide is also set to appear in the museums spring 2015 retrospective on modern Latin American architecture). Back home in Venezuela, an advertising campaign to pre-sell the commercial spaces for the different businesses the building would house (an innovative form of raising capital at the time) produced drinking glasses, stickers, and key chains. Hoping El Helicoide would catalyze the urban development of southern Caracas, a boulevard connecting the building to the Botanical Gardens (next to Villanuevas recently inaugurated Universidad Central de Venezuela ) was planned. The Chilean poet Pablo Neruda wrote that El Helicoide was one of the most exquisite creations ever to have sprung from the mind of an architect. Salvador Dalí offered to decorate it with his art.
And then it all came to a halta slow, gradual halt that took everybody by surprise and from which El Helicoide never recovered. In January 1958, Marcos Pérez Jiménez was overthrown. Contrary to popular belief, El Helicoide was still not under construction, since only the custom-carving of La Roca Tarpeya had taken place between 1957 and 1958. Construction actually began in October 1958, under the provisional military government of Wolfgang Larrazábal, which oversaw the transition to democracy and allowed the building to go forward as long as its developers hired a large number of unemployed workers, part of a national emergency plan. They did, and El Helicoide roared on with 1,500 men working in three shifts round the clock for the next year and a half.
It was democracy that dealt El Helicoide its fatal blow. How exactly this happened is still unclear. Some blame the newly formed government of Rómulo Betancourt, which, unwilling to continue and thus legitimate the dictatorships massive urban renewal of Caracas, put conditions on a line of credit that had previously been granted to El Helicoide. The company balked, embarking on a lengthy legal dispute that would end only in 1976 when the empty building became state property. Others, including Pedro Neuberger, state that following Pérez Jiménezs ousting, the main shareholders of El Helicoide (IVECA, a company owned by Roberto Capriles) fled the country, leaving the building financially adrift. In any event, contractors were not paid, and the business owners who had bought into the project sued the construction company, which went bankrupt. End of story for El Helicoide, the mall.
During the next twenty years, the construction that had made international headlines stood in almost total silence. Its architects despaired over their fantastic venture gone sour and turned to other projects. True to its modern temperament, always looking forward and never back, Caracas moved on, forgetting its magnificent spiral to consumer heaven. To their credit, local governments attempted to save the frozen giant. One after another, administration after administration proposed different commercial, cultural, and commercial-cultural plans, twenty-seven in total: automobile center, performance center, museum of art, tourism center, modern cemetery, center of radio and television, multi-cinema, national library, museum of anthropology, and environmental center, to name a few.
Of these, only the last two actually got under way, giving some life to the buildings empty hallsif we dont count the massive occupation by squatters from 1979 to 1982, that is. Spurred by the official relocation of five hundred landslide refugees in El Helicoide in 1979, small groups began to install themselves in the building. By 1982, the unfinished structure was home to some twelve thousand squatters, all living without basic services in an economically depressed part of town. The building became a zone for trafficking in drugs and sex, with attendant high crime rates. This situation was literally washed away with hydraulic force in 1982 to open the way for the Museum of Anthropology.
The Museum of Anthropology plan managed to finally place on the complexs roof the Buckminster Fuller dome, which had been stored for over twenty years at a local warehouse. It didnt get much further, despite having enlisted the collaboration of El Helicoides main original architect, Romero Gutiérrez (who, refusing to set foot in it again, counseled from a distance). The four high-tech Austrian Wertheim elevators, for exampleeach capable of carrying thirty-two people and designed to move diagonally on a thirtysix degree incline along the hills slope at a speed of 6.6 feet per secondwere found at Venezuelas main port, La Guaira, languishing away incomplete. They had arrived with great fanfare two decades earlier, but by 1982, very few people even remembered what those enormous machines actually were.
Soon after the museum plans were abandoned, another type of occupant began to install itself. Starting in 1984, the Venezuelan intelligence police (then DISIP, now SEBIN) gradually began to establish its headquarters in El Helicoide, the perfect panopticon with a 360-degree view of Caracas. A new kind of darkness set upon the building, this time arising from its conversion into a detention center. High-tech surveillance equipment was installed, officers delighted to be able to ride their cars to their offices à la James Bond. There were political prisoners, there was torture; SWAT teams would stop anyone taking a picture of the building from the surrounding highways.
Some believe the place is cursed. (The hill, after all, was named for Romes Tarpeian Rock, from which the daughter of the Roman general Tarpeius was thrown after being killed for betraying the city to the Sabines.) In 1992, for example, Julio Coll and Jorge Castillo, architects of the most progressive of the projects imagined for El Helicoidethe Centro Ambiental de Venezuela, designed to house the ministry of the environment, a laudably early response in the region to an underrecognized global problemsought to dispel the negative energy that they thought might have been blocking the buildings progress. The duo took several measures to address its bad vibes, starting with a meditation under the Fuller dome during which they claimed to have heard voices informing them that an indigenous cemetery on La Roca Tarpeya had been disturbed during the construction of the building. Coll and Castillos project was completed in 1993, a magnificent headquarters that included a library with marble niches on the buildings top level. All to no availthe Centro Ambiental was never inaugurated, and within a few months a new government had appropriated its glowing headquarters for the senior commanders of the DISIP. La Roca Tarpeya had struck again.
A few years later, the DISIP was joined by training schools for the police and the military, namely the Universidad Nacional Experimental de la Seguridad (UNES) and the Universidad Nacional Experimental de las Fuerzas Armadas (UNEFA). So proud of El Helicoide that it featured the building in a 2007 philatelic commemoration, DISIP was rebuked in June 2012 by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which determined that its detention center was in breach of international prison conventions on hygiene. A serious bacterial outbreak a year later finally led to the transfer of prisoners to other facilities, but the center still houses short-term detainees. The irony is staggering: a place that was meant to be a highway to consumer heaven became instead a stairway to hell, as if the spiral had spun downward instead of upward, opening the way for El Helicoides particular twist on its sacred referent, the Babylonian ziggurat. After all, the ziggurat is meant to connect the earth not only with the heavens above but also with the ground beneath. El Helicoide: a tropical ziggurat gone astray.
Rumors have it that El Helicoide has subterranean tunnels reaching out to different parts of the city. Like a rhizomatic helix whose coils spread waste and disillusionment, the slums around it have multiplied, as has the security apparatus that emerges from its entrails. The former grow so close to the building that they morph topographically with its curves; the latter use the building as a launch pad for their operations. A surreal platform, El Helicoide is as unexpected, unpredictable, and unique as Caracass ever-changing physiognomy.
For most caraqueños, El Helicoide is simply a part of the landscape, one of the many unfinished or abandoned buildings that add to the citys irregular topography and unwieldy urbanism. For others, it is a reminder of the 1950s and 1960s, when Caracas underwent its modern boom, expanding in all senses. It was a utopian time that some remember with deep-felt nostalgia, whether for the dictatorial regime that gave the city its modern infrastructure or for the burgeoning democracy that immediately took its place after decades of quasi-consecutive dictators, each one stamping his own distinctive character on the fertile valley that once housed coffee and tobacco haciendas.
In the four decades after the discovery of oil in 1918, Caracas went from a quiet, semi-rural town of 140,000 inhabitants to an effervescent capital of the Americas with a population of more than 1.2 million and filled with highways, skyscrapers, and also schools for the families of employees of foreign oil companies (Shell, Mobil, Exxon) that were busily pumping Venezuelan oil. Like that oil, democracy gushed into existence, young and full of projects, eager to embrace a modernity for which Venezuela finally seemed ripe, ready to catch up with a world it had long admired. However, as with many other nations, Venezuela built its democratic dream on the back of a vast majority that it rarely saw, and acknowledged even less. The fabulous party, as Venezuelans themselves call the period from the 1940s through the 1970s, came to its final end in 1999 with the rise of the Bolivarian Revolution headed by Hugo Chávez. But the party had finished long before, and if anything, El Helicoide is the best testament to the extremes that have led Venezuela by the nose, swinging from despair to excitement and back again.
Modernity is a tricky condition, especially in countries like Venezuela, whose oil-driven emergence from a semi-feudal economy was nothing short of radical, and where catching up was not the same as growing up or becoming independent as a nation. On the contrary, catching up meant becoming if not equal, at least comparable, to its complicated northern neighbor, the United States. It meant being able to emulate the North American model, understood as the model of the future, of progress based on the paradigms of capital investment and mechanical efficiency. It meant, in a typically Venezuelan manner, beating the gringos at their own game: for example, building a supermall that would leave them stunned.
And so it did. In their essay for MoMAs Roads catalogue, Bernard Rudofsky and Arthur Drexler make the point that El Helicoides adventurous enterprise has been undertaken in Latin America and not in the United States, where both highways and shopping centers are among our most ambitious efforts. Nelson Rockefeller tried to buy El Helicoide, but even he couldnt overcome the legal quagmire that paralyzed the building until the state intervened and took it over. El Helicoide was a feat of the imagination and of technology, yes, but in a context where such things are secondary, where continuity is non-existent and maintenance considered a waste of time, and where purpose falls prey to a proprietary politics that binds the country to its leaders in a perverse filiation.
In the end, El Helicoide stands for exactly the opposite of what it was built to be. Instead of a dynamic center of exchange that might have revitalized the area and its surroundings, the building grew melancholically inward, fated, like an obsessive thought, to repeat its failure over and over again. Rather than expansive, it became sinister, a threatening fortress of law and order in a country that endemically ignores both. The building that could have become a symbol of modernitys progressive thrust became instead an emblem of its failuresof the price paid for wishing to change everything at all costs, for imposing a vision unilaterally, for dreaming for others what they may not want to dream at all. As such, many think that in its ruined condition, El Helicoide offers the most appropriate portrait of a dystopic Caracas.
For the last thirty years, El Helicoide has been like a black sun, radiating inconspicuous state control, detention, and surveillance. For some, this fate might seem better than its lying in derelict abandon, yet it is far, very far, from the grandiose aspirations that fueled its original construction. And farther away still from the sacred geometry underlying pyramids and temples, the spiral dance at the origin of life and of these unique structures. Like them, El Helicoide, literally carved in stone, will outlast centuries of human history, even nuclear blasts. It will remain an icon of a future that never quite made it to the present.

Patrick Allan,"Is there anything better than digging your toes into the warm sand on some beautiful, exotic beach? Well there is if that beach is riddled with hookworms that hope to burrow into your feet and make their way to your small intestine. If you do a lot of traveling to warm, humid locales, here’s how you can avoid these nasty little things. iOS/Google: Different countries around the world have unique foods, styles, and cultures, but they… Read more Read Hookworms, if you haven’t already guessed, are a parasite. They pass from person to person by one of two ways : walking barefoot on soil contaminated with infected human feces, or ingesting hookworm eggs. The former is a big problem in many parts of the world where sewage systems are inadequate. When you gotta go, you gotta go, so people end up using holes, bushes, or fields, then hookworm eggs are deposited into the soil where they can spread anywhere water moves the soil—like downhill to the beach. The eggs grow into small larvae and spend the rest of their days hoping to latch onto some animal’s bare skin. Fun stuff. Even the Southern U.S. used to have their own major problem with hookworms. People couldn’t afford proper plumbing, so the parasite spread and spread and spread. In fact, the parasite is largely responsible for the stereotype of the lazy Southerner with a big belly and shoulder hunch who sleeps on their porch all day (all symptoms caused by rampant hookworm infection). Fortunately, the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease pretty much eradicated the problem here, save for a few cases here and there. While you don’t usually have to worry about hookworms on beaches here in the states, they’re still a big problem in other parts of the world. Areas with warm, moist climates are all at risk, especially if sanitation and hygiene are poor. In case you were wondering what areas fit that description, here’s a useful map. Parts of South America, Asia, Central America, and Africa are all possible homes to the parasite. It goes to show how prevalent hookworms are around the world. If you’re in need of a new passport, or haven’t renewed yours in a long while, now’s the time. A… Read more Read There’s no immunization you can get to prevent hookworms from infecting you, but it doesn’t take much to stop them. If you’re traveling to any areas that may have hookworms and plan on spending any time on the beach, or any area where you might be in direct contact with soil, here’s what Sara Chodosh at Popular Science says you can do to prevent infection : Wear sandals on the beach. Sit on towels or blankets when resting on the ground. Wash your skin with soap and water after you touch soil or sand. That’s it! That’s all it takes. Hookworms are considered a “neglected tropical disease” because it’s generally pretty easy to prevent, but still such a big problem for many people. A little knowledge and a minor attempt at prevention goes a long ways. According to the CDC, symptoms of hookworms include an itchy rash on the point of contact (usually your feet), as well as fatigue, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight loss, and anemia. But if you do happen to get infected, don’t fret. Your healthcare provider will prescribe you a few pills that will take care of the parasites in a matter of days.","Is there anything better than digging your toes into the warm sand on some beautiful, exotic beach?

Lydia Belanger,"September 6, 2018 4 min read This story appears in the September 2018 Entrepreneur. Subscribe » Dennis and Nicole Drake know how to motivate a workforce. The husband-­and-wife team -- a Defense Department adviser and an aerospace engineer, respectively -- spend their days working in highly sensitive U.S. intelligence and defense facilities, managing projects and teams stretched across the globe. Then they turn to their side hustle, where those same skills are put to different use: They own and operate two Tropical Smoothie Cafe stores in Virginia, employing high school and college students preparing for their future. To keep their staff engaged and working hard, the Drakes have implemented programs, rewards systems and scholarships to set up their employees for success -- at Tropical Smoothie Cafe and beyond. Related: 10 Tips to Motivate Employees Without Resorting to Money Most of your staff are Gen Z. How do you recruit and hire? Dennis: In this industry, you have a lot of companies vying for the same people, and there’s high turnover. We have to understand the dynamic of how to hire right and keep our employees from moving simply for a dollar or two. Nicole: When I do interviews, I take the “motherly approach.” If [the candidate is] still in school, I stress that the most important thing right now is their education. And I establish my expectations up front. I’ll tell them that I don’t like drama, but I’ll also let them know that I want them to come to work and feel safe and comfortable being who they are. That’s what we owe our employees. What have you learned about keeping this younger staff engaged? Dennis: They like a healthy challenge and competition. We reward them with our “Atta Boy” employee-of-the-month program that comes with recognition and a bonus. They also value meaningful activities -- our guys and gals at our Gainesville location lost a friend to suicide because of bullying, and we took up that cause, with all our employees wearing buttons or shirts to raise awareness and show support. When you care about what they care about, you get great mileage when it comes to their commitment. Related: 7 Ways Managers Motivate and Demotivate Employees How do you support their career development? Nicole: We know this is a stepping-­stone for them, and we don’t want anyone to feel like we’re trying to trap them here. But I do want them to learn work ethic. If you’re a crew member and you have aspirations to be a leader, then there’s a shift-lead goal, an assistant manager goal and a manager goal. We’re extremely proud that both of our managers were some of our first hires. Dennis: We also provide resume assistance for our college students and graduates, we provide letters of recommendation and we’ve hosted homework night for students going into final exams -- we keep the café open late in the evening so our team has a quiet place to study. We also hold scholarship challenges, certain days where a portion of our sales go toward a fund for our employees. Related: How to Motivate Employees in Less Than 5 Minutes Do you keep in touch once they’ve moved on? Dennis: The other night, Nicole got a text from one of our ex-employees, who’s in college now, that said, “I’m in this business class. What were the methods of customer engagement we used?” It’s rewarding -- Nicole: -- to know that they feel comfortable enough to text me at 10 o’clock at night to ask me that question.

David Murphy,"All I ever seem to see on the “New and Trending” list in Valve’s Steam service are games I know I’ll never play. And then there are those weird sexy games. In fact, as I write this article, the game “Tropical Liquor” sits near the top of my feed—another classic title that rewards you with anime characters that strip whenever you successfully complete a mini-game. (And don’t even get me started about Super Seducer, also appearing on the list today, or the flood of broken-as-hell Early Access games I regularly see.) Thankfully, there’s a way to heavily filter the games you see on Steam, but it’s somewhat buried within Steam’s clunky user interface. Here’s how you do it. Find the right settings menu To personalize Steam’s store, you’ll need to first find the correct Settings menu. Don’t look under Steam’s Settings menu (Steam &gt; Settings), nor your Profile preferences, nor even the “Your Store” link on Steam’s primary Store page. Instead, you’ll want to click on your account name in the upper-right corner of Steam’s UI and click on “Preferences.” (Note to Valve: It would be great to be able to access all of Steam’s options from a single, easy-to-find “Settings” menu, which could include feed customization. Just saying.) Remove game types you don’t care about Nothing against Early Access games—titles that might be beta-testing or in active development—but there are a lot of them and they can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming to view in Steam’s Store. And it’s perfectly fine to be the kind of person who prefers to know about games when they’re finished, not when they’re being worked on. Within Steam’s Store Content Preferences, you can select whether you want to see a variety of titles in Steam’s store: Early Access games, preorders, software, videos, movies, and VR content. If you aren’t interested in different categories—maybe you Netflix all movies instead of buying them, for example—just uncheck each category to remove its associated content from Steam. You can also elect to hide titles that are excessively gory or sexy, if one of those isn’t your cup of tea. Filter out games by keywords The “Tags to Filter Out” section in Steam’s Store Content Preferences is one of its more useful features. If there are certain types of games you have absolutely no interest in—like “anime” games or “free to play” games—just type in the tag. You only get three tags to filter (sigh), so make them good. Bonus: Even more content filters As you’ve probably noticed, the Store Content Preferences menu has a few other tricks up its sleeve. If you use Steam’s Discovery Queue or New Release Queue to find games that might interest you, you can adjust the content that appears in each. Filter titles you want to see by category—early access games, software, videos, and unreleased games—or filter out particular tags you don’t care about. You can also remove games by platform if you don’t think you’ll ever play titles on a Mac you don’t own or a Linux box you have no intention of ever setting up.",All I ever seem to see on the “New and Trending” list in Valve’s Steam service are games I know I’ll never play.

Jason Schreier,"It is incredibly fun to die in Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, a game that assaults your senses with enough cute animals, wonderful animations, and lovely music to make you forget that it’s beating the hell out of you. Tropical Freeze, which came out for Wii U in 2014 and launches again for Switch today, is set in a world in which Mario’s first villain wears a red tie and collects bananas. The plot, as it were, involves a gang of villainous penguins who decide to interrupt Donkey Kong’s birthday party by covering his island in a thick coat of frost. This is not so much a story as an excuse for Donkey Kong and his pals to go off on a series of side-scrolling platforming adventures, hopping on bad guys and riding in mine karts along the way. As Donkey Kong (often joined by the pal of your choice, be it Diddy Kong, Cranky Kong, or Dixie Kong), you’ll move from left to right, slamming the ground and jumping between ledges to re-conquer your island from the penguins. Daily thoughts from a Kotaku staffer about a game we’re playing. The Nintendo Platformer Scale has always looked something like this: Easy: Kirby (also boring — sorry Stephen ) Medium: Mario (“Darker Side” notwithstanding) Hard: Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze is no exception. As you hop between perilous gaps and shoot your way out of high-speed cannons, you will die. A lot. The Switch version’s new Funky Mode—which boosts you from two to three hearts and allows you to swap between DK and his overpowered surfer cousin, Funky Kong—helps mitigate the pain a bit, but this is still an astoundingly difficult game. Falling off a ledge or driving a mine cart into the wrong place will kill you immediately, taunting you to get better or die trying. That’s a good thing, I think. I like tough games, especially when they’re as resplendent as Tropical Freeze, with its beautiful environments and excellent soundtrack. I’ve played through two worlds of the newest game on Switch, and died several dozen times already—enough to see this embarrassing message: Screw you, Donkey Kong. I don’t need your patronizing messages or shortcuts. Just let me die in peace.","It is incredibly fun to die in Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, a game that assaults your senses with enough cute animals, wonderful animations, and lovely music to make you forget that it’s beating the hell out of you.

Mark Kaufman,"Last weekend, Ellicott City's quaint Main Street, with red, white, and blue decorations draped from storefronts, became a churning brown river. While several factors resulted in this Maryland town's second ""1,000-year storm"" occurring in just the last 22 months, one increasingly significant contribution to the flooding is the amount of water vapor accumulating in Earth's warming atmosphere. The flooding in Maryland fits within the broader context of how human-caused climate change is altering our atmosphere, making these extreme events more commonplace in the future. SEE ALSO: 2018's hurricane season will be active, but probably not as bad as last year NASA scientists say that average global temperatures have been on a ""rapid warming trend"" in the last four decades. This warming means that the air is capable of holding more water. Specifically, for every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, the air can hold 7 percent more water. Accordingly, this loads storm systems with more water. ""So when it rains, it really, really pours, in the future — and now,"" Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in an interview. ""This is super basic physics and chemistry,"" said Marvel of increased temperatures allowing the air to absorb more water. Today, the consequences of this elementary science are pummeling the U.S. ""We’ve already observed an increase in heavy precipitation events,"" said Marvel. In 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report showing extreme, single day downpours have been on the rise since the late 1970s. The United States' 2014 National Climate Assessment — guided by 13 federal agencies — found that ""Across most of the United States, the heaviest rainfall events have become heavier and more frequent."" ""Increases in extreme precipitation are projected for all U.S. regions,"" the report added. Image: U.S. government/National climate assessment That said, Marvel emphasizes it's inaccurate to say that any extreme downpour was the direct or single result of more water vapor being held in the warmer air. Destructive weather will still happen — but now it has an added kick — human-induced global warming. ""Unlucky, bad things happen all the time,"" said Marvel. ""Weather happens, but we know what climate change is doing."" Tropical cyclones, for example, have ravaged U.S. coastlines throughout history, and will continue to do so. The first named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Alberto — which is not a hurricane but is still carrying bounties of water — has now causing flooding so severe in North Carolina that the National Weather Service tweeted ""HEED ALL EVACUATION ORDERS IMMEDIATELY!"" in areas around the Lake Tahoma dam. NOAA/NWS Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center preliminary analysis indicates the 3-hourly max rainfall totals across Ellicott City MD area on Sunday have a 0.1% (1 in 1000) chance of occurring in a given year. Amazing...2 such rare events over the same area in last 22 months pic.twitter.com/wz1xT4XHwN — NWS Eastern Region (@NWSEastern) May 30, 2018 NASA also notes that the severity of downpours during tropical storms and hurricanes are on the rise. Marvel uses disgraced U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong, who admitted to doping, as an analogy. The talented Armstrong would still have probably won some races without enhancing his performance with prohibited drugs. But, ""we know that he was doping, and we know what doping does,"" Marvel said. Similarly, ""we know we’re doping the weather,"" said Marvel. ""And we know what that does.""","Last weekend, Ellicott City's quaint Main Street, with red, white, and blue decorations draped from storefronts, became a churning brown river.

Associated Press,"(HARARE, Zimbabwe) — Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi have been hit by a vicious cyclone that has killed more than 140 people, left hundreds more missing and stranded tens of thousands who are cut off from roads and telephones in mainly poor, rural areas.
U.N. and government officials report that Cyclone Idai has affected more than 1.5 million people in the three southern African countries.
Hardest hit is Mozambique’s central port city of Beira where the airport is closed, electricity is out and hundreds of homes have been destroyed. The storm hit Beira late Thursday and moved westward into Zimbabwe and Malawi, affecting thousands more, particularly in eastern areas bordering Mozambique.
Homes, schools, businesses, hospitals and police stations have been destroyed by the cyclone. Thousands have been marooned by the heavy flooding.

Lyka Amethyst H. Casamayor,"THE City Government of Davao will provide P1-million calamity fund each for the five provinces declared in the state of calamity due to Tropical Depression Usman.
The City Council's special session Thursday, January 3, approved a P10-million assistance for the provinces of Albay, Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte, Sorsogon, and Oriental Mindoro. The aid for these provinces were requested by the City Administration Office through City Administrator lawyer Zuleika Lopez.
Camarines Norte recorded the highest number of families affected with 642,710, followed by Camarines Sur (522,495), Albay (286,641), Sorsogon (177,002), and Oriental Mindoro (168,811).
Another P5 million will be allotted for food and relief assistance will be divided only to Albay, Camarines Sur, and Sorsogon, the three most devastated areas.
During the special session, some councilors suggested that the P5 million allotment for food and relief assistance to the three major affected provinces should be given as groceries for the affected families in which the council members agreed.
The fund will be sourced from the Quick Response Fund (QRF) of the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund or the calamity fund of the City for 2019.

Space Coast Daily,"By Space Coast Daily // September 22, 2018 Tropical Storm Kirk, the 11th named storm of the season, developed on Saturday morning and is moving through an area of warm water and relatively low shear, according to AccuWeather Expert Senior Meteorologist Dan Kottlowski. (NHC image) BREVARD COUNTY, FLORIDA – Tropical Storm Kirk, the 11th named storm of the season, developed on Saturday morning and is moving through an area of warm water and relatively low shear, according to AccuWeather Expert Senior Meteorologist Dan Kottlowski. Tropical Storm Kirk is located 450 miles south of the southernmost Cabo Verde Islands. The storm will move toward the west-northwest through early next week and is not a threat to Florida. While these two factors are favorable for strengthening, Kirk is also moving through an area of relatively dry air, which would limit intensification, according to Kottlowski. Winds are sustained at 40 mph and is moving west at 14 mph. The National Hurricane Service said that some strengthening is expected through Sunday, but it will stay a tropical storm. Kirk is expected to speed up through the weekend but will not impact land for several days, allowing those potentially in its track plenty of time to prepare.

"Gwen Ihnat on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Snow day: The two words that strike terror in the hearts of parents and equal amounts of glee in the hearts of children. As Chicago bared down for its latest snowpacolypse, our public school system shut down for the first time in a few years, my daughter’s after-school playdate stretched into a sleepover, and I was just grateful to have a job that lets me work from home if I need to (unlike my husband, who headed out in a pre-dawn Lyft). My son spent the day angling for sledding excursions, but for my daughter and her friend, something a little more crafty was in order. Some of their friends had been dyeing their hair with Kool-Aid, which seemed to be a fun, nontoxic, relatively semi-permanent way to amp up your middle-school hairstyle. And the girls both have long, extremely thick, wonderful hair: My daughter—a mysterious buttery blonde, as my husband and I are both dark-haired—and her adorable brunette pal. It wasn’t difficult to find a multitude of YouTube videos and online illustrations regarding the process: I chose to use Kool-Aid liquid instead of packets, thinking it would be easier to mix. Unfortunately, the blue on one of the bottles fooled me, as it was actually red for tropical punch. Pro-tip: Go for blue raspberry if you want blue hair. So we stuck with grape, the flavor/color of purple. My whole house smells like grape right now. We boiled some water and added it to the Kool-Aid syrup in a little bowl. We then put the dissolved Kool-Aid in coffee cups for easier hair dipping. The next step was to section off the girls’ hair into ponytails, measuring how far in they wanted to dip the hair, from tips to ends. My daughter went pretty far in, a few inches. Then they had to stay like that, 10 minutes per side, to let the Kool-Aid set. Welcome to the inconvenience of beauty treatments, girls. Once the 10 minutes were up, I dried them off as much as possible with clean rags and paper towels, to avoid the distinct possibility of dyeing the entire house purple. We then pulled out the hair dryer, and viewed the results after drying. The eventual revelation was much more exciting for one head of hair than the other. As I once spent an entire seventh-grade sleepover wrestling with some henna that had literally no ultimate effect, I told the brunette in the room that I could sadly relate. Maybe a lighter color would have worked better. Stupid blue. But my daughter was pretty excited, as it’s the most she’s ever changed her appearance outside of a haircut. I’m willing to give it a try myself: Kool-Aid is considerably cheaper than my pricey highlights. Overall, Kool-Aid hair dye worked pretty well for a snow-day activity; for us non-sledding types, the view from inside was imminently preferable. You will need: preferred bottle of Kool-Aid liquid for color boiling water (about 2 cups) small bowl hair elastics coffee or styrofoam cups for hair dipping A mega-ton of clean rags and paper towels blow-dryer Dissolve liquid in boiling water in small bowl, then pour into coffee cups. Separate hair into two low ponytails, and dip into cup, 10 minutes per side for thick hair. Then pat dry as quickly as possible, following up with hair dryer. You can eventually follow up with shampoo (to get the stickiness out) but the color should hopefully last at least for a few shampoo rounds.","Snow day: The two words that strike terror in the hearts of parents and equal amounts of glee in the hearts of children.

"Brett Clarkson, Doug Phillips","The regenerated Tropical Storm Kirk is one of those sequels nobody really wanted or asked for (see: Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 or Deuce Bigelow: European Gigolo). The second installment of Kirk, resurrected Wednesday from the first Kirks remnants, was continuing to trek west toward the Caribbean at a decent clip, although not quite as fast as earlier in the week. Kirks top wind speeds had gone up by about 15 mph on Wednesday, from 45 mph in the morning to 60 mph in the afternoon, bringing Kirk closer to hurricane status, according to the National Hurricane Center. The minimum threshold for hurricanes is winds measuring 74 mph. A tropical storm warning, meaning that tropical storm conditions were likely over the next 36 hours, was in effect for islands along the eastern wall of the Caribbean including Barbados, St. Lucia, Dominica, Martinique and Guadaloupe. Kirk is about 1,800 miles southeast of South Florida and poses no immediate threat to our area. The storm is expected to be over the Lesser Antilles on Thursday afternoon. The Lesser Antilles are the arc-shaped line of islands that comprise form the eastern boundary of the Caribbean, separating the Caribbean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean. Watchers of the Atlantic tropics might recall that the short-lived first version of Tropical Storm Kirk weakened to a depression on Sunday before fizzling into a blob of clouds and storms by Monday. But regardless of whether or not Kirk intensifies further this time or remains a tropical storm, forecasters say the conditions up ahead in its path will not be amenable to the its long-term survival. Why? Wind shear. Shear, which refers to varying wind speeds in the atmosphere, is bad for tropical systems because it can weaken or kill them. Strong westerly shear is likely to continue to adversely affect Kirk while it moves over the Caribbean, and the system should weaken into a depression within 72 hours or sooner, and become a remnant low later in the forecast period, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. As of 2 p.m. Wednesday, Tropical Storm Kirk was spinning to the west at 18 mph about 300 miles east of Barbados. Meanwhile, an area of low pressure about 100 miles off North Carolina no longer has a chance of becoming a tropical depression, forecasters said. Finally, Post-Tropical Cyclone Leslie, in the central Atlantic a few hundred miles southwest of Portugals Azores Islands, has a 90 percent chance of becoming organized again over the next five days. brettclarkson@sun-sentinel.com or Twitter @BrettClarkson_","Sun Sentinel Tropical Storm Kirk, with winds up to 60 mph, is the sequel nobody wanted Sun Sentinel The regenerated Tropical Storm Kirk is one of those sequels nobody really wanted or asked for (see: “Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2” or “Deuce Bigelow: European Gigolo…",2018-09-26T19:04:49Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Sun-sentinel.com'}","Tropical Storm Kirk, with winds up to 60 mph, is the sequel nobody wanted - Sun Sentinel",http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/weather/fl-ne-kirk-comeback-atlantic-tropics-20180925-story.html,http://www.trbimg.com/img-5bac403c/turbine/fl-ne-kirk-comeback-atlantic-tropics-20180925,,Sun-sentinel.com,tropical,1
Hunter Ingram StarNews Staff,"The system near Bermuda probably won't develop into much, but jury still out on disturbance making its way toward the Caribbean WILMINGTON -- Storms are brewing in the Atlantic, but there is not cause for alarm just yet. Two systems are churning in the warm waters of the Atlantic, the closest of which is between Bermuda and the East Coast. But the system only has a 30 percent chance of forming into a tropical cyclone, according to the National Hurricane Center. Despite its relatively close proximity to the East Coast, Dave Loewenthal, meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Wilmington office, said there isn’t much risk to Southeastern North Carolina. “It probably won’t develop enough to affect us,” he said. “It is not even expected to generate waves for us.” The region has seen more people caught in rip currents in recent days, but Loewenthal said that is due to the high number of people in the water for the Fourth of July holiday and not weather related. The second system developing in the Atlantic has a much greater chance of formation. Located farther southeast, roughly midway between Africa and the Caribbean, the tropical wave has a 70 percent chance of formation in the next few days. What impact, if any, the region could see from the system is still too far out to gauge, Loewenthal said. “It’s way out there, so we’ll have to wait and see,” he said. “It will be another five to six days to see if it keep on coming across the ocean.” Even if Southeastern N.C. isn’t in its path, Loewenthal said the conditions are favorable for it to strengthen. Moving into the rest of the weekend, the region will remain in the mid-to-upper 80s, with a good chance of afternoon showers through Sunday.

Chris Hockman,"Redevelopment poses a threat to several islands. After seemingly fading away, Tropical Storm Kirk has redeveloped in the Caribbean and will pose a threat to several islands in the sea, reports the Weather Channel. The storm has emerged again to the east of the Lesser Antilles and will bring heavy rain and winds to the islands. Those conditions will lead to flooding and mudslides in several areas, which will mean that thousands may need to be evacuated. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued advisories for Barbados, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, Martinique, Dominica, and Guadeloupe. Three others were advised that conditions were possible in Barbuda, St. Croix, and San Jan, Puerto Rico. As is often the case with a new storm, the U.S. Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters will fly through the storm, expected to do so at some point today. That move will help the NHC get a better handle on the storm itself and allow it to make better projections about what could happen with the storm. On Monday, the storm broke up after Kirk lost its center circulation in the middle of the Atlantic after starting in Africa. But in the first half of this week, the storm regained strength, got a center, and is now moving quickly, starting Wednesday about 300 miles east-southeast and moving west. The remnants of #Kirk are producing tropical-storm-force winds as the system moves quickly westward across the tropical Atlantic, and could reacquire tropical cyclone status during the next few days. pic.twitter.com/S5ZXLdIE83 — National Hurricane Center (@NHC_Atlantic) September 24, 2018 These countries will be expecting tropical storm-force winds of over 39 MPH in the next three days. Currently, the forecast and projection aren’t certain, and more will be gathered from the fly through of the Hurricane Hunters as the NHC is expecting to get a better picture of where the center of the storm is. The forecast has the storm hitting the Windward Islands, starting with Barbados on Thursday, then weakening as it makes its way through the islands. There is a significant chance that the storm could grow in intensity before it strikes Barbados, now forecast to be at a speed of 50 MPH. Kirk’s big threat to the area will be rain, with rainfall totals as high as 10 inches possible from Barbados to as far as Guadeloupe. Rain will likely bring flooding to the area, which has produced devastation in the Carolinas. It will be especially bad in these regions as it will also bring mudslides in many parts of the islands. Fortunately for residents of the Windward Islands, the storm will experience wind shear which will either change the direction of the storm or lower its wind speed.","The Inquisitr Tropical Storm Kirk Resurfaces, Poses Threat To Caribbean Islands The Inquisitr After seemingly fading away, Tropical Storm Kirk has redeveloped in the Caribbean and will pose a threat to several islands in the sea, reports the Weather Channel. …",2018-09-26T17:49:03Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Inquisitr.com'}","Tropical Storm Kirk Resurfaces, Poses Threat To Caribbean Islands - The Inquisitr",https://www.inquisitr.com/5089960/tropical-storm-kirk-resurfaces-poses-threat-to-caribbean-islands/,https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Barbados-storm.jpg,,Inquisitr.com,tropical,1
