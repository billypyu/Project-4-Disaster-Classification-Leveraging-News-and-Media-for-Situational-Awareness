BRAD PLUMER,"The Battery area of Charleston, S.C., after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. Companies are seeking better climate forecasts to assess the risks of operating in the area. Credit Sean Rayford for The New York Times In Charleston, S.C., where the ports have been expanding to accommodate larger ships sailing through the newly widened Panama Canal, a real-estate developer named Xebec Realty recently went looking for land to build new warehouses and logistics centers. But first, Xebec had a question: What were the odds that the sites it was considering might be underwater in 10 or 20 years? After all, Charleston has repeatedly suffered major floods that can paralyze cargo operations. And scientists warn that flooding will worsen as sea levels rise and storms strengthen with climate change. Yet detailed information about the city’s climate risks proved surprisingly hard to find. Federal flood maps are based on historical data, and won’t tell you how sea-level rise could exacerbate flooding in the years ahead. Scientific reports on global warming, such as the National Climate Assessment, can tell you that heavy rainstorms are expected to increase in the Southeast, but they won’t tell you whether specific roads leading to a given warehouse might be unusable during those storms. So Xebec turned to a Silicon Valley start-up called Jupiter, which offered to analyze local weather and hydrological data and combine it with climate model projections to assess the potential climate risks Xebec might face in Charleston over the next few decades from things like heavier rainfall, sea level rise or increased storm surge. Although Jupiter’s forecasting skill remains unproven, Xebec was eager to participate in a pilot project. “If we could have reliable predictive analytics in this area, that’s a huge impact for our business,” said Scott Hodgkins, an executive vice president at Xebec. As companies around the world grow concerned about the risks of climate change, they have started looking for clarity on how warming might disrupt their operations in the future. But governments in the United States and Europe have been slow to translate academic research on global warming into practical, timely advice for businesses or local city planners. Now some private companies, like Jupiter, are trying to fill the gap. This remains a young and untested field, and it’s unclear whether Jupiter or others can succeed as profitable enterprises. Scientists caution that predicting short-term climate effects in specific locations remains rife with uncertainty. Jupiter will have to persuade potential customers that its forecasts are reliable enough to give companies a competitive edge. “In economics, information has value if you would make a different decision based on that information,” said Matthew E. Kahn, an economist who studies climate adaptation at the University of Southern California. “Is that the case here?” Some insurance companies, such as FM Global, already study climate risks and consult with clients on how to make their buildings more resilient to hurricanes that may get stronger in the future. In 2014, a start-up called Coastal Risk Consulting opened in South Florida to offer flood assessments to homeowners nervous about rising seas. Jupiter, founded in 2017 by Rich Sorkin, a longtime tech entrepreneur, wants to go a step further. The start-up has received $10 million in venture capital so far and has been hiring climate scientists, weather modelers and data experts from places like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Its co-founders include Todd D. Stern, the lead climate envoy in the Obama administration, and Jeff Wecker, the chief data officer for Goldman Sachs. The company is developing a variety of predictive tools, some of which look much like Google Maps, that it hopes will allow paying customers to zoom down to the city block level to get a better sense of the potential risks they face from storms, heat waves, wildfires or other climate-change effects in the coming decades.

Credit Jupiter Intel “We know the planet’s getting warmer and sea levels are rising, but on a hyperlocal basis, the quality of those predictions can be much better than it is,” Mr. Sorkin said. To create its flood maps, for instance, Jupiter looks not just at public data like satellite-based observations of rainfall and ocean currents, but also how changes in the urban landscape affect how water flows through cities. It then aims to harness recent advances in cloud-based supercomputing to combine that data with the latest climate model projections. The company’s scientists plan to continually test their forecasts against observations — to see, for instance, how well they predict flooding from major storms — and publish their research in scientific journals. In theory, the United States government could cobble much of this information together and present it in a usable way. But federal agencies tend to focus their resources on shorter-term weather predictions, and Congress has generally underfunded initiatives such as those at the Federal Emergency Management Agency to incorporate climate change into its federal flood maps. “If you want a full picture of flooding risk, you need expertise in weather, but also climate and hydrology and engineering and running complex models on the latest computer hardware,” Mr. Sorkin said. “All of those specialized disciplines are usually heavily siloed within the public sector or the scientific community.” Jupiter’s scientists will have to grapple with a number of technical challenges. While current climate models can provide broad statistical projections of how average temperatures and rainfall patterns are likely to shift across large regions over the coming century, it remains difficult to predict such shifts precisely over shorter time scales — which is what companies are often most concerned about. “Forecasting at 10-20 year time periods is perhaps the most difficult period to forecast,” Simon Mason, a climate scientist at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society who is not involved with Jupiter, wrote in an email. “If that is not enough, trying to predict severe weather events rather than long-term averages is even harder still!” Past efforts to provide what are known as “climate services” have struggled with this issue. In 2009, the German government established the Climate Service Center to provide information about global warming risks to cities and businesses. But Guy P. Brasseur, a climate scientist who helped start the center, said potential clients were often disappointed with the uncertainty in the resulting forecasts. “One airline wanted to know how often the airport in Frankfurt would be closed because of snowstorms next year,” Dr. Brasseur said. “We were unable to answer a question like that.” Jupiter, which acknowledges the uncertainties in climate forecasting, will have to prove that a market exists. But at least one firm in the insurance industry sees potential value in the company’s approach, particularly after flooding and other disasters caused $306 billion in damages last year in the United States and record losses by insurers. “That certainly raised the stakes in terms of trying to get the best possible science on your side when you’re pricing risk,” said John Drzik, president of global risk at Marsh, one of the world’s largest commercial insurance brokers, which is currently in talks with Jupiter to explore what types of data and risk analyses might be most useful to its clients. Mr. Drzik noted that many of the traditional catastrophic risk models used by the insurance industry are rooted largely in historical data and don’t always grapple fully with how climate change could shift those risks in the future. While his company is still evaluating whether Jupiter’s climate-oriented models are useful enough to be worth paying for, “it grabbed us as something that had a lot of promise.” As global warming advances, experts say that governments will ultimately have to invest more in their own local climate prediction tools to help cities and industries adapt. But they also see a role for private climate forecasters, much as weather companies have sprung up to supplement the work the National Weather Service does. “The federal government could be doing a lot more,” said James L. Buizer, who studies climate adaptation at the University of Arizona. “But there’s still an important role for the private sector. If companies are going to benefit from this information, they ought to be paying for it. After all, it’s their infrastructure that’s going to get trashed.”","The Battery area of Charleston, S.C., after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016.

Fair Bluff, N.C., a small town on the banks of the Lumber River, has been turned upside down by a succession of once in a lifetime storms. It was devastated by Hurricane Florence less than a month ago, having never fully recovered from Hurricane Matthew in 2016, and the new storms predicted path will take it within 100 miles of town.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"Waterways across the Carolinas and beyond swelled to record-breaking levels this week, with several rising more than 20 feet above their averages, according to National Weather Service data. The Cape Fear and Lumber Rivers were forecast to rise as high or even higher than they did during Hurricane Matthew in 2016, North Carolina officials said. Christian Dreyer has seen this kind of flooding before, and he knows that the worst is yet to come. As a volunteer member of a New Jersey search-and-rescue team, he helped pull people from rushing floodwaters in this part of North Carolina after Hurricane Matthew. Now he’s back with the same group, New Jersey Task Force 1, helping rescue people from their flooded homes in Washington, N.C., just north of New Bern. The crew got some people out in vehicles, but in other cases, they had to drive boats up to their front doors. The flooding right now is caused mostly by storm surge, as the swollen ocean pushes rivers over their banks. It’s slow moving, Mr. Dreyer said, especially compared to the rushing floodwaters that will soon come from the opposite direction, down the rivers, as up to 40 inches of rain falls inland. “A surge is like a bathtub flooding,” said Mr. Dreyer, who is also a sergeant first class with the New Jersey State Police, as tornado warnings went off in the background. “When it comes down from the mountains, it’s all gravity. It’s going to be much faster and more dangerous.” Several deaths have been reported Continue reading the main story","Fierce rains were likely to produce “catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding,” the National Hurricane Center said.",2018-09-15T09:45:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Hurricane Florence Live Updates: Heavy Rains Drenching the Carolinas,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/15/us/hurricane-florence-path.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/11/us/hurricane-florence-tracking-map-promo-1536673849664/hurricane-florence-tracking-map-promo-1536673849664-facebookJumbo-v33.png,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Victoria Rodriguez,"Hurricane Michael was one of the most powerful hurricanes to hit the continental U.S. in almost 50 years, according to the Associated Press. The hurricane made landfall in Mexico Beach, Florida, as a Category 4 storm on Wednesday and then weakened as it moved through Georgia. Now designated a tropical storm, Michael is headed toward North and South Carolina, which were both recently devastated by Hurricane Florence. SEE ALSO: Photos show widespread destruction in the aftermath of Hurricane Michael Although the full scope of the damage is still being evaluated, preliminary reports have included power outages, uprooted trees, flooding, and demolished homes. At least six people have died as a result of the hurricane. CoreLogic, a financial data company, estimates insured storm losses could reach $4.5 billion. Recovery work has started in Florida, so if you'd like to help the survivors there and in Georgia, here's our list of ways you can provide support: 1. Donate to disaster-relief organizations. The nonprofit Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities, compiled a list of organizations providing general aid and relief, as well as food, shelter, medical care, and other necessities. If you want to ensure that your donation goes directly to Hurricane Michael relief, check first with the nonprofit about how they earmark financial gifts. Here are the organizations listed by Charity Navigator: GlobalGiving, International Relief Teams, International Medical Corps, Save the Children, Direct Relief, American Kidney Fund, DonorsChoose.org, World Help, American Red Cross, LeSea Global Feed the Hungry, SBP, Americares, Good360, World Hope International, First Book, Christian Relief Fund, World Vision, Matthew 25: Ministries, Heart to Heart International, Catholic Charities Diocese of St. Petersburg, Big Cat Rescue, Feeding the Gulf Coast, and Feeding Tampa Bay. Though not featured on Charity Navigator's list, Habitat for Humanity is taking donations to carry out their recovery plan following the storm. Portlight Inclusive Disaster Strategies, which receives donations, is working to assist people with disabilities, older adults, and other people with access and functional needs. 2. Help provide emergency supplies. Several of the above organizations are focused on meeting the urgent need for food, water, clothing, and shelter. World Vision, a Christian humanitarian organization, is delivering supplies, such as food, hygiene kits, clean water, blankets, diapers, and other personal care items to those affected and displaced by Hurricane Michael. You can donate here. Global Giving, an international crowdfunding community that supports local nonprofits, launched a Hurricane Michael relief fund to provide emergency supplies as well as long-term assistance. 3. Donate to GoFundMe campaigns. GoFundMe has created a general relief fund to raise $50,000. The funds will be managed by The Direct Impact Fund, an independent nonprofit that distributes funds to verified campaigns and aid organizations. GoFundMe has also created a hub for verified individual campaigns related to Michael. If you're looking for additional resources on how to assess nonprofits and their work providing relief aid, consider consulting Charity Navigator or other charity watchdogs, like GuideStar, Charity Watch, and BBB Wise Giving Alliance.","Hurricane Michael was one of the most powerful hurricanes to hit the continental U.S. in almost 50 years, according to the Associated Press.

ALAN BLINDER,"A spokesman for the House Speaker, Tim Moore, did not respond to messages seeking comment. Mr. Moore, a Republican who has toured disaster areas in recent weeks, has said that lawmakers were prepared to ensure that relief money actually gets out to where its supposed to be a sign that Raleigh was already raw with hurricane politics even before Florence. Mr. Coopers administration has faced heavy pressure, and no small amount of outrage, over how it managed the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, which struck in 2016. Frustrated Republicans set up a special legislative subcommittee in August to conduct further examination of the issues concerning the administration and management of Hurricane Matthew recovery efforts. Democrats, furious, saw the move as a nakedly partisan attack on Mr. Cooper, who did not take office until nearly three months after the storm ravaged the state. It is my hope that the executive branch has learned some lessons from how things were handled in the aftermath of Matthew, Mr. Berger, the Senate leader, said. A lot of the difficulties weve had with the executive branch have been differences of philosophy. It is my hope that we all share the same philosophy with reference to trying to get peoples lives back to normal. South Carolina, the other state hardest hit by Florence, is almost guaranteed to have an easier time politically with its recovery efforts. Gov. Henry McMaster and the lawmakers who control the State Legislature are all Republicans and do not seem to wake up each morning with their knives already sharpened, as their counterparts appear to in Raleigh. Mr. McMaster is on the November ballot, but Mr. Coopers term in North Carolina runs another two years, and there are few marquee state races this year. The main prizes at stake in November are the supermajorities the Republicans hope to retain in the Legislative Building.","Political leaders say they hope for a cooperative effort on storm relief measures, but there are already signs of tooth-and-claw partisanship rearing up again.",2018-09-29T13:19:29Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Florence Silenced North Carolina’s Political Rancor.

Patrick Rucker,"FAIR BLUFF, N.C. (Reuters) - When Hurricane Matthew submerged the small town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, two years ago, Eve Waddell thought she had witnessed a once-in-a-lifetime disaster. “You’ll never see that again,” she reassured her daughter Ella, then 4, after floodwaters surged over the banks of the Lumber River, inundating Fair Bluff with several feet of water and damaging her house. As Hurricane Florence barreled toward the state on Wednesday, Waddell packed up her family to seek shelter with relatives and said she was ready to leave town for good - just as many businesses and hundreds of residents did after Matthew in 2016. “This old town’s had it,” said her husband, Anthony Spivey, the police chief in a nearby municipality. Meteorologists warn the menacing storm could stall out over the Carolinas, dumping enormous amounts of rainfall and creating massive flooding. That was the case with Matthew, a less powerful hurricane that did most of its damage inland, producing catastrophic levels of flooding throughout low-lying eastern North Carolina and causing billions of dollars in damages. Rural, low-income communities like Fair Bluff - already beset by economic difficulties - were hardest hit and remain most at risk this week. Approximately 125 miles (200 km) south of Raleigh, Fair Bluff is 38 percent white and 60 percent African-American, with a median household income of $17,000, according to state figures. Its downtown district has been a virtual ghost town since Matthew, with a dozen empty storefronts still bearing the marks of the storm’s fury. A grimy scar cuts across retail windows, marking the height of the flooding. In a furniture shop, neatly arranged bedroom sets moldered; an abandoned hardware store was still stocked with ovens, washing machines and refrigerators. Before the storm, Fair Bluff had nearly 1,000 residents, said Al Leonard, the town’s part-time administrator. He estimated more than a quarter left and have not returned since Matthew. “We base our calendar on B.C. or A.D.,” Leonard said. “In Fair Bluff, they base their calendar on Before Matthew and After Matthew. Matthew changed everything.” Eve Waddell, daughter Ella, 6, and her husband, acting police chief of Chadbourn, North Carolina, Anthony Spivey, take stock out in the backyard of their home ahead of Hurricane Florence in Fair Bluff, North Carolina, U.S., September 12, 2018. REUTERS/Patrick Rucker RURAL DEVASTATION Other rural communities around the state’s eastern half tell a similar story. Lumberton, a larger nearby town of approximately 21,000 people along the Lumber River, saw nearly 900 homes severely damaged by Matthew, including hundreds of low-income renters who lost their residences, according to a state report. In Princeville, known as the oldest community settled by freed slaves in the United States, hundreds of homes were severely damaged by flooding from the Tar River. The agricultural community of Goldsboro, along the Neuse River, saw hundreds of homes and substantial livestock destroyed. Many low-income communities were already buffeted by a decline in manufacturing and agriculture, as well as the aftermath of the 2007-09 recession, according to Barry Ryan, vice president of the nonprofit NC Rural Center, which helps support rural counties. “These communities are aging rapidly,” he said. “There’s been a general market downturn - somewhat driven by population loss, somewhat driven by economic restructuring.” Jeff Axelberg, a member of Fair Bluff’s Chamber of Commerce who markets sweet potatoes, said the farmers he works with are worried because Florence is arriving so early in the season, with only about 10 percent of the crop in. “They’re working day and night to get what they can out of the ground,” he said. Long-term solutions are elusive. Some in town have suggested recruiting a canoe operator or other tourist draw to Fair Bluff, turning the river from a liability into an opportunity, Axelberg said. Residents and business owners have often found it challenging to navigate state and federal bureaucracies in search of recovery and repair funds. In many communities, homeowners are only now starting to receive money through the state’s hazard mitigation grant program to sell, elevate or rebuild their homes. The smallest towns are also hamstrung by a lack of administrative capacity. Leonard, Fair Bluff’s administrator, also serves as the town’s water system supervisor, town planner and budget director. He spends one day per week in Fair Bluff because he also holds the position of town administrator for four other nearby municipalities. On Wednesday, he watched as laborers laid brick for a police office extension off the back of Fair Bluff’s town hall, which officials moved to just outside the flood zone after Matthew. “Last time, this was high ground,” Leonard said. “We’ll just have to wait and see.” Reporting by Patrick Rucker in Fair Bluff, North Carolina; Additional reporting and writing by Joseph Ax in New York; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Lisa Shumaker","When Hurricane Matthew submerged the small town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, two years ago, Eve Waddell thought she had witnessed a once-in-a-lifetime disaster.",2018-09-12T23:55:42Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Looming Florence heaps despair on rural U.S. towns ravaged by 2016 storm,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-florence-rural/looming-florence-heaps-despair-on-rural-u-s-towns-ravaged-by-2016-storm-idUSKCN1LS398,https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180912&t=2&i=1303730513&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEE8B2B9,reuters,Reuters,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","When Hurricane Michael flattened entire communities in the Florida Panhandle last fall, most Americans and media outlets responded with an appropriate level of horror and empathy. A few, however, engaged in a pretty ugly form of victim-blaming; observing that the conservative districts that suffered damage voted for politicians who deny climate sciencethe implication being these Americans got what was coming.
At the time, Earther called out this sort of victim shaming as wrong and counterproductive. But we didnt have much evidence for how widespread such attitudes are. Now, a social scientist to whom we posed that question last October has gone and taken a first stab at answering it, and the result is both alarming and unsurprising: A lot of people think this way.
As scientists warnings about climate change become increasingly dire, our conversations about

In fact, roughly a third of Americans who understand that climate change is real and driven by human activities agree with the idea that climate deniers get what they deserve when disasters strike their communities, according to the new research, which hasnt yet been peer-reviewed.
 We were not too surprised though we are a bit disappointed, Matthew Motta, a postdoctoral researcher studying science communication at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author on the study, told Earther.
Motta and his colleagues from Washington University in St. Louis and Emory University used an online survey tool to poll 4,056 individuals. Respondents were first asked to identify their political leanings on a 7-point scale. The poll then asked whether they think climate change is real and human-driven. Those who answered yes were asked whether they agree with the sentiment that people who dont believe in climate change get what they deserve when natural disasters strike.
Of the 54 percent of respondents who were on board with the scientific consensusa fraction that tracks other national surveys but is a bit lower than one published last weekthe authors found that more than a third think climate deniers are getting their due when a hurricane flattens their town or a wildfire engulfs their city. Nearly 70 percent of these victim-blamers identified as Democrats, with more ideologically liberal respondents tending to dish the blame more. 
 While previous research has shown that people who hold strongly partisan views tend to dislike the other side more, this finding takes things a disturbing step further. As the authors put it, a substantial number of Americans are wishing, or at least accepting, physical harm as a sort of political retribution. And lest any right-of-center readers see this as vindication that the libs are a bunch of assholes, Motta pointed out that this sort of victim blaming likely isnt limited to Democrats. 
I think it would go the other way as well, he told Earther, citing violent crime as a potential issue that might engender ill will from conservatives if, for instance, the victim was opposed to carrying weapons. Thats a hypothesis he and his colleagues are planning to explore in future work, but one need look no further than Trumps awful tweets on Californias wildfires for evidence that partisan victim blaming is bi-directional.
While the findings should be taken with a grain of salt until the study is published in a peer-reviewed journal, if the truth is anywhere close to these survey results, its bad news. Not only is it deeply shitty to spit on others suffering, blaming people for their misery is, in Mottas extremely evenhanded assessment, not a solid science communication strategy. Communications experts often cite discussing shared values and common ground as effective strategies when talking about climate change with a skeptical audience. Shaming people for their beliefs is kind of the opposite.
Theres also the reality that those who suffer most from natural disasters generally have the least power to effect change in our global fossil fuel-driven energy system. With only a handful of years left to rein in the worst consequences of a warming climate, the only people we should be shaming are the oneswho got usinto this mess in the first place.","When Hurricane Michael flattened entire communities in the Florida Panhandle last fall, most Americans and media outlets responded with an appropriate level of horror and empathy.

KENDRA PIERRE-LOUIS,"The remains of a house in Perryville, Mo., after a tornado. Credit Jon Durr/Getty Images Extreme weather events caused a total of $306 billion in damage in the United States last year, making 2017 the most expensive year on record for natural disasters in the country, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday. A trio of major hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, contributed hundreds of billions to the total. But the year was seemingly mired in disaster, from a freeze in the Southeast that damaged fruit crops in March, to hail storms that whipped across Colorado, Oklahoma and other central states in May, to the tornadoes that struck the Midwest in June. Unusual consequences of extreme weather could be found all over the map. Thirteen cows died in a field in Pennington County, S.D., after ingesting anthrax spores from the soil; they had changed their grazing patterns during a drought that lasted much of the year in South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana. The cows’ demise was a small part of the $2.5 billion of damage that struck the three states. In all, there were 16 natural disasters that caused more than $1 billion of damage in 2017. In 1980, when NOAA first started tallying records, there were three, adjusted for inflation. Scientists cannot always say with certainty that a given natural disaster was influenced by climate change. But some may be related to warming, and the contiguous United States experienced its third-warmest year on record in 2017. The temperature average was 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average, said Jake Crouch, a climate scientist from NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center. Here are the 16 billion-dollar disasters from 2017: Some made headlines for weeks, and some were simply overtaken in the public’s consciousness by the next one.

In 1999, the Grid was inundated by river flooding after Hurricane Floyd, and Mr. Swank wanted none of it. He and his girlfriend were going to his sister’s house for a while. “She lives over behind the Cracker Barrel, not near any water,” he said. “We don’t want to be stuck here.” Worries were running equally high in inland South Carolina. Fifteen miles northwest of the gaudy spectacle of Myrtle Beach sits the quiet county seat of Conway, a nearly 290-year-old town shaded by live oaks and straddling the Waccamaw River. Time and again — in Hurricanes Floyd and Matthew, to name just two occasions — Myrtle Beach has been spared the worst damage, while Conway has taken a heavy hit: flash floods with the storm itself, then river floods in the days that followed. “The water collects really quickly, and people think that’s the flooding, but it’s flash flooding,” said Le Hendricks, the Conway fire chief. “That goes down pretty quick, and then they think they’re free. B ut then what happens is, the Waccamaw River gets backed up.” Chief Hendricks described a kind of hydrological traffic jam: Water trying to leave the Waccamaw meets flooded waterways and a surging ocean at capacity. The river has nowhere to go but over its banks, onto highways and roads and into people’s homes. This kind of flooding might not happen at its worst until two days after the hurricane hits, but when it does, the water can sit for weeks. Meanwhile, places on the coast might have already begun rebuilding from any damage wrought by the winds and the initial surge. “Myrtle Beach, they did fairly will during Matthew,” Chief Hendricks said. “They had damage but were back up and running within a couple of days.” Conway, at first, thought it had dodged a bullet, as well, he said. “But it was the flooding. And it took about 18 days for us to get back out of that.”","The storm surge in the Carolinas could be deadly.

JAMES ESTRIN,"Haiti, beset by natural disasters, a lack of infrastructure and poor sanitation, has had a more difficult path. When Hurricane Matthew hit Haiti, Ms. Bruce covered it as spot news for the National Geographic’s website, including documenting its effect on sanitation and the availability of indoor toilets for her project. She also photographed the people she sees as the “unsung heroes of sanitation in Haiti,” the “bayakou” who often strip down and climb into pit latrines to clean them out. By hand. “They only work at night because people throw rocks at them, and even their family members often don’t know what they do,” she said. “They’re like masked superheroes.” India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi campaigned on ending the unsanitary practice and set a deadline for Gandhi’s 150th birthday in October of next year. He has set aside more than $40 billion to build latrines and toilets and change public behavior. But in a country the size of India, with its large and sluggish bureaucracy, Ms. Bruce said, that ambitious target may not be met.","Four women in New Delhi wait for the one working stall to open for use.

"Nicole Chavez, CNN","(CNN) Water appears to have receded in some areas of the Carolinas, but more flooding from Hurricane Florence could arrive through the weekend, officials say. More than a dozen rivers in North and South Carolina already have overflowed their banks and the water -- particularly the Waccamaw River, which spans both states -- is expected to swell putting additional residents in harm's way. Officers were going door-to-door along the river in Brunswick County, North Carolina encouraging residents to evacuate. President Donald Trump met with first responders in Conway, South Carolina on Wednesday and warned them of the danger of rising rivers. ""It's going to get rough for South Carolina,"" he told them. ""You're going to have a rebuilding process, and we are behind you from day one,"" Trump said, calling this the ""calm before the storm, because you're going to have a lot of water."" Conway's city spokesman Taylor Newell said water could be ""4 feet higher"" there than when Hurricane Matthew struck in 2016. In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents to ""stay alert"" as water rises. ""People in flood prone areas or near waterways need to remain alert as rivers crest and stay above their banks in coming days,"" Cooper said. Bodies of women trapped in flooded police van recovered There are still unanswered questions surrounding the deaths of two mental health patients who drowned Tuesday in a prison transport van swept away by rising floodwater in South Carolina. The victims, whose bodies were recovered by divers on Wednesday, were identified as Windy Newton, 45, and Nicolette Green, 43, the Horry County Sheriff's Office said. The women were being transported by sheriff's deputies from a hospital in Loris and from the Waccamaw Center for Mental Health in Conway to McLeod Health Darlington, CNN affiliate WPDE reported. The two deputies escaped the vehicle but were unable to open the doors to get the women out, authorities said. They have been placed on administrative leave, the sheriff's office said. ""We are sorry,"" Horry County Sheriff Phillip Thompson told reporters Wednesday. ""We take a lot of pride in what we do. We work hard to protect and to serve our citizens. We are just very sorry that this event has taken place."" The investigation has been handed over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and the sheriff's office has launched an internal investigation, officials said. The women are among at least 36 people who have died because of the storm. Thousands remain in shelters More than 8,100 people are taking refuge at dozens of shelters across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, according to the Red Cross. Of those, approximately 7,800 are in shelters in North Carolina. Some residents are waiting until the floodwater recedes from their homes. Others can't get to their neighborhoods because the extensive road closures or simply because they don't have a ride home. And some who went home have returned after finding out they don't have power, CNN affiliate WRAL reported. Roads have been so impassable in Kinston, North Carolina, the National Guard has used helicopters to distribute water. In Conway, South Carolina some residents were heading home Wednesday but only to collect their belongings and evacuate again after officials say more flooding could be on the way. ""We are cautioning everyone not to be overconfident,"" City Administrator Adam Emrick said. ""The water is going to come back up. We are worried about Friday."" Chris Ross has been staying at a shelter since he fled his Fayetteville home about a week ago when the National Guard pulled people out of his neighborhood. ""People can only take so much,"" Ross told WRAL. ""It's wearing on a lot of people here, trying to keep their sanity together."" Even after farmers moved thousands of animals to higher ground ahead of the storm, many have suffered losses. North Carolina farms lost an estimated 3.4 million poultry birds and 5,500 pigs, the state Department of Agriculture &amp; Consumer Services said. Allison Cavenaugh and her husband, who own a home and a poultry farm with 80,000 chickens in Wallace, North Carolina, returned home for the first time this week on a boat just to find out that their chickens have drowned. ""It's all gone,"" Cavenaugh told WRAL. North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler, who conducted an aerial survey of damage on Tuesday, said the flooding has affected the top six agricultural counties in the state. ""This was an unprecedented storm with flooding expected to exceed that from any other storms in recent memory,"" Troxler said in a statement. ""The footprint of flooding from this storm covers much of the same area hit by flooding from Hurricane Matthew in 2016, which only worsens the burden on these farmers."" In South Carolina, farmers face damage to cotton, peanut and hemp crops, the state said. CNN's Jay Croft, Steve Almasy, Amanda Watts, Andrea Diaz and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","Water appears to have receded in some areas of the Carolinas, but more flooding from Hurricane Florence could arrive through the weekend, officials say.",2018-09-20T10:32:45Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",The Carolinas brace for even more flooding,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/20/us/florence-aftermath-wxc/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180919164431-little-pee-dee-river-south-carolina-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"JACK HEALY, RICHARD FAUSSET and CAMPBELL ROBERTSON","But the mind-set seemed to have fully changed. Local officials used to regard hurricane response as something akin to major snow removal: sporadic events that therefore warranted relatively little investment. “Two years of these types of storms have really made us look internally at our own preparation,” Mr. Sears said. “Now that we have a better understanding of where people may be at risk, we can better stage assets in that area.” “Matthew got me once, Florence got me twice,” Mr. Sears said Tuesday, recounting what he told the City Council this week. “The next hurricane won’t get me.” Closer to the coast, in Conway, S.C., a few miles northwest of Myrtle Beach, the weariness with the cycle of worry, flood, repeat was palpable. “I grew up here,” said Matt Bruton, 34, a moving and storage business operator, who was hanging out Tuesday in his single-story brick home in Old Sherwood Country Club, an eclectic neighborhood of old and new houses north of the Waccamaw River. The waters had already risen through neighboring Crabtree Swamp to a level higher than residents had ever seen. “We had a record flood during Floyd in ’99, and it wasn’t this high,” Mr. Bruton said. “The hundred-year flood they called it the last time, and here we are again. I’d like to put my house in a different, higher place, but I call this the best neighborhood in Conway.

Emily Rosko,"Emily Rosko's most recent poetry collection is ""Weather Inventions"" (University of Akron Press, 2018). She is associate professor at the College of Charleston and director of the master of fine arts program in creative writing. The views expressed here are solely the author's. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN) Every morning, since Saturday after Florence made its westward turn, it's a new set of contingencies. As the storm nears and intensifies, so too does the stress of preparing and planning. Tuesday morning, my blood began prickling underneath my skin; I felt a nervous-energy in my gut, as though I were perched on the starting blocks before a race. We are not in the clear, and the current information cannot tell us how Florence will behave once it approaches the coast. Projected track lines across the Carolinas look as though a toddler has scribbled all over the map. Charleston sits on the edge of the cone of uncertainty. The schools, the college campus where I work, all the city offices are all closed. My family is leaving our house on the Charleston peninsula to go inland -- the third time in three consecutive falls. Florence threatens, and yet it's beautiful here right now. After the 5 inches of unprecedented snow and ice that glazed the camellias and gave us an actual winter, after a long summer of rains, after an eye-blink of a spring, our front yard garden is ripening. The sages and salvias, the bee balm and zinnias are drawing in a cast of bees and butterflies. The promise of less humid days is visible in the resurrection ferns browning on the live oaks, in the sky's dynamic mixture of high and low altitude clouds. With the school year in full swing, we were just feeling settled into our weekly routines. Last year, Irma interrupted this exact same week of the school year, and the year before Matthew arrived not far after. I ask myself -- did I plant our winter vegetable garden before or after Irma, before or after Matthew? September and October have new meanings for me now. Time moves strangely when a hurricane eyes you from the ocean. You reside in a surreal pre-storm space. The closest comparison I have to this altered time-space is caring for a newborn in the first weeks. You try to concentrate on other things. There's a constant pressure behind your eyes; you do not sleep well. You go hour-by-hour reassessing with every forecast update. You never feel you are making the best choices. You exist in a mixed state of hyper-vigilance and fret; you go back-and-forth discussing the storm's probabilities and what gambles you're willing to take. You might put up plywood; you might not. You might evacuate, if you can. You might not. Hurry up and wait, hurry up and wait -- that's the pre-storm mantra. Then the storm arrives, and you wait. As I wait, I talk to my neighbors, colleagues and students about their thoughts: Will you stay? What's your plan? In Charleston, you can often tell a South Carolina native from a transplant, like me, based on how they react to these storm threats. Charleston natives, long seasoned by storms and near misses, will joke about how they plan to go to the bars downtown, now that there's plenty of parking with all the tourists gone. They will remind you about Hurricane Hugo -- the measuring stick of what disaster means here. Many will say that if it's a Category 4 or higher, then they will go, but only then. I do not feel seasoned by these storms yet. But I know what will likely happen here: The peninsula's outermost roads will be inundated with saltwater; the downtown Market will flood. Some of the majestic old trees, heavy with rot, will crack and fall. Every intersection notorious even for sunny-day flooding will fill up all the faster; the crosstown will become a stream. The bridges that link the peninsula and the sea islands will close. Trucks delivering food will be delayed. Once in the clear, people will venture outside; others will arrive back to their houses to clean up what puddles or debris they find. Threads on our neighborhood Facebook feed will ask what restaurants are open and serving -- gosh darn it, they say, they need to get out of the house, they're stir crazy. At the College of Charleston, we'll have to re-create our syllabi and fit in make-up classes. My summer garden will be toppled, flattened in spirals. It'll be a nuisance -- at least that's what I'm most hopeful for -- a repeat of what has happened twice before. I'm lucky that I can entertain the thought of Hurricane Florence as a nuisance, but even this is overshadowed by certain catastrophe to the north where the impacts won't be merely bothersome but biblical. Rain there is measured in feet and not inches; the color scale indicating rain accumulations grows a deeper gray as all the more alarming colors were spent further down the scale. As I sit here pitched on the edges of the cone of uncertainty, I'm reminded how much of our lives -- if we are fortunate -- unfold at the edge of a catastrophe that is always striking somewhere and striking hard, sometimes on a scale distant and unimaginable.","Every morning, since Saturday after Florence made its westward turn, it's a new set of contingencies.

"CAMPBELL ROBERTSON, RICHARD FAUSSET and ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS","Dian Edge told her family that God had instructed her in a dream to wait out Hurricane Florence in her little wooden farmhouse, surrounded by soybeans and peanut plants, down near the South Carolina coast. The storm came down, the contents of the freezer were emptied — sausage, turkey, rotisserie chicken — and by the light of kerosene lamps, the family bided their time. Mike Edge, 22, kept vigil, his guns at hand; Meghan, 28, a granddaughter visiting from Boston, stayed in contact with the outside world on her laptop; Dian, 71, the matriarch, prayed and read Psalms aloud to the dark house as a wind-whipped sycamore tree tore at the roof. “She’s reciting the Bible,” the younger Ms. Edge said by phone in the middle of the storm, “and keeps saying evil can’t penetrate God’s word.” Florence, at least, did not penetrate their house, though the roof sustained considerable damage. The morning after, some members of the church brought the Edges a thermos of hot coffee and some ham sandwiches. The devotion does not let up with the weather. Billy Layton, who moved to Lumberton nearly two years ago to rebuild flood-damaged houses with the North Carolina Baptists on Mission, was planning to move on by the end of the year. He had been leading this nomadic lifestyle for nearly a decade, following disaster after disaster, and was ready to get to some long-delayed repairs on his own home. On Saturday night, with Lumberton looking more and more as though it would be flooded even more severely than it had during Hurricane Matthew, Mr. Layton contemplated the question he would soon face: whether to stay in the area on his now indefinitely prolonged mission.","Volunteers set up a mobile food station, capable of serving 30,000 meals a day, at Temple Baptist Church in New Bern, N.C., on Sunday.",2018-09-16T23:54:54Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","In the Carolinas, Churches Provide Spiritual Refuge and Shelter From the Storm",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/16/us/hurricane-churches-shelter-relief.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/us/17storm-religion03/17storm-religion03-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nicole Chavez and Dakin Andone, CNN","(CNN) After an agonizing week of ravaging floodwaters, rising rivers, power outages and dozens of deaths, the Florence-weary Carolinas are facing the possibility of more flooding over the weekend. At least 44 people have died since the hurricane slammed into the coast last week. While the rain subsided, some rivers are still rising, and North and South Carolina officials warn the flooding danger is far from over. ""The Cape Fear River will crest again this weekend, along with the Lumber River,"" the North Carolina Department of Transportation tweeted Friday, adding that the Neuse will rise Monday. ""Additionally, new areas are flooding with little warning. Due to this, travel isn't recommended south of US 64,"" it said. While some roads are not flooded, they may have damage and hazardous debris that makes it dangerous to drive or walk on them, state officials said. In South Carolina, emergency officials issued a stern warning on avoiding the roads: ""I know we sound redundant, but it bears repeating: Turn around, don't drown!"" the state's emergency management department tweeted. A week after Hurricane Florence made landfall, the trillions of gallons of water it dumped over the Carolinas are slowly moving toward the sea and leaving a path of destruction behind. Residential streets have turned into rivers and freeways have morphed into waterways. Storm recovery will cost $1.2 billion In North Carolina, flooded rivers have left thousands of evacuees living in shelters and hundreds of roads underwater. The water has receded in some places, but as it moves downstream, officials say, thousands of people could be in danger until next week. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division said Friday a number of rivers -- the Waccamaw, Lynches, Little Pee Dee and Big Pee Dee -- are forecast to crest east of Interstate 95 this weekend and early next week. Residents were warned the confluence of the Big Pee Dee and Little Pee Dee rivers -- where they merge -- could reach flood levels even greater than those seen during Hurricane Matthew. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the state's resources and personnel have shifted to the Pee Dee region. Authorities have said 23 out of the 46 counties in South Carolina could potentially be impacted by flooding. Residents in those areas are still recovering from the 2015 catastrophic floods in the Carolinas as well as from the widespread damage of Hurricane Matthew in 2016 In Conway, South Carolina, authorities said residents could see damage in homes that have not flooded before. Officials are also worried about contamination and environmental hazards from the storm, including the potential effects of coal ash. Coal ash is an industrial waste created by coal-burning power plants, and can carry health risks. Flooding from the Cape Fear River caused breaches in a dam at a cooling lake at Duke Energy's LV Sutton Plant in Wilmington, North Carolina, prompting the company to shut down the natural gas plant Friday, Duke Energy said in a statement. ""Water is now exiting the cooling lake through breaches -- one large and several smaller -- on the southern end of the impoundment,"" the statement said. It noted there are two coal ash basins on the site, but said there was ""no visible ash in the cooling lake. A landfill containing disposed ash from the site has not been affected by the cooling lake, it said. An earlier statement from Duke Energy explained the LV Sutton coal power plant was retired in 2013, and today the plant operates as a natural gas plant. Most of the people died in North Carolina Of the 44 people killed, three have been in Virginia, 32 in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina, officials said. The deaths include two mental health patients killed in South Carolina's Horry County. The women, Windy Newton, 45, and Nicolette Green, 43, drowned Tuesday in a prison transport van when sheriff's deputies couldn't open the doors of the vehicle, authorities said.","After an agonizing week of ravaging floodwaters, rising rivers, power outages and dozens of deaths, the Florence-weary Carolinas are facing the possibility of more flooding over the weekend.",2018-09-22T09:59:04Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",44 dead as Florence-weary Carolinas face more flooding and rising rivers,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/22/us/florence-carolinas-flooding-saturday-wxc/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180920235843-03-florence-flooding-0920-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Megan Molteni,"Last Wednesday, Hurricane Michael slammed into the Florida Panhandle at 155 miles per hour, flattening neighborhoods, turning subdivisions into rubble, and plunging the coast into darkness. On Friday, Trevor Lewis packed up two trucks with crowbars, chainsaws, sledgehammers, ropes, walkie talkies, and five other guys from Cocoa Beach, where he lives on the east side of the state. As night fell they began the drive up into the worst of the wreckage. By 4 am on Saturday they were responding to their first call for help. Lewis leads a self-funded search-and-rescue unit made up of off-duty police officers, firefighters, and EMTs. They call themselves Salty Water Rescue Services, and most of them have special emergency training on the high-speed powerboat racing circuit off Cocoa Beach. Theyre one of hundreds of volunteer crews that showed up post-Michael to help first responders overwhelmed by 911 calls. They used as their guide a service called Crowdsource Rescue, or CSR, which showed on a map individuals who might need help. On one of Salty Waters visits, the crew met a woman whose house had a gas leak, so Lewis called local authorities. Its an eerie feeling to dial that number thinking someones going to come and it goes straight to a busy signal, he says. The womans family had used CSR to request a wellness check on their relative. The idea behind CSR started out simple: collect calls for help posted on social media, geolocate them, and route volunteers to the distressed parties. Basically, Uber for emergencies. It was a simple enough concept that a pair of developers named Matthew Marchetti and Nate Larson hacked it together in about six soggy hours in Houston last August while Hurricane Harvey howled outside. They expected it to help out a few families in their rapidly flooding neighborhood. By the time the storm was over, Marchetti says at least 25,000 people had been reached using the web service. Turns out, armies of spontaneous samaritans can get a lot more done if technology tells them where to go. The volunteers are going to show up no matter what, says Marchetti. Were just trying to empower them to find more people safely and more effectively. What began as a one-off charitable coding sprint has since evolved into a five-person emergency volunteer mission control center. In their day jobs at a real estate company, Marchetti and Larson built maps. And thats basically what the first version of CSR was. But as more hurricanes rocked the US in quick succession in late 2017first Irma, then Mariathe pair piled on new features as problems arose in real-time. We would change something on the site while there were 60,000 people using it, and if they didnt like it, theyd let us know, says Marchetti. We had no master plan. It was all just reactionary. In January, when the hurricane season had ended, they found time for a more thoughtful redesign. The latest version, released two weeks before Florence hit, includes a mobile app and new safeguards. It allows users to tag hazards such as downed power lines, washed-out roads, and fast-moving water. It also gives CSR the flexibility to block off any areas that emergency management officials have declared dangerous for civilians, so that volunteers without proper training cant see aid requests in those areas. Those precautions are to prevent volunteers from winding up needing rescuing themselves. Thats less of a concern for volunteers like Lewiss Salty Water crew, who used CSR for the first time during Florence, but who are no strangers to treacherous waters. After that September storm swept through, seven of their guys drove to North Carolina with a flat-bottom boat and two tuned-up jet skis with rescue sleds on the back. Over the course of a few sleepless days they checked in on nearly 100 people, delivering supplies, relaying messages to loved ones, and helping the unluckiest few to safety, including about a dozen shivering pets. On the long drive back to Cocoa Beach they decided to formally partner up with the crowdsource platform. But when Michael arrived two months later with its powerful Category 4 winds, Lewis and his teammates had used up most of their vacation time responding to Florence, so they could only stay four days. They had AT&amp;T, which Lewis says was the only carrier with coverage, and switched to walkie-talkies when they hit areas with service outages. If they couldn't relay their findings back to worried families directly, they'd take pictures or video to share using their phones later. He says that in the time they were in Panhandle, his team reached more than 300 people using the app. Yet the rescue that sticks in his mind most vividly wasnt coordinated by CSR. It came about just by chance. She was the neighbor of someone whose family had filed a wellness request; Lewis spotted her as they were preparing to move on to the next ticket, and he asked if she was alright. It soon became clear she wasnt. A widow in her 80s and frail, she lived alone. There was almost no food or water in her house. A section of her roof had been ripped clear of its frame. An immigrant from Thailand, she had no family in the US. No one was looking for her. She had one friend in the city, but with no phone service she couldnt call her. It was heart wrenching, says Lewis. His team reached the friend and waited until she came to pick the old woman up. Then they patched her roof and ripped out her wet carpet, collected her valuables and put them in a safe place to dry. They filed a new CSR ticket so that there was a record. And so that someone follows up. But the incident showed one of the apps biggest limitationson its own it cant locate missing people. Being homeless, phoneless, family-less, or Facebook-less can make dangerous storms even more deadly in the days and weeks after the worst weather has passed. Thats one of the reasons Marchettis team has started to layer social vulnerability indices and flood zones onto its maps of areas where hurricanes are expected to hit. As landfall predictions firm up, CSR places Facebook ads for its app targeted at people living in the path of the storm. They start making calls to churches and local community organizations, trying to raise awareness of the resource. We want to play this role of equalizer, to come in serve as a stopgap, he says. Not having the ability or the funds to evacuate doesnt mean you dont deserve to be helped. Early Wednesday morning, CSR had more than 1,200 open tickets for people not yet verified as safe. But as more people got cell service and volunteers cleared a backlog of requests, that number dropped to 548 by the end of the day. Marchetti says that doesnt necessarily mean that all of those people really are missing and presumed dead. They could be staying with other friends or relatives and unable to communicate. But we are starting to hit that point in every disaster where that number becomes more and more representative of the real thing, he says. A more official number could emerge as soon as Thursday evening, when the Federal Emergency Management Agency expects to complete its search and rescue operations. The agency has 10 crews and a dozen cadaver-sniffing dogs scouring the destruction scattered across Bay, Gulf, and Jackson counties, according to FEMA spokesperson Ruben Brown, reached Wednesday at the agencys interim operating facility in Tallahassee. State officials have not provided a count of the people currently considered to be missing. The states division of emergency management has an online system where people can report missing individuals as well as the locations of people who are trapped or running out of medications and other supplies. But Florida officials did not respond to questions about how those lists are used to coordinate searches. The states website also links to a searchable American Red Cross registry where people can list themselves as safe and well for their loved ones to find.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Authorities are warning coastal residents in the path of Hurricane Florence to evacuate now or be at the mercy of the Category 3 storm, which is expected to slow upon hitting the coast of the Carolinas on Thursday and ravage the region with storm surge, rainfall, and flooding. According to CNN, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told reporters that emergency personnel will not be able to intervene during the storm due to the high risk it poses. Florence is currently expected to begin delivering tropical storm-force winds in the region by early Thursday, escalating to hurricane-force winds by late Thursday or early Friday. CNN wrote: “You put your life at risk by staying,” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said. “Don’t plan to leave once the winds and rains start.” Cooper and his South Carolina counterpart, Henry McMaster, told the more than 1 million people who have been told to leave that if they don’t, they are on their own. McMaster told residents in some counties that emergency responders will be pulled from areas expected to be hit hard. “Even the rescuers cannot stay there,” he said. Accuweather reported that its meteorologists “believe that the hurricane will stall and meander near the Carolina coast from Thursday night to Saturday.” That means locals and their property could be punished with severe hurricane conditions for days, not hours. “Total innundation” is expected in eastern and southeastern North Carolina, as well as northern Southern California, and the storm surge could reach in “excess of 10 feet in some areas,” Accuweather added. Isolated tornadoes could also occur along North Carolina’s coast on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service in Wilmington. Only seven major hurricanes have hit on the coast between Savannah, Georgia and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina since 1879, CNN reported, and the last was Hurricane Hugo in 1989. In that time the population has dramatically increased. The Washington Post warned that the heavy rainfall expected is likely to be “catastrophic,” and noted the National Weather Service said Florence will likely be bad even by the standards of prior big storms: “This will likely be the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast,” the National Weather Service in Wilmington, N.C., wrote Tuesday, “and that’s saying a lot given the impacts we’ve seen from hurricanes Diana, Hugo, Fran, Bonnie, Floyd, and Matthew.” As Earther has noted before, the path Florence has taken is incredibly unusual, with none of the 57 named storms that had passed within 200 miles of its position last week coming close to striking the U.S. coast. The expected stalling is equally unusual, according to USA Today : Instead of roaring ashore and quickly heading inland and weakening, as most storms do, Hurricane Florence should instead “stall near the coast and then parallel southwestward toward Georgia,” Weather Channel meteorologist Greg Postel said. “I’ve never seen anything like this.” AccuWeather meteorologist Marshall Moss said Florence’s track is unique. “It was located farther north in the Atlantic than any other storm to ever hit the Carolinas, so what we’re forecasting is unprecedented,” Moss said. In other words, those living in coastal regions subject to evacuation orders in Florence’s path have had their final warning: Please, for your own good, get out of there before it’s too late. That means now.

Associated Press,". RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Hurricane Florence is testing the resolve of farmers in the Carolinas, who could face billions of dollars in agricultural damage while still feeling the sting from Hurricane Matthew almost two years ago. After last weekend's high winds and rain that was measured in feet, followed by this week's rising rivers and standing water in fields, early farm reports are confirming pre-storm worries about losses to tobacco, cotton and corn crops. North Carolina industry leaders remain anxious about whether sweet potatoes and peanuts — grown beneath the soil and susceptible to flooding — will suffer greatly as well. Matthew hurt eastern North Carolina farmers in 2016, but that storm arrived in October, after most of field crops had been brought in. With Florence, most major crop harvests were still underway or just getting started. ""This hurricane couldn't have come at a worse time,"" North Carolina Farm Bureau President Larry Wooten said, North Carolina likely won't have preliminary crop damage estimates until the end of the next week, state Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler said. Floodwaters and blocked country roads still were making it difficult for agency agronomists to check out farms. Five of North Carolina's top six farming counties are within the hardest-hit areas in the eastern part of the state. ""I think it's easily going to be in the billions of dollars,"" Troxler said in an interview Thursday, calling the damage ""catastrophic"" and ""unbelievable."" In South Carolina, meanwhile, crop damage was estimated at $125 million so far, Gov. Henry McMaster wrote Thursday to the state's congressional delegation. This week, state Agriculture Commissioner Hugh Weathers visited farmers in damaged areas previously hurt by Matthew and by record flooding in 2015. Weathers said farmers told him that while this year's cotton crops had been damaged by high winds and peanuts were rotting in soaking soil, no crop was a total loss. North Carolina farmers had several days' notice of Florence to harvest what they could and move livestock to higher ground or to market, but there was only so much they could do to prepare. ""Farmers have just faced several years of (low) commodity prices. Matthew came through... and now we're faced with Florence,"" said Jason Jones, a fifth-generation farmer in Craven County. He said the un-harvested corn on his 1,800-acre (728-hectare) farm is ""just about completely flat"" and neighboring farms lost all of their tobacco in the fields. Jones said farmers have crop insurance, but it doesn't cover the total loss. ""For eastern North Carolina farmers, we're hanging by a thread,"" Jones said. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said he told President Donald Trump during his visit to the state Wednesday that making farmers whole will take more than just a ""farm bill."" ""We're going to have to take a special approach to our farm communities, because they have taken a gut punch,"" said Cooper, who planned to view agricultural damage Friday. North Carolina remains the nation's largest tobacco producer, with more than 330 million pounds (150 million kilograms) in 2016. Graham Boyd, chief executive of the Tobacco Growers Association of North Carolina, estimates losses could total as much as 125 million pounds (57 million kilograms) valued at $250 million to $350 million. About 40 percent of the tobacco crop remained in the field when Florence arrived, Boyd said, with the highest-quality leaves yet to be harvested. Leaves began ""melting on the stalk"" — disintegrating when sunny skies followed heavy rains and standing water. On the 5,000 acres (2,023 hectares) that Craig West's family farms on near Fremont — about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Raleigh — the biggest moneymaker is the 500 acres (202 hectares) of tobacco. Sixteen inches (41 centimeters) of rain there made it impossible to harvest the leaves still in the fields in time, even if the winds hadn't battered them so that they were about as appealing and saleable as a bunch of bruised bananas, West said. ""We haven't had a good growing season anyway. We had a pretty severe drought early on and then it started raining. We had too much rain even before the storm,"" West said Thursday. ""So we had some disease issues already. It's magnified since the storm."" West's tobacco loss means the farm's nearly $6 million in gross revenues will be diminished by about 30 percent, he said as workers loaded a machine that sorted tobacco picked weeks ago and then packaged the cured leaves into bundles for shipping. Livestock losses in North Carolina are estimated at 3.4 million poultry and 5,500 hogs so far, the state Agriculture Department said. Both represent small percentages of the 800 million broilers — chickens raised for meat production — and 9 million hogs raised annually. Troxler said chicken and hog house damage would be significant. Kim Kornegay's family farm in Johnston County could lose 40 percent of its cotton crop, farm manager T.J. Sasser said Thursday. Workers there prepared to slog through the mud Friday to try to see what sweet potatoes could be salvaged. ""We're optimistic, but we're also realistic,"" Kornegay said. ___ Dalesio reported from Fremont, North Carolina.

BAN KI-MOON and FRANCIS SUAREZ,"We have also learned that there is strength in numbers. Miami can access a wealth of resources, including sea level rise projections, thanks to its membership in regional bodies like the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact. The city has also gained a broader perspective on urban resilience challenges and approaches by joining global networks such as the Global Commission on Climate Adaptation, where we both serve as board members, and 100 Resilient Cities. 
Finally, we have learned that effective adaptation is a collective endeavor. It requires a holistic, long-term approach that takes into account the needs of our citizens today and in the future. This requires robust and meticulous long-term planning, informed investment in resilient infrastructure, adapting land use and building policies to address the climate challenge, advancing new transportation solutions, educating and informing citizens about climate change, training and mobilizing volunteers during emergencies, informing private property owners of climate risks, and forging partnerships with research institutions and business innovators. As this long list makes clear, there isnt a single aspect of our daily lives that isnt affected by climate change.
Perhaps one of the reasons there is so little investment in adaptation is the lack of financial incentives. Unlike a wind farm, for example, that can earn a steady return for investors, the monetary benefits of adaptation are less straightforward. Investing in resilience protects businesses and communities from devastating losses, so it must be measured in the lives saved and businesses that remain open. We are only now learning how to quantify these benefits to communities. Floridas Division of Emergency Management, for example, calculated that projects to reduce wind and water damage avoided $81 million in losses when Hurricane Matthew struck in 2016, while costing only $19 million to carry out. The projects included raising buildings, improving drainage, and buying and demolishing properties in vulnerable areas
That is why leadership, particularly from city governments like Miamis, is so important in driving investment in adaptation. After Hurricane Irma in September 2017 one of the costliest in United States history, leaving a $50 billion trail of destruction there was both a moral and a fiscal obligation to act. Thats why two months later, Miami voters approved the $400 million Miami Forever Bond.
The program is the citys answer to the shortfall of investment in adaptation. It brings together city planners, private sector innovators and citizens to build a stronger, more resilient future for Miami. Almost half this amount is being invested in flood defenses and other measures to combat the effects of rising sea levels. The remaining funds will be invested in affordable housing, tree planting, road work and an innovative approach to urban landscape design that will allow residents to continue enjoying waterfront access while improving drainage and sea wall defenses.","In 2017, voters agreed to finance adaptation efforts through property taxes. Now the first phase of those projects is underway.",2019-02-20T20:50:36Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Miami Battles Rising Seas,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/opinion/ban-ki-moon-miami-climate-change.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/20/opinion/20moonWeb/20moonWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Laila Kearney,"FLAGLER COUNTY, Fla (Reuters) - Down the palm tree-lined roads of northeast Florida’s Flagler County, a half-dozen dump trucks are shuttling back and forth along the Atlantic coast pouring thousands of tons of sand onto the local beach. Replacing sand swept away by waves and wind is critical work to protect seaside homes and businesses as well as the tourism dollars brought by northerners seeking refuge from the cold in the Sunshine State. Getting enough of it, for the right price and in time for the peak tourist season, has become much harder after a violent storm year that brought Irma, the most powerful hurricane to hit the state in over a decade, and saddled Florida with more than $50 billion in damage. Costs of so-called beach renourishments are a fraction of the total, measured in hundreds of millions of dollars, but the effort is crucial for Florida's $67 billion tourism industry. And while sand needs are surging, there is not enough to go around. ( tmsnrt.rs/2BIyPFs ) “It’s like the slow progression of tooth decay versus a fight where someone knocks out your teeth all at once,” Flagler County Administrator Craig Coffey said, referring to sand lost during Irma and Hurricane Matthew, which buffeted Florida’s coast in October 2016. With the longest coastline of any mainland U.S. state, more money and time is spent fixing up Florida’s shores - widening and building dunes - than in any other state. [L2N1PR2CK] But after seven decades of rebuilding its beaches, the state is now struggling with sand shortages, rising costs and tight public funds even during calmer years. The quick succession of powerful storms makes the challenges even more daunting. By one estimate, based on a sample of beaches, Irma knocked out four times the amount of sand Matthew displaced, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokesman John Campbell said. Matthew was already considered one of the worst storms in recent memory. As weather patterns change and coastal development increases, more states have rolled out programs to counter beach erosion over the past five years. Other nations, including Mexico, Britain and Australia, also regularly fix up their shores. High demand for sand in the construction industry further strains global supply. As needs and costs rise in Florida, communities are increasingly competing both for sand and funding, with some retaining “sand lobbyists” to represent them in state and federal legislatures. Flagler County tried for more than a decade to get the federal sand funds used for popular beaches like Miami before turning to local tax dollars, private money and emergency aid to rebuild dunes and protect neighborhoods flooded in Matthew, Irma and several nor‘easters since. The estimated $26 million project began late last month. SOARING PRICES AND TURTLES A lone beachcomber and a pair of seagulls walk near dredging equipment on a blustery day at St. Augustine Beach along the Atlantic Coast of Florida, U.S., January 26, 2018. REUTERS/Gregg Newton That back-to-back strike of storms has pushed counties to reach for sand sources all at once, driving up prices. South of Flagler, Brevard County wanted to expand a contract it awarded after Matthew to also cover post-Irma needs at the original price, but the contractor rejected the deal. New bids came in 11 percent to 39 percent higher and the county settled for the lowest offer, said County Commissioner John Tobia, who wants some of the local tax money spent on sand to be used repairing the county’s damaged roads instead. Brevard, home to Kennedy Space Center, also has to worry about sea turtles. Federally-protected sea turtles nest along Florida’s east coast and the laws prohibit any work during the nesting period from May through October. Environmental rules also prescribe what type of sand can be used, since its color affects the temperature - the darker, the faster it warms - and that in turn can change the gender of the turtles before hatching. As useable offshore sand sources get depleted and tapping into new sites involves lengthy permitting, more local governments are trucking sand from mines - instead of dredging it from the seabed and piping it onshore - even though it can cost five times more per cubic yard. “With the shrinking sand supply, it leads to conflict,” said Dave Bullock, who retired last month as town manager for Florida’s western barrier island of Longboat Key, which used up the rest of its offshore reserves after Matthew. In a recent example of that clash, two neighboring beach communities, Siesta Key and Lido Key are facing off in a lawsuit over which can claim 1.8 million tons of sand from a common boating channel. Environmental advocates argue that beach erosion is primarily a natural phenomenon and efforts to reverse it create a vicious-circle by encouraging building along the shore. That in turn puts more people and public resources at risk and calls for greater efforts and money to protect them. The long-term, lasting solution would be to roll back coastal development, environmental activists argue. Still, needs are likely to grow, says Derek Brockbank, executive director at the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association, which lobbies for coastal governments and businesses. Climate change and coastal development have created an urgent need to protect the upland, Brockbank said, calling for $5 billion to be set aside over the next decade in any upcoming federal infrastructure bill.

GLENN THRUSH,"Traditionally states, and not the federal government, have been responsible for hashing out the details of assessing damage, processing claims and distributing funding in the wake of national disasters, a system intended to give local decision makers control over how their communities are rebuilt. But states and cities, unaccustomed to dealing with the complex logistical and oversight issues of administering programs geared at fast-tracking billions in capital projects, are now finding themselves overwhelmed by the demands, even though such challenges have been well-documented since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Many of the areas most prone to repeated hurricanes, especially Louisiana, Texas, Puerto Rico, and now North Carolina, have all experienced similar problems as they adjust to a new normal in which disaster agencies are permanently mobilized and f ederal disaster money is now one of the single biggest sources of government money used to help rehabilitate or preserve low-income housing. We are really good at disaster recovery programs, hazard mitigation, helping individual people who are in trouble, but not at this kind of thing, said the states emergency management director, Michael A. Sprayberry, who contends that the lessons learned under Matthew will help the state more efficiently distribute post-Florence disaster funding. We have had to hire and stand up a completely new staff roughly 50, 60 new people so this is a whole new ballgame. It took more than 10 months to comply with federally mandated environmental reviews and other red tape, Mr. Sprayberry said, which is contributing to the frustration. There will be a news release from HUD saying that the state is going to be receiving funding, which right then sort of automatically raises the level of expectations, he added.",North Carolina has had an especially hard time distributing money earmarked by Congress to help low- and moderate-income homeowners in the wake of disasters.,2018-09-24T23:32:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","North Carolina, a ‘Slow Spender’ State, Struggles to Hand Out Storm Aid",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/us/north-carolina-florence-matthew-disaster-aid.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/24/us/00nchousing-02/00nchousing-02-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brian Snyder,"PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - More than a thousand people were still missing on Wednesday a week after Hurricane Michael flattened communities across the Florida Panhandle, killing at least 27. Teams made up of hundreds of volunteers with the Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue organization were searching for more than 1,135 people in Florida who lost contact with friends and family, Matthew Marchetti, co-founder of Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue. Most of those missing are from Panama City and many are elderly, disabled, impoverished, or live alone, Marchetti said. Florida officials have not given a number for how many people are considered to be missing. Those who are missing may be with relatives and friends, and not necessarily presumed dead. Debris, downed trees and power lines have hampered access to stranded people, but CrowdSource said a number of its missing person reports resulted from widespread phone and power outages. The death toll includes 17 in Florida, one in Georgia, three in North Carolina and six in Virginia, according to a Reuters tally of official reports. Officials said medical examiners were determining whether another four deaths in Florida were due to the storm. Michael slammed into the northwest coastal strip of Florida last Wednesday with top sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (250 km/h), unleashing a surge of seawater that demolished homes. About 35,000 Floridians have called Federal Emergency Management Agency seeking help since and the agency has already approved $1 million in assistance for people in those 12 counties, spokesman Ruben Brown in Tallahassee said. FEMA has distributed about 4.5 million meals, more than 5 million liters of water and 9 million infant-and-toddler kits, he said. In Mexico Beach, which took a direct hit, the number of people missing dropped to three on Tuesday, said Rex Putnal, a city councillor. A day earlier, it was more than 30. The town of 1,200 residents had reported two fatalities as of Monday. Nearly 163,000 homes and businesses remained without power in the U.S. Southeast, with residents of battered coastal towns forced to cook on fires and barbecue grills. At least 80 percent of customers in three mainly rural Panhandle counties were without electricity on Tuesday. Officials said it could be weeks before power returns to some.

Rod Nickel,"MEXICO BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Search and rescue volunteers have located hundreds of people reported missing in the U.S. Southeast after Hurricane Michael tore through their Florida Panhandle communities, but the death toll of at least 18 was expected to rise. Rescue crews heard cries for help and cut into a mobile home crumpled by the storm in Panama City, freeing survivors who had been trapped inside for two days, Matthew Marchetti, co-founder of the Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue, said on Saturday. In door-to-door searches, teams consisting mostly of off-duty police officers and firefighters have found more than 520 of the 2,100 people reported missing since Michael crashed ashore near Mexico Beach, Florida, on Wednesday as one of the most powerful storms in U.S. history. “We expect that number to go up dramatically today,” Marchetti said, adding hopes were raised by an influx of volunteers on the weekend and the restoration of power in some areas. “Volunteers are working side-by-side with first responders. They are cutting holes in roofs. They try to take a picture so we can call the family and tell them we made contact,” he said. But as roads were cleared to allow wider searches, the death toll was expected to mount. As of early Saturday, authorities were reporting at least 18 deaths in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia. Rescue teams, hampered by power and telephone outages, used cadaver dogs, drones and heavy equipment to hunt for people in the rubble. In Callaway, Florida, an especially hard-hit town, Catholic Christians barbecued hamburgers and Scientologists handed out water. “I’m homeless,” said nursing assistant Carla Covington, 45, who is caring for her mother and two children after their house was destroyed by falling trees. She said it felt good to receive comfort, but was also hard. “I’m used to helping people and not asking for help,” she said, her voice breaking with emotion. The tropical storm, which grew in less than two days into a Category 4 hurricane, tore apart entire neighborhoods. More than 1,700 search and rescue workers were deployed, including seven swift-water rescue teams and nearly 300 ambulances, Florida Governor Rick Scott’s office said. Power and phone service were being slowly restored, with about 236,000 homes and businesses still without power in North Carolina, down from a peak of more than 600,000, said spokesman Keith Acree of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety. It could be weeks before power is restored to the most damaged parts of Florida.

Emergency service workers will also go to homes FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. – The sixth-largest city in North Carolina may experience two 500-year floods within two years. Still bearing the trauma of deadly Hurricane Matthew in 2016, Fayetteville and Cumberland County officials Saturday morning weighed whether to call for mandatory evacuations. What they're facing now with Tropical Storm Florence is potentially worse than two years ago, when at least four people died as a result of flash flooding. This time, the danger from flash floods is not as great. But as the rain keeps pounding the east of the state, two rivers in the area are rising — the Little and the larger Cape Fear. Last Slide Next Slide The Cape Fear was at 12.15 feet at 5 p.m. Friday, according to the National Weather Service. Flood level is 35 feet. During Matthew, it reached 58 feet. By Tuesday, officials expect more than 62 feet for the river that runs through the center of the city. Leaders of the county and city joint response team are already strongly encouraging people who live within a mile of the little River to voluntarily evacuate due to what they're calling potentially ""life-threatening flooding."" Those within a mile of the Cape Fear are also being asked to consider evacuating. That encouragement might become mandatory Saturday afternoon, said Sally Shutt, assistant Cumberland County manager. ""We are monitoring it and communicating with the National Weather Service,"" Shutt said. If officials deem the evacuation necessary, they'll send out alerts via texts, emails and phone calls. Emergency service workers will also go to homes, Shutt said.

Steve Holland,"LYNN HAVEN, Fla. (Reuters) - Rescue workers and volunteers searched for more than 1,000 people still missing in the Florida Panhandle and tens of thousands of residents remained without power on Tuesday after the area was devastated by Hurricane Michael last week. At least 19 deaths in four states have been blamed on Michael which made landfall on Wednesday as one of the most powerful storms on record to hit the continental United States. Volunteer rescue organization CrowdSource Rescue said its teams were trying to find 1,300 people still missing in the disaster zone in the Panhandle, according to Matthew Marchetti, co-founder of the Houston-based group. About 30 to 40 people remained unaccounted for in Mexico Beach, according to a city councillor, Rex Putnal. The mayor of the town of about 1,200 residents, which took a direct hit from the hurricane, has said that at least one person was killed, while CNN reported that another person was found dead on Monday. With most Mexico Beach homes already searched for survivors, rescue workers were using dogs to find any bodies that might be buried under the debris. More than 200,000 people were still without power in the U.S. Southeast, with residents of battered coastal towns such as Port St. Joe, Florida forced to cook on fires and barbecue grills. At least 80 percent of customers in three mainly rural Panhandle counties were without electricity on Tuesday. Officials said it could be weeks before power returns to the areas that sustained the most damage. CAMPING IN TENTS Countless residents in the region’s backcountry have struggled for days without electricity, running water or sanitation as they await help from authorities. Some have been camping in tents with whatever belongings they were able to salvage. “I’m staying out here to try to keep away looters, to try to save what I can save,” said Bernard Sutton, a 64-year-old cancer patient, who has been living out of a tent and broken-down minivan. “This is everything we own right here,” he said, standing over a heap of clothes, books, furniture and other belongings. Access to those stranded by the storm was hampered by downed oak trees across highways and dirt roads. “Everyone needs help. We’re devastated out here. We’re wiped off the map,” said Gabriel Schaw, 40, gesturing to a handful of neighbors surrounding his own demolished mobile home in Fountain, Florida. The state government is distributing ice, water and about 3 million ready-to-eat meals, according to Governor Rick Scott’s office. With top sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (250 km per hour), Michael hit the Florida Panhandle as a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale on Wednesday. The winds and storm surge caused insured losses worth between an estimated $6 billion and $10 billion, risk modeler AIR Worldwide said. Those figures do not include losses paid out by the National Flood Insurance Program or uninsured property, AIR Worldwide said. Water supply was restored to some residents in Panama City on Monday but Bay County officials said it was not yet safe to drink. U.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump visited the storm-affected areas on Monday, arriving by helicopter from Eglin Air Force Base about 100 miles (160 km) to the west. They distributed bottles of water at an aid center in Lynn Haven, a city of about 18,500 people near Panama City in northwestern Florida. “To see this personally is very tough - total devastation,” said Trump, who later traveled to neighboring Georgia to see the storm damage there.

Brian Snyder,"PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - A lack of power and phone service in the areas of Florida flattened by Hurricane Michael last week was hindering efforts on Wednesday to distribute food and water and to contact residents not heard from since the storm plowed through the state’s Panhandle. The hurricane, one of the most powerful storms on record to hit the continental United States, killed at least 30 people, according to county officials. It packed top sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (250 km per hour) that toppled power lines and unleashed a surge of seawater that demolished homes. Florida officials have not said how many people are missing. Many people may not be able to call friends and family or may be staying elsewhere and are not necessarily presumed dead. Debris, downed trees and power lines have hampered access to stranded people. Teams made up of hundreds of volunteers with the Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue organization were trying to reach 720 people in Florida who lost contact with friends and family, said Matthew Marchetti, the organization’s co-founder. Most of those unaccounted for are from Panama City and many are elderly, disabled, impoverished, or live alone, Marchetti said. He said the search has been hindered by spotty cell phone coverage in the devastated area, though authorities are making progress in restoring communications. Many residents have also expressed frustration at the slow pace of recovery of wireless networks. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai on Tuesday called for wireless carriers to waive bills for customers affected by the storm. The death toll includes 20 in Florida after three more deaths were confirmed on Tuesday, one in Georgia, three in North Carolina and six in Virginia, according to a Reuters tally of official reports. Officials said medical examiners were determining whether another four deaths in Florida resulted from the storm. About 35,000 Floridians have called the Federal Emergency Management Agency seeking help since and the agency has already approved $1 million in assistance for people in 12 counties, spokesman Ruben Brown in Tallahassee said. FEMA has distributed about 4.5 million meals, more than 5 million liters of water and 9 million infant-and-toddler kits, he said. The state government is distributing ice, water and about 3 million ready-to-eat meals, Governor Rick Scott’s office said. Nearly 155,000 homes and businesses remained without power in the U.S. Southeast, with residents of battered coastal towns forced to cook on fires and barbecue grills. At least 70 percent of customers in four mainly rural Florida Panhandle counties were without electricity on Wednesday.

Brian Snyder,"PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - The death toll from Hurricane Michael rose to at least 29 on Tuesday as crews scoured debris for hundreds of people reported missing in the Florida Panhandle, nearly a week after the storm flattened whole communities. Michael slammed into the northwest coastal strip of Floriday last Wednesday with top sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (250 km per hour), unleashing a surge of seawater that demolished homes. One of the most powerful storms ever to hit the continental United States, it has killed 20 people in the Florida Panhandle, five in Virginia, three in North Carolina and one in Georgia, according to a Reuters tally of official reports. Matthew Marchetti, co-founder of Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue, which had hundreds of volunteers on the ground, said he expects the death toll to rise as phone service is restored and roads are cleared. “For every one person we have made contact with, there are probably three we haven’t,” Marchetti said. Teams from the volunteer organization were searching for more than 1,135 people in Florida who lost contact with friends and family. Debris and downed trees and power lines have hampered access to stranded people but the group has said a number of its missing person reports resulted from widespread phone and power outages. Most of those missing are from Panama City and many are elderly, disabled, impoverished, or live alone, Marchetti said. “The hardest hit in disasters are generally our most vulnerable populations,” Marchetti said. In nearby Mexico Beach, another hard-hit coastal town on the Florida Panhandle where rescue workers were using dogs to look for bodies buried in debris, the number of people missing dropped to three on Tuesday, said Rex Putnal, a city councillor. A day earlier, it was more than 30. The town of 1,200 residents had reported two fatalities as of Monday. “It’s miraculous if all we have is two fatalities,” said Mexico Beach Mayor Al Cathey. Nearly 190,000 homes and businesses remained without power in the U.S. Southeast, with residents of battered coastal towns forced to cook on fires and barbecue grills. At least 80 percent of customers in three mainly rural Panhandle counties were without electricity on Tuesday. Officials said it could be weeks before power returns to some.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai on Tuesday called for wireless carriers to waive bills for customers affected by the storm and allow consumers to switch carriers without penalties.

Brian Snyder,"PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Rescue workers and volunteers searched on Tuesday for scores of people still unaccounted for in the Florida Panhandle as residents rejoiced at restored phone services and portable toilets after Hurricane Michael devastated the area last week. At least 19 deaths in four states have been blamed on Michael, which made landfall on Wednesday as one of the most powerful storms on record to hit the continental United States. That number could reach 30 as the Bay County Sheriff’s Office reported 12 deaths. It was not clear if that figure included two deaths previously reported in Mexico Beach in that county. Teams from the volunteer rescue organization CrowdSource Rescue were steadily making contact with people flagged by friends and relatives in the Panhandle disaster zone, according to Matthew Marchetti, co-founder of the Houston-based group.

As cellphone service returned, the number of people unaccounted for in Mexico Beach, one of the hardest-hit towns, dropped to three, said Rex Putnal, a city councillor. A day earlier, it was more than 30. “Hopefully, they left and we’ll find them safe somewhere,” he said, before heading to a clean-up effort where workers awaited the arrival of some overdue portable toilets. “This type of living wears on you,” Putnal said. “This is about my fifth day and I’m just not used to washing clothes in a tub with no washer and dryer and eating only peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.” The mayor of the town of about 1,200 residents, which took a direct hit from the hurricane, said a second person, a woman, was found dead on Monday afternoon.

"Arizona Republic, Jason Pohl, Arizona Republic","A rescue of nursing-home residents takes place in Port Arthur, Texas, on Aug. 30, 2017. Nick Oza/USA TODAY NETWORK 08/31/2017 -- Port Arthur, TX.

Matthew Marchetti's mapping program – fittingly dubbed CrowdSource Rescue – is an Uber of sorts that connects civilian rescuers with people in need. Since its inception during Hurricane Harvey, Marchetti and his organizing platform for spontaneous volunteers have gained international acclaim as researchers and emergency managers work to streamline evacuations during major hurricanes, like the one looming this week in the Atlantic. CrowdSource Rescue has been activated eight times, including in hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. More than 13,500 people – including 780 people with first-responder training – have signed in to voluntarily evacuate more than 37,500 people who were otherwise trapped or stranded, most commonly by high water. Local first-responders, like firefighters, still play a key role in disaster response, Marchetti acknowledged. But with a population experts say is woefully under-prepared for disasters, officials are including Marchetti and others into the equation of how to better use so-called spontaneous volunteers. More: Hurricane Florence path shift 'bizarre,' could bring 'catastrophic flooding' to Southeast ""We are not necessarily a traditional response agency. We empower people who are already doing great things,"" Marchetti, 27, said in an interview with The Arizona Republic. ""Ultimately, it comes down to there being this spirit of volunteerism."" 'Zero to 120 overnight' While out for a rainy bike ride the Sunday Harvey hit Houston in August 2017, Marchetti came upon an unfolding rescue scene. He told a firefighter that he used to be an EMT and that he wanted to help but was ultimately told to go check in at the fire station. That wasn't really an option. Marchetti, who worked in real estate as a data developer, was reliant on his bicycle after he wrecked his car ahead of the storm's arrival, and his transportation options were limited. Instead, he and a couple of volunteers tried using Facebook to get involved in the rescue process. The reports were overwhelming of people checking in and posting updates about being stranded as torrents inundated parts of the city. With 911 systems overwhelmed and a lack of organized efforts to corral and dispatch civilian rescuers, Marchetti resolved to do something about it. That night, Marchetti built a basic online mapping program to give a handful of volunteers – mostly people he knew – a place to coordinate their rescue efforts. At best, Marchetti thought, people from his church could use it to try to get into neighborhoods to help, connecting elderly people with vetted rescuers. Matthew Marchetti co-founded CrowdSource Rescue, an online mapping program that connects civilian rescuers with people in need. In Hurricane Harvey, it resulted in 30,000 rescues. (Photo: Courtesy Matthew Marchetti) He woke up the next day to 1,200 volunteers having signed up. The map set the internet ablaze as the day went on. Officials called on those with boats to help their neighbors. The Cajun Navy, a flotilla of civilian rescuers who volunteer during hurricane evacuations, descended on Houston and outlying coastal areas. Marchetti's map became the go-to organizing force for civilian rescuers. The platform spurred more than 30,000 rescues by approximately 8,000 rescuers, he said. He then created another outlet for the quick succession of storms that followed: hurricanes Irma and Maria. “It’s still a little bit odd to me,"" Marchetti said. ""We went from 0 to 120 overnight and haven't really stopped.” 'It was a cluster' Nick Terrell was one of those spontaneous volunteers during Harvey. He and some other volunteers spent an entire day driving around Houston, checking Facebook and trying to find a place to put a boat in the water and assist people in need. But every corner they turned was a dead end or an area that had already been evacuated. They knew people were in need. They just didn't know where. “We were just trying to help,"" Terrell said Monday. ""It was very unorganized since it was just based off of social media posts. We didn’t know what to do, or where to go, or who to contact to help or anything. ""It was a cluster."" Nick Terrell volunteered to help evacuate buildings and rescue residents in Port Arthur, Texas, Aug. 30, 2017, in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. (Photo: Jason Pohl/The Republic) Terrell's wife attended church with Marchetti and learned about his online map. She suggested Terrell check that to see where the need actually was. The answer: Port Arthur, Texas. There, he and a team of volunteers set out to help. Some were skilled in emergency medicine or trained as first responders, others only had a boat and an eagerness to serve. ""It was literally overnight a complete 180,"" Terrell said. Welcomed into rescue worlds Something else has happened in between the disasters: Marchetti attained something of a superstar status among those in emergency-management circles. In July, he spoke to a room of internationally renowned disaster experts who gathered in Colorado and used his experience as an example of what a new perspective on volunteerism can look like during emergencies. “Volunteering in a disaster is one of the compassionate moments in America,"" Marchetti said. ""That’s when we see true goodness and true justice come out in droves.” 08/30/2017 400P -- Port Arthur, TX -- Rescuers, some trained first responders and others volunteers, help to evacuate the Gulf Health Care Center, a nursing home in Port Arthur, Texas. Elderly patients, many of the bedridden, needed assistance getting out of the facility that had nearly a foot of water in the lobby by 3 p.m. Wednesday. -- Photo by Nick Oza, Gannett (Photo: Nick Oza, for USA TODAY) Some emergency officials are working with him to figure out how to leverage the platform's potential ahead of an emergency. If they can have agreements in place and a legion of volunteers ready to perform non-technical rescues in large-scale Harvey-esque events, more highly trained first-responders can focus on those in more dire situations. Others are working to iron out how the data that's collected – addresses for evacuees in need or contact information for volunteers – can be used down the road to harness the volunteers when response turns to recovery. “We’re really excited that we’re even at the table,” Marchetti said. Why it helps Though FEMA administrator Brock Long has stopped short of recognizing Marchetti's efforts directly, he has consistently advocated for a ""culture of preparedness"" and a less-bureaucratic system of disaster response and recovery. His comments came after The Republic in February reported that thousands of the most highly skilled rescuers incurred $92 million in expenses during responses to hurricane-hit regions of the country – often where they sat idle and awaited rescue orders. All told, those 6,000 rescuers were involved in saving or assisting nearly 9,000 people, raising questions about how to more efficiently use the network of versatile, highly skilled first responders. ""FEMA is just one part of the team,"" Long wrote earlier this year. ""During a disaster, citizens in the impacted communities also become the 'first responders.' We need to empower individuals with life skills to help speed the response and recovery efforts."" Rescuers, some trained first responders and others volunteers, help to evacuate the Gulf Health Care Center, a nursing home in Port Arthur, Texas, on Aug. 30, 2017. Elderly patients, many of them bedridden, needed assistance getting out of the facility that had nearly a foot of water in the lobby. (Photo: Nick Oza/The Republic) Responding to Florence Hurricane Florence intensified dramatically from a Category 1 to a Category 4 hurricane on Monday. On Wednesday, it was downgraded to a Category 3, with sustained winds of 115 mph as it continued to approach the Carolinas, according to the latest forecast from the National Hurricane Center. AccuWeather meteorologist Brett Rossi said the ground in North and South Carolina and Virginia is already saturated from recent rains. Rivers are high, and the storm will be moving slowly when it arrives, exacerbating the situation, Rossi told USA TODAY. ""This is very scary rain event potentially setting up this week,"" Rossi said. ""Florence could dump a foot of rain in places that cannot handle it, making for a very scary flooding situation in some areas."" Some portions of the Carolinas could see as much as 30-40 inches of rain from Florence, the National Weather Service said, which would lead to river flooding that ""could last for days or weeks"" after the storm. Marchetti and his team of volunteers have been bracing for the latest test to their platform, building connections in civilian and sworn emergency services. They've been working to get the word out about the program as Florence churns off shore. ""This could be a big moment,"" he said Monday night. ""It's going to force us to be ready.""

Jonathan Shieber,"If the current presidential administration’s approach to climate change could be summarized in one sentence, it seems that sentence would be “smoke em if you got em.” By the administration’s own estimate, on its current course (if nations around the world do nothing more to respond to the climate change threat) the planet will warm by 7 degrees by the end of the century. It means, as one Twitter commentator pointed out, that climate change is not only real, but catastrophic… and the response is to burn more carbon because we’re all dead anyway. Well, at least they finally admitted it was real, said the man crawling out of the ensuing permanent desert hellstorm covering America into the more soothing environs of a 30 meter sea rise to quietly drown along with civilization as we know it… https://t.co/TwJ5nDwjtV — Matthew Ocko (@mattocko) September 28, 2018 If global temperatures rise 7 degrees, much of coastal America will find itself underwater. Ocean acidification will dissolve coral reefs and the world can expect dramatically more powerful and more damaging storms and more severe droughts and heatwaves. However, as The Washington Post reported, the dire assessment of the world’s climate situation wasn’t made with an eye toward trying to find solutions to the problem, merely to illustrate that the planet is already doomed. The revelations of our planet’s fate came buried in a 500-page report from the National Traffic Highway Safety Administration study that was meant to justify President Trump’s decision to drop fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks built after 2020. The administration’s argument is: if no one does anything more to combat climate change, then the world will be destroyed anyway, so there’s no point in doing anything to try and combat climate change. The (lack of) logic explains why the administration has rolled back emissions reduction requirements on methane (from oil and gas drilling and industrial animal farming), carbon dioxide (for coal fired power plants), and hydrofluorocarbons (used in refrigerators and air conditioners). The NTHSA report projects that global temperatures will rise by roughly 3.5 degrees above the last average temperature before climate change began to affect (the years between 1986 and 2005) whether or not the rules on fuel efficiency standards are enacted or not. The administration isn’t wrong in its assessment of where things stand now, but it is wrong in assuming that the current situation in any way reflects future realities. As the analysis states, the world will have to drastically slash carbon to avoid the kind of disastrous warming scenario. However, the assumption that the analysis reaches (as quoted by The Post ), that reducing emissions “would require substantial increases in technology innovation and adoption compared to today’s levels and would require the economy and the vehicle fleet to move away from the use of fossil fuels, which is not currently technologically feasible or economically feasible,” seems misplaced. It also flies in the face of repeated assertions by the President that climate change is a hoax. By acknowledging the existence of climate change and saying that nothing can be done to stop it, the new report provides a cover for all of the steps that have been taken by conservative lawmakers and the President’s cabinet to cut costs for industry. Meanwhile, the Carolinas are still underwater from flooding brought on by Hurricane Florence ( here are ways to donate ), and the risk of wildfires continues to increase in the West. This is fine.","If the current presidential administration’s approach to climate change could be summarized in one sentence, it seems that sentence would be “smoke em if you got em.” By the administration’s own estimate, on its current course (if nations around the world do …",2018-09-28T18:39:21Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}","As its own reports reveal the disaster of climate inaction, Trump proposes climate inaction",http://techcrunch.com/2018/09/28/as-its-own-reports-reveal-the-disaster-of-climate-inaction-trump-proposes-climate-inaction/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-28-at-8.53.34-AM.png?w=764,techcrunch,TechCrunch,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anna Mehler Paperny,"KINSTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Residents in Georgetown County, South Carolina, where five rivers flow into the ocean, will prepare on Friday for a deluge of water in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which has killed more than 40 people. Lying on Atlantic Ocean between Myrtle Beach and Charleston, the county of about 60,000 people is one of several areas across the Carolinas waiting anxiously for rivers to crest, a week after Florence dumped some three feet of rain in the region. Flooding could begin early next week, officials said during a community meeting on Thursday. The city of Georgetown on Friday will hand out 15,000 sandbags as the county develops plans to evacuate residents. “Please heed the warnings,” Sheriff Lane Cribb said. “Protecting lives and property will be our goal... You better pray. I think we all need to pray that it don’t happen.” More than three dozen flood gauges in North and South Carolina showed flooding. Some rivers had still not crested by Friday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Thirty-one deaths have been attributed to the storm in North Carolina, eight in South Carolina and one in Virginia. Some 4,700 people across North Carolina have been rescued by boat or helicopter since the storm made landfall, twice as many as in Hurricane Matthew two years ago, according to state officials. About 10,000 remain in shelters. The coastal city of Wilmington, North Carolina, remained cut off by floodwaters on Thursday. More than 200 roads across the state were closed or blocked as residents. Over 60,000 customers were without power in North Carolina early on Friday, according to Poweroutage.us. As floodwaters continue to rise, concerns are growing about the environmental and health dangers lurking in the water. The flooding has caused 21 hog “lagoons,” which store manure from pig farms, to overflow in North Carolina, creating a risk that standing water will be contaminated, according to the state’s Department of Environmental Quality. North Carolina is one of the leading hog-producing states in the country. Several sewer systems in the region also have released untreated or partly treated sewage and storm water into waterways over the last week, local media reported.

Andrew Freedman,"We've been warning for two days now that a major storm would develop along the East Coast and intensify so rapidly that it could earn a place in the record books. We were the first to call it a ""weather bomb"" or ""bomb cyclone,"" and now that that term has taken off in the broader media, it's important to understand just what it means. ""Bomb cyclone"" may seem like an obscure expression invented by meteorologists for attention, or to describe some sinister atmosphere terrorism plot, but it's actually rooted in the science of meteorology. SEE ALSO: 'Bomb cyclone' to pummel East Coast, followed by a polar vortex-related cold snap It refers to a meteorological phenomenon known as bombogenesis, in which a storm's minimum central pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. Such storms are common in the fall and winter along the East Coast, and most major snowstorms that hit the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast meet this definition. What's unusual about this particular storm is that it's likely to greatly exceed the typical intensification rate to qualify as a weather bomb, perhaps even doubling that rate. This would put it in the upper echelon of rapidly intensifying non-tropical storms in this part of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean Basin. Meteorologist Ryan Maue of Weather.us said on Twitter that this storm is likely to be in the top 15 percent of all ""bomb cyclones,"" based on the intensification rate. In general, the lower the air pressure, the stronger the storm. Computer model projections have consistently been showing that this storm could reach a peak intensity, as measured by its minimum air pressure, close to that of Hurricane Sandy when that monstrous storm slammed into the New Jersey coast in Oct. 2012. Global Density of locations of ""bomb cyclones"": Form along East coast of North America and Asia where ""jet stream"" entrance — an area very favorable for ascending air.

It then spirals inward toward the center, rises and exits through the top. If more air is leaving the storm than is sucked inward, the pressure falls even more and the system will continue to grow."" The rapid intensification of this storm, which the National Weather Service has repeatedly pointed to in its public forecast discussions, is tied to its impacts over land, because such a sharp drop in air pressure will cause extremely strong winds. The Weather Service is predicting winds as high as 50 miles per hour along much of the East Coast, including New York City, with gusts to hurricane force, or 75 miles per hour, across eastern New England. Recent past notable E. Coast winter storm approx. low pressures, per WPC, Unisys daily map archives (may not be exact lowest): - Stella (3/14/17): 976 mb - Juno (1/27/15): 975 mb - Nemo (2/9/13): 970 mb - #Grayson : possibly 950s mb. (Serious #wind threat coastal N. Eng.) pic.twitter.com/fZELVhnvis — Jonathan Erdman (@wxjerdman) January 3, 2018 Such winds, combined with heavy, wet snow, will cause blizzard conditions and power outages right before the coldest air of the season arrives on the backside of the storm, which is a worrisome prospect. The greatest risk for such outages is across southern New England, including the greater Boston area and Cape Cod and the Islands. The storm currently gathering strength over the Gulf Stream waters off the Southeast coast may end up being comparable in its intensification rate to a storm that struck New England in March of 2014, which brought 80 mile-per-hour winds to Cape Cod despite tracking farther off the coast than the present-day storm. Though the term may be new to you, ""bomb cyclone"" isn't a new weapon developed by some mad scientist, or a desperate attempt by weather nerds to get clicks. Instead, it's a type of storm that is relatively rare, but which you've probably experienced before. These storms are awesome to behold, transforming from small splotches of cloud cover to fully formed, comma-shaped behemoths in as little as 24 hours. This transformation will occur between today and tomorrow, leading to some spectacular weather satellite imagery. With weather communication, as well as science communication in general, it can often be difficult to engage a wide audience and make them aware of imminent risks. Pulling terminology from the scientific lexicon is a valid way to do that, provided that the terms match the phenomena being predicted. A similar dynamic played out with the polar vortex winter four years ago, when an actual weather term was popularized for the first time, and became part of popular culture seemingly overnight. Right now, it's bomb cyclone's turn. Perhaps next to come will be tropopause fold, or gravity wave (both real things).","We've been warning for two days now that a major storm would develop along the East Coast and intensify so rapidly that it could earn a place in the record books.

ALAN BLINDER,"• Local, state and federal officials are rushing to rescue people stranded in half-submerged homes across the region. So are many volunteers, including Tray Tillman, 26, a construction foreman who was part of a makeshift rescue flotilla that has plucked hundreds of stranded people from attics, second-floor bedrooms, church vestibules and crumbling decks. • View photos of the storm and its effects on areas across the Carolinas. • The New York Times is providing unlimited access to our coverage of Florence and Typhoon Mangkhut. Catch up on the rest of our coverage. More than one million power failures have been reported, according to the Department of Energy, but utility companies and the state authorities reported some successes in restoring service. Most of the outages were in North Carolina, but like their neighbors to the south, North Carolinians had known they were likely to face days of flooding from engorged rivers long after the immediate drama of flying shingles and TV newscasters staggering in the squalls. “There is a lot of rain to come,” said Jeff Byard, associate administrator for response and recovery at the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Saturday. He spoke during a news conference where a snapshot of the federal response so far emerged. The Coast Guard said 43 aircraft had rescued five people. The Army Corps of Engineers was engaging in a $6.1 million response, monitoring federal dams, helping with rescues, and deploying pumps and portable barriers. And while officials pleaded with residents not to try to drive on flooded streets, and warned that the storm still posed a serious threat, they also began preparing for what will most likely be a long and costly recovery. Some who had evacuated returned home on Saturday evening to survey the damage. Tanya Caulder of Coward, S.C., found a giant tree on her front lawn after spending two nights at a shelter. Fortunately, the tree had fallen away from the house and just missed the pump house, which her family used to get water. But Ms. Caulder, who had stayed at the shelter with 12 relatives, said she was still worried about flooding. During Hurricane Matthew, she said, the nearby Lynches River had sent water into her mobile home. All 13 members of the family would be staying at the house that night, she said, since only her place still had power. “But if I see water come up in the backyard, I’m out of here,” Ms. Caulder said.","The storm has sped up, leaving less time for its drenching rains to saturate the places in its path.",2018-09-16T12:37:21Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Tropical Depression Florence Updates: Rivers Swell as Death Toll Rises,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/16/us/hurricane-florence-path.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/us/17florence-01sub/17florence-01sub-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The New Food Economy,"As of Tuesday afternoon, more than a million people are under mandatory evacuation orders in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina as Hurricane Florence draws closer to the coast. Meteorologists are predicting that the Carolina coasts will start seeing tropical storm-force winds late Wednesday night, with hurricane-force winds arriving at around noon on Thursday and official landfall likely on Thursday night. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on Friday. The governor also lifted restrictions on weight-limited vehicles like semi-trucks so that farmers could harvest crops ahead of the storm. Heather Overton, assistant director of public affairs at the North Carolina Department of Agriculture &amp; Consumer Services, says the agency sent 12 regional agronomists to survey farmers around the state. They estimate about two-thirds of the state's tobacco and three-quarters of the corn have already been harvested, but sweet potato and peanut harvests are just getting underway. ""Farmers are working to get as much out of the fields as they can,"" Overton says. ""We urge them and everybody else to take the situation seriously."" Hog and poultry farmers have more to worry about than flooded barns. Meanwhile, the state's pork and poultry farmers are stocking up on feed and fuel and moving animals to higher ground. ""Some of the farms will have sent their birds to the processing plant a little early to move them off the farm,"" says Bob Ford, executive director of the North Carolina Poultry Federation. ""We're in pretty good shape,"" he adds. The pork industry seems similarly nonchalant: Andy Curliss, the North Carolina Pork Council CEO told Bloomberg he'd only be concerned if the state got more than 25 inches of rain. In reality, hog and poultry farmers have more to worry about than flooded barns. Animal agriculture produces about 10 billion pounds of wet waste a year in North Carolina, and a lot of that waste is stored in open lagoons. During Hurricane Floyd in 1999, those lagoons broke open and dumped waste into public waters, an environmental catastrophe that was later blamed for algal blooms and fish kills. During Hurricane Matthew in 2016, 14 lagoons flooded and millions of animals died. Yet in a blog post admonishing readers to ""beware of misleading narratives and check facts,"" the North Carolina Pork Council argued that the vast majority of lagoons operated as advertised during Matthew, which minimized the damage. Overton says North Carolina hog farmers have begun spraying manure onto fields to free up space in the lagoons should major rainfall accompany Florence. Transferring waste from the pit to the field helps minimize the risk of a flooded lagoon, but the state's Department of Environmental Quality regulates the amount of manure farmers are allowed to apply. Overton says that farmers have had several days to prepare, but restrictions on applying manure have not been lifted despite the pending storm. ""From what we understand, they are in pretty good shape."" Farmers are required to stop applying manure at a certain point after weather watches and warnings are issued by the National Weather Service — typically hours before the severe weather begins. This can put them in a double-bind: leave the manure in the lagoons and risk a breach caused by flooding, or break the law by applying it on the farm too late and risk letting it run off into the public water supply when the storm comes. There's a powerful incentive to break the rules. ""We have consistently, in advance of similar storms even of lesser intensity, witnessed illegal spraying after that prohibition is triggered,"" says Will Hendrick, staff attorney for the Waterkeeper Alliance, an environmental advocacy group. ""That's part of what we will be on the lookout for during our pre-storm monitoring."" Hendrick's team will also be monitoring agricultural flooding from the air so that it can alert state agencies to mobilize a response. He points out that the state of North Carolina doesn't always know where poultry farms are located — they're not required to apply for a permit. ""I don't think anyone is as optimistic as to assume that there won't be considerable damage in North Carolina,"" Hendrick says. ""We're going to do our best to determine it, assess it — and in particular, the damage that's caused by threats to water quality.""","Michael Conroy/AP As Hurricane Florence approaches the Carolinas, farmers need to work quickly to get as much out of their crops as they can and move animals to higher ground.

Aarathi Krishnan,"2017 set the record for costly devastation brought about by natural disasters globally. While our discussions about such events often concentrate on the pain and destruction they bring, we also see that these moments can bring about the best of humanity. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, for example, chef Jose Andres set up a network of kitchens that served millions of hot meals to Puerto Ricans. In Mexico, a group of 25 social organizations created a Google Crisis Map and took to social media directing updates on where help was most needed after the earthquake toppled buildings there. When Hurricane Matthew engulfed Haiti, it was the Digital Humanitarian Network that activated a bridge between professional humanitarian organizations and volunteer networks. These amazing responses pose an interesting question: Do citizens want to respond to humanitarian events independent of large aid organizations or governments? In a more globalized world, are the needs of the citizens impacted by disaster more complex? Do they no longer fit the traditional approaches and assumptions that aid organizations tend to operate in? [Photo: IFRC] Just like every other industry, the international aid and development sector is being disrupted by the vast global transformations that are occurring all around us. This has prompted the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to ask pivotal questions about its own relevance and whether it is fit for to address the next type of emergency, and the unique environment in which it will occur. In our new exhibit, The Future Is Now, we looked at a broad range of strategies to address these questions, in order to imagine scenarios in which the Red Cross much more effectively responds to those that are made vulnerable as a result of disasters, poverty, and inequality. Part of our analysis has resulted in the experiential scenarios and guerrilla artifacts you see here. The aim is not to predict the future (as one can’t!) but rather, to understand the complex contexts in which change is happening. We aren’t just presenting future scenarios of humanitarian need, but rather a holistic view of what society might look like, what people would want, need, and how they would interact each other in the decades ahead. This is a subtle but clear delineation again from how humanitarian futures thinking has traditionally been done. When we started the design for this exhibit, we faced skepticism. These installations can seem too far removed from everyday reality for such a practical, hands-on organization. So it was essential that the proposals weren’t too ‘out there,’ but could be understood in the contexts that our people operate in — and pushed us to consider the possibilities of the future, regardless of whether any of these scenarios do turn into reality. Citizenship Kit ( Changeist, 2017) [Photo: IFRC] This scenario hypothesizes single-use dynamic temporary citizenship. The Citizenship Kit builds on a steady upward trend in political and climate-driven disruption, resulting in hundreds of thousands unable to remain in their home states. The framework for dynamic national mobility (DyNaMo) builds on the precedent and practice of successful long-term e-residency programs developed by Estonia in the 2010s. It allows displaced individuals to gain digital-legal “citizenship”–though not necessarily rights to physical residency. The Kit places between 2,000 and 50,000 people into a pool for temporary legal “citizenships” and provides a means of extending local legal and welfare systems for up to 120 days to those displaced from countries under meaningful threat from war, genocide or non-voluntary resettlement due to a natural disaster or other significant cause. These temporary “citizenships” are extended solely for the purposes of enabling delivery of financial, medical or other critical assistance that could only be supplied under cover of an appropriate national safety net. Similar to the way internet addresses or prepaid mobile numbers are assigned dynamically, these temporary citizenships can be assigned in the field by trained relief workers, then expired and returned to the pool in 120 days or earlier as deemed by the issuing country or relief body. Protection and benefits are only delivered in the field or in approved third-country transit, and are not useable for actual resettlement in the issuing country, though they do provide a special category of humanitarian consideration should the recipient wish to apply for resettlement in the issuing country. The benefits of this include not only the ability to provide different kinds and levels of protection and relief that are situation- or location-specific, but also allows issuing countries to better control emergency migration and aid delivery without over-burdening its own capacities to respond. DONAID ( Superflux, 2017) [Photo: IFRC] This scenario hypothesizes a future in which cryptocurrencies have replaced all traditional forms of money. DONAID is a donation platform in which citizens earn their salaries in cryptocurrency and a portion of salaries are automatically donated to a project or cause of their choosing. The portion of salary donated is derived from cryptocurrency mining, which is an essential component of their salary transaction process. Through this component, citizens can choose to donate to Red Cross Red Crescent programs directly without going through an intermediary. Cryptocurrency mining is typically an environmentally unfriendly activity, consuming vast amounts of power to generate the currency. To rectify this, DONAIDs’ model is based on small but frequent currency generation sessions. A user would dedicate between 1% and 20% or 1 – 20 mins of power to mine a small amount of cryptocurrency per day. The created “coins” or money would then be donated to the Red Cross Red Crescent. Extensive specialized hardware does not need to be used and citizens process this on their own personal devices, enabling a much more efficient and effective transaction. RC Voluntair ( Superflux, 2017) [Photo: IFRC] What if artificial intelligence completely took over all jobs and organizations were run by algorithms and not humans? Can algorithms make ethical decisions about where aid resources are allocated and where? RC Voluntair hypothesizes a future Red Cross organization that is wholly virtual. No physical office exists, and neither do traditional job functions. This future Red Cross organization is an advanced algorithm that independently manages a global network of newsfeeds, data sets, aid workers and volunteers to anticipate and allocate aid and relief resources where and when they are needed most. Volunteers are indexed by their skill sets and geolocation and can be called upon by the system to quickly and efficiently respond to emerging situations. Traditional job functions no longer exist and have been replaced by automated processes and decision making. The powerful machine-learning system enables Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to employ predictive distribution strategies placing aid infrastructure before natural disasters and crises strike. Floating Nations ( Edge DNA, 2017) [Photo: IFRC] This scenario hypothesizes a future where climate change impacts have made arable land and water increasingly scarce. Thus, entirely new countries or cities are created on floating islands as a solution to rising sea levels that have driven entire populations living on coastlines, edge of drylands, and urban floodplains away from their homes permanently. These new floating nations have entire systems for housing, farming, and manufacturing on them to sustain their citizens for years. It utilizes natural resources including sun, wind, and waves for energy self-sufficiency and has entirely new governance models in place. New World Times 2030 ( Open Lab at Newcastle University and IFRC) [Photo: IFRC] In 2017, more than 4,000 Red Cross youth volunteers across 120 countries played a global, multiplayer online game for 10 days: WhatFutures. The game was played entirely on WhatsApp and used simulations to gather the perspectives and voices of the young person on what their vision of the future was for themselves and their friends and family. What they want to inherit is a world that has artificial blood, 3D printed building, autonomous policing, humanitarian drones, microgrids, and a new world map. We turned their winning submissions into a Newspaper from the Future – entirely imagined by them. Are we fit for this future ?

Amanda Kooser,"The Bahama Nuthatch isn't gone yet, but it's still endangered. Matthew Gardner, University of East Anglia Six weeks and a 250-mile (400-kilometer) trek on foot through a thick forest. That's what it took for a research team to rediscover an endangered bird thought likely to be extinct. The team, led by students from the University of East Anglia (UEA) in the UK, went in search of what the university describes as ""one of the rarest birds in the Western Hemisphere."" The Bahama Nuthatch looked like a goner after the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016. The dainty bird is found only in a pine forest on Grand Bahama Island. UEA released brief video footage of the bird this week. The nuthatch was estimated to have a population of about 1,800 in 2004, but a 2007 survey uncovered just 23 birds. Habitat destruction due to logging and storm damage have contributed to the bird's precarious situation. The team played a recording of the nuthatch's ""distinctive high-pitched squeaky call"" to lure it out of hiding. ""Our researchers looked for the bird across 464 survey points in 34,000 hectares of pine forest,"" said Diana Bell from UEA's School of Biological Sciences, who likened the expedition ""looking for a needle in a haystack."" A second team led by students from the University of The Bahamas-North also scoured the forest. Both teams separately caught sight of the birds in May. The UEA team logged six sightings while the other team counted five, including one of two birds together. Despite the joy of finding the elusive bird, some of the researchers aren't optimistic about its prospects. ""Sadly,"" Bell said, ""we think that the chances of bringing this bird back from the brink of extinction are very slim, due to the very low numbers left, and because we are not sure of the precise drivers for its decline.""

Brian Snyder,"PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Rescue workers and volunteers searched on Tuesday for scores of people still unaccounted for in the Florida Panhandle as residents rejoiced at restored phone services and portable toilets after the area was devastated by Hurricane Michael last week. At least 19 deaths in four states have been blamed on Michael which made landfall on Wednesday as one of the most powerful storms on record to hit the continental United States. Teams from the volunteer rescue organization CrowdSource were trying to contact hundreds of people reported missing in the disaster zone in the Panhandle, according to Matthew Marchetti, co-founder of the Houston-based group. As cellphone service returned, the number of people unaccounted for in Mexico Beach, one of the hardest-hit areas, dropped to three, Rex Putnal, a city councilor, said in a telephone interview. “Hopefully, they left and we’ll find them safe somewhere,” he said, before heading to a clean-up effort where workers awaited the arrival of some overdue portable toilets. “This type of living wears on you,” Putnal said. “This is about my fifth day and I’m just not used to washing clothes in a tub with no washer and dryer and eating only peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.” The mayor of the town of about 1,200 residents, which took a direct hit from the hurricane, said a second person, a woman, was found dead on Monday afternoon. With most Mexico Beach homes already searched for survivors, rescue workers were using dogs to find any bodies that might be buried under the debris. More than 200,000 people were still without power in the U.S. Southeast, with residents of battered coastal towns such as Port St. Joe, Florida forced to cook on fires and barbecue grills. At least 80 percent of customers in three mainly rural Panhandle counties were without electricity on Tuesday. Officials said it could be weeks before power returns to the areas that sustained the most damage. CAMPING IN TENTS Countless residents in the region’s backcountry have struggled for days without electricity, running water or sanitation as they await help from authorities. Some have been camping in tents with the belongings they were able to salvage. “I’m staying out here to try to keep away looters, to try to save what I can save,” said Bernard Sutton, a 64-year-old cancer patient, who has been living out of a tent and broken-down minivan. “This is everything we own right here,” he said, standing over a heap of clothes, books, furniture and other belongings. Access to those stranded by the storm was hampered by downed oak trees across highways and dirt roads. “Everyone needs help,” said Gabriel Schaw, 40, gesturing to a handful of neighbors surrounding his own demolished mobile home in Fountain, Florida. “We’re devastated out here. We’re wiped off the map.” The state government is distributing ice, water and about 3 million ready-to-eat meals, according to Governor Rick Scott’s office. With top sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (250 km per hour), Michael slammed into the Florida Panhandle as a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale on Wednesday. The winds and storm surge caused insured losses worth between an estimated $6 billion and $10 billion, risk modeler AIR Worldwide said. Those figures do not include losses paid out by the National Flood Insurance Program or uninsured property, AIR Worldwide said. Water supply was restored to some residents in Panama City on Monday but Bay County officials said it was not yet safe to drink. U.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump visited the storm-affected areas on Monday, arriving by helicopter from Eglin Air Force Base about 100 miles (160 km) to the west. They distributed bottles of water at an aid center in Lynn Haven, a city of about 18,500 people near Panama City in northwestern Florida. “To see this personally is very tough - total devastation,” said Trump, who later traveled to neighboring Georgia to see the storm damage there.

Brian Snyder,"PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - A week after Hurricane Michael battered Florida’s Gulf Coast with record fury, the full extent of devastation and loss of life remained unclear on Wednesday, as disruptions to phone, power and transportation systems hindered the disaster recovery. At least 30 people were killed, according to local authorities, when Michael plowed ashore as one of the fiercest hurricanes on record to strike the U.S. mainland, pulverizing a cluster of seaside towns along Florida’s northwestern Panhandle region. Seven days later search crews continued combing through the wreckage of demolished neighborhoods looking for any sign of additional victims in Panama City Beach, Mexico Beach and Port St. Joe, the communities closest to the storm’s landfall. Distribution of food and water to storm-stricken residents farther inland has been slowed by communication outages and storm-shattered roads blocked by toppled trees, power lines and other debris. Florida officials have not said how many people may be missing. Teams of volunteers with the Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue organization were trying to reach more than 700 Florida residents reported unaccounted for by worried relatives and friends, said Matthew Marchetti, the organization’s co-founder. Most of that number, down from 2,100 people the group was trying to locate in the immediate aftermath of the storm, are from Panama City and many of them are elderly, disabled, impoverished or living alone, Marchetti said. He said the search had been hampered by spotty cell phone service in the devastated area, though authorities were making progress in restoring communications. High volumes of missing persons reports are not uncommon in the days following a natural disaster because so many survivors fail to check in with loved ones right away or lack the means to do so because of phone and power outages, authorities said. Nevertheless, at least 48,000 Florida residents in the 12 counties hardest hit by Hurricane Michael had registered for disaster assistance as of Wednesday with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA spokesman Ruben Brown told Reuters. That number represents about 7 percent of the population of the 12 counties designated by President Donald Trump’s federal disaster declaration as eligible for FEMA aid to individuals and households. Nearly a third, or more than 15,000 people, reported storm damage to their homes when they signed up with FEMA, though the full scope of property losses remained to be seen, Brown said. As of Wednesday, 286 families left homeless by the storm in Bay County, at the epicenter of the disaster, were approved for FEMA-furnished hotel vouchers, he said. Florida accounted for 20 of the known fatalities attributed to Hurricane Michael, with six more in Virginia, three in North Carolina and one in Georgia, according to a Reuters tally of reports from county officials along the path of the storm. Officials said medical examiners were determining whether another four deaths in Florida were storm-related. As of Tuesday, FEMA had distributed about 4.5 million meals, more than 5 million liters of water and 9 million infant-and-toddler kits, Brown said. The state government was distributing ice, water and about 3 million ready-to-eat meals, Governor Rick Scott’s office said. Nearly 155,000 homes and businesses remained without power in the U.S. Southeast, with residents of battered coastal towns forced to cook on fires and barbecue grills. At least 70 percent of customers in four mainly rural Florida Panhandle counties were without electricity on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the federal government said that 61.5 percent of cell sites remained out of service in Bay County. Officials said it could be weeks before power returns to some. Countless numbers of people in the region’s backcountry have struggled for days without running water or sanitation, awaiting help from authorities. Some have been camping in tents with the belongings they were able to salvage.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected on Wednesday to visit North Carolina, where thousands of homes and roadways remain underwater and swollen rivers threaten more flooding less than a week after Hurricane Florence made landfall. Trump, who has been criticized for his response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, plans to arrive at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina, at about 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) and return to Washington at 6:15 p.m. (2215 GMT), according to the White House. More than 15,000 people remain in shelters and more than 200,000 customers are without power across North Carolina, six days after Florence made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, according to state officials. “We continue to feel the effects of this massive storm,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Tuesday. “Even though there is no substantial rain in the forecast and the sun may be shining across many parts of our state, rivers continue to rise and we will see more flooding.” The Cape Fear River was expected to crest at 61.5 feet (19 meters), four times its normal height, on Wednesday in Fayetteville, a city of 200,000 near the Fort Bragg army base in the southern part of the state, according to the National Weather Service. That has disrupted efforts to restore power, clear roads and allow evacuated residents to go home. “There is a strong potential that those who live within the 1-mile evacuation area of the Cape Fear River will be impacted by flooding,” the city said in a statement. The city manager told CNN that 12,000 people are “in harm’s way.” Florence has killed at least 35 people, including 26 in North Carolina and eight in South Carolina, where local media reported that two female mental health patients drowned on Tuesday after a sheriff’s van they were in crashed. One person was killed in Virginia by a tornado that spun off from Florence. SWOLLEN RIVERS Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas. Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage resulting from Florence, which has dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina since Thursday. At least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage, with three others set to crest in the coming days in North Carolina, the state said. In the town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, which has struggled to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, only about 50 residents remained on Tuesday, Fair Bluff Police Chief Chris Chafin told Reuters. The town has largely been cut off by flooding from the still-rising Lumber River, which was expected to crest on Wednesday. As Florence was bearing down on the Carolinas last week, Trump reignited the controversy over his handling of Maria by disputing the official death toll of 2,975 in the U.S. territory, which was compiled by public health experts at George Washington University. Trump said, without offering evidence, that Democrats had inflated the figure to make him look bad. In addition to the deaths, Maria devastated the infrastructure of Puerto Rico, whose 3 million citizens are Americans but do not vote in presidential elections, and left much of the island without power for months. Critics said the Trump administration was slow to recognize the extent of the damage and slow to help.

Harriet McLeod,"CHARLESTON, S.C./RALEIGH, N.C. (Reuters) - Thousands of people in the Georgetown, South Carolina, area were urged to evacuate their homes on Tuesday as rainwater unleashed by Hurricane Florence surged down rivers, threatening to submerge some neighborhoods under 10 feet of water. Georgetown, which sits at the confluence of the Waccamaw, Great Pee Dee and Sampit rivers, was largely spared the initial fury of Florence, which came ashore on Sept. 14 as a Category 1 hurricane, killing 46 people in three states. But the port city of more than 9,000 stands in the path of what the National Weather Service has said could be significant flooding as water dumped by the storm system drains to the ocean. “We are urging people to take this event seriously. We expect the flooding to be worse than Hurricane Matthew a couple years ago,” said Randy Akers, deputy public information officer for Georgetown County. “We always urge people to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.” Akers said between 6,000 and 8,000 people have been exhorted to leave, but it was not clear how many had done so as of Tuesday evening. He said the county lacked authority to mandate evacuations. “We do have some concerns that people are not taking this event as seriously as they should,” he said. Parts of Georgetown could be submerged in up to 10 feet (3 meters) of water in the coming days as the Pee Dee and Waccamaw rivers overrun their banks, the National Weather Service said, adding that the deluge threatened to cut off highways and isolate communities. COAL ASH POND COULD FLOOD In neighboring Conway County, the Waccamaw, which was already well above flood stage on Tuesday, could inundate a coal ash pond that holds more than 200,000 tons of toxic ash, according to Santee Cooper, South Carolina’s state-owned electric and water utility. Santee Cooper said it has removed more than 1 million tons of coal ash, which can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife, from the site in the past few years. The Waccamaw was forecast to crest on Thursday at 22 feet in Conway and at 21.2 feet in Georgetown, a representative with the South Carolina Emergency Management Division said. The potential flood zone encompasses roughly 3,500 homes in Georgetown, 37 miles (60 km) south of Myrtle Beach, and the coastal resort community of Pawleys Island where as many as 8,000 people live, Georgetown County spokeswoman Jackie Broach-Akers said. Authorities warned residents in harm’s way with recorded telephone messages and home visits. The county opened two emergency shelters on Monday, and hotels in nearby Myrtle Beach were offering discounts to evacuees. Public schools were closed until further notice. State transportation crews were working to erect temporary dams on either side of U.S. Highway 17, the main coastal route through the area, and National Guard engineers were installing a floating bridge at Georgetown in case the highway is washed out at the river. In North Carolina, Governor Roy Cooper said on Monday that seven rivers in the southeast part of the state were at major flood stages and three others at moderate flood stages.Meanwhile a new storm was brewing in the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, bringing scattered showers and thunderstorms across the Carolinas on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Rod Nickel,"MEXICO BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Search and rescue volunteers have located hundreds of people reported missing in the U.S. Southeast after Hurricane Michael tore through their Florida Panhandle communities, but the death toll of at least 18 was expected to rise. Crews heard cries for help and crowbarred into a mobile home crumpled by the storm in Panama City, freeing a mother and daughter, both diabetics who had been trapped in a closet without insulin for two days and were on the verge of diabetic shock, rescuers said on Saturday. “We had another lady who was on her last tank of oxygen. No cell phone, no power, no nothing. There are people out here on dialysis, but there is no power,” said Taylor Fontenot, 29, a roofing contractor from Sugar Land, Texas, and founder of 50 Star SAR, a volunteer search and rescue organization. In door-to-door searches, teams consisting mostly of off-duty police officers and firefighters have found more than 520 of the 2,100 people reported missing since Michael crashed ashore near Mexico Beach, Florida, on Wednesday as one of the most powerful storms in U.S. history. “We expect that number to go up dramatically today,” said Matthew Marchetti, co-founder of the Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue, adding that hopes were raised by an influx of volunteers on the weekend and the restoration of power in some areas. “Volunteers are working side-by-side with first responders. They are cutting holes in roofs. They try to take a picture so we can call the family and tell them we made contact,” he said. But as roads were cleared to allow wider searches, the death toll was expected to mount. As of Saturday, authorities were reporting at least 18 deaths in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia. Rescue teams, hampered by power and telephone outages, used cadaver dogs, drones and heavy equipment to hunt for people in the rubble. Fontenot, who said he alerts authorities when he finds corpses, has a cadaver dog with his group. “When we pulled into Mexico Beach, she was trying to jump out the window because she smelled so many bodies,” he said. In Callaway, Florida, an especially hard-hit town, Catholic Christians barbecued hamburgers on Saturday and Scientologists handed out water. “I’m homeless,” said nursing assistant Carla Covington, 45, who is caring for her mother and two children after their house was destroyed by falling trees. She said it felt good to receive comfort, but was also hard. “I’m used to helping people and not asking for help,” she said, her voice breaking with emotion. Panama City port worker Josh Jackson, 29, had three cars damaged. The rented home he lived in with his girlfriend and son was wrecked, as were their possessions. “I lost everything so I got to start over,” he said near a tent in a parking lot where a Geico insurance agent was taking claims. Jackson said he plans to move to a community that was not so badly hit, but was concerned that delays processing his insurance claim might hold him up. Michael ripped most of two walls out from the red-brick St. Andrew United Methodist Church in Panama City, but parishioners spent Saturday handing out food, water and clothes to others. “Our whole city was hit. There has got be a way it can recover,” said Jo Ann Sutter, 73, a volunteer who was married in the church. “We will.” The tropical storm, which grew in less than two days into a Category 4 hurricane, tore apart entire neighborhoods. More than 1,700 search and rescue workers were deployed, including seven swift-water rescue teams and nearly 300 ambulances, Florida Governor Rick Scott’s office said. Power and phone service were being slowly restored, with about 236,000 homes and businesses still without power in North Carolina, down from a peak of more than 600,000, said spokesman Keith Acree of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety. It could be weeks before power is restored to the most damaged parts of Florida.

"USA TODAY, Christal Hayes, USA TODAY","Sandbagging in Lumberton, N.C. to prepare for Hurricane Florence Nashville Tennessean Lumberton resident Robert Chavis, 41, carries a filled sandbag as volunteers and the North Carolina National Guard reinforce a low-lying area as Hurricane Florence approaches Lumberton, N.C., Friday, Sept. 14, 2018. (Photo: ANDREW NELLES/THE TENNESSEAN/USA TODAY NETWORK) LUMBERTON, N.C. – Trees swayed as powerful gusts tossed shingles and other debris down roads. The rain whipped in the wind, feeling like nails against the skin. But dozens of residents in Lumberton remained outside, some without rain jackets, doing manual labor. “We’ve got to protect our community. Florence isn’t gonna get us,” Robert Chavis, 41, said before lifting his shovel and filling another woven bag with sand. It was two years ago that water from the Lumber River broke free from its banks, taking over low-lying areas in the region. It moved through ditches on either side of nearby train tracks and flooded neighborhoods. The devastation from Hurricane Matthew overwhelmed the city and took lives. More: Florence downgraded to tropical storm, but winds, rain still punishing Carolinas More: Florence made landfall in North Carolina. What's next for the weekend? Bruce Mullis lost his father-in-law during the storm. He drowned trying to get out as the waters rose. Mullis said he rushed down to the West Lumberton Baptist Church to help fill sandbags Friday and clog the ditches in hopes of saving others this time around. “It’s hard going through it all over again,” he said. “It’s only been two years. It’s honestly traumatizing.” The effort all started with a Facebook post by state Sen. Danny Britt. “I told everyone that I had a plan but it was gonna be a project and I’d need some help,” Britt said. “Then it just blew up. People from all over were asking what they could do.” The dozens of volunteers who showed up heard mostly over social media or by word of mouth. “It’s just that type of place,” said Joshua Malcolm, 48. “I can’t really put it in words why we’re all out here doing all this, but if you look at the photos of this area after Matthew, you get it. We really care.” Volunteers fills sandbags to reinforce a low-lying area as Hurricane Florence approaches Lumberton, N.C., Friday. (Photo: ANDREW NELLES/THE TENNESSEAN/USA TODAY NETWORK) In the end, more than 5,000 sandbags packed the path the water took that devastated the area. The National Guard reinforced the line with concrete barriers. “This is our last ditch effort,” said Corey Walters, deputy director of public works in the city of Lumberton. “We’re hoping this weathers it and prevents the devastation we saw during Matthew.” If it doesn’t, he says the community could likely see millions of dollars in damage again, something they can’t afford “This is the poorest county and the poorest city in the county, so it’s really in a tough spot,” Walters said. “Your heart really breaks for them because you know they just went through this and no one can afford to do it again.” Walters said the railroad shut down Friday morning, which allowed for the work to happen. “That’s the only reason we’re all out here in a hurricane,” he said. “We would have had this patched well before the storm.” Last Slide Next Slide Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2xd7iHk","It was two years ago that water from the Lumber River broke free from its path, taking over low-lying areas in the region.

Robert Peary’s expedition in 1909. What it didn’t mention were the people with him, specifically Matthew Henson, who was hired as Peary’s valet but became an invaluable navigator and interpreter. Photo Matthew Henson, Arctic explorer. In the decades after the expedition, the roles of Henson and the party’s four Inuit members — Ootah, Seeglo, Egingwah, and Ooqueah — were played down. Henson, who was African-American, was working at a store in Washington when he met Peary. Their partnership lasted through eight Arctic expeditions over more than 20 years. Peary acknowledged, “I can’t get along without him.” Henson was the first to plant the American flag when Peary’s group believed it had reached the North Pole. Henson died in obscurity in 1955 at the age of 88. In 1988, he was reburied in Arlington National Cemetery, next to Peary. At the re-internment, S. Allen Counter, who campaigned to have Henson recognized, said: “We are assembled here today to right a tragic wrong, to right the record.” “Welcome home, Matt Henson, to the company of your friend Robert Peary.

Shelly Sigo,"With floodwaters still rising in parts of the Carolinas, the devastation wrought by Hurricane Florence may spur Congress to enact legislation that will help mitigate such damage in the future. Nothing would make Alan Rubin happier. Rubin, a principal with Blank Rome Government Relations LLC and a member of the firms severe weather emergency recovery team, accompanied the Federal Emergency Management Agency to New Bern and Wilmington, North Carolina, on Saturday and Sunday. It was pretty destructive, Rubin said of what he observed. North Carolina officials are doing an incredible job of moving quickly into recovery efforts, Rubin said, adding, Theres not much they can do until the flooding is over in South Carolina. Hurricane Florence made landfall around 7:15 a.m. Sept. 14 near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, about 20 miles east-southeast of Wilmington. Although Florence was a major Category 4 hurricane as it approached the Carolinas, it slowed before impact and struck Wrightsville Beach as a Category 1 hurricane with winds around 90 mph. Water, not wind, was Florence's main weapon. Dumping rain for days, Florence flooded cities and farms, and is still pushing rivers over their banks. At least 43 deaths had been counted in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia as of Tuesday. Early damage estimates from insured and uninsured losses in North and South Carolina are estimated at $40 billion, plus an additional $4 billion in economic losses, Rubin said. A much-needed measure that will help mitigate the magnitude of such losses in the future will be available soon, he said, adding that it could also bolster the bond ratings of state and local governments. Congress is poised to pass the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 in H.R. 302, which Rubin said will address disaster mitigation and funding for its implementation by FEMA. The bill would also reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration for five years. After seeing some of Florences devastation first hand in North Carolina, Rubin said he believes people will accept measures that would harden and raise structures and protect them from future disasters, especially those who have experienced repeated losses. I think people are ready to take a look at this and say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, he said. Were finally getting to the point where people recognize that we cant survive on emergency relief and we have to start thinking about resiliency. Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, called on Congress to approve the bipartisan legislation in an Investors Business Daily op-ed released by his committee on Tuesday. It costs less to prevent and minimize damage and to strengthen our communities than it does to simply spend resources on recovery afterward - a common-sense approach but not one that our federal programs currently emphasize, Shuster wrote. Facilitating and incentivizing mitigation is the most effective means of bending the cost curve for disasters. According to the National Association of Counties, the House was expected to vote on the bill Wednesday. Rubin said he expected a vote in the Senate by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. The bill would provide $8.8 billion in emergency relief for states battered by Florence, and introduce a separate revenue stream for FEMAs mitigation program - $950 million in performance grants through 2022. Im very excited about it, said Rubin, who counseled lawmakers on what should be included in the bill based on his experience with multiple natural disasters. That experience includes working with officials post-Hurricane Andrew, a category 5 storm that decimated south Florida in 1992 and destroyed 165,000 homes. It caused about $46 billion of damage in todays dollars and led Florida to implement some of the strongest building codes in the country. The place looked like it was nuked, Rubin said of the damage created by Andrews winds. The land wasnt inundated by water. Strengthening building codes, he said, helped mainland Florida stave off massive damage from Hurricane Irma in September 2017. Rubin said he expects measures such as stronger building codes and requiring building to be built higher to withstand flooding will also help communities a great deal in protecting their creditworthiness. People will actually start looking at green bonds, he said, adding that federal, local and private funds can be leveraged to pay for projects that address resiliency and the increase in severe weather that some believe is driven by climate change. Green bonds are an asset class that attract investors interested in socially responsible investing. Rubin also said there are circumstances where pre-planning would address some known conditions such as the rain-driven flooding some areas of Carolinas experienced with Florence. I dont think anyone can be prepared for 40 inches of rain and inland flooding in vast rivers and lakes, he said. Thats part of North Carolinas charm that they have all these lakes and rivers some areas are called lowlands for a reason. They are very pretty but people have to think about how to address living in this environment and make it part of their economic development going forward. Florence could also impact some credits where parts of the Carolinas were unprepared for Florences impacts, including areas that never flooded before. Thats where rating agencies are monitoring the extent of the damage, particularly to public infrastructure. We continue our process of contacting issuers we believe could have potential credit-related events associated with the storm, S&amp;P Global Ratings analyst Bianca Gaytan-Burrell said Tuesday. For both local governments and utilities we believe the affected issuers are mostly located along the North Carolina coastline where the storm came ashore near Wilmington, N.C., and where concentration of the damage and flooding appears greatest. In some instances, if theres an indication of extreme or prolonged fiscal stress in response to damage or flooding from the storm, S&amp;P said it may place ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications or modify stable outlooks to negative. S&amp;P said typical credit-related impacts from hurricanes can include inability to treat water and wastewater for an extended time, a permanent loss of customer base, immediate loss of revenues, unexpected capital costs, and cash flow problems from financing cleanup costs before FEMA reimbursements or grants are received. Geographically, S&amp;P said its efforts are focused in New Hanover, Onslow and Brunswick counties in North Carolina. S&amp;P said it is not yet known whether the Cape Fear River a source of drinking water supply in east central North Carolina - has been fouled by the coal ash from Duke Energy's nearby facilities. We view this systemic risk as potentially most detrimental to credit quality, and will look to understand this aspect of creditworthiness in addition to any short-term financial effects as we make contact with issuers, said Gaytan-Burrell. As far as utilities are concerned, S&amp;P said it expects the costs of restoring service, the cost of replacement power, and long-term capital costs for damages and customer dislocations will be manageable or minimal. While we also understand additional flooding could still occur as some waterways are expected to rise further, we don't anticipate significant electric service disruptions or damage, Gaytan-Burrell said. As a result, we do not expect any rating actions on U.S. retail and wholesale electric, cooperative electric, and combined utility issuers in North Carolina or South Carolina. S&amp;P said it believes local government obligors that could experience potential credit impacts include the North Carolina counties of Craven, Bertie, Edgecombe County, Halifax, Hertford, Northampton, Onslow, Bladen, Cumberland, Duplin, Lenoir, Pitt, Robeson, Sampson, Wayne, New Hanover, Carteret, Dare, Pender, and Brunswick. Municipalities in North Carolina that could be impacted are Greenville, the city of Wilmingtons stormwater system, Fayetteville, Goldsboro, and the Town of River Bend. North Carolina utilities S&amp;P is watching include the Cape Fear Public Utilities Authority, the Brunswick County water and sewer system, the Onslow Water and Sewer Authority, and the Town of Oak Islands water and sewer system. Public power utilities under review include: Brunswick Electric Membership Corp., North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency, North Carolina Electric Membership Corp., and power systems owned by the cities of Concord, Fayetteville, Greenville, Monroe, and Shelby. In South Carolina, S&amp;P said public utilities being reviewed for impacts include: Central Electric Power Cooperative Inc., Piedmont Municipal Power Agency, the state-owned South Carolina Public Service Authority also known as Santee Cooper and municipal power services owned by the cities of Camden, Easley, Greenwood, Greer, Newberry, and Rock Hill. Although rising floodwaters could impact inland issuers, S&amp;P said the credit effects there are probably more short-term and cash-flow related as opposed to being systemic and long-term. Because of state and federal disaster declarations, S&amp;P said it expects most cleanup and repair costs to eventually be reimbursed by either insurance coverage or FEMA. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said Monday that 27 counties have been approved for federal assistance for uninsured and underinsured damage resulting from Hurricane Florence. Approximately 80,000 people have registered for disaster assistance and more than $26 million in federal disaster assistance has been approved for individuals and families, he said. Florence is gone but the storms devastation is still with us, Cooper said, adding that the state has shifted to full-time recovery efforts. In its latest estimate, Moodys Analytics said it believes Hurricane Florences costs have risen to between $38 billion and $50 billion, based on damage to property, vehicle losses and lost output losses that result in a more disruptive storm than its strength and path may have implied. Many of the areas that experienced flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew are enduring similar tribulations this fall, but the footprint appears to be significantly broader following Florence, stretching about 200 miles west from the North Carolina coast and spanning 150 miles from north to south, extending into South Carolina, according to analyst Ryan Sweet and researcher Adam Kamins. Matthew struck the area in October 2016. The pair estimates most damage is to single-family homes based on the destruction associated with similar past storms and the value of single-family housing in affected counties. These losses will no doubt be exacerbated by a lack of flood insurance, they said. With flood insurance coverage lacking largely because of outdated flood maps that have allowed many homeowners to remain uninsured despite the risk, they said it will be more difficult for the region to be made whole. This problem mirrors the types of issues that plagued rebuilding efforts during Hurricane Harvey and speaks to the growing ineffectiveness of the National Flood Insurance Program, Sweet and Kamins said. Rubin said the bill before Congress will help mitigate flooding and repeat events. It makes a huge difference when you have different revenue streams for recovery and mitigation, he said. In North Carolina, Rubin said an example of one problem that has emerged is pollution in flood waters from pig feces from farms that didnt have appropriate sanitation to deal with flooding. As many as 50 man-made pits called lagoons that collect animal waste were flooded, according to state officials. Some of the [federal] preparedness and recovery money can give them opportunities to come up with better systems so that if it does flood again there wont be the environmental nightmare they have today, Rubin said.","Bond Buyer Hurricane Florence may spur Congress to pass damage mitigation bill Bond Buyer With floodwaters still rising in parts of the Carolinas, the devastation wrought by Hurricane Florence may spur Congress to enact legislation that will help mitigate suc…",2018-09-26T17:20:47Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Bondbuyer.com'}",Hurricane Florence may spur Congress to pass damage mitigation bill - Bond Buyer,https://www.bondbuyer.com/news/hurricane-florence-may-push-congress-to-pass-mitigation-bill,https://assets.sourcemedia.com/dims4/default/97c4c53/2147483647/crop/1664x874%2B0%2B0/resize/1200x630%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.sourcemedia.com%2F64%2F7c%2Ff0a264c54c79a7252ea39766f41a%2Fhurricane-florence-approaches-us-091218-credit-noaa.png,,Bondbuyer.com,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dan Vergano,"Hurricane history has a dire warning for Hurricane Florence, now a Category 4 storm with sustained winds around 140 miles-per-hour, aimed right at North Carolina and South Carolina. Upgraded in strength on Monday, and threatening to become a Category 5 storm, the major hurricane has prompted evacuations from coastal counties in both Carolinas and Virginia. Current projections place North Carolina in the storm’s bullseye. “Wherever you live in North Carolina, you need to get ready for this storm now and you need to evacuate if asked to,” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said in a statement. He cited storm surges along the coast, flooding from rains inland, and high winds statewide as reasons for concern about life-threatening dangers of the hurricane. Cooper has good reason to worry, based on past major hurricanes that have hit his state and those nearby hard, all doing damage in different, severe ways that took lives and cost billions of dollars in damages. Experts such as Nick Petro of the National Weather Service are pointing, in particular, to storms such as Hurricane Hugo in 1989 (the last major hurricane to hit South Carolina), Hurricane Fran in 1996 (the most recent major hurricane to strike North Carolina), and Hurricane Matthew in 2016, as models for the mayhem threatened by the coming storm. Hurricane Florence threatens to pack the combined wallop of all three storms, with projected 20 foot storm surges along the coast, 145 mph high winds of a Category 4 (or higher) major storm, and more than 10 inches of heavy rainfall possible, dumping rainwater on the already sodden Eastern Seaboard. A high pressure weather system developing north of the storm threatens to slow its progress after landfall, raising the specter of it parking in place like Hurricane Harvey last year over Houston, dropping tremendous amounts of rainfall, perhaps 20 inches, on North Carolina and Virginia. “The bottom line is that there is high confidence that Florence will be a large and extremely dangerous hurricane, regardless of its exact intensity,” according to a National Hurricane Center advisory about Hurricane Florence. Hurricane Hugo landed just north of Charleston, South Carolina, on September 22, 1989, as a Category 4 storm with maximum winds of 140 mph, the most intense storm to hit the East Coast above Florida in the last century. At one time a Category 5 storm, Hugo followed a curling upper-cut path that reached eastern Puerto Rico before steaming northward. When it reached the US mainland, it delivered a storm surge just above 20 feet high, enough to flood the cafeteria of a school in McClellanville, South Carolina, where people had taken refuge from the storm and had to climb to the rafters or stand atop tables to escape the rising water. “The enormity of the situation was staggering,” according to one survivor’s account. Sixty people died from the storm, 35 of them in South Carolina. Additionally, thousands of people were left homeless. Hugo was a fast traveller, however, which limited flooding from rainfall. It also meant it arrived over North Carolina’s Outer Banks still a Category 1 hurricane, with gusts as high as 87 mph. Tracing a path similar to the one tracked by Florence, Hurricane Fran picked up steam crossing the Atlantic, and roared past the Bahamas to become a Category 3 storm. Fran arrived ashore at Cape Fear, North Carolina, on the evening of September 5, 1996, with 115 mph winds and up to 12 feet of storm surge. The storm delivered 79 mph wind gusts in the state capital Raleigh, toppling trees and power lines more than 200 miles inland, and dumping rain that led to dozens of dam failures. According to the Charlotte News &amp; Observer, “the storm was a meteorological wake-up call for millions of North Carolina residents,” who had forgotten about the power of hurricanes to reach inland. Some 26 deaths resulted from the storm, and it caused about $4.1 billion in damages. The storm was so devastating that the name “Fran” was taken off the list of future storm names. A Category 5 bruiser that never quite hit the US mainland as a major storm, Matthew still dealt tremendous damage through flooding, in a 36-hour trek offshore that ended with its landfall as a Category 1 storm on October 8, 2016, near unlucky McClellanville, South Carolina. Overall, the storm killed more than 600 people as it travelled from the Caribbean — the site of most deaths — to the US, and caused $15 billion in damages. The storm knocked out power and triggered evacuations from Florida to South Carolina as it powered up the coast. Its torrential rains caused widespread flooding in North Carolina and Virginia, with river heights cresting at record levels, feet above marks set by Hurricanes Hugo and Fran. Roughly 100,000 homes and other buildings were damaged in North Carolina alone. In an analysis released on Monday, coastal geologist Robert Young of Western Carolina University compared possible flooding from Florence to the “ flood of the century ” left behind by another deadly storm. In 1999, Hurricane Floyd created a “500-year flood” that left whole towns underwater, their residents clinging to rooftops. Caskets floated from graves, and lagoons filled with hog farm waste overflowed, leading rescue workers to smear their noses with menthol ointment to kill the stench. Of 87 people killed by the storm, 52 died in the flooding in North Carolina. Ten years on, a burst of construction and increased population in the state makes inland flooding from Florence even more dangerous. Villanova University’s Stephen Strader noted more than 11 million homes are now in the cone of the storm’s projected landing zone inland. “Everybody’s focused on the cone, which does not imply anything in the ways of impacts,” Steve Pfaff, a warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service, said about Florence projections. “This is a huge system. It’s a big engine. And its impacts are going to be so far outside of the center tracks — there’s a potential for millions of people to be impacted by this.”","Following in the footsteps of Hurricanes Matthew, Fran, and Hugo, Hurricane Florence promises rain, floods, and power outages in the Carolinas.

Jeff Mason,"HAVELOCK/WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday promised that North and South Carolina would have strong federal support as they recovered from the devastation of Hurricane Florence, whose floodwaters continue to threaten the region. “We’re going to be there 100 percent,” Trump told officials at a briefing shortly after arriving at the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina. “... There will be nothing left undone. You’ll have everything you need.” Trump, who has been criticized for his handling of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, also thanked first responders for their work since Florence made landfall on Friday and recapped the efforts to get food to residents and restore power. He was accompanied by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Federal Emergency Management Agency chief Brock Long, Senators Richard Burr and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott of South Carolina. More than 15,000 people remain in shelters and more than 200,000 customers are without power across North Carolina because of Florence, which came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, according to state officials. Although the storm is long gone, river flooding still poses a danger to the area. The Cape Fear River was expected to crest at 61.5 feet (19 meters), four times its normal height, on Wednesday in Fayetteville, a city of 200,000 near the Fort Bragg army base in the southern part of the state, according to the National Weather Service. That has disrupted efforts to restore power, clear roads and allow evacuated residents to go home. “There is a strong potential that those who live within the 1-mile evacuation area of the Cape Fear River will be impacted by flooding,” the city said in a statement. The city manager told CNN that 12,000 people are “in harm’s way.” Florence has killed at least 36 people, including 27 in North Carolina, eight in South Carolina and one in Virginia. Two of the South Carolina victims were mental health patients who drowned on Tuesday when a van carrying them was swept away by floodwater. SWOLLEN RIVERS Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas. Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage resulting from Florence, which has dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina since Thursday. At least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage, with three others set to crest in the coming days in North Carolina, the state said. In the town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, which has struggled to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, only about 50 residents remained on Tuesday, Fair Bluff Police Chief Chris Chafin told Reuters. The town has largely been cut off by flooding from the still-rising Lumber River, which was expected to crest on Wednesday. As Florence was bearing down on the Carolinas last week, Trump reignited the controversy over his handling of Maria by disputing the official death toll of 2,975 in the U.S. territory, which was compiled by public health experts at George Washington University. Trump said, without offering evidence, that Democrats had inflated the figure to make him look bad. Maria also devastated the infrastructure of Puerto Rico, whose 3 million citizens are Americans but do not vote in presidential elections, and left much of the island without power for months. Critics said the Trump administration was slow to recognize the extent of the damage and slow to help. Former basketball star Michael Jordan, a native of Wilmington, North Carolina, and the principal owner of the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association, donated $2 million to the Florence recovery effort, the team said.

Jolyn Rosa,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Lane threatened to drench Hawaii’s most populated island of Oahu on Saturday, after lingering just south of the U.S. state and unleashing torrential rains and flooding on the Big Island, weather and civil defense officials said. Hawaii was spared a direct hit by a major hurricane as Lane, once a monster tempest, weakened on Friday into a tropical storm with sustained winds of 65 miles per hour (100 kph). Early on Saturday it remained south of Hawaii and was moving slowly north-northwest through the Pacific Ocean, its outer rain bands producing severe flooding across parts of the islands. “Regardless of the storm’s track, life threatening flash flooding, along with locally strong winds and possible isolated tornadoes, will continue to extend far beyond the center’s location,” the National Weather Service’s Honolulu office said. “Do not focus on the exact forecast track or intensity of Lane.” Hawaii’s Big Island, properly called the island of Hawaii, was hard hit on Friday and much of it remained vulnerable to flash floods, the weather service said. Hilo, the Big Island’s largest community, received more than 31 inches (79 cm) of rain from Wednesday through Friday, its largest three-day total since records began in 1949. Some areas received more than 45 inches, the weather service said. Police and emergency crews conducted numerous rescues of people stranded in vehicles and homes by high water on Friday. On Saturday, Lane was creeping north-northwest at 3 mph (5 km/h), NWS meteorologist Chevy Chevalier said by phone. It was expected to turn to the west, away from Hawaii, later on Saturday, he said. “We have to get this thing out of here, and the biggest reason is the Big Island doesn’t need any more rain,” he said. NO INJURIES REPORTED No injuries were reported, but several structures were destroyed on the Big Island, said Melissa Dye, an NWS spokeswoman in Honolulu. She said two Hilo-area neighborhoods were evacuated. “I’ve never seen this, so much devastation of the river flowing down off of Komohana,” said one long-time Hilo resident, Tracy Pacheco. “I just came from Pahale Park, and there’s no park.” Oahu, home to the state capital of Honolulu and to 70 percent of Hawaii’s 1.4 million residents, could receive heavy rain later on Saturday if the storm lingers south of the state, forecasters said. More than 1,100 people stayed in emergency shelters in the city on Friday, according to its mayor, Kirk Caldwell. He told the Weather Channel that Honolulu is vulnerable to floods and mudslides because it is partly ringed by mountains. “We have asked our residents in these areas where they know it floods to be ready to leave,” Caldwell said on Friday. Forecasts predicted that Lane, which peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with top sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph) earlier in the week while far from Hawaii, will diminish into a tropical depression by early on Sunday. New Yorker Rigo Pagoada, 43, who was on vacation on Oahu with his family, said he felt lucky it had been largely spared, but that it was sad to see what had happened on the Big Island. “We’ve been very fortunate,” Pagoada said. Hawaii’s major airports stayed open during the storm, though some flights were canceled at Honolulu’s main airport and at Kahului Airport on Maui. Travelers should expect congestion at the airports through the weekend as a result, Hawaii Governor David Ige said.

Adele Peters,"Less than two years after the city of Lumberton, North Carolina, was flooded by Hurricane Matthew, a levee that protects the city from rising river water has been breached again by Florence. The community is at risk because of geography. But some residents there are also at risk because they’re poor. A series of maps from Direct Relief, a nonprofit that provides humanitarian medical aid, shows the social vulnerability of each community in the path of the hurricane, based on an index from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On a map of socioeconomic risk, Robeson County, where Lumberton is located, is one of the areas shaded darkest for its low levels of income and wealth. Poverty there makes people particularly vulnerable. “If you’re poor, you’re much more likely to see significant adverse effects that require support from outside agencies for a response to a disaster,” says Andrew Schroeder, the organization’s director of research and analysis. Someone may be less likely to have a car and be able to leave. If they rely on food stamps, the system may be disrupted and it may be harder to get food. They may not have the money for a hotel or be able to afford not working. They’re also a little more likely to have a chronic, long-term illness. Explore the interactive map here. [Screenshot: Direct Relief ] “If you’re poor and you’re chronically ill, what’s really going to tip you into crisis is that you can’t get access to medicines even for a short period of time,” says Schroeder. The organization also mapped out risk by disability and the age of residents, since older residents are also more likely to have illnesses, like diabetes, that require an ongoing supply of medicine, and have a harder time evacuating. Deaths from the immediate disaster–such as drownings–could be eclipsed by deaths from emergencies that occur while the community tries to recover. Direct Relief also mapped out the vulnerability of communities based on types of housing and transportation used–including how many people own cars–and based on race and ethnicity, including how many people speak a language that may not be included when government organizations share information about the disaster. “All the things which make your community vulnerable before disaster make your community even more vulnerable during disaster,” Schroeder says. The organization is using the maps to find the areas at highest risk so it can prioritize working with health centers there, and will continue to use them as the region goes through the longer-term process of rebuilding. “That broad focus on making sure that we don’t lose sight of the most vulnerable during disasters is really, really important,” he says.","In places where people already lack resources, it’s much more difficult to recover from a storm.

Eliza Relman,"White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley called Puerto Rico, a US territory whose citizens are American, ""that country"" twice during a Tuesday interview. 
 Gidley made the comments after President Donald Trump attacked Puerto Rico's leaders in a series of Tuesday morning tweets and accused the island of mismanaging disaster relief funds in the wake of the devastating Hurricane Maria in September 2017. 
 Gidley reiterated the president's argument and called claims that Trump has ""other-ized"" Puerto Ricans ""ridiculous."" 
 ""They have had a systematic mismanagement of the goods and services we've sent to them,"" Gidley told MSNBC's Hallie Jackson. ""Their governor has done a horrible job ... He's trying to find someone to take the blame off of him for not having a grid and not having a good system in that country."" 
 Gidley later said the phrasing was ""a slip of the tongue."" 
 At another point in the MSNBC interview, Jackson accused Gidley of rolling his eyes when she said that Puerto Ricans are US citizens. 
 ""The president says Puerto Ricans are taking from the USA. Puerto Rico is part of the United States,"" Jackson said, referring to the president's Tuesday tweet. ""There's a lot of confusion over why the president would say this and what he understands and how he views the people of Puerto Rico."" 
 ""That's ridiculous,"" Gidley responded. ""He's actually already traveled to Puerto Rico after this horrific hurricane — he was there.""

 Trump attacked Democrats on Tuesday morning for opposing a Republican disaster-relief bill for victims of hurricanes, wild fires, and other natural disasters across the country that Democrats argued didn't include enough food assistance for Puerto Rico. Republicans simultaneously opposed a version passed by House Democrats that included significantly more funding for Puerto Rico. 
 ""Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, &amp; all their local politicians do is complain &amp; ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, &amp; only take from USA,"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning, adding that Puerto Rico's governor is ""crazed and incompetent."" 
 Puerto Rico has not, in fact, received $91 billion in aid following the hurricane and the administration told the Washington Post that the figure was a high-end estimate for the total amount that will be needed over time. The island has so far received about $11 billion and a total of $41 billion in aid has been committed. 
 In comparison, the US government spent more than $120 billion on recovery efforts following Hurricane Katrina. 
 The president went on, ""The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump. So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted."" 
 In recent months, Trump has disputed Puerto Rico's death toll following the hurricane, falsely accused Puerto Rico of using its disaster relief funds to pay off its debt, and proposed redirecting disaster-relief funds to his border wall construction.","White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley called Puerto Rico, a US territory whose citizens are American, ""that country"" twice during a Tuesday interview.

Associated Press,"BLADENBORO, N.C. – Major flooding remains in eastern North Carolina more than a week after Hurricane Florence made landfall. Gov. Roy Cooper said Saturday that nine of the state's river gauges are at major flood stage and four others are at moderate stage, while parts of Interstates 95 and 40 will remain underwater for another week or more. Emergency management officials said residents whose homes were damaged or destroyed will begin moving into hotel rooms next week. ""Hurricane Florence has deeply wounded our state, wounds that will not fade soon as the flood waters finally recede,"" Cooper said. South Carolina also has ordered more evacuations as rivers continue to rise in the aftermath of a storm that has claimed at least 43 lives since slamming into the coast more than a week ago. The small farming community of Nichols, South Carolina, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) from the coast, was completely inundated by water, Mayor Lawson Batter said Saturday. He called the situation ""worse than Matthew,"" the 2016 hurricane that destroyed almost 90 percent of the town's 261 homes. Battle said flooding from Florence has wiped out the 150 or so homes rebuilt afterward. ""It's just a mess,"" said Battle, who was awaiting a visit from Gov. Henry McMaster. ""We will try everything we can to come back... but we need to have federal and state help."" In Wilmington, where Hurricane Florence made landfall and which had been cut off by floodwaters, officials said they'd identified three safe routes into town. They encouraged people to avoid travel in areas where the risk of flooding remains. North Carolina Emergency Management Director Michael Sprayberry said Saturday that eastern counties continue to see major flooding, including areas along the Black, Lumber, Neuse and Cape Fear rivers. The Cape Fear river is expected to crest Sunday and remain at flood stage through early next week. He said residents who register with the Federal Emergency Management Agency can begin moving into hotels Monday. The program initially will be open to residents in nine counties, then will be expanded. A FEMA coordinator said about 69,000 people from North Carolina already have registered for assistance. North Carolina environmental officials said they're closely monitoring two sites where Florence's floodwaters have inundated coal ash sites. The National Weather Service confirmed Saturday that 10 tornadoes spawned by Hurricane Florence touched down Monday in Virginia, the strongest of which leveled a flooring company in Chesterfied and killed one worker. An economic research firm estimated that Hurricane Florence has caused around $44 billion in damage and lost output, which would make it one of the top 10 costliest U.S. hurricanes. The top disaster, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, cost $192.2 billion in today's dollars, while last year's Hurricane Harvey cost $133.5 billion Moody's Analytics estimates Florence has caused $40 billion in damage and $4 billion in lost economic output, though the company stressed that the estimate is preliminary and could go higher or lower. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster has estimated damage from the flood in his state at $1.2 billion. He asked congressional leaders to hurry federal aid. ___ Waggoner and Robertson reported from Raleigh, North Carolina.

Heather Barnes,"North Carolina and other states on the east coast were hit by Hurricane Florence just over one week ago. The storms winds battered crops and its rainfall, more than 30 feet in some areas, caused flooding that closed major interstates and shut down entire towns. Agriculture, the number one industry in my state, took a hard hit, the full extent which won't be known for months. The needs of the agriculture community are great and may not be as obvious as you think. We need you to know we prepared for this storm. Generators were checked; fuel and feed were stockpiled. Animals were moved to higher ground (more than 20,000 hogs alone). Knowing North Carolina is in hurricane alley, hog farmers began preparing lagoons in August so these manure storage ponds would be able to hold as much rain water as possible. You can read more about how lagoons work on the NC Pork Council's website. We need you to know farmers stayed behind, even when told to leave. There are no livestock on our farm, but we had tobacco barns running and didn't leave. Livestock farmers stayed on their farms, sometimes in the barn, putting themselves in harms way to protect the animals in their care. We need you to see the photos and videos farmers have posted on social media, including: Farmers using ATVs, trucks, boats, or even helicopters to get feed to their animals Workers carrying feed to poultry in 5-gallon buckets because there was no power to run the automatic feeders inside the chicken houses Tobacco almost melting off the stalk, cotton bolls hardened by rain, sweet potato fields under water, and other crop damage The farmers whose pig, chickens, and turkeys were in houses with power when their children were not. We need you to feel the pain of our loss as we stand looking at a crop we worked 80-hour weeks to grow, only to lose it all; to feel the tears we shed at the loss of livestock that drowned; the desperation of livestock owners, like a former coworker of mine, who were stranded with their animals and asking for help to get their horses feed without a thought of their own food needs. We need you to know family farms of all types were impacted by this storm; both large and small. Livestock, row crop, fruit and vegetables, all were affected including conventional and organic. From first generation to seventh generation, part-time farmer and full-time farmer, family farms that sell at your local farmers market, to your local grocery store and internationally, all were impacted. We need you to stop assuming that crop insurance will pay all their bills. It does not. Federal crop insurance is complicated, but the cliff notes version is it only covers certain crops (row crops like cotton and corn, not vegetable crops like sweet potatoes) and only a percentage of your production. Homeowners insurance covers replacement costs of your home. Crop insurance does not replace the lost income from a damaged crop. Many farmers will not farm another year after this loss, just two years after they suffered losses from Hurricane Matthew. We need you to realize food safety and animal welfare rules don't stop because of the storm. Do you really believe drowned animals will enter the food chain? NO. Do you believe crops covered by overflowing creeks, ponds and other bodies of water will be harvested for human consumption? NO. If you believe that, then you must think the fish drowned along Interstate 40 will also end up in the food chain. We need the media to interview farmers if they want to cover the true story of this hurricane. Get sound bites from those of us who make our living from the land. Talk to the commodity groups and other agriculture organizations that haven't been watching from afar, but from the ground beside us. We need photos and video that are used in stories about Florence to have actually been taken during or after Florence. I've seen photos circulating that were taken after Hurricane Floyd in 1999 accompanying reports of Florence's damage. North Carolina saw huge losses, particularly in the livestock industry, from Floyd and learned many lessons which resulted in less loss of livestock and less discharge from hog lagoons from Florence. It is disappointing to see photos from almost 20 years ago being circulated and passed off as current. It's even more disheartening to read the comments from people who take them at face value. Photos from 20 years ago aren't relevant, unless you want to highlight all the improvements farmers have made since then. We need the media to verify the authenticity of photos and video before they broadcast or print it. Some news media have reported on ""hog farms"", including photos or videos that weren't pig farms but municipal waste facilities, poultry farms, warehouses, or some other structure. Some hog houses that were shown no longer house pigs and havent in many years. We need you to spread the word that farmers needing assistance can call the NC Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services emergency hotline at 866-645-9403. Some farmers lost all the hay they had baled for winter and pastures have been flooded. Without hay or feed, they will be forced to sell animals. Many are still cleaning up their farms and can't take supplies now, but will need them. NCDA&amp;CS, NC Cooperative Extension and many commodity associations also have information related to disaster relief and recovery posted on their websites. We need help. Immediate needs include temporary or permanent fencing, salt blocks, minerals, feed and hay. These and other supplies are being accepted at the Emergency Farm Supply Distribution site in Pink Hill (call 252-521-1706). Financial donations are being accepted by the Lenoir County extension office, which is working directly with the distribution site. Checks can be made payable to the N.C. Agriculture Foundation (tax deductible) or Lenoir County (not tax deductible) and should be sent to: Lenoir County Cooperative Extension, Attn: Eve Honeycutt, 1791 Hwy 11 55, Kinston, NC 28504. The North Carolina Farm Bureau Foundation is also working to help farmers impacted by Florence. We need our fellow farmers who have helped each other through other storms and will continue to do so. We need to give thanks to the lineman who have restored power, the communities who have supported us, the truckers who brought feed through the flood waters, the volunteers who have fed us, and everyone who has donated not only to farmers, but to everyone impacted by Florence. We don't need you to kick us when we're down. Even before the storm, as farmers were preparing for Florence to hit land, anti-agriculture organizations were in the sky looking for problems. News reports on the losses have not always been accurate and most include reader comments telling farmers we brought this on ourselves, how much we don't care about the livestock in our care and other negative thoughts. We need boots on the ground, not eyes in the sky. If you are going to fly over our farms, at least drop a load of hay or some fuel on your way over.","Agriculture.com What North Carolina Farms Needs After Hurricane Florence Agriculture.com North Carolina and other states on the east coast were hit by Hurricane Florence just over one week ago.

Gene Cherry,"(Reuters) - Nearly all rivers and waterways in North and South Carolina will crest Sunday, but most will remain at dangerous flood levels for days to come, the U.S. National Weather Service warned, more than a week after the arrival of Hurricane Florence, which has killed at least 40 people. Swaths of rivers near the Atlantic coast will not crest for days to come, such as the lower Cape Fear River near Wilmington, N.C., one of the hardest hit communities, said Bob Oravec, a meteorologist with the NWS’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park Maryland. “This isn’t over,” Oravec said early Sunday. “Large sections of rivers near the coast won’t start cresting until at least early in the week, maybe later.” “All that water is going to take a good while to recede,” he said. “Damage can still be done. It’ll be a slow drop.” Meanwhile, remnants of the once mighty storm, brought heavy rains northwest up the Ohio Valley, prompting flood watches and warnings from Texas to Virginia and Maryland, at least through Monday, the weather service said. Officials in towns and cities in both North and South Carolina were filling sandbags and finalizing evacuation plans, eyeing some rivers that are swollen by heavy rainfall on Saturday. In Conway, South Carolina, where President Donald Trump visited this week, images posted by the city on Saturday showed water lapping at homes in an area where residents were being evacuated. In Lee’s Landing in Horry County, some residents used boats to get to safety as the Waccamaw River spilled into neighborhoods, a local CBS affiliate reported. “If you can get out, get out,” Joseph Tanner, the county’s fire rescue chief, said in an interview with WBTW News 13. More than two dozen flood gauges in North and South Carolina showed flooding on Saturday, the NWS said. At least 40 deaths have been attributed to the storm, with most of those in North Carolina. About 5,000 people across North Carolina have been rescued by boat or helicopter since the storm made landfall, twice as many as in Hurricane Matthew two years ago, according to state officials. Thousands of people remained in shelters. Nearly 550 roads remained closed, the state’s department of transportation said, warning motorists not to travel in 17 southeastern counties worst-hit by Florence. Duke Energy Corp said on Friday that breaches in a cooling lake dam forced it to shut down its natural gas-fired L.V. Sutton plant in North Carolina. The utility said it could not rule out the possibility that coal ash from a dump adjacent to the plant, which formerly burned coal, might be flowing into the nearby Cape Fear River. Coal ash can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife. The company is testing the water for possible contamination, Duke officials said in a release Saturday. “The company is bringing in additional construction material from across the state to repair the breach as soon as the flood waters recede,” the release said. The flooding from Florence has also caused 21 hog “lagoons,” which store manure from pig farms, to overflow in North Carolina, possibly contaminating standing water, according to state officials. North Carolina is one of the leading hog-producing states in the country. Several sewer systems in the region also have released untreated or partly treated sewage and storm water into waterways over the last week, local media reported.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Mario Aguilar to Gizmodo","As scientists warnings about climate change become increasingly dire, our conversations about extreme weather events have become increasingly political. There will always be those who chastise the climate-concerned public for politicizing the storm but theres also an argument for doing just that when it is the refusal of specific politicians to act on climate that increases our vulnerability to powerful storms, wildfires, and more. But drawing linkages between our weather, our climate, and our politics is quite a different thing than blaming victims of a tragedy for their own suffering. That latter, far uglier form of politicization reared its head last week when the Guardian ran an article under a headline seemingly tailor-made to drive the partisan wedge between us even deeper: Victims of Hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers. The headlines implicationthat by voting for the wrong politicians, folks in the Florida Panhandle were somehow getting whats coming sparked swift condemnation on social media. And to the credit of author John Abraham, a professor at the University of St. Thomas, he asked the Guardian to change it after publication, and the Guardian did. But the victim-shaming sentiment the Guardian telegraphed is sadly nothing new. In the aftermath of a storm, those who stay behind are often condemned for not evacuating, even though evacuation is a privilege not everyone can afford. In the wake of the deadly Oso landslide that struck Washington State in 2014, people whose homes were destroyed were blamed for building on unstable ground in the first place. When Hawaiis Kilauea erupted last spring, residents of Leilani Estates took heat for buying property atop an active volcano. The list goes on and on. After a disaster happens, it is a very common human trait to immediately find a way to assign blame, disaster researcher and former Gizmodo writer Mika McKinnon told Earther. A large chunk of why we do this is to say well, it wouldnt happen to me. Perhaps, then, it isnt surprising that how victims voted is starting to creep into conversations about who is to blame when it comes to climate change-fueled disasters, however reprehensible that kind of talk may be. Faith Kearns, a scientist at the California Institute for Water Resources, says shes seen victim shaming based on ideology become increasingly common as we wrestle with how to talk about climate change after a disaster. As an example she pointed to the massive wildfire that tore through Fort McMurray in 2016, which brought out the worst on social media, with some, including former New Democratic Party candidate Tom Moffatt, calling it karmic that a town in the Canadian oil-sands was devoured by a blaze likely exacerbated by climate change. A brief scan of responses to the recent Guardian article reveals there are indeed jerks who saw citizens of the red-leaning Florida Panhandle getting what they deserve when Hurricane Michael struck last week. Matthew Motta, a postdoc studying science communication at the University of Pennsylvania, wasnt aware of any research showing that a significant number liberals blame conservative voters for extreme weather, or, more perniciously, revel in disasters striking their communities. But he said the deep partisan divide over climate change makes it the sort of issue where we might expect to see affective polarization, that is, polarization that causes us to dislike the other side even more. And its not just random internet commenters who are liable to resent and blame those they disagree with on climate change. Sarah Myhre, a climate scientist at the University of Washington, told Earther that derision or dismissal of the uninformed or misinformed public is a sentiment shes been exposed to quite a few times, particularly among male colleagues whove never had their authority questioned ever. The righteousness of male power brokers when they are not believed gets re-routed into anger and cynicism, Myhre told Earther. She said we need more leadership from women, particularly women of color, to reframe our conversations about climate change centering the values of human rights. NASA climate scientist Kate Marvel emphasized that blaming disaster victims, which she described as at best unproductive and at worst just morally abhorrent, sets up a false narrative when it comes to climate change. After all, its hardly the citizens of the Florida Panhandle among the poorest in the statewho are responsible for our planetary fever. That distinction goes to the fossil fuel industry, which has reaped unimaginable profits off our outdated energy system. It goes to the shareholders and executives whove hid their own companies research on the link between carbon emissions and warming, whove built misinformation campaigns to sow confusion among the public, and even now, when the science is too clear for bald-faced denials, who have convinced us we are all equally to blame. And it goes to politicians who continue to bury their heads in the sand at industrys behest. Politicizing the storm can be the right thing to do. But if were using politics to punch down, were giving these real power brokers a pass.","As scientists’ warnings about climate change become increasingly dire, our conversations about extreme weather events have become increasingly political.

Catherine Thorbecke,"Hurricane Michael made landfall in the Florida Panhandle Wednesday afternoon as the strongest storm to hit the U.S. since 1969, and the third most powerful on record for the country. Interested in Hurricane Michael? Add Hurricane Michael as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricane Michael news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Approximately 20 million people are either under a warning or watch for hurricane, flooding or tornadoes as a result of the massive storm, according to ABC News contributor Tom Bossert, former Homeland Security Adviser to President Donald Trump. Many have also already experienced the storm's fury. Pets are checked in, as people seek safety in a shelter as Hurricane Michael approaches, Oct. 10, 2018, in Panama City, Fla. As the rest of the country watches the storm inundate the Southeast, it can be difficult to navigate the slew of humanitarian organizations and charity networks out there that are promising relief and aid for those impacted by the storm. People seek safety in a shelter as Hurricane Michael approaches, Oct. 10, 2018, in Panama City, Fla. Below is a roundup of just some of the groups currently on the ground responding to areas impacted by Michael that have been approved by the nonprofit group Charity Navigator as highly-rated organizations. A woman walks through downed trees blocking her heavily damaged neighborhood just after Hurricane Michael passed through in Panama City, Fla., Oct. 10, 2018. The American Red Cross Just weeks after responding to the devastation of Hurricane Florence, folks at the American Red Cross are preparing to provide relief to those in the path of Michael, especially those who have been forced to evacuate their homes as the storm hits. ""The Red Cross is working closely with state and local authorities in Florida, Alabama and Georgia to support evacuation centers for as many as 30,000 people who may need a safe place to stay during the storm,"" Brad Kieserman, Vice President of Disaster Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross, said in a statement. The Red Cross is accepting donations to aid in their relief efforts through telephone, via text, and online. More information can be found here. The organization is also encouraging those who can to donate blood, writing on their website: ""Severe weather events like Hurricanes Florence and Michael often force the cancellation of blood drives and decrease donor turnout in affected areas. To meet the needs in these impacted areas and throughout the country, the Red Cross asks individuals to give blood."" Americares The health-focused humanitarian organization Americares is deploying an emergency response team to Florida to respond to Hurricane Michael, they announced today. ""Michael is on track to be a life-threatening hurricane,"" Americares Director of Emergency Response Brian Scheel said in a statement today. ""Our response team is on the way and ready to meet the health needs in affected communities."" They are currently accepting donations on their website. A man walks past damaged stores after hurricane Michael passed through the downtown area on Oct.10, 2018, in Panama City, Fla. GlobalGiving The nonprofit crowdfunding organization GlobalGiving, which supports grassroots charity projects on the ground in affected areas, has launched a Hurricane Michael relief fund. The fund will support immediate relief efforts such as food, water and medicine, but also invest in longer-term recovery projects to help residents rebuild their community after the storm recedes. Matthew 25: Ministries The international aid and disaster relief organization Matthew 25: Ministries announced on their Instagram that they are deploying a response team to distribute aid to those impacted by Michael this weekend. ""We are prepared to respond as soon as the path of the storm becomes clear we are able to reconnect with our partners on the ground to ensure they are able to receive supplies,"" Matthew 25s CEO Tim Mettey said in a statement.

Rod Nickel,"MEXICO BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Searchers on Friday found the first body in the rubble of the Florida coastal town of Mexico Beach, which was nearly obliterated by Hurricane Michael, as the toll from the historic storm rose to at least 17 and was expected to rise. Rescue teams, hampered by power and phone outages, used cadaver dogs, drones and heavy equipment to search for hundreds of people unaccounted for in devastated communities across the Florida Panhandle. “I’ve watched on television, thinking of what others have experienced, like in the Carolinas and Texas,” Mexico Beach Mayor Al Cathey told reporters referring to hurricanes this year and last. “But it’s different when you walk down and see this, and your emotions run away. This is just a small unique coastal community.” No other information was available about the deceased man found in Mexico Beach, said Joseph Zahralban, Miami’s fire chief and the task force leader of a search and rescue unit. He said it was unclear if the man was living alone or with a family. Three deaths were reported in Marianna, in Jackson County, Florida, Sheriff Lou Roberts told a news conference on Friday afternoon. The dead include at least eight people in Florida, five in Virginia, three in North Carolina and one in Georgia. The number of fatalities is expected to rise as rescuers go door to door and comb through the rubble in Mexico Beach and other Florida coastal communities such as Port St. Joe and Panama City, said Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The Houston-based volunteer search-and-rescue network CrowdSource Rescue said its teams were trying to find some 2,500 people who were either reported missing or were stranded and in need of help in Florida, co-founder Matthew Marchetti said. Social media websites were filled with messages from people trying to reach missing family members in Florida’s Bay and Gulf Counties. Marchetti said his volunteer search teams, consisting mostly of off-duty police officers and firefighters, also had rescued or accounted for 345 others previously reported to CrowdSource Rescue since Michael struck on Wednesday. DOGS AND BULLDOZERS FEMA crews have been using bulldozers and other heavy equipment to push a path through debris to allow rescuers to probe the rubble with specially trained search dogs. More than 1,700 search and rescue workers have been deployed, Governor Rick Scott’s office said in a statement, including seven swift-water rescue teams and nearly 300 ambulances. Michael crashed ashore near Mexico Beach on Wednesday afternoon as one of the most powerful storms in U.S. history, with winds of up to 155 miles per hour (250 km per hour). It pushed a wall of seawater inland, causing widespread flooding. The storm, which in less than two days grew from a tropical storm to a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, tore apart entire neighborhoods in the Panhandle, reducing homes to naked concrete foundations or piles of wood and siding. Except for the emergency-911 system, authorities in Bay County, the epicenter of the disaster, were virtually without telephone or internet service until late in the day on Friday, making communications internally and with the public difficult. “We didn’t have anything,” said Ruth Corley, a spokeswoman for the Bay County Sheriff’s Department. “We’ve been writing things down on pieces of paper. We’re doing what we can with the minimal media that we have.” She said local television stations were knocked off the air for two days, and authorities were relying on the Gulf State College radio station to broadcast public service bulletins. Search teams were going door-to-door looking for victims. REBUILD RIGHT FEMA’s Long urged communities such as Mexico Beach, where many homes were pulverized by 12 to 14 feet (3.7 to 4.3 meters) of storm surge, to rebuild to withstand future storms. “It’s OK if you want to live on the coast or on top of a mountain that sees wildfires or whatever, but you have to build to a higher standard,” he said. “If we’re going to rebuild, do it right.” By Friday morning the remnants of the storm were located about 275 miles (445 km) southwest of Nantucket, Massachusetts, with maximum sustained winds of 65 miles (100 km) per hour. More than 940,000 homes and businesses on the U.S. East Coast were without power on Friday and it could be weeks before power is restored to the most damaged parts of Florida. The number of people in emergency shelters was expected to swell to 20,000 across five states by Friday, said Brad Kieserman of the American Red Cross. The Coast Guard reported rescuing 129 people. Even as rescuers searched the rubble for survivors or the deceased, some residents of Mexico Beach were nervously trickling back on Friday, expressing hope the place, nicknamed “the Forgotten Coast,” would not change too much as it rebuilds. “It was the perfect beach town. Not all of that commercialism,” said Dottie Sinclair, 57, a nurse, adding a Subway fast-food restaurant was the only commercial chain. “I don’t think it will ever be the same,” said husband Danny Sinclair, 64, who is semi-retired. “People will just pack up and leave.” Reporting by Rod Nickel; Additional reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in Port St. Joe, Florida, Gina Cherelus and Scott DiSavino in New York, Gary McWilliams and Liz Hampton in Houston, Jon Herskovitz in Austin, Texas, Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee and Alex Dobuzinskis, Steve Gorman and Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Writing by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Bill Tarrant and Sandra Maler","Searchers on Friday found the first body in the rubble of the Florida coastal town of Mexico Beach, which was nearly obliterated by Hurricane Michael, as the toll from the historic storm rose to at least 17 and was expected to rise.",2018-10-13T01:59:49Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Rescuers find first body in town worst hit by Michael,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-michael/rescuers-find-first-body-in-town-worst-hit-by-michael-idUSKCN1ML0OC,https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20181012&t=2&i=1314057939&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEE9B1HC,reuters,Reuters,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Animalkind, USA TODAY Matthew could see the relief in this dog's eyes as he cradled it to his chest. (Photo: Animalkind) Stranded on the front porch of a North Carolina home, two dogs were trapped with water rising around them. Hurricane Florence was blowing through, and the pups didn’t have much time to survive. Then, a boat pulled up to the porch. Pastor Matthew Drake and LeRoy McGee, a member of his church, were searching for anyone who needed help. They saw the dogs in distress and immediately got out to help. RELATED: Marine veteran determined to reunite fellow Marine with service dog ""I could see the sense of relief in the dog's eyes. It didn't matter who I was, and it didn't matter whether I knew the dog or not. We had this quick little bond, and the dog just kind of pulled in close to me,"" says Drake. Drake and McGee drove the dogs to higher ground, keeping them safe and comforting them. They went back out in search of a cat they had seen earlier. It was difficult to spot, but the cat could be seen climbing out of the water onto the window sill and then diving back into the water. Drake and another member of his church went to find it, wading through the waist-deep water. They came back to the boat with not one, but two cats. The dogs and cats are now in the care of animal control. The dogs’ owners have been contacted and will be reuniting with their pets when they return home. “We just try to help out,” Drake shrugs. This isn’t the first time Drake has helped in emergency situations. Coming from a family of first responders, Drake grew up knowing what it was like to be first on the scene. He’s aided people in car accidents and fires, stopping to help whoever and wherever he can. Using his capable, off-road vehicle, he’s able to get people and animals to safety.

Chris Ciaccia,"As hurricanes continue to cause greater impact due to factors such as climate change, NASA is working to have new hurricane-tracking satellites up and running by early 2019. The government space agency is currently testing a group of eight micro-satellites to measure factors such as ""wind speeds over Earth's oceans, increasing the ability of scientists to understand and predict hurricanes,"" in a mission known as Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS). As part of a series of environmental tests for NASA’s CYGNSS constellation, one of the eight microsatellites is placed in a radio frequency (RF) anechoic chamber. (Credit: NASA) Current tracking technology forecasts with a degree of accuracy the path a hurricane, but its still not able to accurately measure a storm's intensity. HAWAII VOLCANO ERUPTION FORMS NEW LAVA 'SILAND' JUST OFF COAST With the new system, NASA hopes to better advise meteorologists and help people who are likely to be affected by the hurricane. “The fact that we have a much better understanding of where these storms are going to go is a great first step,"" said Steve Bowen, director and meteorologist for insurer Aon Benfield’s Impact Forecasting team in an interview with Reuters. ""We sort of have half the circle filled in, and we need to get that other half filled in, which is that intensity component,” he said. Predicting the power of a hurricane relies on knowing where it gets its energy from, which can be tricky to do as it is happening. To do that, a hurricane hunter aircraft has to be flown inside the storm, where it can measure inputs such as wind speed from a weather buoy, the Daily Mail reported, a technique known as scatterometry. Or it can rely on satellites that fly over the storm, though they only do this once every other day. ""The CYGNSS satellites will only receive signals broadcast to them from GPS satellites already orbiting the Earth and the reflection of the same satellite’s signal reflected from the earth,"" NASA said on its website. The satellites themselves will not broadcast, which according to the mission's principal investigator, University of Michigan's Chris Ruf, will result in significant cost savings. CYGNSS comes at a cost of $157 million, the Mail reported. When NASA gave the award to Ruf and his team in 2012, it was a five-year deal for $151.7 million, which included ""initial development, launch, deployment and data analysis."" VENUS AIRCRAFT COULD BE IN NASA'S PLANS Each of CYGNSS's mini-satellites weighs just a fraction of regular satellites, at 64 pounds, and has a 5-foot wingspan. They will fly in low-orbit, where they'll utilize the same GPS technology seen in cars and go over the tropics every few hours. ""This sampling strategy will overcome the limitations of a previous single, wide-swath approach,"" said Ruf, according to NASA. The data will be shared with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and help them with extreme weather planning, the Mail added. The advantage of CYGNSS is clear, and not just in getting more data in real time that can be plugged into models. Aside from helping people prepare, it can save lives. According to Reuters, more than 1,000 people were killed by Hurricane Matthew, after it turned into a Category 5 storm. In a 2017 report, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said it failed to adequately predict how intense the storm would get.

Amanda Morris,"Amy Currin watches the weather news on her cell phone after the power went out at the hotel where she was taking shelter from Hurricane Harvey last August. Joe Raedle/Getty Images In addition to getting flashlights, bottled water and food, hurricane preparation these days includes stockpiling apps on your phone. For those in the path of Hurricane Florence in North and South Carolina, having the right apps can be lifeline during and after the storm. Here are some apps — mostly free — that are useful to download if you're in a hurricane zone: For immediate assistance: Crowdsource Rescue – Emergency phone lines, like 9-1-1, can get overwhelmed with calls during storms, and this app helps with the rescue efforts through the concept of ""neighbors rescuing neighbors."" The app was developed by Matthew Marchetti after Harvey hit his city Houston too quickly to connect professional first-responders and vetted volunteers with all those in need of help. The app uses GPS tracking and allows civilian volunteers, such as those who may have a boat, to sign in and help evacuate others in the area. For shelter: Harmany – This app was created in 2017 after hurricanes Harvey and Irma to connect people in need of temporary shelters with those who want to provide it during emergencies and evacuation events. On the app, hosts can easily turn on and off their shelter spaces and evacuees can do a shelter search to find the best places to suit their needs. Harmany also provides in-app alerts and notifications for severe weather, fire, and other dangerous events. Airbnb — Through a program called OpenHomes Airbnb allows hosts to offer extra space for free to those in need of temporary housing. Airbnb then helps hosts by verifying, screening and checking guests, reimbursing hosts for any property damage, and providing phone support. Airbnb activated the OpenHomes program in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia for Hurricane Florence. These free listings will be available until October 1. For updates: Weather Underground – This app provides hyper-local forecasts and current conditions from local weather stations with customizable alerts. It also allows users to report local weather and hazards to help inform others in the community. The map interface is interactive, allowing users to choose different layers to view elements such as rain accumulation, crowd reports, and satellite images. It also allows users to track storms. FEMA – This app provides real-time alerts from the National Weather Service, helps users locate emergency shelters and disaster recovery centers and includes various safety tips to help people stay safe during a natural disaster. It allows users to register for disaster assistance online and share photos through FEMA's disaster reporter. This app is available in both English and Spanish. Hurricane by the American Red Cross — This app allows users to monitor conditions in their area and let family and friends know they're okay with the use of a customizable ""I'm Safe"" alert for Facebook, Twitter, email and text. The app includes a map where users can track the hurricane's path and find Red Cross shelters in the area. If you don't have data connectivity, the app also provides users step-by-step instructions of what to do before/during/after the storm. It also comes with a Hurricane Toolkit, with a strobe light, flashlight and audible alerts. iHeartRadio —For those who want to follow along with local news stations to get the latest updates, or who are radio nerds like us, this app will ensure that you can continue access broadcasts, so long as you have service. For communication: FireChat – No cell service? No internet? No problem. FireChat is a free messaging app that works without either of these things, relying on mesh networks instead. However, Bluetooth and WiFi still need to be turned on, even if access isn't available, in order for this app to work. In the app, users can create private groups of up to 50 people or create public chat rooms using hashtags. Zello — Currently trending on Google Play and hitting the number one spot on the Apple App Store's ""free"" apps, Zello is a push-to-talk app, sort of like a walkie-talkie. Unlike walkie-talkies, there are no limits to the number of users or channels. It's available worldwide, wherever there's WiFi or data service, and can be used like a two-way radio to communicate with family members or rescuers. Nextdoor – This is a locally driven app that keeps users informed about what's going on in their neighborhood and connects them with their neighbors. The app provides a secure environment where all neighbors are verified, and was used during Hurricane Harvey. In the app, neighbors can discuss evacuation routes, flood levels, or ask for help from their neighbors, even when other emergency communication methods such as 9-1-1 are down. WhatsApp – During hurricanes or storms, telecommunication services can be limited, but WhatsApp connects to the internet to send messages between phones so that you can stay in touch with friends, family, and loved ones throughout the storm. It also allows you to do free voice and video calls. Glympse — This is a real-time location-sharing app that allows users to share their exact whereabouts with others, such as rescue groups. Local News Apps — Those in Hurricane Florence's path can look up and download local news apps in order to get more local updates and information on the storm. (The WUNC app, for example). For supplies: GasBuddy – Normally, users can use the GasBuddy app to find the closest and cheapest gas stations in their area. However, GasBuddy has recently activated its fuel availability tracker so that residents in affected hurricane areas can find gas more easily. The tracker can differentiate between stations that have no power, limited fuel options, or no fuel, as opposed to those that have both fuel and power. These services can also be found outside the app here: http://tracker.gasbuddy.com. For well-being: Red Cross Apps – Red Cross offers a variety of apps that can be useful during hurricanes and other natural disasters. In addition to their Hurricane app, it has a Flood app that educates people on how to prepare for floods. In case of injury, they also have a First Aid app that informs users on how to handle common first aid emergencies (they even have one for pet emergencies). Headspace: Meditation — Meditating can be one form of self-care to relieve stress and stay calm.

The Conversation,"We are all too familiar with images of flooding in low lying areas after heavy rainfall or houses destroyed by coastal erosion after a storm. For an increasing number of people, coastal flooding and erosion is a real threat to property, the local economy and, in some cases, life. Hurricane Florence, for example, is forcing more than a million people on the US East Coast to flee from their homes. Coasts support important industries (such as ports and tourism) and their populations are growing faster than inland areas. But coastal areas are also particularly sensitive to impacts of climate change, which are likely to increase the extent, intensity, and frequency of coastal flooding and erosion. So not only have we occupied areas that naturally flood and erode from time to time, we have changed the environment in ways that increase coastal flooding and erosion risk. And we continue to do so, sometimes with serious legal consequences. Meanwhile, public policies have not been very effective in managing this predicament. Traditional hard engineering approaches of coastal protection (such as groynes, revetments and seawalls ) are known to cause detrimental effects, which in the longer term can aggravate the problem they were supposed to solve. The impact of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans was a stark reminder that engineering structures are not effective against all events at all times. They are built based on trade-offs between the level of protection needed and the costs of construction and maintenance. Soft engineering, such as beach nourishment (where sediment, usually sand, is added to the shore), can offer a level of protection and beach amenity — but these reduce through time, as erosion continues. Meanwhile, ""protection"" gives a false sense of safety and enables occupation of risk areas, increasing the number of people and assets in risk areas. A serious conundrum A cyclist rides through flooded sidewalks in the wake of Hurricane Matthew in Charleston, South Carolina. Brian Blanco/Getty Images Climate change has forced a paradigm shift in the way coastal flooding and erosion risks are managed. In areas of lower risk, adaptation plans are being devised, often with provisions to make properties and infrastructure more resilient. Adaptation may involve requiring raised foundations in flood-prone areas or the installation of mitigating measures, such as sustainable drainage systems. Building codes may also be established to make structures more disaster-proof and to control the types of constructions within risk zones. But such adaptation options are often of limited use or unsuitable for high-risk areas. In such areas relocation is the only safe climate-proof response. Planning for relocation is problematic. There are large uncertainties concerning the predictions of climate change impacts — and this makes planning a difficult task. Uncertainty is not an easy concept to incorporate in planning and coastal management. In some places, effects of sea level rise are already evident, but it's still difficult to be sure how fast and how much it will rise. Similarly, there is still great uncertainty about when and where the next ""super storm"" will happen and how intense it will be. Inevitably, areas that have already been affected by flooding or erosion will be affected again — the question is when and how badly. Relocated Kiruna, the northernmost town in Sweden. Tsuguliev/Shutterstock Despite these issues, relocation is increasingly being adopted as a strategy. There have been some successes at the local level. One such example is the Twin Streams project in Auckland (New Zealand), where relocation (through the purchase of 81 properties ) has provided space to create community gardens and cycleways where 800,000 native vegetation plants were planted. This was made possible by engaging over 60,000 volunteer hours. Although not on the coast, the town of Kiruna in Sweden shows that, when risks are high, forward thinking and long-term planning can make large-scale relocation possible. Kiruna is at risk of ground collapse due to mining. Over a 20-year period, more than 18,000 residents will be relocated to a new city centre 3km away. The layout of the new city centre has been designed to be more sustainable, energy efficient and have better options for cultural activities and socializing. Local residents were engaged and helped identifying 21 heritage buildings they want relocated to the new area. The French, meanwhile, have instigated the first ever national strategy focused on relocation from high-risk areas. French policy places a duty on local authorities to develop plans by 2020, identifying the areas at serious risk of coastal flooding or erosion, what needs to be relocated and how (including sources of funding). Five pilot areas have been selected to test how the strategy might be implemented at the local level. Two of these areas have contrasting approaches and outcomes. In Lacanau (a top surfing stop in the Bay of Biscay) coastal erosion threatens the tourism-based economy. Although public opposition was initially high, the development of a local plan has generally been positive, mainly due to the inclusive community involvement in the project. A local committee was created to act as a consultation body and decisions were informed by open discussions based on clear communication of technical, legal, financial and sociological issues. In Ault (northern France) the experience was less positive. The risk reduction plan identified a high-risk zone within 70 metres of the cliff edge. It was decided that no new construction would be allowed here and restrictions to improvements on the existing 240 houses were imposed. This would force relocation if the properties were damaged by flooding or erosion. In May 2018 a residents group won a court case which considered the plan illegal, lifting the restrictions imposed on renovation of existing properties until a new plan is drafted. Engaging communities These examples demonstrate that engaging with local communities from the inception of any such project is essential. Unfortunately, people instinctively resist change — and relocation is a complete shift from the centuries-old approach of fixing coastlines and fighting against coastal dynamics. Our current legal and management frameworks are too geared up for maintaining the status quo. Funding and legal aid to support purchase of properties and removal of infrastructure that are not imminently deemed inhabitable are limited. But open and inclusive debate about the need for relocation and the consequences and benefits of it can change people's perceptions. The ""Nimby"" (not in my backyard) attitude is strong in coastal communities, but can subside after personal experiences of severe flooding or erosion. The environment around us is changing and we cannot continue living the way we did in the past. Prevention is always less costly and more effective than remediation, particularly when involving people's safety. The earlier we accept the need to change, the less damaged is the legacy we leave to the next generations.","Coastal flooding and erosion is a real threat to property, the local economy and, in some cases, life.

"Alex Norcia, Brian McManus","After Hurricane Irma ravaged Key West, Jamil Gonzalez and Judd Alison, two local film fixers and location scouts, watched as sailboats sank into the water. On one of them, Gonzalez said, somebody had written ""Send Help,"" with a phone numberand when they called it, they realized, thankfully, that everyone aboard had landed in a shelter. It was a harrowing experience, they said, and it came only one month before Harmony Korine, the legendary cult filmmaker who wrote the seminal movie 90s Kids and directed 2012's oddball mind-bender Spring Breakers, would begin principal shooting on his newest project, The Beach Buma look at ""Cosmic America,"" and the drunkards, degenerates, and romantics who inhabit what was once Ernest Hemingway's famous, mythic retreat. 
""We were pretty intriguedthis happened soon after the hurricane, and we didn't quite know what we were going to doand we kind of originally set up that we wanted to do some sort of relief, to help everybody out,"" Alison said. ""And the more that we were trying to help people out, we were really getting to the people who got hurt the most. These are the people who weren't the tourists. These are what we call the 'conchs'.""
Released on Friday, March 29, The Beach Bum (produced by VICE Studios) is a kind of blown-out love letter to the Florida Keys, a sun-soaked dark comedy that revels in the resilience of the longtime residents of the Keysthe houseboat owners, the bartenders, the boozersand the lifestyle they don't want to (and won't) give up easily. These are the conchs, through Korine's eyes.
""Most have decided that hurricanes are just part of the way of life living down here and have come to terms with them,"" said David Hawthorne, dockmaster of Garrison Bight Marina in the area. ""They like the life style and just deal with it.""
The Beach Bum has been described primarily as a character-driven film, as if Woody Harrelson had pushed the wheelchair-bound Matthew McConaughey right out of the final scene of True Detective season one and dumped him in front of a bar in the Florida Keys. There, alright, alright, alright, he transforms into Moondog, the type of guy who's sloshing red wine in the morning and wearing whatever mismatched clothes he can find, as he writesor avoids writinga sort of Great American novel, Richard Brautiganstyle. In McConaughey's own words, as he told GQ: ""Moondog's a verb. A folk poet. A character in a Bob Dylan song dancing through life's pleasure and pain knowing every interaction is another 'note' in the tune of his life."" This is the sort of stuff Moondog himself says in the movie.
Then, there are the men (mostly men) he gets into trouble with. Zac Efron, with a Zoolander-esque haircut and a Bluetooth incessantly in his year, seems to love God and snorting narcotics with equal fervor. Snoop Dogg very successfully smuggles drugs. Martin Lawrence, a dolphin guide with a coke-snorting parrot and Vietnam flashbacks even though he never served, can't tell those mammals from sharks, which [spoiler alert] eventually becomes his undoing. Naturally, Jonah Hill has a Southern accent. (He often makes an appearance on a putting green.) Jimmy Buffett enters the screen as himself. 
""The more time you spend in Key West, the more time you start to see a specific type emerge, Harmony Korine told me over the phone. ""This kind of celebration of a lack of ambition. It's check-out culture.""
""These sorts of people, they know how they're living,"" Korine continued. ""It's really an amazing thing.""
Talking to Gonzalez and Alison, too, you get the sense of what he's talking aboutthey seem as if they'd be good conversation over one or seven beers. 
""Harmony's big thing is that he wants everything to be authentic,"" Alison told me.
Like the ""coconut guy,"" who showed them around in a ""drunken stupor,"" and introduced them to a secret patch of aloe. (He demonstrated the healing powers of this miracle plant, Alison said, by rubbing it all over his face.) Or the older black Christian couple, descendants, Gonzalez said, of the first black settlers in the region, who had been more than happy to turn their home into a whorehouse for the shoot. Or the guy who owns ""Well Hung,"" a boat Moondog boards in the movie, who operates an actual bed and breakfast off of it. (""The only thing we changed,"" Alison said, ""was the name. But, honestly, he might have left it."")
It's very easy to get caught up in all these personalities, just as it was when James Franco and a bunch of Disney Channel stars wielded guns in Spring Breakers. But The Beach Bum is as much about that placeand the feeling of that placeas it is about any of the flamboyant characters, because neither of those elements are possible to articulate without the other. This is obviously an exaggeration of that, though Korine did mention to me that he's witnessed men trying to speak to dolphins. 
""We tried to find places that were a little bit more hidden,"" Korine said. ""We filmed in different Keys, not just Key West."" Places like, as Gonzalez and Alison rattled off and recommended: the Hogfish Bar &amp; Grill, Schooner Wharf Bar, Duval Street, the southernmost point of the United States, Palm Beach Country Cluba resort golf course that's also open to the public, a microcosm Doug Carter, the general manager there, summarized of the Florida Keys at-large. (""You get all kinds of people,"" he told me over the phone, ""everywhere you go."")
""This place is really like nowhere else anywhere,"" Alison told me. ""You still have the big tourist crowds that come through, but you have the derelicts, too, and everyone who drops off. Think about itif you have nothing left, and you have no money, and you want to be an artist, you might as well do it in paradise.""
Not even a hurricane can stop that.

Patrick Rucker,"RALEIGH, N.C./NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Florence could taint North Carolina waterways with murky coal ash and toxic hog waste as heavy rains test environmental rules written with milder weather in mind, carrying the risk of contaminating water with bacteria like salmonella, officials said on Friday. Many of the state’s environmental codes were written to withstand a 25- or 100-year storm. But Florence promises heavy rains that some regions might not see in a thousand years, straining systems meant to keep state residents safe. The deluge could push industrial waste sites to the limit, Governor Roy Cooper said on Friday. “All of the infrastructure here is going to be tested,” Cooper told a news conference. “We are deeply concerned about the inland flooding.” Florence would not be the first test of North Carolina manure pits, or “lagoons.” Sixteen lagoons flooded under the foot of rain that came with Hurricane Matthew in 2016. The southeast part of the state is expected to get more than twice that amount in the days ahead, said Bryce Link, a meteorologist at DTN Marine Weather, a forecasting service. There are 62 industrial hog farms within North Carolina’s 100-year floodplain, environmentalists estimate, and Duke Energy Corp has four coal ash sites in the coastal area touched by Florence. If excrement escapes from the lagoons where it is stored, it could potentially contaminate drinking water with bacteria like salmonella, which can cause digestive problems, and, in certain vulnerable patients cause E. coli. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is working with storm-struck states and is ready to respond to any breaches, a spokeswoman, Maggie Sauerhage, said. Animal feeding operations above a certain size need to be “designed and operated to handle the rainfall and runoff from 25-year 24-hour storms,” Sauerhage said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters. Even in the midst of a storm, these feeding sites must report leaks, she said. In North Carolina, hog and poultry waste pits make up 6,848 acres of land according to a report from the Environmental Working Group. Still, North Carolina has fewer flood-prone hog farms than it did when Hurricane Floyd inundated about 50 sites in 1999 and sparked statewide reforms. Ash pits and other embankments have ruptured under heavy rain in the past, and Duke Energy has agreed to secure the sites in North Carolina’s lowland areas - but that work is ongoing. Erin Culbert, a spokeswoman for Duke Energy, said the utility was ready to respond as needed to the storm. There is, however, disagreement over the risk posed by Florence. Andy Curliss, head of the North Carolina Pork Council, said spill dangers are overblown, noting that hog farmers have faced severe weather before. “This is not the first hurricane to hit North Carolina,” said Curliss, who noted that many lagoons are at a low point across the state at this time of year. But a state lawmaker said that hurricanes have led to dangerous spills in recent years and North Carolina’s laws are too lax to confront severe storms such as Florence. “As a state, we have put our head in the sand,” Representative Pricey Harrison said. “Past storms should have been a wakeup call.” Reporting by Patrick Rucker in Raleigh and Jessica Resnick-Ault in New York; additional reporting by Tom Polansek in Chicago; editing by Leslie Adler","Tropical Storm Florence could taint North Carolina waterways with murky coal ash and toxic hog waste as heavy rains test environmental rules written with milder weather in mind, carrying the risk of contaminating water with bacteria like salmonella, officials…",2018-09-15T00:34:21Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Florence seen testing North Carolina environmental codes on toxic hog waste,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-florence-pollution/florence-seen-testing-north-carolina-environmental-codes-on-toxic-hog-waste-idUSKCN1LV00S,https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180915&t=2&i=1304498606&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEE8E010,reuters,Reuters,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected on Wednesday to visit North Carolina, which is bearing the brunt of Florence’s deadly deluge and where rivers are still rising while thousands of homes and roadways remain submerged. Trump’s trip to the state follows criticism for his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last year, and more recently for disputing the official death toll of 3,000 in the U.S. territory. Trump plans to arrive at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina at about 10:30 a.m. local time and return to Washington D.C. at 6:15 p.m., according to the White House. More than 15,000 people remain in shelters and more than 200,000 customers are without power across North Carolina, six days after Florence made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, according to state officials. “We continue to feel the effects of this massive storm,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Tuesday. “Even though there is no substantial rain in the forecast and the sun may be shining across many parts of our state, rivers continue to rise and we will see more flooding.” The Cape Fear River was expected to crest at 61.5 feet (19 meters), quadrupling its normal height, on Wednesday in Fayetteville, a city of 200,000 in the southern part of the state near the Fort Bragg army base, according to the National Weather Service. That has disrupted efforts to restore power, clear roads and allow evacuated residents to go home. “There is a strong potential that those who live within the 1-mile evacuation area of the Cape Fear River will be impacted by flooding,” the city said in a statement. The city manager told CNN that 12,000 people are “in harm’s way”. Florence has already killed at least 35 people, including 26 in North Carolina and eight in South Carolina where local media reported that two mental health patients drowned on Tuesday when the sheriff’s van the women were in crashed. One person was killed in Virginia when the storm spawned about 16 tornadoes there on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas. Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage after Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina since Thursday. At least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage with three others set to crest in the coming days in North Carolina, the state said. More than 1,100 roads were still closed across North Carolina, Cooper said, including several portions of interstates 40 and 95. In South Carolina, 40 major roads were closed. In the town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, which has struggled to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, only about 50 residents remained on Tuesday, Fair Bluff Police Chief Chris Chafin told Reuters. The town has largely been cut off by flooding from the still-rising Lumber River, which was expected to crest on Wednesday. Much of Columbus County, where Fair Bluff is located, was under water, according to Steve Abbott of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, with most roads closed and “driving not advised”.

"feedback@businessinsider.com (Michael Biesecker), Michael Biesecker","Duke Energy said Saturday night that heavy rains from Florence caused a slope to collapse at a coal ash landfill at a closed power station near the North Carolina coast. Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said about 2,000 cubic yards of ash were displaced at the L. V. Sutton Power Station outside Wilmington and that contaminated runoff likely flowed into the plant's cooling pond. The company has not yet determined whether the weir that drains the lake was open or if contamination may have flowed into the Cape Fear River. That's roughly enough ash to fill 180 dump trucks. Florence slammed into the North Carolina coast as a large hurricane Friday, dumping nearly three feet of rain and swelling the region's rivers. The resulting flooding forced swift-water rescues and left several people dead. Sheehan said the company had reported the incident to state and federal regulators ""out of an abundance of caution."" The coal-fired Sutton plant was retired in 2013 and the company has been excavating millions of tons of ash from old waste pits and removing it to safer lined landfills constructed on the property. The gray ash left behind when coal is burned contains toxic heavy metals, including arsenic, lead and mercury. Duke has been under intense scrutiny for the handling of its coal ash since a drainage pipe collapsed under a waste pit at an old plant in Eden in 2014, triggering a massive spill that coated 70 miles of the Dan River in gray sludge. In a subsequent settlement with federal regulators, Duke agreed to plead guilty to nine Clean Water Act violations and pay $102 million in fines and restitution for illegally discharging pollution from coal-ash dumps at five North Carolina power plants. The company is in the process of closing all of its coal ash dumps by 2029. In this June 23, 2014 file photo, the dried-up bed of an inactive coal ash pond is seen at Duke Energy's Sutton plant in Wilmington, North Carolina. Mike Spencer/The Star-News via AP Spokeswoman Megan S. Thorpe at the state's Department of Environmental Quality said state regulators will conduct a thorough inspection of the site as soon as safely possible. ""DEQ has been closely monitoring all coal ash impoundments that could be vulnerable in this record breaking rain event,"" Thorpe said. She added that the department, after assessing the damage, will ""hold the utility accountable for implementing the solution that ensures the protection of public health and the environment."" There are at least two other coal-fired Duke plants in North Carolina that are likely to affected by the storm. The H.F. Lee Power Station near Goldsboro has three inactive ash basins that flooded during Hurricane Matthew in 2016, exposing a small amount of coal ash that may have flowed into the nearby Neuse River. The old waste pits are capped with soil and vegetation intended to help prevent erosion of the toxic ash beneath. The Neuse is expected to crest at more than nine feet above flood stage Monday and Sheehan said the company expects the same ash basins are likely to be inundated again. At the W. H. Weatherspoon Power Station near Lumberton, Sheehan said it had already rained more than 30 inches by Saturday evening, causing a nearby swamp to overflow into the plants cooling pond. The Lumber River is expected to crest at more than 11 feet above flood stage Sunday, which would put the floodwaters near the top of the earthen dike containing the plant's coal ash dump. Environmentalists have been warning for decades that Duke's coal ash ponds were vulnerable to severe storms and pose a threat to drinking water supplies and public safety. ""Unfortunately, Duke Energy has spent years lobbying and litigating and still has not removed the coal ash from its dangerous riverfront pits in the coastal area, some of which are in the floodplain,"" said Frank Holleman, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center who has battled the company in court. He added: ""When a hurricane like Florence hits, we have to hope and pray that our communities do not suffer the consequences of years of irresponsible coal ash practices by the coal ash utilities.""","Matt Born/The Star-News via AP Duke Energy said Florence's heavy rains caused a slope to collapse at a coal ash landfill at a closed power station near the North Carolina coast.

Brace said that after S.C. Gov. Henry McMaster ordered an evacuation the property owner asked for the house to be boarded up. (Photo: Mic Smith, AP) With Hurricane Florence spinning through the Atlantic Ocean and threatening to slam into South Carolina later this week, Gov. Henry McMaster ordered mandatory evacuations for the state’s entire coastline beginning at noon Tuesday. All lanes on multiple roadways will lead to safety, too. The Palmetto State, for the third straight storm season, will reserve lanes on multiple major highways – including Interstate 26 between Charleston and Columbia – to push all vehicle traffic away from an approaching hurricane that could be poised to become the southeastern United States’ next Hurricane Hugo. “We are not going to gamble with the lives of the people of South Carolina,” McMaster said. While evacuation orders are issued by states as a protective action in disaster events such as hurricanes and wildfires, they are sometimes ignored by people – whether it’s because they didn’t believe the warnings, didn’t have the financial means or refused to abandon friends, family or pets. More: As Hurricane Florence intensifies, FEMA gears up for disaster response More: The effects of Hurricane Florence could be devastating In January, 17 people were killed in flash flooding and mudslides in Southern California, some of whom didn't heed voluntary evacuation orders, The Associated Press reported. One woman whose parents were killed told the Chicago Tribune they decided against evacuating their ""forever home."" Six months later, the Carr Fire in northern California near Redding killed six people (and two firefighters), with law enforcement authorities blaming one death on the failure to heed evacuation orders, CBS News reported. Some 7 million people, primarily in Florida, were asked to flee from Hurricane Irma last September, the largest mass evacuation in U.S. history, easily surpassing the 2.5 million who were ordered to evacuate during Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. This is how ""hurricane hunters"" at NOAA are tracking down the potentially catastrophic Hurricane Florence. USA TODAY It’s unknown how many of those millions decided instead to hunker down. As that storm pounded the Sunshine State, CNN talked to four locals in the Florida Keys who didn't heed warnings, with one saying, ""I'm prepared for the worst but hoping for the best,"" and MSNBC's live on-site weather report from Miami Beach was interrupted by a kite surfer riding hurricane-charged waves. As of Monday night, Florence was 500 miles in diameter, considerably larger than the typical 300-mile-wide hurricane, with winds up to 140 mph. The storm, which intensified from the Category 1 to a Category 4 in a mere 13 hours on Monday, is tracking to make landfall on Thursday night or Friday morning. In South Carolina, McMaster’s evacuation orders impact some 1 million residents and tourists across eight low-lying counties. There are mandatory evacuations set for Virginia, too, where Gov. Ralph Northam has ordered about 245,000 people in flood-prone coastal areas to get out beginning at 8 a.m. Tuesday. It’s unlikely everybody will heed the warnings. Those who don’t won’t face punishment, either, and that could be another reason behind peoples’ decision to weather a storm – no matter how dangerous. Only three states have laws in place to enforce mandatory evacuations – California, New York and North Carolina, with violators facing misdemeanor charges. The California Emergency Services Act also includes possibilities of a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment for up to six months.

"Paul P. Murphy, CNN","(CNN) Authorities in Georgetown County, South Carolina, are urging thousands of people to evacuate ahead of historic flooding in an area where multiple swollen rivers converge. The county escaped the brunt of Hurricane Florence's wind, but it sits at the mouths of the Waccamaw, Great Pee Dee and Sampit rivers. Parts of Georgetown County will see at least 10 feet of flooding, forecasters say. Key words: at least. The flooding is expected to begin Tuesday and will last through the weekend. ""The Pee Dee River is the big elephant in the room,"" Georgetown County Administrator Sal Hemingway said in a press conference Thursday. The Great Pee Dee and the larger Waccamaw River have already swollen to record levels upstream -- as demonstrated by the flooding 40 miles north in and around Conway, where the Waccamaw is still rising -- and that water is now traveling downstream at historic levels. There is no benchmark for comparison, not even the destruction wrought by Hurricane Matthew last year, Hemingway said. Making matters worse is the potential for tides to exacerbate floodwater levels. Normally, from low tide to high tide, Georgetown sees about a 3-foot difference in the water level where the Great Pee Dee River meets Winyah Bay. Monday night's full moon means high tides will be even higher. If the rivers hit peak crest during a high tide, flooding will spread even farther into the city. How the city is preparing The rainfall that Florence dumped on North Carolina has been crawling downriver for more than two weeks. It's now set to inundate the homes and businesses belonging to Georgetown County's more than 61,000 people -- almost 8,000 of whom are being urged to evacuate. A significant portion of the city is expected to be underwater. Critical infrastructure is already being prepared and hardened. Along Highway 17, which connects Georgetown to the nearby South Carolina coast and its beaches, flood barriers are being erected. Officials worry that the flooding could wash away the portion of the highway that links the bridges spanning the Great Pee Dee and Waccamaw rivers. As a precaution, the South Carolina National Guard is building a floating ribbon bridge, capable of carrying heavy equipment, across the Waccamaw River. All 19 Georgetown County schools were closed Monday until further notice. Several are ""at risk for substantial flooding damage,"" county officials say. Two of them, Georgetown High School and Waccamaw Middle School, have opened as pet-friendly shelters. The Georgetown County Water and Sewer District is also scrambling to prepare. The Waccamaw River, which supplies drinking water for the county, will soon contain dangerous pollutants from the floodwater. Ray Gagnon, executive director of the water district, told reporters that the district is working to protect all of its facilities in the ""inundation zone,"" and preparing other sources of water -- including aquifers, recovery wells, groundwater wells and the county's interconnect with the nearby Grand Strand Water and Sewer Authority. Sandbags are also being distributed -- up to 10 per household -- but the county warned on its Facebook page, ""Keep in mind that sandbags will not seal out water."" Thomas Cafe sits on Front Street, the main drag in Georgetown. It looks almost exactly like did it did when it opened in 1929. The menu and the booths are original, as is most of the decor -- even the refrigerator. In its 89-year history, it has never flooded before. Matthew's floodwater reached only to its back door. ""We're expected to get water in this time,"" said Olivia Goins, who has waited tables there for five years. On Tuesday, the cafe won't be serving its famous $10.95 shrimp and grits. It will close for one of the few times in its history so employees can remove the fridges and freezers ahead of the flood. Like many residents and business owners in the city, they're trying to prepare in any way they can, but in the end, there's not much they can do. ""Water is water,"" Goins said bluntly. There's nothing anyone can really do; the floodwater is coming and, by all forecasts, will be catastrophic. Goins and the city of Georgetown are stuck playing the waiting game.

Gina Martinez,"A series of photos of a rising North Carolina river over three days shows the historic scale of the flooding in parts of North Carolina – even as the storm formerly known as Hurricane Florence moves slowly out of the Carolinas. The Cape Fear River in Fayetteville was at 60.1 feet and still rising as of noon Tuesday. It’s projected to crest at 61.6 feet, which is far from the 1945 record of 68.9 feet, but higher than the 58.9 feet it reached after Hurricane Matthew, according to the National Weather Service. The Cape Fear River expected to spread to a width of up to 2 miles, with several thousand homes and business threatened. As the city of Fayetteville begins to flood, up to 150 homes will be threatened, according to the National Weather Service. The flood waters aren’t expected to recede to normal levels until late Friday – one week after the hurricane made landfall. The Cape Fear River is just one of several major rivers that are spilling over their banks after Hurricane Florence brought massive storm surge and record rainfall to North and South Carolina. More than 25 inches of rain fell on inland parts of North and South Carolina – deluging streams and rivers with vast amounts of water. Lumber River in Lumberton is also at a Major Flood Stage with 21.9 feet of water, breaking the previous record of 21.8 feet, the National Weather Service said. The floodwaters are inching closer to the local Pepsi plant and dozens of homes will be isolated and inundated. Several roads will be closed near the river. Flooding is expected to continue there for the next few days. As of Tuesday, the death toll from Florence was at 32 and rising, with 24 of those deaths taking place in North Carolina, according to the Associated Press. The National Hurricane Center downgraded Florence to a tropical depression, but warned that catastrophic flash fooding, river flooding and landslides are still expected in western North Carolina and southwestern Virginia. On Sunday, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper warned residents at a press conference to steer clear of flooded areas in the upcoming days. “Never drive through flooded roads. Just a few inches of water can wash your car away,” Cooper said. Last week Mike Doll, Senior Meteorologist at Accuweather, warned that residents near the Cape Fear River and other low-lying areas next to streams, creeks and rivers, should prepare for river flooding. “Once the last drops of rain [have] occurred doesn’t mean problems are over,” he said. “People that live in flood-prone areas near creeks and rivers need to be prepared. Even after the rain has ended, residents should still pay attention.”",A series of photos of a rising North Carolina river over three days shows the historic scale of the flooding in parts of North Carolina – even as the storm formerly known as Hurricane Florence moves slowly out of the Carolinas.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"This morning you may hear the train conductor say something like: “Good morning, riders. Let’s keep the trains moving — walk all the way into the car, and please don’t hold the doors open.” Or with today’s soggy weather, conductors may warn: “Hello. Subway floors and station platforms may be slippery today. Be careful when you get on and off the train, or when taking the stairs.” Those examples were taken from a bulletin that was circulated to transportation employees this month. They are meant to be more human, more descriptive and “more empathetic to our customers’ frustrations,” according to the bulletin. When something goes wrong, the M.T.A. wants conductors to give real-time updates with more information about what’s going on — including how long you’ll be stuck, if they know. “We’re completely changing the way we communicate with our customers,” said Jon Weinstein, a spokesman for the M.T.A. “The basic language of New York City transit is changing.

Susanna Heller,"Charges have been dismissed against the woman who took in animals during Hurricane Florence, the Wayne County Government said in a press release on Tuesday. ""The safety and well-being of the animals was the primary concern of Wayne County Animal Services officers,"" a Facebook post announcing the dismissal of the charges said. ""Ms. Hedges surrendered all animals that did not belong to her to Animal Services."" Tammie Hedges, who runs an animal rescue group called Crazy's Claws N Paws, had been charged with practicing of veterinary care without a license. In the wake of Hurricane Florence, the Goldsboro, North Carolina, woman housed 27 animals in a space that she was in the process of converting into an unauthorized shelter, authorities said. While the animals were in her custody, Hedges allegedly administered the antibiotic amoxicillin to one cat, according to authorities. But in a new statement published on their Facebook page Tuesday, the Wayne County Government said it decided to dismiss charges against Hedges. ""The protection of animals and their well-being has always been an important concern, especially during times of natural disaster,"" District Attorney Matthew Delbridge began. ""A passion for and the love of animals is laudable but does not excuse unnecessarily putting their health at risk when other, safer resources are available."" In the statement, Delbridge noted that Hedges had previously been ""censured for the unauthorized practice of veterinary medicine"" and in this case had ""taken advantage of a dire situation to solicit money and opioid narcotics from our generous and well-intentioned citizens."" Following Hedges' arrest, all the animals were voluntarily surrendered to Wayne County Animal Services — and some have even been reunited with their rightful owners, or will be soon. Delbridge said the criminal charges against Hedges were dismissed to focus on ""violent crime"" in the region. ""It is my desire that having ensured the safety of the animals in question, a dismissal of these criminal charges will minimize further distraction from my core mission of protecting the public from violent crime and allow the North Carolina Veterinary Medical Board to take whatever action they may deem appropriate,"" he said. Hedges was previously released on $10,000 unsecured bond. A GoFundMe to help cover her legal fees has raised more than $40,000.

https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=742186908,"LUMBERTON, N.C. — The storm known as Florence is creating a slow-motion natural disaster for the Carolinas that could prove deceptively lethal as swollen rivers and streams spill over their banks and continue to rise. The hurricane, now downgraded to a tropical storm, was blamed by authorities for at least five deaths as of late Friday. Though Florence did not arrive with winds as violent as once feared, forecasters got the storm surge and rainfall correct. They have made clear that this event is all about the water — which the storm has delivered in devastating quantity. The storm made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., in the gloom of dawn Friday as a Category 1 hurricane. As the storm sat along the edge of the Atlantic, some stretches along the coastal Carolinas received close to 20 inches of rain. Florence is projected to migrate at barely more than a walking pace across northern South Carolina, passing close to the city of Florence — truly — on Saturday. The great danger now, experts say, is river flooding and then, once the remnants of the tempest reach the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians, flash floods, mudslides and debris flows. Relief will not come quickly. The National Weather Service said the floods are likely to last for weeks. This is a perilous moment for the hundreds of thousands of people who took to the roads to escape the storm’s fury. The rivers are in most cases several days from cresting. The parts of the country still in the storm’s path have been saturated by summer rains and cannot soak up any surplus from Florence. More than a dozen major rivers in the Carolinas and Southern Virginia are forecast by the National Weather Service to reach flood stage, and some — including the Neuse, Pamlico, Lumber, Waccamaw, Northeast Cape Fear and Pee Dee rivers — are expected to set flood records. There is really nowhere for the water to go. “We’re in God’s hands,” said Rick Foreman, pastor at West Lumberton Baptist Church, as the Lumber River steadily rose Friday and local residents filled sandbags. “We all know that.” The Weather Service forecast the Lumber to reach major flood stage Saturday and to keep rising through Sunday. State Sen. Danny Britt (R) put out a call on Facebook for volunteers to fill the sandbags and, with the help of 40 members of the National Guard, dam a railway channel that has been problematic during floods. “Pretty soon I had a hundred of my closest friends out here helping us out,” Britt said. “Sixty mile-per-hour winds, shingles flying off their own homes, and they’re here working for everyone else.” The river swamped the town after Hurricane Matthew came through two years ago: One church parishioner drowned during that storm, more than 700 families were displaced from their homes, and two of the city’s largest public housing projects were destroyed, Foreman said. And so as a pelting rain fell Friday, residents worked in soaked T-shirts and shorts to try to stave off another disaster. Usually hurricanes this far north deliver their punch and quickly leave town. Florence has been a strange tropical cyclone since it materialized in the distant Atlantic and took an unusual path toward the mainland United States. On Friday afternoon it was traveling at just 3 to 5 mph, still near the coast. “There’s nothing to steer it. It’s all about the steering currents. We don’t have any right now,” said Ken Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. “It’s like a bubble with no wind, it just floats. You don’t want slow, but that’s what we have.” South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R) urged patience, emphasizing that his state has never seen “a hurricane staying on top of us for this long.” The coast has been battered, and the mountains appear to be next. The remnants of Florence are expected to hit the peaks of western North Carolina in a couple of days. National Hurricane Center meteorologist Joel Cline said the mountains will wring water out of the moist tropical air: “It’s like running into a wall, and that moisture has to go somewhere, and it goes up, creates rain, and you have torrential rain in that area.” Cline said July was the wettest ever in that part of North Carolina, and the water table rose 21 inches higher than normal. Florence could add an additional six to 10 inches of rainfall this weekend. Flash floods can materialize within minutes of intense rain as the water rushes down hillsides. “You evacuate from water,” Cline said. “That’s why we’ve been preaching to people that you have to get away from the water.” Appalachian State University in Boone canceled its first home football game scheduled for Saturday. “It’s not often that we have to prepare for a hurricane in the mountains, but we are doing so on our campus,” Jason Marshburn, the director of safety and emergency management at the university, wrote in a letter to students and faculty members. Florence’s remnants are expected to keep traveling north and then northeast, and they could drop several inches of rain in eastern Tennessee and eastern Kentucky, southwest Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Flash flooding is a threat in those states as well. The Carolinas know all about hurricane-related flooding, having experienced Matthew two years ago and Floyd in 1999. Floyd, like Florence, hit Wilmington directly and dumped record amounts of rain. Rivers swelled not only with water but also with the carcasses of livestock. A number of motorists died trying to drive through moving water. Hence the refrain Friday from emergency management officials: Turn around, don’t drown. With the center of the storm still at sea early Friday, scores of residents had to be rescued from homes and the tops of cars in New Bern, N.C. Power outages mounted until nearly 700,000 customers were in the dark in North Carolina alone. Duke Energy said late Friday that it anticipates 1 million to 3 million outages in the Carolinas, and that full power restoration could take weeks. “The storm is wreaking havoc on our state, and we’re deeply concerned for farms, for businesses, for schools and even for whole communities that might be wiped away,” said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D). The eyewall of Florence struck the coast before dawn. At 5:30 a.m. a reporter in a downtown hotel in Wilmington heard the signature hurricane sound — a low, heavy humming combined with an almost musical high note. Eight-foot waves, a local record, ruffled the surface of the Cape Fear River. At 6 a.m. the electronics chirped for a moment as the power went out. Buildings swayed for several hours. The wind in Wilmington gusted to 105 mph, the strongest since Hurricane Helene on Sept. 27, 1958, the Weather Service said. The winds became less violent as the eye, no longer well-formed but instead welling with rain, passed over the city after it made landfall at 7:15 a.m. Trees went down, as did power lines, and streets filled with debris. A Waffle House downtown remained open for a few hours — sandwiches only, no coffee — before closing at noon. Metal signs and roof coverings littered the biggest commercial byway, Market Street, and trees blocked many roads. Traffic lights were out. Residents mostly heeded police commands to stay home and off the streets. In Kinston, a city southeast of Raleigh, two people died in the storm. A 78-year-old man connecting extension cords in the rain was electrocuted, according to Roger Dail, the Lenoir County director of emergency services. And a 77-year-old man died when he was knocked over by wind, he said. In Pender County, officials said that a woman died of a heart attack Friday morning as emergency crews tried to reach her; they were delayed because of downed trees and debris in the road. The crews tried to move the debris with a front loader, but a tree went through the windshield, causing further delays, the officials said. “Our hearts go out to the families of those who died in this storm,” Cooper said in a statement. “Hurricane Florence is going to continue its violent grind across our state for days. Be extremely careful and stay alert.” Sullivan reported from Wilmington, N.C. Berman and Achenbach reported from Washington.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Rivers and waterways, swollen after Florence’s historic deluge, rose dangerously across the Carolinas on Tuesday, closing roads, inundating communities, hindering rescue and repair efforts and preventing evacuees from returning home. Though slow-moving Florence has moved into the U.S. northeast, allowing glimpses of sunlight in the waterlogged state, at least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage with three others set to crest in the coming days, the state said. “One thing we know is that sunshine doesn’t necessarily mean safety,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a late-afternoon press conference and warned the 15,000 residents living in shelters against returning home too soon. More than 1,100 roads were still closed across North Carolina, Cooper said, including several portions of Interstates 40 and 95. Florence, which made landfall on Friday as a Category 1 hurricane before it was downgraded, has already killed at least 33 people, including 26 in North Carolina and six in South Carolina. One person was killed in Virginia when the storm spawned some 16 tornadoes there on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. The White House said President Donald Trump would visit North Carolina on Wednesday. He was criticized for his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last year, and more recently for disputing the official death toll of 3,000. ‘DRIVING NOT ADVISED’ In the town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, which has struggled to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, only about 50 residents remained on Tuesday, Fair Bluff Police Chief Chris Chafin told Reuters. The town has largely been cut off by flooding from the still-rising Lumber River, which was expected to crest on Wednesday. “I haven’t been home since it started. I can’t get home either,” Chafin said. Much of Columbus County, where Fair Bluff is located, was under water, according to Steve Abbott of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, with most roads closed and “driving not advised.” The Cape Fear River was also expected to keep rising in Fayetteville, a city of 200,000 in the southern part of the state near the Fort Bragg army base, according to the National Weather Service. That has hampered efforts to restore power, clear roads and allow residents to homes. Florence dumped more than 8 trillion gallons (30 trillion liters) of rain on North Carolina, the weather service said. “Road conditions are starting to improve in some parts of our state but rising creeks, streams and rivers continue to make travel unsafe,” Cooper said. Brock Long, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, appeared with Cooper and said his agency would help restore power and open roads. “I think the next 48 hours are going to be incredibly critical,” he said. THOUSANDS OF RESCUES In South Carolina, 40 major roads were closed. Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage after Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain on the state since Thursday. Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas, and more than 650 people were taken to safety in and around Wilmington, North Carolina, said Barbi Baker, a spokeswoman for New Hanover County. The coastal city took a direct hit when Hurricane Florence came ashore and has been largely cut off since then due to storm surges and flooding from the Cape Fear River. More than 324,000 customers, mostly in the Carolinas, were without power on Tuesday, according to power companies, down from a peak of nearly 1 million outages. North Carolina estimated on Tuesday 3.4 million poultry birds and 5,500 hogs died in the storm, exceeding the number killed in the state’s last major hurricane two years ago. Property damage from the storm is expected to range from $17 billion to $22 billion, the risk management firm Moody’s Analytics said. Further flooding could push up that figure.

Anna Mehler Paperny,"WILSON/WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Florence kept dumping rain on North Carolina on Sunday and officials warned residents that “the worst is yet to come” from a storm that has already killed at least eight people, as rivers inland were likely to flood. Florence, which crashed into the state as a hurricane on Friday, had weakened to a tropical depression by Sunday morning but was forecast to drop another 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 cm) of rain in North Carolina, bringing rainfall totals in some inland areas to 15 to 20 inches, according to the National Hurricane Center. The most rain so far from Florence was 33.9 inches (86 cm) in Swansboro, North Carolina, a new record for a single hurricane in the state. The previous record was 24 inches (61 cm), set by Hurricane Floyd, which killed 56 people in 1999, said Bryce Link, a meteorologist with DTN Marine Weather, a private forecasting service. In Fayetteville, a North Carolina city of about 210,000 people some 90 miles (145 km) inland, authorities told thousands of residents near the Cape Fear River and Little River to get out of their homes by Sunday afternoon because of the flood risk. “If you are refusing to leave during this mandatory evacuation, you need to do things like notify your legal next of kin because the loss of life is very, very possible,” Mayor Mitch Colvin said at a news conference on Saturday. “The worst is yet to come,” he added. A total of about 761,000 homes and businesses were without power on Sunday in North and South Carolina and surrounding states, down from a peak of nearly 1 million. In New Bern, about 90 miles northeast of Wilmington at the confluence of two rivers, Florence overwhelmed the town of 30,000 and left the downtown area under water. “It was pitch black and I was just scared out of my mind,” said Tracy Singleton, who with her family later fled her home near New Bern. As authorities rescued people by boat and even airlifted 50 stranded people in North Carolina, there were also reports of looting. Five people were arrested for breaking into a Dollar General Store, said the police department in Wilmington, which has imposed a nighttime curfew. A least seven people have died so far in the storm in North Carolina, including a mother and child killed by a falling tree and three people who drowned, state officials said. A woman died in South Carolina when her car hit a fallen tree. ‘CATASTROPHIC’ STORM “This is still a catastrophic, life threatening storm,” said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center. “It has already dumped 20 to 30 inches of rain on parts of the Carolinas with more to come,” he said. “And many of the rivers will see prolonged flooding, some not cresting for a few days.” Many roads were closed and authorities warned of landslides, tornadoes and flash floods, with dams and bridges in peril as rivers and creeks swelled. The flooding could taint waterways with murky coal ash and toxic hog waste. By Sunday morning the storm’s winds had dropped to about 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. It had picked up pace somewhat, moving west at 8 mph (13 kph), and its center was expected to move across the western Carolinas during Sunday and the Ohio Valley and Northeast United States on Monday and Tuesday. The White House said President Donald Trump approved making federal funding available in some affected counties. Trump, who plans to visit the region this week and he tweeted his “deepest sympathies and warmth” to the families and friends of those who died. As the United States dealt with Florence, a super typhoon made landfall in China’s Guangdong on Sunday after barreling past Hong Kong and Macau and killing dozens of people in the Philippines.

William Laws,"WASHINGTON (AP) — With a powerful hurricane bearing down on the southeast coast, President Donald Trump on Tuesday turned attention back to the federal government's response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico a year ago, deeming it ""incredibly successful"" even though a recent federal report found that nearly 3,000 people died. The administration's efforts in Puerto Rico received widespread criticism. But after visiting the island last September, Trump said that Puerto Ricans were fortunate that the storm did not yield a catastrophe akin to the havoc wreaked by Hurricane Katrina along the Gulf Coast. All told, about 1,800 people died in that 2005 storm. Puerto Rico's governor last month raised the U.S. territory's official death toll from Hurricane Maria from 64 to 2,975. The storm is also estimated to have caused $100 billion in damage. ""I actually think it was one of the best jobs that's ever been done with respect to what this is all about,"" Trump said Tuesday of the response in Puerto Rico, suggesting that it was made more difficult by the ""island nature"" of the storm site. The president praised the response to the series of storms that battered the United States last year, saying ""I think Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success. Texas we've been given A-pluses for. Florida we've been given A-pluses for.""

REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins Having long struggled to express empathy at times of national crises, Trump sparked outrage when during his visit to the island he feuded with the mayor of San Juan and passed out paper towels to victims like he was shooting baskets. While defending the handling of the previous storm, he urged caution in regards to the new one bearing down on North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. ""The safety of American people is my absolute highest priority,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. ""We are sparing no expense. We are totally prepared. We are ready. We are ready as anybody has ever been."" The president, flanked by maps of the storm and the heads of the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Florence was unlikely to change course before it is expected to make landfall with 130 mph winds and potentially ruinous rains in the coming days. ""They haven't seen anything like what's coming at us in 25, 30 years, maybe ever,"" Trump said of the states in the storm's path. ""It's tremendously big and tremendously wet. Tremendous amount of water."" Florence was expected to blow ashore late Thursday or early Friday, then slow down and wring itself out for days, unloading 1 to 2½ feet of rain that could cause flooding well inland and wreak environmental havoc by washing over industrial waste sites and hog farms. North and South Carolina and Virginia ordered mass evacuations along the coast.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","WTSP Meteorologist Ashley Batey says Hurricane Michael is packing major hurricane strength, a lot of rain and significant storm surge threats. USA TODAY A satellite image taken Tuesday afternoon, October 9, 2018, shows Hurricane Michael spinning in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. (Photo: NOAA) Hurricane Michael could rewrite the record books. The storm, now predicted to hit the Panhandle of Florida on Wednesday as a major hurricane, could rival the worst storms on record to hit that part of the state. ""Michael is currently forecast by the National Hurricane Center to have maximum sustained winds of 125 mph near its time of landfall,"" said Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach. ""If that were to verify as its landfall intensity, Michael would tie with Eloise (in 1975) and the Pensacola Hurricane of 1882 for strongest winds for a Florida Panhandle landfall on record,"" he added. Hurricane Eloise hit near Panama City, Florida, on September 23, 1975, and killed 21 people in the U.S. The 1882 hurricane hit near Navarre on September 10 of that year. Another noteworthy mark: If Michael hits as a Category 3 hurricane, it would be only the 10th major hurricane to hit the Panhandle since records began in 1851, Klotzbach said. And since 1950, only three major hurricanes have made landfall in the Florida Panhandle: Eloise (1975), Opal (1995) and Dennis (2005). A ""major"" hurricane is classified as a Category 3, 4 or 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity. Thus, any hurricane with winds of 111 or higher is considered a major hurricane. More: Hurricane Michael strengthens, targets Florida: 'You cannot hide from this storm' More: Track Hurricane Matthew More: More cruise ships alter course as Michael barrels toward Florida And as for the time of year, Michael would be only the 11th major hurricane to hit Florida in October on record. The most recent was Wilma in 2005. Florida tends to be ground zero for October hurricanes. Historically, about 60 percent of all continental U.S. landfalling hurricanes have hit Florida, according to Klotzbach. Florida Gov. Rick Scott warned Tuesday that ""Hurricane Michael is forecast to be the most destructive storm to hit the Florida panhandle in decades. It will be life-threatening and extremely dangerous. You cannot hide from this storm. You can rebuild your home, you cannot rebuild your life.""

Marcus Gilmer,"There's always, always a tweet. Donald Trump tweets incessantly, a habit he began well before he became president and one that opponents are now using against him. Whether it's in response to something Trump says, one of the many moments of chaos that occur every week of the Trump presidency, or just an old tweet that aged poorly, people are happy to throw old tweets back at Trump. SEE ALSO: Trump claims his loss of Twitter followers proves anti-conservative bias It's surprisingly easy just use Twitter's advanced search option and a few keywords but that doesn't make it any less wild how often Trump has gone back on previous statements. Sure, it's one thing for politicians to evolve, but this happens with enough regularity there's even an entire subreddit dedicated to it. It's impossible all of these as there are literally hundreds. But below find some of the bigger examples, including a few very recent ones, that just go to show that A laughing stock Trump was, of course, relentlessly critical of President Barack Obama. One of his favorite insults was to insist that, under Obama, the United States was a laughing stock or that the world was laughing at us. We need a President who isn't a laughing stock to the entire World. We need a truly great leader, a genius at strategy and winning. Respect! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2014 China, OPEC and Russia laugh at us. But now thanks to Obama so does Syria. Very sad! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2013 On September 25, 2018, though, the world quite literally laughed at Trump during his address before the United Nations. It's quite something to see, especially when you consider how quickly those aforementioned criticisms of Obama were rendered moot in a matter of seconds. How do you feel about Nikki Haley? On Tuesday, Nikki Haley resigned from her position as the United States' ambassador to the United Nations, and Trump took time to heap praise upon the former South Carolina governor. Shes done a fantastic job, and weve done a fantastic job together, Trump said. Those comments were a far cry, however, from how Trump felt about Haley back in 2016 when he was still fighting it out for the GOP nomination. The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 1, 2016 Of course, the bad blood was mutual with Haley being sharply critical of Trump. At least until Trump won, anyway. The eye of a hurricane On Wednesday, Trump went ahead with a planned rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, even as Hurricane Matthew blew onshore in Florida, leaving destruction in its wake. His reasoning: he didn't want to disappoint attendees who had lined up ahead of time. Of course, it didn't take long for folks to find two great examples of Trump taking shots at Obama on the 2012 campaign trail during the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, including one in which he blasted Obama for a fundraising stop two weeks after the storm. Lets be honest, if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm, then he would have been in Ohio on Monday. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2012 Yesterday Obama campaigned with JayZ &amp; Springsteen while Hurricane Sandy victims across NY &amp; NJ are still decimated by Sandy. Wrong! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 On the road again Speaking of travel, Trump has been quite the jet-setter himself, spending an inordinate amount of time away from the White House, either at one of his properties, playing golf, or holding one of his many ""MAGA"" rallies ahead of the midterms. He's already done six rallies in the first 10 days of this month, with two additional rallies scheduled by October 13. Earlier this fall, the Washington Post noted that Trump had spent 48 of the 92 days between June 7, 2018 and Sept. 7, 2018 at either a rally or at one of his properties. So of course there are old tweets in which he criticized Obama's traveling and golf during his presidency. We pay for Obama's travel so he can fundraise millions so Democrats can run on lies. Then we pay for his golf. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2014 Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2014 Guns in school Like Clinton, Bush, and Obama before him, Trump has had to face the sad reality of school shootings as a too-common occurrence. The most high-profile example during Trump's tenure so far was the Parkland school shooting, which spawned a new anti-gun movement led by survivors, a meeting with gun violence victims in which Trump had some curious notes, and the president suggesting that teachers should be armed. Armed Educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them. Very smart people. Must be firearms adept &amp; have annual training. Should get yearly bonus. Shootings will not happen again - a big &amp; very inexpensive deterrent. Up to States. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2018 This is exact opposite of what he proclaimed on the campaign trail in 2016, when he tweeted that he didn't want guns in schools. Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 22, 2016 Striking Syria During Obama's second term, Trump was highly critical of Obama's handling of Syria, the Bashar al-Assad regime, and the possibility of military action. Just as with everything else, he wasn't afraid to share his opinion, including in all-caps. AGAIN, TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA - IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN &amp; FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2013 President Obama, do not attack Syria. There is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your ""powder"" for another (and more important) day! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2013 Obama would eventually order a strike on Syria in Sept. 2014, about a year after Trump sent the above tweets. In April 2017, Trump decided it was time for action, ordering a strike on a Syrian air base in response to a Assad's use of chemical weapons as part of Syria's civil war. A year later, in April 2018, following another of Assad's chemical attacks, Trump ordered yet another military strike on Syria. The fight over LGBTQ rights During the 2016 campaign, Trump swore up and down he would do more than Hillary Clinton protect the rights of the LGBTQ community. Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 14, 2016 Well, here we are, almost two years into the administration and, so far, Trump's agenda has been horrible for LGBTQ rights. And that's just scratching the surface. ( Vox and Buzzfeed have pretty detailed lists of the Trump administration's anti-LGBTQ actions and they are harrowing reads.) So much for campaign promises. Hail to the chiefs As we've seen, Trump was always up to take shots at Obama whenever he could and that extended to Obama's staff and the heavy turnover at the top. Indeed, Obama went through four different chiefs-of-staff during his first term. (Though Denis McDonough served in that position for the entirety of Obama's second term.) But before Obama won re-election, Trump let fly with a crack aimed at the revolving door in the Obama administration. 3 Chief of Staffs in less than 3 years of being President: Part of the reason why @BarackObama can't manage to pass his agenda. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 10, 2012 While it's true that Trump has been through only two chiefs-of-staffs so far, it still remains a real possibility that he equals or even betters Obama's number of chiefs. And the tweet seems even worse in hindsight, given the chaos that has engulfed Trump's White House with an ""unprecedented"" turnover in staff less than two years into his first term. A failed agenda In 2016, Trump ascended to the White House with both the House and Senate in Republican control, paving the way for what should have been a legislative steamrolling. And, sure, Trump has managed to get plenty of bills and other key items approved namely two Supreme Court justices and his tax cut legislation his first two years aren't any sort of improvement over Obama's first two years which he was highly critical of. Obama's complaints about Republicans stopping his agenda are BS since he had full control for two years. He can never take responsibility. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2012 Trump has faced some big league failures as well, as his own health care and immigration legislation have both been defeated, and he's failed to secure funding for his long-promised border wall. It's led to great consternation on Trump's part as these defeats have revealed, whether or not he realizes it, that it's a lot easier to hurl criticisms about political agendas than it is to actually pass an agenda. Democrats would do much better as a party if they got together with Republicans on Healthcare,Tax Cuts,Security. Obstruction doesn't work! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 21, 2017 Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation, for a change! This is why we need more Republicans elected in November. Democrats are good at only three things, High Taxes, High Crime and Obstruction. Sad! Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 16, 2018 If anything, Trump has learned how to chip away at things piecemeal, as evidenced by the way he's slowly altered the health care system previously laid out by Obama's Affordable Care Act. And, like Obama, Trump is likely to learn that no matter what legislation you pass in those first two years, voters will reward a president by taking away his party's congressional advantage.","There's always, always a tweet.

Christopher Condon,"Federal Reserve officials followed through on an expected interest-rate increase and raised their forecast for economic growth in 2018, even as they stuck with a projection for three hikes in the coming year. “Averaging through hurricane-related fluctuations, job gains have been solid, and the unemployment rate declined further,” the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement Wednesday following a two-day meeting in Washington. Inflation will remain below the Fed’s 2 percent goal in the near term but “stabilize” around the target in the medium term, the central bank said. In a key change to the statement, the Fed omitted prior language saying it expected the labor market would strengthen further. Instead, Wednesday’s missive said monetary policy would help the labor market “remain strong.” That suggests Fed officials expect improvement in the job market to slow. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes was little changed after the Fed announcement, as was the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index. The 7-2 vote for the rate move, the Fed’s third this year, raises the benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent. In another move that could tighten monetary conditions, the Fed confirmed that it would step up the monthly pace of shrinking its balance sheet, as scheduled, to $20 billion beginning in January from $10 billion. Through the policy adjustments and the statement, the Fed continued to seek a delicate balance between responding to positive news on growth and unemployment that encouraged gradual tightening, while signaling caution due to persistently weak inflation readings that have befuddled policy makers. That puzzle continued earlier Wednesday when Labor Department data showed consumer inflation, excluding food and energy, was lower than expected at 1.7 percent in the 12 months through November. Inflation Developments “Hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding have affected economic activity, employment and inflation in recent months but have not materially altered the outlook for the national economy,” the Fed said. Repeating language used since June, the FOMC said that “near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.” In the latest set of quarterly forecasts released Wednesday, the median estimate for economic growth next year jumped to 2.5 percent from 2.1 percent. It wasn’t immediately clear how much of the change reflected confidence that the tax-cut legislation moving through Congress will boost growth, or other factors such as pickups in business spending and global growth. At the same time, the committee’s median forecast for long-run expansion was unchanged at 1.8 percent, suggesting officials aren’t yet convinced the tax package will significantly affect the economy’s capacity for growth. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and the Chicago Fed’s Charles Evans both dissented against the interest-rate decision, preferring to leave them unchanged. It was the first meeting with more than one dissent since November 2016; Kashkari’s dissent was his third this year. Evans dissented for the first time since 2011. Fed Chair Janet Yellen will hold what’s expected to be her last post-meeting press conference at 2:30 p.m. If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Fed Governor Jerome Powell, President Trump’s nominee to succeed her, will take over when her four-year term as chair expires on Feb. 3. What Our Economists Say: “The most important takeaway from the December FOMC meeting is that even though policy makers are becoming more bullish on economic prospects, they are not shifting to a more hawkish policy stance. An extended inflation soft patch is giving the Powell-Fed a free pass to continue along Janet Yellen’s gradualist path toward policy normalization.” -- Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva, Bloomberg Economics. That follows a solid rebound for the expansion since a disappointing start to 2017. Gross domestic product grew at more than a 3 percent annualized pace in both the second and third quarters, and is on track to expand in the fourth quarter by 2.9 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracking estimate. Rate Path Despite the upgrade in near-term growth expectations, policy makers left the number of hikes projected for 2018 effectively unchanged. The median forecast pegged the federal funds rate at 2.1 percent at the end of next year. That could, in part, reflect lingering concerns over sluggish wage and price gains. The Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, based on consumer spending, gained just 1.6 percent in the year through October. Weighed against unemployment, which has dropped to a 16-year low at 4.1 percent, that weakness has puzzled economists and made some policy makers declare the Fed should hold off on additional rate increases until prices respond more briskly. The committee lowered its median estimate for the unemployment rate, expecting it to hit 3.9 percent by the end of 2018, compared with a September projection of 4.1 percent. The committee left its median estimate for the lowest sustainable level of long-run unemployment at 4.6 percent, suggesting that officials still expect the drop in joblessness to eventually boost inflation. Forecasts showed little change in the inflation outlook over the next three years. Yellen is expected to chair the committee’s next meeting on Jan. 30-31 for what will be her last FOMC gathering of her time on the committee spanning three decades as chair, vice chair, San Francisco Fed president and governor. Other Details of Projections Median estimate for 2019 federal funds rate held at 2.7 percent; 2020 projection rose to 3.1 percent from 2.9 percent, while long-run rate remained at 2.8 percent Median inflation forecasts all unchanged except for 2017 headline PCE forecast, which rose to 1.7 percent from 1.6 percent 2019 median economic-growth forecast rose to 2.1 percent from 2 percent; 2020 projection moved to 2 percent from 1.8 percent Median 2019 unemployment-rate projection fell to 3.9 percent from 4.1 percent; 2020 estimate declined to 4 percent from 4.2 percent — With assistance by Matthew Boesler","Bloomberg Fed Raises Rates While Keeping Three-Hike Outlook for 2018 Bloomberg Federal Reserve officials followed through on an expected interest-rate increase and raised their forecast for economic growth in 2018, even as they stuck with a projection for thr…",2017-12-13T19:21:15Z,"{'id': 'bloomberg', 'name': 'Bloomberg'}",Fed Raises Rates While Keeping Three-Hike Outlook for 2018 - Bloomberg,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-13/fed-raises-rates-while-sticking-to-three-hike-outlook-for-2018,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ikaqhY3Kbf5U/v0/1200x800.jpg,bloomberg,Bloomberg,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kohler,"For developing communities in many parts of the world, safe drinking water is far from a guaranteed part of daily life. Hand in hand with water safety is the issue of proper sanitation. A lack of resources, infrastructure, and education often means that practices like open defecation or poor hand-washing further threaten a community's already precarious water supply. Water Mission, an engineering nonprofit that designs, builds, and implements safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) solutions in developing regions and disaster areas, understands that both education and engineering play a key role in addressing the world's water crisis. With World Toilet Day coming up this November 19, WASH issues are a particularly timely topic. We spoke with Water Mission's Director of Community Development Andrew Armstrong and Community Development Specialist Caroline Foster to dig into the organization's goals for responding to these pressing global issues. To date, Water Mission has provided access to safe water to more than 3.6 million people across 55 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Water Mission understands that no two communities are the same. The organization tailors sanitation solutions to the parts of the world in which it operates in part by having boots on the ground. In addition to Water Mission's Charleston, South Carolina-based team of scientists and staff, the organization also deploys volunteers to work on-location in rural communities around the globe. This on-the-ground expertise is especially important in times of natural disaster, particularly when it comes to informing relief efforts that may require knowledge of cultural sanitation norms. The organization has helped out with relief efforts ranging from treating water and combatting ebola in Liberia to working with UNICEF Malawi in response to extreme flooding. They've also contributed to efforts in Nepal (in the wake of the 2015 earthquake), Tanzania (working with refugee camps), and Haiti (in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, Water Mission provided safe water to more than 100,000 people). Image: Water Mission One of the company's core beliefs, says Armstrong, is that scalable solutions don’t have to come at the expense of high-quality service. In other words: It's possible to prioritize both quantity and quality. When it comes to sanitation, ""Water Mission's overarching goals are to protect human health and human dignity,"" says Armstrong. ""So we want to protect people from microbiological contamination, but we also aim to protect privacy."" The best solution, he says, to achieving these goals across the board is the pour-flush latrine — or a toilet without a tank that's flushed by pouring a small amount of water into the bowl. When it comes to installing and maintaining these types of sanitation solutions, Foster says that community mobilization is a major part of the process. ""Members of the community run the show,"" she explains. ""They all get training — be it financial training or training on the WASH systems — and they’re in charge of keeping everything going throughout the lifespan of the project."" Our overarching goals are to protect human health and human dignity. This system of education and accountability, she explains, has proven successful in the long-term: In a 2008-2015 initiative in Honduras, for example, Water Mission installed 15,664 latrines throughout 464 communities. In 2016, 85% of installed latrines were still functioning, and 82% were still in use. These numbers, Armstrong and Foster say, are high compared to other approaches (such as implementing homemade latrines, which often last no longer than one year). Armstrong explains that initiatives are carried out both on the community and household level. In homes that qualify for subsidized latrines (such as The Healthy Latrine, one of the most common solutions Water Mission utilizes), the capital cost is typically funded by a donor. The fraction of the subsidy varies based on different contexts, such as how much a family is able to contribute on their own. ""The pour-flush design is a more expensive design, but ultimately it’s those [costlier qualities of the latrines] that keep people using them,"" says Foster. In other words, the up-front investment is worth it in the long run. Water Mission is now turning its focus to Western Honduras in an effort to bring sanitation solutions to even more Honduran homes. They're working with companies like Kohler to improve upon the designs that have been effective in other parts of the country. ""We want to continue investing in pour-flush toilet technology,"" says Armstrong. In addition to installing Kohler toilets as part of this upcoming project, Water Mission is especially excited by the broad product potential of the partnership. “We’re also working with Kohler to develop a low-cost, efficient, and aspirational hand-washing station that can be used in all kinds of contexts,” says Armstrong. “So, it's a multi-faceted relationship."" ""Kohler is all about high-quality products and aspirational living, and that very much lines up with our core values,"" he adds.","For developing communities in many parts of the world, safe drinking water is far from a guaranteed part of daily life.

Andrew Duehren,"LUMBERTON, N.C.Lottie Locklear was just starting to get her life back in order two years after Hurricane Matthew struck her home when Hurricane Florence rolled into the Carolinas in September, dumping more than 30 inches of rain here. Ms. Locklears home flooded again, and she spent more than a week in a shelter before staying with her niece. One of the last bits of mail Ms. Locklear, 66 years old, had received before the hurricane was confirmation that she was registered to vote, a piece of paper that is now lost. I guess its in the water. Floating somewhere, she said, adding that she doesnt plan to try to vote. Ms. Locklear lives in North Carolinas competitive ninth congressional district, where two political newcomers are vying for an open Republican House seat. Hurricane survivors like Ms. Locklear could play an important role in the midterm elections in North Carolina and Florida based on whether or not they vote in large numbers. The states were slammed by two hurricanes in quick succession Florence in September and Michael in October further complicating the high-stakes homestretch to the election. Michael tore through the Florida Panhandle, home to a swath of Republican counties, flattening buildings and knocking out power lines. How many voters turn out there Nov. 6 could be pivotal in the tossup Senate race between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and his GOP challenger, Gov. Rick Scotta contest that will help determine which party wins control of the Senate. State and local election officials are working to ensure people can vote. In the wake of Florence, which last month left more than 40 people dead, North Carolina officials changed damaged polling locations and extended the voter-registration deadline by three days in the 28 hardest-hit counties. The state is also spending $400,000 on an advertising campaign aimed at hurricane survivors to keep voting on their minds when they have a lot else on their minds, said Patrick Gannon, a spokesman for the North Carolina Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement. In Florida, Mr. Scott issued an executive order Thursday allowing local election officials to change polling locations and extend early voting in counties ravaged by Hurricane Michael. Dozens died in the storm and more than a thousand remain missing, though rescue workers said that many might be safe and without phone access. Even with these accommodations, voting remains an afterthought for many people affected. On Wednesday, the first day of early voting in North Carolina, Hoit Pierce, 68, wasnt headed to the polls. Instead, Mr. Pierce, whose home was flooded both last month and during Hurricane Matthew two years ago, went with his wife to the Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster center in Lumberton. A Republican who voted for President Trump in 2016, he didnt return from his daughters home in Arizona until last week, and since then he has been consumed by repairs. Im more worried about getting my house fixed than I am about voting, he said. North Carolinas ninth congressional district begins in Charlotte and stretches east into rural Robeson County. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the race in the district as a tossup, making it a key target for Democrats looking to win the chamber in November. While the race will likely be won or lost in the more populous areas near Charlottewhich was spared the worst of the hurricanesthe storms aftermath provides both political opportunities and challenges for candidates. Our candidates have had a lot of visibility during the hurricane. Obviously its not the way you want to get visibility, said Phillip Stevens, the Robeson County GOP Chairman. The race pits Republican Mark Harris against Democrat Dan McCready, a Marine veteran who is running as a moderate in a district President Trump won by 11 percentage points. Each has pitched in with the recovery. Mr. Harris, a Baptist pastor who unseated the Republican incumbent in a primary, took a helicopter tour of damaged areas in the days following Hurricane Florence. Mr. McCready toured recovery operations in the eastern parts of the district. They both participated in a bipartisan event to aid the rebuilding effort. Its a balancing act. On the one hand you want to look like you care, on the other you dont want to look like youre exploiting a tragedy, said Thomas Mills, a Democratic political consultant in North Carolina. Though their recovery work wasnt controversial, a conflict erupted between the candidates due to the storm. Mr. McCready, who has raised large sums in the race, announced that he was suspending his campaign, while Mr. Harris aired ads on the Weather Channel in addition to other cable channels. The Democratic campaign blasted Mr. Harris, saying he took advantage of a natural disaster, while Mr. Harris said that Mr. McCreadys statement suspending his campaign was more or less a public relations play. None of that matters to Joyce Cribb, 59. Fierce winds tore the roof off her mobile home like a sardine can during Florence, she said, ruining most of her belongings. Ms. Cribb and her husband have lived in the First Baptist Church in Lumberton ever since, sleeping in beds set up in the event hall. As she has navigated the recovery process, applying for FEMA funding to replace her home, she hasnt had time to tune in to national politics. One of our friends from church come the day before yesterday and brought that TV and thats the first time Ive seen any television since.

""My wife's sitting on the porch with a shotgun right now,"" he said. ""Have you ever seen a woman who smokes when she's out of cigarettes?"" Compared to that, Hurricane Florence and its aftermath never stood a chance. So Wolvin sloshed a mile and a half through the waters of the overgrown Little River from his home in Spring Lake near Fort Bragg, past the floating cars, the submerged Starlite Motel and the swamped Sunoco gas station, to the nearest shopping center. A crowd gathered to watch as he emerged in a soaked pair of shorts and a Jeff Gordon T-shirt.

The National Weather Service predicted the nearby Cape Fear River could crest at record levels of 62 feet by Wednesday. If the Cape Fear backs up, the Little River and surrounding waters could, too. Water already bubbled up through cracks in the stsreet pavement Tuesday. And runoff from a Monday night thunderstorm just adds to the risk.

Reuters,"By Brian Snyder PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Another 10 people in Florida have been confirmed dead in the wake of Hurricane Michael, bringing the number of storm-related deaths to at least 29 as rescue workers try to reach hundreds more people whose whereabouts are unknown. Michael, which made landfall on Wednesday as one of the most powerful storms on record to hit the continental United States, has killed 20 people in the Florida Panhandle, five in Virginia, three in North Carolina and one in Georgia, according to official tallies. Teams from volunteer rescue organization CrowdSource Rescue were steadily making contact with people flagged by friends and relatives in the Panhandle disaster zone, according to Matthew Marchetti, co-founder of the Houston-based group. Volunteers still had not reached more than 1,135 people on Tuesday morning. As cellphone service returned, the number of people unaccounted for in Mexico Beach, one of the hardest-hit towns, dropped to three, said Rex Putnal, a city councillor. A day earlier, it was more than 30. Hopefully, they left and well find them safe somewhere, he said, before heading to a clean-up effort where workers awaited the arrival of some overdue portable toilets. This type of living wears on you, Putnal said. This is about my fifth day and Im just not used to washing clothes in a tub with no washer and dryer and eating only peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. The town of 1,200 residents had reported two fatalities as of Monday. Rescue workers were using dogs to find any bodies that might be buried under the debris. More than 200,000 people remained without power in the U.S. Southeast, with residents of battered coastal towns forced to cook on fires and barbecue grills. At least 80 percent of customers in three mainly rural Panhandle counties were without electricity on Tuesday. Officials said it could be weeks before power returns to some. Countless residents in the regions backcountry have struggled for days without running water or sanitation, awaiting help from authorities. Some have been camping in tents with the belongings they were able to salvage. Im staying out here to try to keep away looters, to try to save what I can save, said Bernard Sutton, a 64-year-old cancer patient, who has been living out of a tent and broken-down minivan. Downed trees hampered access to those stranded by the storm. The state government is distributing ice, water and about 3 million ready-to-eat meals, according to Governor Rick Scotts office. Water supply was restored to some residents in Panama City on Monday but Bay County officials said it was not yet safe to drink. Michael slammed into the Florida Panhandle last week with top sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (250 km per hour). The winds and storm surge caused $6 billion to $10 billion in insured losses, risk modeller AIR Worldwide said. Those figures exclude uninsured property or losses paid out by the National Flood Insurance Program, AIR Worldwide said. U.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump visited the storm-affected areas on Monday, distributing bottles of water at an aid centre in Lynn Haven, a city of about 18,500 people near Panama City.

"Asheville Citizen Times, Sam DeGrave, Asheville Citizen Times","Hurricane Florence was downgraded to a Category 2 storm but forecasters warned that the enormous wind field has been growing larger, raising the risk of the ocean surging on to land. (Sept. 13) AP Evacuation out of the question: In Kinston — and likely elsewhere in eastern North Carolina, home to some of the state's greatest pockets of poverty — evacuation isn't possible. (Photo: Sam DeGrave, USA TODAY NETWORK) KINSTON, N.C. – As Hurricane Florence churned toward the North Carolina coast, Gov. Roy Cooper tripled down on a warning he’s been issuing for days: Get out of this storm’s way. “This monster of a storm is not one to ride out,” Cooper said Wednesday from the steps of the state Department of Public Safety’s emergency management staging site in eastern North Carolina. But in Kinston — a town of nearly 21,000 people living 30 miles of west of New Bern, where the Neuse River widens on its way to the Outer Banks — the governor’s urgent warning went largely unheeded. Having only two years ago lived through Hurricane Matthew, which devastated portions of the state’s eastern reaches, some Kinston residents decided to stay. Others, constrained by economic circumstances, remained because they had no choice. Poverty is an anchor for many in Kinston, home to some of North Carolina’s most economically distressed neighborhoods despite its budding reputation as a food destination. Ben Knight watched Wednesday as a small team of workers fastened sheets of plywood to the windows of Chef &amp; the Farmer — a nationally renowned restaurant in the heart of downtown that Knight owns with his wife Vivian Howard. Knight said he’d elected to stay behind while Howard and their children headed west, out of Florence’s reach. “I think a lot more people have left for this storm, but most people in this town will stay,” Knight said. “With the median income of this town being less than half of the national average, some people will have to stay.” No home to leave: Tony Clower, 39, would like to follow the governor's advice and evacuate, but he's homeless. (Photo: Sam DeGrave, USA TODAY NETWORK) 'Not an option' Tony Clower, 39, falls firmly within that camp. The 12-year Kinston resident is homeless. Clower said he thinks others in Kinston should heed Cooper’s warning, advice he said he’d follow if he could. “I think people should listen when he says to leave because this is going to be a bad storm,” Clower said. “Some people are getting out of town, but that’s not an option for me. I have no money, no job, no connections.” Jasper Newborn, who runs the city’s only emergency homeless shelter, said that on any given night, he’ll house about 15 people, but that “represents less than 10 percent of the city’s homeless population.” The rest sleep on the street or wherever else they can find shelter, he said. Track: Follow Hurricane Florence's forecasted path More: Hurricane Florence weakened but far from weak: What to know about storm's power More: Hurricane Florence nears coast: 'This is a life-threatening situation' Natural disasters, Newborn said, most adversely impact the city’s most vulnerable population: the indigent. And as Hurricane Florence looms, he said he’s worried about what will happen to the city’s homeless residents who decide not to seek refuge. Friends of the Homeless, the shelter which Newborn founded in 1990, only has 35 beds, but he said he won't be turning anybody away during the storm. Clower said he planned to weather the storm in a small wooden shed in which a friend was letting him live. “Getting out of dodge is not always easy; it’s not always cheap,” Newborn said. “You’ve got to have transportation. You’ve got to have housing. That all costs money.” Kinston has a 30 percent poverty rate, according to 2015 U.S. Census data – nearly double that of North Carolina as a whole. A 2014 study by the Center for Urban &amp; Regional Studies at UNC Chapel Hill found a Census tract within Kinston to be the state’s most distressed among rural areas for its poverty rate, per capita income and unemployment. Empty for now: Friends of the Homeless Emergency Shelter, in downtown Kinston, stood empty Wednesday afternoon as Cleoxin Waters restocked supplies. But come Thursday, when Hurricane Florence hits, Jasper Newborn, who founded the shelter in 1990, hopes that the city's homeless population fills his shelter's beds. (Photo: Sam DeGrave) 'Where else I got to go?' The burdensome economic impact of evacuation doesn’t strictly impact the homeless. In east Kinston, not far from one of the city’s subsidized housing developments, Michael Weathington, 53, sat waiting for a ride on the porch of his home — a humble abode of whitewashed wooden siding beneath a rust-tinged metal roof. Weathington said he witnessed Hurricane Matthew, and as far as he’s concerned he can live through another hurricane, even if Florence is supposed to be bigger and more dangerous. But he would struggle to leave even if he wanted to. “I don’t have a car, and my whole family is here. Where else I got to go?” he said. “I’m just going to ride it out.” At least two emergency shelters have opened in or near Kinston to house those who might be displaced by the storm. Business is booming: Though Chef &amp; the Farmer is closed until Hurricane Florence passes, the men who worked Wednesday to cover the restaurant's doors and windows with plywood are seeing plenty of business. The Kinston restaurant was one of several businesses that they've boarded shut in the past several days, they said. (Photo: Sam DeGrave) Different circumstances, different impacts Travis Quinn, director of sales for Kinston’s Mother Earth Brewing, has lived in Eastern North Carolina his whole life. He grew up in Kenansville, a small town about 45 minutes south of Kinston, where he now lives. Quinn is no stranger to hurricanes, and while he isn’t evacuating, he said he and the brewery staff are preparing for a walloping. “This is not our first hurricane, and it’s not something that we take lightly. We’ve seen what these storms can do,” he said. Get out: At three separate press conferences Wednesday, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper warned anybody who would listen to evacuate if they're in Hurricane Florence's path. (Photo: Sam DeGrave) “The threat of another large storm coming through is really challenging for the community as a whole,” Quinn said. But as Knight pointed out while standing outside of Chef &amp; the Farmer, some people and businesses are better suited to absorb the damaging impacts of major storms. Large farming companies can likely roll with Hurricane Florence’s punches. Family farmers, on the other hand, could be ruined if the storm wreaks havoc on their crops, Knight said. While some consider the economic impacts of the storm, there are others — in some cases living right down the road — who are simply hoping to make it out of the storm alive. Clower is among them. “I’m really worried about the storm,” he said standing outside of a convenience store, where he works odd jobs in exchange for snacks, like Hot Pockets. “I want to cry. All I can do is put my hands together and ask God to keep me safe.” The sign says it all: Much of Kinston sits adjacent to the Neuse River, which in heavy rain bursts its banks and, in the past, has devastated the community. (Photo: Sam DeGrave, USA TODAY NETWORK) Elsewhere in eastern North Carolina In the small community of Kelly in Bladen County, roughly 90 miles southwest of Kinston, some have chosen not to leave because they, too, don’t have the resources, said Charles Russ, the former fire chief who now runs Kelly General Store. Areas nearby flooded heavily two years ago during Matthew, Russ said. Kelly’s less than 15 minutes from Pender County, where officials have called a mandatory evacuation, leaving flyers wedged in the cracks of doors. Russ said he’s worried that “people aren’t taking this seriously.” “I tell people it’s going to be nothing like we’ve seen before.” But for some, the trip to higher ground is beyond what they can manage, he said. “There was one family that just moved in here. I asked if they were going somewhere. She said, ‘We spent all the money we had coming here.’” Reporter Joel Burgess contributed to this article.

Anna Mehler Paperny,"WILSON, N.C. (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Florence was likely to weaken on Sunday as it swept through the Carolinas but dozens of communities are devastated and “epic” amounts of rain could still fall, officials said. The storm is expected to become a Tropical Depression as it trudged inland early Sunday, knocking out power and causing at least eight deaths as flood waters kept rising. North Carolina officials have reported at least seven storm-related fatalities with unconfirmed reports of a further three deaths. South Carolina authorities reported one death. “This is still a catastrophic, life threatening storm,” said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Center’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. Winds have dropped to about 40 miles per hour (65 kph) since it roared ashore along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast on Friday as a hurricane and it is crawling west over two states at 6 mph (9 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said early Sunday. Taylor said the storm already dumped 30 inches of rain on some parts of the N.C. “This storm is still deadly and dangerous and it’s expected to turn northward later today into Virginia and the mid-Atlantic,” he said. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said: “This system is unloading epic amounts of rainfall, in some places measured in feet and not inches.” Rivers will continue to rise days after the rain has stopped, he said. Around 50 stranded people were airlifted by helicopter in North Carolina, said Petty Officer Michael Himes of the U.S. Coast Guard. More than 26,000 hunkered down in shelters. Roads were closed and authorities warned of landslides, tornadoes and flash floods, with dams and bridges in peril as rivers and creeks swelled. As of Saturday, about 676,000 homes and businesses were without power in North Carolina, along with 119,000 in South Carolina. The White House said President Donald Trump approved making federal funding available in some affected counties. Trump, who plans to visit the region next week and he tweeted his “deepest sympathies and warmth” to the families and friends of those who had lost their lives. WORST YET TO COME Florence was drifting westward over South Carolina, reaching about 25 miles southeast of Columbia S.C. at 2 a.m. Sunday, the NHC said. Up to 40 inches (102 cm) of rain are expected along coastal areas of the Carolinas and up to 10 inches in southwestern Virginia, it said. In Fayetteville, a North Carolina city of about 210,000 people about 90 miles inland, authorities told thousands of residents near the Cape Fear River and Little River to get out of their homes by Sunday afternoon because of the flood risk. “If you are refusing to leave during this mandatory evacuation, you need to do things like notify your legal next of kin because the loss of life is very, very possible,” Mayor Mitch Colvin said at a news conference. “The worst is yet to come,” he added. The storm made landfall on Friday near Wilmington, a city of about 120,000 squeezed between North Carolina’s Atlantic coastline and the Cape Fear River. Near the Sutton Power Plant in Wilmington, coal ash leaked from a Duke Energy landfill. The site lost enough material to fill around two-thirds of an Olympic-sized pool, the company said in a statement, adding that it did not believe the incident posed a risk to health or the environment. Officials had warned before the storm rains could taint waterways with murky coal ash and toxic hog waste. Florence has already set a North Carolina record for rainfall totals, exceeding that of Hurricane Floyd, which struck in 1999 and caused 56 deaths. Floyd produced 24 inches of rain in some parts of the state, while Florence has already dumped about 30 inches in areas around Swansboro. In New Bern, about 90 miles northeast of Wilmington at the confluence of two rivers, Florence overwhelmed the town of 30,000 and left the downtown area under water. Some area residents described a harrowing retreat as the storm hit. “It was pitch black and I was just scared out of my mind,” said Tracy Singleton, who with her family later drove through torrential rain and high winds from her home near New Bern. South Carolina authorities said law enforcement officers were guarding against looting in evacuated areas, while Wilmington set a curfew on Saturday evening in response to looting in one area. As the United States dealt with Florence, a super typhoon swirled towards Hong Kong and the Chinese coast on Sunday, gaining in strength over the South China Sea after hurtling through the Philippines, where it wreaked havoc that killed at least 25.

Enjoli Francis,"As North Carolina continued to reel in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence making landfall, Gov. Roy Cooper said first responders were working hard to evacuate people near rivers. Interested in Hurricane Florence? Add Hurricane Florence as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricane Florence news, video, and analysis from ABC News. ""This storm is slowly and painfully grinding across our state. Our main worry is water and flooding. With every inch of rain, our rivers rise and we'll see significant flooding on into next week -- could be of historic proportions.... Our No. 1 concern right now is the safety of our people here,"" Cooper told ABC News' David Muir Friday. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper gives an update about Hurricane Florence on Sept. 14, 2018. Cooper said the state was getting forecasts of rivers being higher than they were during Hurricane Matthew in 2016 when North Carolina saw significant flooding across the state. At least five fatalities were reported Friday because of Florence, including a mother and infant. Preliminary reports show more than 30 inches of rain in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, according to the U.S Geological Survey. If confirmed by the National Weather Service, this number would break the state record for rainfall from a tropical cyclone. ""We're seeing potential for flooding in counties that haven't seen flooding in recent years and we're looking at 500- to 1000-year rain and flood events here in North Carolina. Our preparation is now having to turn to determination and we're going to work hard to recover and recover quickly,"" Cooper said. ""North Carolinians are resilient and we’re going to pull together and get this thing done."" The Neuse River floods the waterfront in New Bern, N.C., on Sept. 14, 2018 during Hurricane Florence. He urged residents not to return to their homes to check the damage to their property. ""Stay in place. People are still being rescued in coastal North Carolina. We've got a lot of debris, a lot of covered roads, covered with water. (It's) a dangerous situation here,"" Cooper said. ""We also are going to have utility companies go out into the field and try to restore power. They're predicting a potential million to 2.5 million people without power and so that is going to be a painstaking and dangerous process, so I'm telling people to stay where you are.

Nicole Gallucci,"Forget Shark Week, it’s Bark Week on Mashable. Join us as we celebrate all the good dogs, which we humans do not deserve. When a celebrity has a soft spot for pups, it just makes them all the more lovable. So we've complied a list of some of the most dog-friendly people in the spotlight. Some share an occasional heartfelt pet tribute, while others dish out a daily dose of puppy love. And a few celebs are so in love with their furry companions that they've gone the extra mile to make their dogs their own Instagram accounts. SEE ALSO: Show your pup's personality with these easy style upgrades Here are 12 celebrities who are rightfully obsessed with their dogs: 1. Chris Evans After saving the world, Captain America likes to go home, change back into Chris Evans, and cuddle up next to man's best sidekick — his rescue dog, Dodger. The actor told People he adopted Dodger in 2016, after the two met while he was filming Gifted. ""...I was walking up and down the aisles and saw this one dude and he didn’t belong there. I snagged him and he’s such a good dog,"" Evans said. He even recorded the life-changing moment in case you want to sob. 😭 Evans uses his Twitter account to give fans a frequent look at his life with Dodger — including highly anticipated reunions after the two have been separated by his schedule, exciting sing-a-longs, and pranks played on other actors named Chris. One dark day the internet mistakenly thought Dodger had died and the heartbreak was REAL — proof that the inseparable duo is one of the most adored celeb/dog matches around. 2. Tom Holland This list is not confined to actors who star in Marvel movies, we promise, but we must talk about our friendly neighborhood Tom Holland's intense love of dogs. The 21-year-old actor, best known for portraying young Spider Man, is no stranger to sharing photos of dogs on Instagram, including one of his Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Tessa, who he got in 2014 when she was just a lil pup. Holland is obsessed with Tess and we're obsessed with his obsession. He brings her to movie premieres, dresses her up as Spiderman, and the two even Facetime occasionally. *swoon* But Holland's love for dogs isn't solely reserved for those he owns. Remember that time he found a stray dog and took it to the vet ?! Yes, one day the IRL hero ran into a dog wandering the streets alone and alerted his Instagram followers. ""If it is your dog please let us know. We're going to take him to the vet to make sure he's all okay,"" Holland said in his story. After getting the dog checked by a doctor, the IRL hero said his contact info was recovered and he would hopefully be returning home. Now THAT'S some serious puppy love. Tom Holland found a missing dog and he's taking him to the vet to see if the dog's okay UGH HE'S TOO PURE FOR THIS WORLD MY HEART pic.twitter.com/sua1fpNSvZ — chlei loves hope van dyne (@almiqhtythor) May 8, 2018 3. Jenny Slate Once again, this list is not confined to actors who are tight with Chris Evans. Jenny Slate just loves dogs too, okay?! The actress and comedian posts quality Instagram shots of her faithful Bichon Frise, Reggie, who she adores, and drives around a lot. Sadly, Reggie is having a ruff time health-wise at the moment, so be sure to send him your love. When promoting Secret Life of Pets in 2016, Slate lovingly told Stephen Colbert about the moment she first saw Reggie. Turns out, the two met ""on what was maybe one of the worst days"" of her life. Sounds like fate. 4. Hilary Duff Hilary Duff and her partner Matthew Koma are also puppy people. In fact, the two recently adopted an adorable dog named Lucy together. If you're looking for cute canine content the Younger star often shares photos of herself on adventures with a bunch of adorable pups, not just her own. From taking walks and Facetiming her son Luca, to playful tail-wagging Boomerangs and more, Duff definitely spends a decent amount of time with furry friends. 5. Michael Phelps When the most decorated Olympian in history isn't running Instagram accounts for his two sons, Boomer and Beckett, he's making some content on behalf of the two family dogs, Juno and Legend. The Phelps fam loves swimming and playing with their pups, and the photos are always ridiculously precious. 6. Ariana Grande God is a woman, and guess what — she loves dogs! Ariana Grande is a huge fan of rescue pups and actually owned NINE of them in 2017. They also all have extremely original names, like Toulouse, Ophelia, Cinnamon, Coco, Lafayette, Sirius, Strauss, Pignoli, and Fawkes (who may no longer live with Grande according to some speculation on fan sites ). Hope Pete Davidson loves dogs, too. 7. The Obama family The former first dogs, Bo and Sunny, will always hold a special place in history and the hearts of Americans. And though we see far less of the pups now than we did when Pete Souza was constantly snapping pics of them at the White House, the little glimpses we do get are heartwarming. Like remember that time they were seen walking around in raincoats ?! Too. Damn. Cute. 8. Jennifer Garner If you love dogs and books, Jennifer Garner's got you covered. She and her intellectual dog, Birdie, spend quality time snuggling by the fireplace, reading books together, and you can join them. In a delightfully joyous Instagram series called B📚📚KS WITH BIRDIE🐦, Garner suggests books from her reading list and passionately reads them to her pup. It's perfect. Please enjoy the most recent installment of the show, in which the two enjoy B.J. Novak's The Book with No Pictures. A great book. 9. Justin Theroux Justin Theroux is another huge advocate for adopting pets, and he dedicates a large portion of his Instagram account to raising awareness about organizations working to find rescue dogs new homes. The actor recently introduced followers to his newest rescue pup, Kuma, who was a survivor of Hurricane Harvey. And when Theroux isn't hanging out with Kuma at press events, he's promoting local organizations and shelters like Austin Pets Alive!, Houston Pets Alive!, and Pilot N Paws, to inspire others to consider welcoming a furry friend into their families. 10. Chelsea Handler Chelsea Handler is another celebrity who treats her two Chow Chows, Bert and Bernice, like her own children. The comedian adopted the brother and sister rescue pups in January after losing her two dogs Tammy and Chunk, and constantly updates her Instagram followers on their lives together. From playtime in the park to couch cuddles and more, Handler shows she's a very committed dog mom. 11. Bryan Greenberg The Mindy Project star, who's married to actress Jamie Chung, gave his dog perhaps one of the greatest names of all time: Ewok Greenberg. The actor isn't shy about telling the world Ewok is his best friend, and posts adorable updates of the two on their daily adventures. Ewok even has his own Instagram account if you're dying for some extra Good Boy content. 12. Kylie Jenner There are a lot of pets in the Kardashians/Jenner family, but 20-year-old Kylie Jenner has FOUR furry friends that are all her own. Though her boyfriend Travis Scott has trouble remembering their names, Jenner has enough love for her pups Norman, Bambi, Rosy, and Harley, for the both of them. She's even made two of the dogs a joint Instagram account. It's truly refreshing to see that even the most famous of celebrities know dogs make the best friends.","Forget Shark Week, it’s Bark Week on Mashable.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Ericsson Image caption Mobile operators say drones working with mobile networks will speed up emergency response Drones may be best known for taking impressive aerial videos and inspecting buildings, infrastructure and crops, but they also promise to improve mobile and internet connectivity for emergency services and consumers. Poor mobile signal in rural areas is frustrating, but it can also be life-threatening in emergency situations. Slow emergency response times mean higher mortality rates. Mobile signals are usually sent via base stations, attached to buildings or special masts. These are tough to put up in a hurry - so why not attach a base station to a drone? For the last two years, the Finnish tech firm Nokia and British mobile operator EE have been flying small quadcopter drones mounted with portable mobile base stations in Scotland. The idea is that in an emergency, a drone could hover over a disaster area to provide instant 4G mobile network coverage with a 50km (31 mile) radius. But drones can't fly for very long before the battery runs out - 30 minutes is a typical maximum. So US telecoms giant AT&amp;T is developing a large, helicopter-like drone known as the ""Flying COW"", short for ""Cell on Wings"". It is tethered to the ground by a cable that gives it power. Image copyright AT&amp;T Image caption AT&amp;T's ""Flying Cow"" drone can stay airborne all day and night This enables the drone stay in the air 24-hours-a-day at a maximum height of 168m (550ft). AT&amp;T says it used Flying COW to provide emergency 4G coverage to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in November. Each drone was able to cover an area measuring 36 sq km. Nokia wants to take things a step further, and turn police vans and fire engines into command and control centres to help emergency responders make crucial decisions much faster than they do today. The idea is for fire engines to have their own personal 4G network with a 50km radius. From the command centre, fire fighters would launch drones and use their cameras to survey the scene. The same concept is being used for search and rescue, with artificial intelligence linking the drones together into a ""swarm"", so only one pilot is needed to direct a whole group of drones. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A Firefighter from a UK Fire and Rescue Service pilots a drone Nokia is testing out the technology with Vodafone and firefighters in Dusseldorf, Germany. ""You don't need to send firemen into the hostile environment, you will have full situational awareness immediately,"" says Thorsten Robrecht, Nokia's vice president of advanced mobile networks solutions. ""What we see from the police is that this is much quicker and lower cost than a helicopter, which they still mostly use today."" Belgian start-up firm Unmanned Life has developed software to send out multiple autonomous drones at the same time to gather information during a crisis, such as when a building is on fire. One drone hovers in the air providing 4G coverage, while another flies around the building providing live video. A third equipped with heat sensors creates a heat map of the building, while a fourth uses sonar to map structural damage. Unmanned Life is in talks to provide its system to BT and Verizon, who currently hold government contracts for emergency communication networks in the UK and US. Swarms of co-operating drones, each with different tasks, help address the flight-time issue because single-function drones can be lighter. And they can be lighter still if many of their computational and sensing functions - navigation for example - are undertaken by computers on the ground ""talking"" to the drones wirelessly. The lighter the drone, the more it can carry. In February, Ericsson tested this concept with BT and Verizon in London to show that a drone could autonomously carry 5kg of medical supplies from one location to another, without human intervention. Image copyright David Tett / Ericsson Image caption A woman watches on a tablet as a man loads a drone with first aid supplies The trial demonstrated that next-generation superfast 5G networks would be powerful enough to transfer data streams between the drone and the ground, as well as ensuring that the connection to the drone never dropped. ""I think drones together with 5G networks and the IoT [internet of things] offer tremendous opportunities,"" says Phil Bonner of Ericsson. ""We need to keep the drone very simple and cheap."" But drones for deliveries and emergency services will only be viable if they can be flown autonomously without crashing into buildings, trees, pylons, or each other. So many tech and telecoms companies are racing to build air traffic control systems for them. ""Nokia has a system run on the 4G network that can connect all the drones and knows where they are,"" says Mr Robrecht. ""And we have a commercial aircraft 4G network covering the entire airspace in Europe in order to connect all the aircraft flying around. ""We're trying to work out how to connect the two networks."" Once this problem is solved, communications drones won't just be for the emergency services. They could help civilians in all sorts of ways too, such as at sports events. Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Drones helped fans watching the 2018 Super Bowl enjoy better mobile connectivity ""One of the challenges we see is when people are using their devices in stadiums during the Super Bowl,"" says Art Pregler, AT&amp;T's unmanned aircraft systems programme director. ""If there's a really good football play, they're all taking video or looking for an instant replay. That creates a lot of demand on the network. ""But we could have drones in the air augmenting our existing capacity, and that will improve their experience at the event."" Technology firm Ericsson thinks that in future we could even pay to have a drone launched if we need internet coverage on-demand in an area with bad signal - great for music festivals. Image copyright Magnum Photos The GSMA, which represents the mobile industry, believes it has an essential role to play in the growth of the commercial drone market. But Gartner analyst Aapo Markkanen says: ""The commercial adoption of drones will happen regardless of telcos [telecoms companies]. ""If telcos get involved, that will enable enterprises to do more sophisticated things, but they need to spend money to make money."" Having a drone with their logo on it riding to the rescue will be good for the telco's reputations, but it may not be hugely profitable, believes Kester Mann, a principal analyst at CCS Insight. ""There is some benefit in helping communities, and selling solutions to the public sector is one of them,"" he says. ""But are we going to see governments cough up for these fancy technologies, at a time when purse strings are under pressure?""

Kelly McCarthy,"A mother has hunkered down with her five children and dog in their Wilmington, North Carolina, home as Hurricane Florence bears down. Interested in Hurricane Florence? Add Hurricane Florence as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricane Florence news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Melissa Cellucci, who lives 20 minutes from Wrightsville Beach where the hurricane made landfall, told ABC News she is riding out the storm at home while her husband Joe, an EMT, is on lockdown working at Hanover County Regional Medical Center. Since the Category 1 storm with tropical force-winds made landfall around 7 a.m. Friday morning, Cellucci said she has seen evidence of the hurricane's force in her own backyard. ""It's crazy and frightening,"" she said. ""We've been watching trees being torn down and our backyard fence get ripped apart all morning from the winds."" She continued, “The whole back side is all demolished. I saw two 20-foot sections getting busted up because the winds are so strong and powerful.” Despite warnings to evacuate ahead of the powerful storm, Cellucci said she and her husband made the decision to stay home. ""With having five kids and my husband’s stuck at work on standby for his job at the hospital it was just easier for us to stay at our home where we have all of our things,"" Cellucci said. ""We have a safe place here at our home and a generator and we have supplies, so we felt that we could be safe here just riding it out."" SLIDESHOW: PHOTOS: Hurricane Florence batters the East Coast But when she and her kids lost power at 3 a.m., she said she began to worry. Although her husband showed her how to turn on the generator before he left for his job at the hospital, she couldn’t get it started on the first try and she and her children were without power for hours. “When the wind picked up it got really spooky and scary. I really didn’t get any sleep, I needed to be up in case anything happened,” she said. But she was “thankfully” able to get the generator started on her second try, it started just now on the second try,” Cellucci said midmorning Friday. Joe Cellucci and Melissa are seen here in this undated file photo. Her husband has called to check in on the family ""several times"" as well as to assure her that he is safe, she said. ""He told me how the hospital felt like it was swaying from the high winds since they have all the EMS personnel in his crew staying on a high floor at the hospital,"" Cellucci said. ""But they are all still on lockdown."" The family has experienced just one other hurricane in their North Carolina home when Hurricane Matthew hit in 2016. ""This is our second hurricane. We’re not from down here; we moved down here three years ago from Michigan,"" Cellucci said. ""It’s kind of new to us what a hurricane would mean so our anxiety was high getting stuff ready,"" she added. Cellucci told ABC News in an earlier interview on Thursday night that the family was already feeling the force of Florence. ""The rain’s really picked up, and just stepping outside a little bit ago the trees are really blowing and bending. We have large pine trees in our backyard, and they’re really bending a lot,"" she told ""Nightline"" anchor Juju Chang on Thursday night. ""The wind is howling away. I could hear it from inside the house.""

"USA TODAY, Rick Jervis, USA TODAY","Forecasters warn Hurricane Florence could hesitate just offshore for days, punishing a longer stretch of coastline, before pushing inland.. AP's Seth Borenstein explains why this storm's pattern is so unusual and worrisome. (Sept. 12) AP Marge Brown, 65, says goodbye to her father, George, 90, before he is evacuated from a health care home in Morehead City, N.C., on Sept. 12, 2018, as Hurricane Florence approaches the East Coast. ""I'd like to stay and see what happens. I'm 90 plus,"" said Brown, a WWII veteran. (Photo: David Goldman, AP) As emergency management teams prepare for Hurricane Florence's landfall along the East Coast, a key focus of their prepping will be hospitals and nursing homes – often the most vulnerable outposts in disasters. In North Carolina, at least 40 of the state’s 130 hospitals are in the direct path of the storm, which is forecast to deliver punishing winds of up to 130 mph, torrential rains and up to 13 feet of storm surge when it stalls along the South Carolina-North Carolina coast Thursday night into Saturday. About 10 of the state's nursing homes located in coastal and eastern counties also began evacuating as early as Monday. In South Carolina, nursing home officials took the rare step of evacuating all 32 nursing homes and assisted-living facilities in the state's coastal region. Last year's hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico exposed hospitals and nursing homes as being at most risk in the wake of disasters. At a Broward County, Fla., nursing home, 14 residents died following Hurricane Irma, while hundreds of the nearly 3,000 estimated deaths from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico were attributed to a lack of health care access. The average age of residents evacuating from nursing homes in South Carolina is 83, and moving them is risky, said Randy Lee, president of the South Carolina Health Care Association. The residents are ferried in ambulances or buses, along with mattresses and their medical supplies, to nursing homes farther inland. Lee said it was the first time he knew of that so many nursing home residents were moved from their facilities at once. ""We have residents who have not left the building in 10 years,"" he said. ""This could be very traumatic for them."" Tracker: See Hurricane Florence's predicted path More: Hurricane Florence forecast shifts: ""Storm of a lifetime"" headed to Carolina coast More: Florence path shift 'bizarre,' could bring 'catastrophic flooding' to Southeast A debate over whether to leave The debate over whether to move frail nursing home residents – many with Alzheimers, dementia or other ailments – has flared nationally since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when several hundred people died in local hospitals or nursing homes that lost power or during arduous evacuations. State nursing home officials often dispute whether it's worth evacuating residents in the run-up to a storm that's a Category 2 or 3, Lee said. But with a major storm such as Florence, there wasn't much of a choice. ""When you get a Category 4 or potentially Category 5,"" Lee said, ""it's just not an option to stay in place."" More: Gas shortages, long lines worsen in North, South Carolina as Hurricane Florence nears More: Hurricane Florence is days away, but help is already arriving In North Carolina, the state's seven trauma hospitals have been in daily conference calls with state emergency officials since Monday to make sure disaster plans are in place and supplies staged for the storm, said Bill Gentry, who heads the executive master’s program at the Department of Health Policy and Management at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Medical teams have been deployed to the Goldsboro area to stage a 200-bed mobile hospital, known as a ""State Medical Assistant Team,"" or SMAT, to take in overflow patients from area hospitals that may be incapacitated or hard to reach because of flooded roads, he said. State health officials have also upgraded their communication system and disaster plans since Hurricane Matthew battered the state two years ago. 'Flooding is flooding' Still, Florence's sheer size – bigger than the state of North Carolina – and combination of strong winds and heavy rains will likely challenge the best-intentioned plans, Gentry said. North Carolina is likely to experience what the Houston area did during Harvey when historic floods cut off residents from hospitals, he said. ""Flooding is flooding,"" said Gentry, a former official with the North Carolina Office of Emergency Management. ""Trying to get people from Point A to Point B with six or seven feet of water outside, no matter how good your communication is, is going to be tough."" An overtaxed generator stopped working during Matthew, and water was cut off from the 440-bed Southeastern Regional Medical Center in Lumberton, N.C., because of widespread floods. Hospital staffers were forced to take the unwanted step of evacuating 13 critical care patients and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit babies in the wake of the storm. As Florence aimed at North Carolina's coast, hospital executives brought in an extra generator, loaded up on water and made sure they had sufficient staff through the weekend, said Joann Anderson, the hospital's chief executive. They also have discharged patients who are able to leave early – a process known as ""decompressing"" – and have been in constant contact with local emergency officials, she said. Despite all the prepping, hospital staffers remain worried. ""There’s a lot of anxiety,"" Anderson said. ""It's definitely stronger, definitely bigger, definitely a lot of uncertainty because of that."" Follow Jervis on Twitter: @MrRJervis.

Maya Rhodan,"As the rain pounded Fayetteville, cars pulled in and out of the parking lot at Campbellton Landing on Person Street. One-by-one, drivers and passengers hopped out of their vehicles to face the pounding rain, all to get a look at the rising Cape Fear River, which is expected to climb high enough to cover the train tracks near Karen Malloy’s house near Deep Creek Road. “When Matthew came, you could put your hand down between the railroad and touch the water. Another foot and it would have been on our road,” she said. “And they’re talking about it’ll be four feet over now.” Malloy’s home is one of nearly 2,800 in the Fayetteville area affected by a mandatory evacuation order issued by the city’s mayor. Those who didn’t heed his call, he warned, should notify their next of kin. And while she planned to make her way to her sister’s house on the other side of town by that afternoon. But Malloy’s two adult sons, who just happen to live next door to her, weren’t sure if they’d join her, despite how much she wanted them to. “When I see that river take over the train tracks, then I might get worried,” said Russell Malloy, one of her sons. He was using his fork to cut up bits of sausage in the bowl of white rice he was eating, watching ESPN on a flat screen TV in his front room. Theirs was a dilemma many have had to face over and over again since Hurricane Florence, now a tropical depression, landed ashore. Is it worth it to leave? Will it really be that bad? Evacuations are inconvenient. But, repeatedly over the past few days, Florence’s wrath has won out. The storm’s death toll had risen to 18 by Monday morning. Chunks of Interstate 95 were rendered impassable. Wilmington, along the coast, was effectively cut off from the rest of the state by water. At least half of central North Carolina was at risk of facing flash floods on Monday morning. Over 1,000 swift water rescues have been conducted in the state, not including the volunteer crews that have been conducting their own missions. Thousands of people have already evacuated. Around 15,000 are in North Carolina emergency shelters, and hundreds more in hotels, motels, and the homes of friends and family across the state. But as rivers crested, creeks rose, and roads flooded, many more were forced out out of their homes as the storm’s remnants lingered in the area. As Cedar Creek in flooded, the roads in Dennis Virts’ neighborhood turned into rivers. On Sunday afternoon, an armoured police rescue vehicle drove through the waters to help move people away from the area. “I didn’t wait around for them,” Virts said, smoking a cigarette in an empty car wash, out of the beating rain. “I just walked out.” In Lumberton, N.C., members of the National Guard reportedly traversed the town instructing people in areas prone to flooding to leave the area. On Water Street in Lumberton, the Lumber River had already begun to surround Dawn Davis’ house on Sunday afternoon. A makeshift obstruction — 5,000 bags of sand crews had dumped on the banks of the river with hopes that it would keep the town from flooding — had already failed. “I guess if it gets a little bit more higher, we’ll all end up leaving,” Davis said. “I’m just trying to put it off.” Her next door neighbor, Bennie Todd, and his family had already had water coming through the top of their house: during the hurricane, the shingles of their roof flew off and so his son, Ben, and son-in-law climbed on the roof and covered it with a bright blue tarp. But the Todd family had no plans to leave. “As long as it doesn’t come up from the bottom, we’ll be alright,” Benny said, swiping the air with an orange flyswatter as he swung from a white wooden bench on their screened-in porch. Rochelle Chatman took photos of the Lumber River, its swift waters flowing just inches from the bottom of the bridge he stood on. He says Chatman says water has already seeped into his house — the second time in as many years — so he and his nine-year-old son have been staying with a cousin in a different part of town. “They say [Matthew] was a 500-year flood,” he said. “Now it’s become a two-year flood.” J.J. Malloy quickly took issue with his brother’s timeline. “I don’t think we should wait until that long, bruh,” he said Sunday, standing in a doorway just off the front room. Russell backtracked: Perhaps they wouldn’t wait that long, but he sure as hell wasn’t in a rush to leave. “I’ve lived here a long time. All my life. I know this river like the back of my hand,” he said. “It could reach my backyard, but at the same time I don’t think it’s going to be inside my house.” “If it gets as bad as Matthew was and we still have rain left. It’s not really a question anymore,” J.J. said. “But I’m really not trying to leave. This is my home.” They soon may not have a choice. By Tuesday, the river is supposed to crest four-feet above the level it did during the 2016 storm. The North Carolina coast may have been in the eye of Hurricane Florence, now a tropical depression, but the state’s central cities have remained in its crosshairs.","As the rain pounded Fayetteville, cars pulled in and out of the parking lot at Campbellton Landing on Person Street.

"AP, AP","FILE - In this Saturday, Sept. 8, 2018, file photo, fans sit in the stands at Vanderbilt Stadium during the second half of an NCAA college football game between Vanderbilt and Nevada in Nashville, Tenn. It will be a Virginia home game played on the road when the Cavaliers and Ohio meet at Vanderbilt Stadium on Saturday, in a game that was moved earlier in the week with Hurricane Florence bearing down on the Mid-Atlantic Region. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey, File) (Photo: The Associated Press) With an eye toward player safety and scheduling flexibility, the NCAA last year considered ways to lengthen the college football season so every team would have 14 weeks to play 12 games every year. It didn't come to pass. The topic popped up again this week as Hurricane Florence prompted the cancellation, postponement or relocation of more than a dozen games, just two weeks after two other games were called off because of lightning in the Midwest. A longer season with more open dates would increase the chances of rescheduling games impacted by weather. But issues that kept coaches from supporting a permanent 14-week season — mainly, having to start preseason camp in July — are still a factor and unpredictable weather is not likely a big enough headache to change things. ""Every year this is going to happen a couple times,"" said Jon Nese, a meteorologist for Penn State and a former storm analyst for The Weather Channel. ""It doesn't leap off the page to me as something that is a primary discussion item."" This season, for the first time, each Football Bowl Subdivision conference will play a conference championship game on the first Saturday in December. With that in mind, the NCAA oversight committee in 2017 did a deep dive on what it would take to allow teams to have two open dates every season. ""Aspirationally, what we wanted to do was build in some recovery time for the players during the course of the season and try and do it in a way that was equitable,"" said Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby, the former chairman of the oversight committee. ""In the end, the 14-week season with the two byes just wasn't going to work from a practical standpoint so we moved away from it."" The problem: There was no good way to compress preseason practice into August. When the NCAA eliminated two-a-day practices, a long-time staple of preseason football, it also cut down the number of total practices allowed from 29 to 25. That way teams could continue to start practice in early August and give players the required amount of time off. To play games the week before Labor Day weekend and still work in 25 practices, teams would have to start practicing in July. Bowlsby said some 14-week schedule scenarios had teams opening practice as early as July 20, even before some players would be done with courses they often take to lighten the academic load during the season. ""For some universities it was actually before their summer school classes were over,"" Bowlsby said. Todd Berry, the executive director of the American Football Coaches Association, said coaches were concerned about preseason practices bumping into media day obligations in July as well as camps for high school players that are typically held the last week of the month. And while the intent behind a 14-week season was to create more open dates, it also opened the possibility of adding another regular-season game down the road. ""Our coaches were stressed out about that,"" Berry said. A solution could be further decreasing the number of preseason practices to about 20. ""Our group went to 25 and felt like that was the minimal amount,"" Berry said. ""Just getting people's bodies ready to make safe tackles and safe blocks takes some time."" Creating space to reschedule games that might get postponed by potentially dangerous weather, a task that is near impossible now, never came up in the 14-week season discussion, Bowlsby said. Last year, hurricanes Harvey and Irma caused cancellations and rescheduling in college football. Hurricane Matthew disrupted the 2016 season. But meteorologists caution about seeing this spate of storms as a trend. ""You'd have to take a look at a really large range of time to really start to pick up on any patterns or correlations,"" said Lara Pagano, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center of the National Weather Service. ""So at this point we really can't say one way or another, but I'm sure a lot of researchers and climatologists will be taking a look at that over the years to come."" ____ Follow Ralph D.

Max Golembo,"Hurricane Florence, dubbed the ""storm of a lifetime"" by the National Weather Service, has slowed dramatically overnight Wednesday and may not officially make landfall until the weekend. While this may lessen wind speeds by landfall, it could increase rainfall totals to as much as 40 inches in North Carolina. Interested in Hurricane Florence? Add Hurricane Florence as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricane Florence news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Florence is a dangerous Category 4 hurricane Wednesday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph -- down from 140 mph overnight. Florence is located about 575 miles southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. The path, intensity and timing of the storm is likely to keep changing through the day Wednesday, but the latest 5 a.m. update shows Florence will no longer be close to Category 5 -- with winds of 145 mph -- through Thursday morning. Florence's path has it slowing and spinning just off the coast of North Carolina. It begins to slow down during the day Thursday and that’s when it will begin to encounter friction from land and weaken significantly. Winds may lessen, but because of that slowdown, rainfall totals will be even higher than previously forecast. The southeast coast of North Carolina could see as much as 40 inches of rain -- in line with the catastrophic flooding caused last year in the Houston area by Hurricane Harvey. Rainfall could be as much as 40 inches locally along the North Carolina coast. ""This will likely be the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast, and that's saying a lot given the impacts we've seen from Hurricanes Diana, Hugo, Fran, Bonnie, Floyd, and Matthew,"" the National Weather Service said. ""I can't emphasize enough the potential for unbelievable damage from wind, storm surge, and inland flooding with this storm."" As many as 1.7 million people have been ordered to evacuate across South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Many of those people were already on the road Tuesday. People drive over a drawbridge in Wrightsville Beach, N.C., as they evacuate the area in advance of Hurricane Florence, Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2018. ""If they say leave, leave,"" said Jennifer Forte, who was in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on Tuesday and headed toward Greenville. ""And my job is closed. I work for the government, they’ve closed. The school’s closed until Friday, so there’s no reason to stay, really."" North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper advised much the same in a press conference Tuesday, warning locations hit by high winds and floodwaters could be without power for ""several days."" Hurricane warnings, watches and tropical storm watches are now in place for the South Carolina and North Carolina coasts. ""We’ll be asking people to prepare their emergency kit,"" he said. ""Get food, water, if there are medications they may need. Pull together their important documents... make a plan for your pets. Also, understand that a lot of people are going to be without power probably for several days if not longer."" The federal government has made similar warnings, with FEMA Administrator Brock Long saying Florence could knock out power for ""weeks."" As millions head out of the area, resources like the Red Cross are preparing to deal with the disaster -- and possibly weeks of problems resulting from it. Brandon Alston carries a board to be placed over a window of the Casemate Museum on Fort Monroe, Tuesday, Sept. 11, 2018, in Hampton, Va. The staff is preparing for rising waters and other possible flooding due to Hurricane Florence. ""This is extremely serious,"" Major Ken Morris, with the Salvation Army’s Disaster Response Team, told ABC News. ""We’ve got a number of volunteers, actually we’ve got over 3 million volunteers across the nation that can help us. But we need our partners in mission. Folks have come through wonderfully in the past and again in non-affected areas. We’ve got canteens coming in. It’s like an accordion. As this thing increases, we increase our resources.""

Strangers who heard about her story raised money, and helped her rent large vehicles for the trip. (Photo: Courtesy of Trudy Schilder) A woman living just outside Myrtle Beach with her seven rescue dogs was expecting to ride out the effects of Hurricane Florence at her home, until strangers raised thousands of dollars to drive her and her pups out of danger's way. On Wednesday, Christine Meinhold told CNN she didn't have the resources to evacuate herself and her dogs. ""When I rescued these dogs, I took on a responsibility of loving and caring for them the rest of their lives,"" she told CNN. ""I can't abandon them."" When animal lover Elaine Sloan from New York City heard the report, she told USA TODAY she reached out to her friend Trudy Schilder, as both have been involving in assisting animal rescues in the past. She said they were able to directly connect with Meinhold. ""Somehow we gathered others and this miracle unfolded,"" Schilder said. A California-based radio host and dog lover Kate Zenna also became involved, pleading with followers on social media to help. ""This is a nightmare waiting to happen,"" Zenna tweeted on Wednesday. Adding in another tweet: ""Let's get these dogs to a safe place before Florence arrives."" By Thursday, Florence was 155 miles east of Myrtle Beach, poising to bring extreme rain and wind before landfall. Last Slide Next Slide Before disaster struck, the crowdsourcing campaign raised more than $5,000 to transport Meinhold and her pups, appearing to be breeds spanning German Shepard to labrador.

Friday, those involved with the rescue reported Meinhold and her dogs arrived at their destination safely. Two of Meinhold's dogs she rescued from Hurricane Matthew in 2016, she told CNN.

Credit Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press Now with 31 teams from South Florida to Vancouver, the N.H.L. started with four Canadian teams spread over less than 350 miles. The league was founded in a Montreal hotel in late November 1917, in the thick of World War I, when professional hockey was still fairly new. The Canadiens are now one of North America’s oldest professional sports franchises. The Arenas eventually became the Maple Leafs. And although the original Senators folded in 1934, the franchise returned as an expansion team in 1992. But the Wanderers are a blip in N.H.L. history. Their victory on opening night was their only win in the league. They lost their next five games and quit the league after their arena burned down on Jan. 2, 1918.

Interested in Hurricane Florence? Add Hurricane Florence as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricane Florence news, video, and analysis from ABC News. CrowdSource Rescue, a free app built to connect volunteers and emergency personnel with those in need, helped tens of thousands of people stranded during the three most recent major hurricane s: Harvey, Irma and Maria. Now, the app's creators are gearing up to save more lives as Hurricane Florence batters the Carolinas, and inches closer to the East Coast. If you are stranded in the midst of Hurricane Florence and can't reach rescuers, this app might be able to get you help.

But if someone puts a request into the CrowdSource Rescue website, they could be connected to a civilian responder within 20 minutes. Marchetti emphasized that the app is meant to help civilians work alongside first responders, and not against them. Each call for help is vetted by the CrowdSource Rescue team through its geotags and IP address, to ensure that it is legitimate. Ultimately, it’s up to the civilian responder to call and make sure that the person calling is who they say they are.

Ariel Ramchandani,"Gloria Castillo Luna, a single mother of four living in Faison, North Carolina, evacuated her family from the home she rents to a shelter just before Hurricane Florence hit a little over a week ago. Luna and her kids had a terrible experience during a storm two years ago, so she knew the shelter was worth the trip. “After my experience with my children during Hurricane Matthew, which felt very dangerous, I knew that we should go,” she said on the phone through a translator. “I did not want to put my children at risk.” But when the family returned to Faison last Saturday and began to assess the damage, their troubles were just beginning. Luna, a farmworker who usually works the sweet potato harvest, is most likely out of a job. “Now that all of the fields are flooded, I won’t be able to find work easily,” she told me. Though the storm has passed and the skies are clear, the floodwaters in North and South Carolina continue to ravage towns and farmland: In some areas, the water has yet to recede. While the storm has been devastating for millions in the region, for farmworkers like Luna whose livelihood is dependent on crops to pick and whose legal status often creates fear around contact with government, the storm has proven especially crippling. Because of all the flooding, crops in the area have been destroyed. “They are under feet of water—not just one foot, but under multiple feet,” says Melissa Bailey Castillo, who works with the migrants workers at the Community Health Center in Kinston, North Carolina. The state is the country’s largest producer of sweet potatoes, and the storm could not have come at a worse time, since late summer typically marks the start of the sweet potato harvest. [ The overlooked children working tobacco fields in Kinston ] In North Carolina, 75 percent of the cash crops are grown in the eastern part of the state, where the flooding has been most severe. An estimated 150,000-plus farmworkers pick these crops, often by hand: Most are immigrants or migrant laborers from Central America, and around half are undocumented. Their jobs are already plagued by uncertainty, and now Hurricane Florence could thwart what is usually the most lucrative time of the year. When I first spoke with Castillo last week, she was driving around Raleigh buying supplies for affected farmworkers. But because of the flooding, she wasn’t able to deliver the supplies until Sunday. “I could get to work yesterday and I could not get to work today,“ she told me. “Water is literally over Highway 70.” Justin Flores, of the Farm Labor Action Committee, says some farmworkers remain in a shelter in Kinston, since many in the area still lack power, water, and cell phone service. “Finding work is going to be really difficult for the families we serve,” says Patty Kingery of the East Coast Migrant Head Start Project, which serves farmworkers and their families. “We have a lot of families who will not have work for the remainder of the season, while the more mobile families are going to seek work elsewhere.” Workers were pulled from the fields five days before Florence hit. “They already went a week without work and now, after this massive hurricane, they don’t even know if they have a job, period,” says Castillo. Many workers weren’t even aware that the hurricane was coming and hadn’t been told the reason they were being sent home. And when it was time to evacuate, migrants to the area also didn’t know where to go or how to get out. [ How to prepare your family for a hurricane ] But beyond the loss of work, migrant farm workers face other perils from the storm. They often live in shoddily built trailers in labor camps—or “campos,” in Spanish—that are especially vulnerable to storms: Even in the best of times, running water and functioning electricity isn’t always a given. Daisy Aguado-Chavez, who works on a hog farm in North Carolina, evacuated the “campo” she lives in with her two young children. Unlike those working in the fields, she was expected to work during the storm, and without any better options, she took her kids with her to work. “We were in a little office and it started flooding from the bathroom and coming towards us,” she said. “We couldn’t do anything about it.” Castillo said that most of the trailers in the Kinston area were flooded, and a few were completely destroyed. Jenny Guzman of the East Coast Migrant Head Start Project told me that some migrant families had evacuated their trailers and did not know when they could return home. As they go about rebuilding their lives, undocumented workers are reliant on the aid of organizations, since they are often reluctant to seek government assistance to repair their homes. The uptick in immigrant enforcement under Trump has also led workers without legal documentation to question whether to head to a shelter or to seek help at all. Before the storm hit, a FEMA administrator said in a news conference that the agency could not “guarantee” that immigrants in shelters wouldn’t be detained and handed off to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities. After the storm hit, Border Patrol agents swarmed to Kinston to help out with recovery efforts— causing panic among the migrant farmworkers in the area and scaring away some of them from seeking shelter. “I think the minute Border Patrol showed up, the shelters were out of the question,” Bailey Castillo said about the workers. “They are going to find someone who is high and dry where they can stay, or not leave their homes, even if they don’t have enough food or water.” When the waters do recede, the migrants have a long few months ahead of them. Luna, the sweet potato farmworker, wonders how she is going to provide for her children. “I am worried about work, especially thinking about winter coming and the rain continuing,” she says. “But we just have to keep going.”",Flooding from the latest storm highlights a particularly vulnerable population.,2018-09-25T11:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",Hurricane Season’s New Normal,https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/09/hurricane-seasons-new-normal/571159/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/09/RTS21UPI/facebook.jpg?1537813942,,Theatlantic.com,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Virtually the entire town is flooded and inaccessible except by boat. (Photo: Gerald Herbert, AP) GALIVANTS FERRY, S.C. – With muddy river water still washing over entire communities on Friday, eight days after Hurricane Florence slammed into land with nearly 3 feet of rain, new evacuation orders forced residents to flee to higher ground amid a sprawling disaster that’s beginning to feel like it will never end. At least 42 people have died, included an elderly man whose body was found in a pickup truck that had been submerged in South Carolina, and hundreds were forced from their homes as rivers kept swelling higher and higher. Leaders in the Carolinas warned residents not to get complacent as it became plain that additional horrors lie ahead before things get much better. “Although the winds are gone and the rain is not falling, the water is still there and the worst is still to come,” said South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster. Speaking in Las Vegas, President Donald Trump said South Carolina is in for a “tough one” as flood waters continue to rise. “They got hit, but the big hit comes days later and it will be the biggest they’ve ever had,” said Trump, who visited North and South Carolina this week.

Rescuers wearing night-vision googles used helicopters, boats and big-wheeled military vehicles overnight to evacuate about 100 people from a southeastern North Carolina county where high water breached a levee and flooded a town. And in South Carolina, emergency managers ordered about 500 people to flee homes along the Lynches River. The National Weather Service said the river could reach record flood levels late Saturday or early Sunday. Shelters are open. In tiny Galivants Ferry, Audra Mauer said she lost her home two years ago when Hurricane Matthew hit and she’s losing it again to Florence. No improvements were made to the area after Matthew, she said, and a frustrated Mauer has no faith any will happen now. “They didn’t clean the ditches,” she said. “Same levee. Same dams. What have we been doing for two years? … Where did the money go to fix everything, to make the power lines stronger and to replace the poles?” About 25 miles (40 kilometers) nearer to the South Carolina coast, Kevin Tovornik was tearing soggy carpet out of the house he has owned for 20 years in Conway, where the Waccamaw River was still rising. Bridges are starting to close because of flooding, he said, and friends were struck in traffic for four hours trying to get through the town of 23,000 people. “This is ridiculous. This is the worst I’ve ever seen, and that includes hurricane evacuations,” Tovornik said. Roads also were a major problem in Wilmington, a city of 120,000 people still mostly cut off from the rest of North Carolina. A photograph posted by the state transportation agency showed flowing water and buckled asphalt on a highway that had been one of the few passable routes into the city, where officials have distributed food and water to residents. Along the Cape Fear River, David and Benetta White and their four children were given short notice to evacuate overnight when floodwaters came rushing on to their property. By the time they got loaded into their van, water was waist-high and they had to slog through a foul-smelling soup to get to a neighbor’s pickup. “We almost lost our lives, I’m here to tell you we did,” said White, whose family previously evacuated last Thursday as Florence approached as a hurricane from the Atlantic. The South Carolina governor estimated damage from the flood in his state at $1.2 billion. In a letter he said the flooding will be the worst disaster in the state’s modern history. McMaster asked congressional leaders to hurry federal aid. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said he knows the damage in his state will add up to billions of dollars, but said with the effects on the storm still being felt, there was no way to make a more accurate estimate. As environmental worries mount, Duke Energy said a dam containing a large lake at Wilmington power plant had been breached by floodwaters from Florence, and it was possible that coal ash from an adjacent dump was flowing into the Cape Fear River. Paige Sheehan, a spokeswoman for Duke Energy, said the company did not believe the breach at the L.V. Sutton Power Station posed a significant threat for increased flooding to nearby communities because the river is already running high. Something else could be a problem, though. The National Hurricane Center said it was monitoring four areas in the Atlantic for signs of a new tropical weather threat. One was off the coast of the Carolinas with a chance of drifting toward land. Greg Lovell has called his Hampstead, North Carolina, neighborhood home for 15 years, but only while battling floodwaters after Hurricane Florence has he met other members of his community facing the same struggles.

In an appeal for federal disaster recovery funds, Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina announced Thursday that the state's financial losses from the storm are estimated to top $1.2 billion. McMaster is asking for funding for half of the state's 46 counties. The preliminary breakdown includes losses and federal recovery fund estimates of $125 million for the state's agriculture industry and $165 million for the National Flood Insurance Program. Also Thursday, FEMA said it will speed up the process for storm victims to receive advanced payments on their flood insurance claims. Policyholders can get up to $5,000 without an adjuster visit or providing additional documentation to their insurer, FEMA said.

(Photo: Jason Lee/The Sun News, AP) GEORGETOWN, S.C. Hurricane Florences floodwaters should reach their final peak before heading into the Atlantic Ocean on Saturday, and arent as high as once feared in parts of South Carolina. The Waccamaw River should crest at record levels Saturday but will be well below the destructive forecasts from earlier in the week, Georgetown County Emergency Management said in a Facebook post Friday. The river is influenced by tidal flow, so it will recede at low tide before reaching the record at high tide, officials said. Officials feared flooding that would top highway bridges and inundate areas that had never flooded since Georgetown was founded before the Revolutionary War, but that has yet to materialize. Still, floodwaters are expected to end up in hundreds of buildings, officials said. Upstream in Conway, the Waccamaw River was finally starting to drop after rising for well over a week. But Friday the river remained nearly 2.5 feet (0.8 meter) above its previous record of 17.9 feet (5.5 meters) set after Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and likely wont drop below that level until Tuesday. Most of the nearly 1,000 homes and businesses flooded in and near the city of 23,000 will remain that way into next week, officials said. We are just encouraging people to be patient. We know lives have been turned upside down, Horry County Emergency Management Director Randy Webster said. On Monday, road crews will begin tearing down the concrete walls, plastic sheeting and sand that successfully kept floodwaters from topping two bridges that carry U.S. Highway 501 the main route to Myrtle Beach over the river, the South Carolina Department of Transportation said Friday. In North Carolina, residents of a flooded Pender County neighborhood are using a nearby soccer field as a staging area for donations, and a half-dozen families are sleeping there in recreational vehicles or tents. Sarah Robles, whos staying nearby with her father after her house flooded, said shes helping to run the soccer field operation to distribute donated items and hot meals at the soccer field to families displaced from the Cross Creek neighborhood. We have big storage bins and stuff, she said. We have a tent that has things and everyone comes to get their stuff like Clorox, cleaning supplies, health and beauty, you know, deodorant, new toothbrushes to snacks, ice, drinks. She said the six to 10 families sleeping on the field, along with her neighbors, have struggled to find temporary or transitional housing. She said those with space are raising prices.

"Fort Myers News-Press, Michael Braun, Fort Myers News-Press","Howling wind and pounding rain lash into Panama City, Florida. Hurricane Michael made landfall near Mexico Beach with wind speeds up to 155 mph. USA TODAY Damage from Hurricane Michael in Panama City, Florida on Wednesday Oct. 10, 2018. (Photo: Andrew West/news-press.com) In the 13 years Ive lived in Florida Ive been through hurricanes both as a reporter and as an observer. Hurricane Michael was unlike anything Ive ever experienced. Photographer Andrew West and I left Tallahassee early on Wednesday to make the drive to Panama City to hunker down in a local hotel, await the passage of the approaching storm and then cover the aftermath. We were lucky we got to do that. Before Michael made landfall, Andrew and I drove around Panama City Beach, getting photos and video of the roiling waters and crashing monstrous waves. The reported size of the storm didnt give us pause; Andrew and I had chased Hurricane Matthew up the East Coast in 2016, doing live social media reporting atop a bridge in 60 to 70 mile per hour winds and wading through hip-deep water to talk to homeowners. We drove around Fort Myers in 2017 during the passage of the eye of Hurricane Irma stopping alongside a building at one point to stay safe. Hurricane Michael didnt seem like a cause for special worry. That changed, fast. Around noon, the cable service at our hotel died. Then the power went out. Out in the parking lot, a light pole pushed by the increasingly violent wind slowly canted over against an SUV. Things escalated with a speed beyond comprehension. Talker: Why are we politicizing hurricanes, the environment? Our view: Global warming, Hurricane Michael and what you can do Another view: Don't panic over U.N. climate change report With a huge crash and a shudder of the entire hotel, portions of the roof started coming apart, landing with a thud on cars and trucks in the parking lot. Another news media person and I walked into the entranceway of the hotel, where despite both front doors being tied shut, we had to hold them closed with all of our might as the howling wind and rain tried to suck them open. With water dripping through the first-floor ceiling, some guests started piling their mattresses against windows along the northern wall as the powerful hurricanes steady cyclonic winds drove water through the sills. An emergency call amid a storm Shortly after another loud bang, I started smelling the acrid odor of natural gas. A faint, rushing noise could also be heard outside the hotels utility room. Is that gas? I asked a hotel clerk, who was on the phone. Oh, my God. Its gas. I gotta go. I gotta call 911, she told her caller. I listened as she called emergency services asking for the hotel guests to be evacuated due to the gas leak. That was not to be. For the next two hours people milled about the first-floor corridor as water poured through the breached roof. Many people concentrated at the back of the hotel, inside a stairwell that was deemed a safe haven in case things got worse. The sickly sweet aroma of marijuana drifted throughout the hotel, so much so that people began yelling to stop smoking in case a spark from a vape device or open flame set off the gas. Hotel guests seemed dazed and worried. Little knots of guests, some families, some friends, some just thrown together by the disaster, lurched from room to room as more of the roof peeled off and the water poured into the first floor in ever-increasing amounts. A small river formed on the carpeted hallway. A small river forms on the carpeted hallway at the Country Inn &amp; Suites hotel in Panama City, Florida during Hurricane Michael. Michael Braun, MBRAUN@NEWS-PRESS.COM The wind from Michael blew steady for two hours a veritable jet-engine blast first from the east and north and then, as the eyewall passed, from the reverse direction. The effect on everything was immediate and dramatic simple devastation. Trees, some hundreds of feet tall, snapped midway, as did nearly every utility pole. The metal roof of our hotel peeled off strip by strip with insulation and plaster smashing into guests vehicles and plywood roofing boards studded with nails flying about like paper airplanes. Andrew and I hunkered down in that stairwell with dozens of other guests, talking, exchanging worried glances, reassuring each other and just hoping, always hoping. Uncertainty in the face of danger There were times during the constant sounds and vibrations of the hotel coming apart at the seams that Andrew and I didnt know if this was going to end well. People around us were praying, muttering, arguing, holding each other and asking us constantly what we knew, which was basically nothing. Neither Andrew nor I had anything to compare this to. None of the other storms we had covered or experienced came close. This was a powerful, monster of a storm. The wind abated about 3 p.m., enough for people to start making their way outside. Damage to vehicles seemed a simple game of luck. Our rental SUV got away with a few dents while an SUV to our immediate right had the entire rear deck lid blown in and smashed. One car might have lost a windshield while its neighbor seemed unaffected. Andrew and I gathered our gear and cleared nail-filled boards, siding, downspouts and other debris from the front of the SUV. After exchanging words of encouragement with several of those who had hunkered down with us good job, be careful, stay safe Andrew and I took off to survey the damage. That two-hour, wind-wracked period unexpected, terrifying, worrisome and prompting some soul-searching is something Andrew and I will never forget.

(Photo: Lynne Sladky, AP) The Trump administration announced Monday it will end immigration protections for about 59,000 Haitians living in the United States in May 2019, concluding that conditions on the ground in the poverty-stricken Caribbean country have improved enough since a massive earthquake in 2010 for residents to return. The Obama administration first granted ""temporary protected status"" to Haitians after the nation was ravaged by a magnitude-7.0 earthquake in 2010 that killed more than 200,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands. The protections have allowed Haitians to legally remain in the U.S. and have been extended each year as Haiti struggles to recover. Elaine Duke, acting director of the Department of Homeland Security, made the decision that extraordinary temporary conditions on which the special protections were issued ""no longer exist."" ""The decision to terminate TPS (temporary protected status) for Haiti was made after a review of the conditions upon which the country’s original designation were based and whether those extraordinary but temporary conditions prevented Haiti from adequately handling the return of their nationals, as required by statute,"" DHS said in a statement. ""Based on all available information, including recommendations received as part of an inter-agency consultation process, Acting Secretary Duke determined that those extraordinary but temporary conditions caused by the 2010 earthquake no longer exist."" In May the Trump administration announced it would extend protections to Haitians who fled to the U.S. until January 2018, but might shut down the program early in the new year. But DHS officials ultimately decided to extend the immigration for another 18 months to give Haiti's government more time to prepare for the return of residents who were forced to leave the country. DHS officials also said the 18 months is intended to give Haitians with temporary status enough time to arrange for their departure or ""to seek an alternative lawful immigration status in the United States, if eligible."" Several federal lawmakers from Florida, a state with the largest Haitian population, immediately criticized the move. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., called the move by DHS ""unconscionable"" and urged the Trump administration to reconsider. There is no reason to send 60,000 Haitians back to a country that cannot provide for them. This decision today by DHS is unconscionable. And I am strongly urging the administration to reconsider. Ultimately, we need a permanent legislative solution. https://t.co/Ft0bE0itf6 — Bill Nelson (@SenBillNelson) November 21, 2017 ""There is no reason to send 60,000 Haitians back to a country that cannot provide for them,"" Nelson wrote in a post on Twitter. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lethinen, a GOP lawmaker from Florida, also blasted the decision. ""I travelled to #Haiti after the earthquake in 2010 and after hurricane Matthew in 2016,"" Ros-Lethinen wrote on Twitter. ""So I can personally attest that #Haiti is not prepared to take back nearly 60,000 #TPS recipients under these difficult and harsh conditions."" Rep. Mario Diaz-Ballart, a Republican lawmaker from Ft. Lauderdale, said he strongly disagreed with the decision and expressed concern about the impact that sending home Haitian immigrants who, in some cases, have spent more than eight years in the U.S. could have on his community. He expressed concern about a move to similarly phase out TPS for some 2,000 Nicaraguans, who were given temporary legal status to live in the U.S. after they fled their homeland following Hurricane Mitch in 1998. ""These individuals are established, respected members of our communities who have made significant contributions and I urge the administration to reconsider its decision regarding Haitian and Nicaraguan nationals,” Diaz-Ballart said. I travelled to #Haiti after the earthquake in 2010 and after hurricane Matthew in 2016. So I can personally attest that #Haiti is not prepared to take back nearly 60,000 #TPS recipients under these difficult and harsh conditions. — Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (@RosLehtinen) November 21, 2017 The good news is that #DHSgov has given Haitian nationals a reprieve, BUT it is only for 18 months, so our job is not done. #SaveTPS pic.twitter.com/SaiHjcI86E — Rep Frederica Wilson (@RepWilson) November 21, 2017 Earlier this year, James McCament, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, recommended the six-month extension. But at the time, McCament said Haiti was nearly ready to receive more of its exiled citizens, and the U.S. should end the protected status in January. Temporary Protected Status is offered to foreign nationals, including legal residents and undocumented immigrants, who cannot return to their home country because of armed conflict, a natural disaster or ""other extraordinary and temporary conditions."" Duke met with Haitian Foreign Minister Antonio Rodrigue and Haitian Ambassador to the United States Paul Altidor recently in Washington to discuss the Trump administration's thinking ahead of the formal announcement.

"Jim Efstathiou Jr., Sylvia Carignan and Shruti Date Singh / Bloomberg","(Bloomberg) — Hurricane Florence’s potential for destruction also includes increased risks for the environment and public health as torrential rains could overwhelm the pits where toxic waste from power plants is stored. Animal-manure lagoons are also at risk of flooding. Duke Energy Corp. was ordered two years ago to clean up coal-ash ponds in North Carolina that posed risks to the environment and public health. The company won’t be done in time for the storm, leaving the sites vulnerable to spills that can unleash the waste. The state is also a major producer of poultry and hogs, and man-made lagoons that hold manure also could be at risk of overflowing into fields and nearby waterways. Florence continues to grow in size and strength, now poised to become the strongest hurricane in almost 30 years to hit the Carolinas as more than 1 million people began fleeing the U.S. coastline. Duke came under pressure to address coal-ash storage after about 39,000 tons spilled in 2014 from a pond near Eden, North Carolina. In 2016, the state gave the company until Aug. 1, 2019, to dig up and close some coal-ash pits and almost a decade more to deal with others. Duke has begun work at several high-risk sites. Coal-Ash Sites “The coal-ash sites are very vulnerable to this hurricane and any other,” said Frank Holleman, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. Duke owns 31 coal ash basins in North Carolina. They contained about 111 million tons of coal ash as of August 2017, according to state estimates. Duke is moving staff and equipment toward North Carolina’s coast to monitor the disposal sites for coal ash, a byproduct of burning coal to generate electricity. It contains metals including arsenic, chromium, and mercury that pose risks to public health and the environment if spilled into drinking water supplies. After the storm hits, staff are prepared to inspect the sites by foot, boat, and drone. Five sites slated for closing that are closest to the coast have lower water levels and “can hold significant rainfall,” Erin Culbert, a spokeswoman, said in an email. Still, many coal-ash storage ponds are near rivers that are vulnerable to overflowing during big storms. “The risk is probably not that rain is going to fall into the pits,” Holleman said “The risk is that land and water will compromise the dams.” Manure Lagoons From the livestock industry, one environmental impact from the storm could be from the lagoons, or lined earthen pits, that hold treated manure. They are commonly used to manage swine waste. The waste is held in lagoons because it’s generally considered a safe way to store the manure before it’s used to aid crops. “There’s just certain times of year when you just don’t want to put waste on fields,” said Mike Yoder, an associate director and coordinator for emergency-response programs at North Carolina State University Extension. The waste can be a significant problem when there’s storm surge and heavy rain, as a lot of North Carolina’s hog production is close to the coast, according to Will Sawyer, an Atlanta-based economist at CoBank. Farmers will be using the next several days to prepare for the storm, he said. There’s the potential that spillover from open lagoons or wash away from barns or fields could get into water used for drinking or recreation, according to the Waterkeeper Alliance, an environmental group. Wet Waste More than 10 billion pounds of wet animal waste is produced annually in the state, according to a June 2016 report by the group, which has monitored the impact of past storms. North Carolina is the top U.S. turkey producer, ranks third for chicken and is home to more hogs than any state other than Iowa, government data show. “This increasingly severe, potentially unprecedented storm is hurdling to the epicenter of animal agriculture in North Carolina,” said Will Hendrick, a staff attorney and manager for a water campaign in the state for the Waterkeeper Alliance. “Because waste is managed using archaic practices, it presents a significant threat to water quality, primarily through run off and/or breach or inundation of hog lagoons.” Still, the hog industry disputes the idea that there’s much environmental risk from the waste lagoons, said Andy Curliss, Chief Executive Officer of the North Carolina Pork Council. He said there was no impact during 2016’s Hurricane Matthew, which struck the state. During that storm, only 14 lagoons out of several thousand flooded, Curliss said. This year, farmers have been using manure as fertilizer through the year and the lagoons can handle as much as 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain. “If we get more than 25 inches of rain, then we’ll start to be concerned,” he said.",The storm surge and flooding could trigger an environmental nightmare,2018-09-11T13:19:56Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Toxic Waste.

(Photo: Caitie McMekin, News Sentinel-USA TODAY Network) Trump set to visit hurricane-ravaged Carolinas President Donald Trump will travel to North and South Carolina on Wednesday to assess the impact of Hurricane Florence, according to an official with knowledge of the plans. The visit comes as the region struggles with catastrophic flooding from the massive storm, which claimed at least 32 lives and has left some 300,000 utility customers without power. The historic flooding has cut access to many communities and paralyzed cities like Wilmington, North Carolina, where officials have opened distribution centers for food, water and tarps. Trump had previously said he planned to visit the region once the recovery was in hand. Last Slide Next Slide Kim Jong Un, Moon Jae-in sign 'peace' agreement at Korean summit South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced a broad agreement after their second day of talks in Pyongyang Wednesday that both said would usher in a new era of peace on the Korean Peninsula. At a news conference, Moon said that North Korea will permanently dismantle its Donchang-ri missile engine test site and would allow international inspectors to observe. The agreement comes after President Donald Trump canceled a visit to North Korea by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month, expressing concern that there had not been enough progress on denuclearization. During the conference, Moon said that Kim had agreed to visit Seoul in the near future and that the two Koreas would bid to jointly host the 2032 Summer Olympics. Last Slide Next Slide One of Elizabeth Smart's kidnappers to be released A woman convicted of helping a former street preacher kidnap Elizabeth Smart in 2002 is expected to be released from prison Wednesday, and she says the public should be worried. The Utah Board of Pardons and Parole last week announced that Wanda Barzee, 72, would be freed five years early due to an error in calculating her original sentence. Barzee's husband, Brian David Mitchell, is serving a life sentence for kidnapping Smart from her Salt Lake City home at knifepoint and raping Smart when she was just 14. In an interview with ""CBS This Morning,"" Smart, now 30, said she believes Barzee is still a threat. ""I shouldn't be the only one who's concerned about her,"" she said. Barzee will be under federal supervision for five years. Man charged with murdering Mollie Tibbetts faces arraignment The man accused of killing 20-year-old Iowa college student Mollie Tibbetts is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in an Iowa courtroom. Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 24, is set to appear in Poweshiek County District in Montezuma, Iowa, on a charge of first-degree murder. Tibbetts was found dead in a cornfield Aug. 21 after going missing more than a month. The arrest of Rivera, an undocumented immigrant farmhand, served as a rallying cry for some officials and political groups seeking tougher immigration laws. But Mollie's father, Rob Tibbetts, urged them to stop, accusing them in an op-ed column of trying to ""callously distort and corrupt Mollie’s tragic death to advance a cause she vehemently opposed."" Border Patrol to inspect facilities housing minors Head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Kevin McAleenan will travel to the southwestern border in Texas on Wednesday to see how the agency's facilities can be modified to better care for waves of families and minors as the images of migrant children detained in chain-linked cages still plague the Trump administration. McAleenan said he will meet with his agents, nongovernmental organizations and others to figure out ways to improve conditions for the growing number of children coming across the border. The Trump administration instituted a ""zero tolerance"" immigration enforcement policy this year that led to the separation of more than 2,600 families seeking asylum. A federal judge halted those separations and ordered the administration to reunify all those families, a process that is ongoing.

USA TODAY Denise Milligan holds her grandson, 2-year-old Hunter, and two of her dogs above the water as she is escorted to dry ground at Lee's Landing Circle, Sept. 21, 2018 in Conway, S.C. With muddy river water still washing over entire communities on Friday, eight days after Hurricane Florence slammed into land with nearly 3 feet of rain, new evacuation orders forced residents to flee to higher ground amid a sprawling disaster that's beginning to feel like it will never end. (Photo: Jason Lee/AP) As Hurricane Florence barreled toward the Carolina coast, Tammie Hedges took action to protect pets that might have otherwise been caught in the storm – a decision that led to her arrest. Hedges, a resident of Waynes County, North Carolina, was taken into custody Friday after providing care to more than two dozen animals – 17 cats and 10 dogs – for owners who had to evacuate before the storm hit. ""The owners got to evacuate. They got to save themselves. But who’s going to save those animals? That’s what we did,"" Hedges said. ""We saved them."" The owner of Crazy's Claws N Paws, a donation-based animal rescue center, was in the process of converting a warehouse space into a proper animal shelter when she decided to use the building to help keep pets dry. However, her facility was not legally registered as a shelter. “Our mission was to save as many animals from the flood that we could,"" Hedges said. ""We went through Hurricane Matthew and it was horrible. There were many preventable deaths.” She said an elderly couple dropped off 18 of the animals, some of which were sick and injured, just before the storm. On Monday, after Florence passed, Hedges got a call from Wayne County Animal Control regarding the animals. “He basically told me, 'You can voluntarily hand over the animals, or I can go get a warrant,' "" Hedges said. She willingly surrendered the animals. More: 'Take your pets with you' to keep them safe during and after Hurricane Florence ""A few days later they called me in for questioning and yesterday they arrested me,"" Hedges said. The charges included 12 counts of practicing medicine without a veterinary license. The non-profit updated a Facebook status to breakdown the charges: ""1 count of administering amoxicillin to Big Momma, 1 count of administering Tramadol to Big Momma, 3 counts of administering amoxicillin to a white Siamese cat, 3 counts of administering a topical antibiotic ointment (triple antibiotic from Dollar Tree) to a white Siamese cat, 3 counts of administering amoxicillin to a cat known as Sweet Pea, 1 count of administering amoxicillin to an unnamed black kitten, and 1 count of solicitation to commit a crime,"" the non-profit writes. ""It was all over-the-counter stuff you could literally find at Dollar Tree,"" said Raina Nyliram, 24, an animal rescue volunteer who started a crowdfunding campaign for Hedges to help cover legal fees. ""She couldn’t get the animals to the vet because the vet was closed. All the charges are bogus."" Just days before the good deed went punished, the unregistered shelter was seeking volunteers to help take care of rescue animals. ""Please share this for anyone in the Wayne County or nearby areas that may need a place to stay or be able to help. If they have a pet and need some place to go, or just like animals, and are in need of a place to stay, we'd love to help them, in exchange for their overnight help,"" the center posted on Facebook. One of those volunteers, Kathie Davidson, said she was ""shocked and saddened"" when animal control showed up to to take the pets. ""Of course this whole situation is unbelievable,"" Davidson said. ""The animals seized were to be returned to their owners after the storm."" Instead, she said that Animal Control has the pets. ""If they can't find the owners, the pets went from a safe place to a kill shelter,"" Hedges said. The county issued a statement about the incident: ""Wayne County Animal Services turned the case over to the Wayne County District Attorney’s office based on suspicion of practicing veterinarian medicine without a license and presence of controlled substances. Ms. Hedges is considered innocent until proven guilty."" The office said that all the animals that were surrendered were checked out by a licensed veterinarian and that it is working to reunite them with their owners.

"Henry Grabar, Henry Grabar","People line up to enter a hurricane shelter at Trask Middle School in Wilmington, North Carolina, on September 11, 2018. On Wednesday morning, Hurricane Florence was spinning towards North Carolina as a Category 4 storm. It’s project to make landfall late Friday, and if it hits anywhere north of Wilmington, it will be the northernmost landfall for a storm of its size on record. That’s only half of it: Even if it lapses back to a Category 3, the storm is expected to slow down over the Carolina coast, dumping upwards of 25 inches of rain in parts of Eastern N.C through the weekend, beating the previous 24-inch record set by Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Florence is an example of the kind of storm we are likely to see more of as the planet heats up. Warmer-than-average water—surface temperatures in the Western Atlantic are currently at 84 degrees, 3-4 degrees higher than normal for this time of year—is lending it power, as increased evaporation fills the air with water vapor that acts like hurricane fuel. More broadly, according to the 2014 National Climate Assessment, the amount of rain falling in “very heavy events”—those at the top 1 percent of all rainstorms, often hurricanes like Florence—has risen by 27 percent in the Southeast between 1958 and 2013. It’s not completely novel. The coastal Carolinas were walloped by Hurricanes Hazel and Hugo, in 1954 and 1989 respectively. Floyd in 1999 prompted what was then the largest peacetime evacuation in U.S history, and its state-record rainfall was worse than it looks, because it came just days after Dennis dumped 8–10 inches across the Eastern Coastal Plain. That purple part has a chance to break the state’s all-time rain record. But there are two big differences between then and now: First, we’ve got a few more decades of global warming under our belts. Second, there’s been rapid population growth in the U.S. Sun Belt and in coastal counties in particular. North Carolina’s beloved coastline isn’t that well-populated relative to states to the north and south. As of 2008, less than 10 percent of the state’s population lived in a coastal county, compared to nearly 20 percent in South Carolina and nearly 40 percent in Virginia. Still, particularly in the southern half of the state around Wilmington—where the storm currently looks to hit worst—population growth has been rapid. That means there will be a lot of residents who won’t even remember Hurricane Hugo (when it hit 30 years ago, it was the costliest hurricane in U.S. history). North Carolina has a much stronger tradition of regulating coastal development than, say, Florida. Even so, reckoning with climate change impacts has been a more complicated story, notes Michael Orbach, a professor emeritus of marine science at Duke who has been involved in coastal planning in the state for decades. “The single biggest problem in planning with respect to sea level rise is all planning and zoning [in North Carolina] was based on sea level rise staying the same. That was true for 6,000 years, but now it’s not.” In 2011, North Carolina’s Coastal Resources Commission put out a dire forecast for sea level rise on the Outer Banks. But then real estate interests successfully convinced the Republican-led statehouse to discard those conclusions. “You can believe whatever you want about global warming,” said state Rep. Pat McElraft, a Republican and real estate agent who sponsored a 2012 law to put a four-year moratorium on state regulations accounting for sea level rise. “But when you go to make planning policies here for our residents and protecting their property values and insurance rates, it’s a very serious thing to us on the coast.” The moratorium expired in 2016. In the meantime, coastal towns undertook their own measures to prepare, passing freeboard laws that require new construction to rise above the FEMA “base flood elevation.” A 2015 report showed that local building standards had prompted a big chunk of the state’s coastal population to add two feet of freeboard. Still, some populous areas were just getting around to freeboard requirements this summer—such as Wilmington, which has grown from 55,000 people in 1990 to approximately 117,000 today. Preparing for the rain is another story. The towns of Eastern North Carolina, which are now projected to be just on the edge of Florence’s worst rainfall bands, are among the most vulnerable places in the United States to inland flooding. In 1999, Flooding from Floyd is thought to have caused a spike in gastrointestinal problems after the state’s proliferating hog farms contaminated neighbors and natural areas with manure-filled water. The state cracked down, for a while, but didn’t solve the problem. After Hurricane Matthew, neighbors were inundated with hog-water again. Steve Wing, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina, flatly told the Washington Post, “Storing vast quantities of fecal waste in flood plains is a serious and preventable public health threat.” That pattern—talk big and then forget about it—is typical of the state’s approach, argues Stan Riggs, a coastal marine geologist at East Carolina University in Greenville who has been advising local governments on flooding for half a century. After Floyd, for example, local governments passed new floodplain ordinances and the state drafted a new hydraulic model to account for changing land use. Riggs: “Everybody cries crocodile tears, says ‘We’re never going to let this happen again,’ but within a year after Floyd flooding in Greensville they were building student condominiums where there had been 10 feet of water just a year before. The economics take over and greed takes over.” Greenville grew by 53 percent between 1990 and 2015, though the state argues that changes in land use have been minimal. In the Carolinas, as along the Gulf Coast, growth has been characterized by a fast-and-loose approach to water management laws. Older developments sit in the floodplain; newer ones sprout unregulated or win exemptions from tax-hungry governments. South Carolina’s devastating 2015 flooding was characterized by the failure of little-regulated, privately-owned dams, some of which had been built to create artificial lakes for suburban homeowners. In coastal North Carolina, population density has more than doubled in the past 50 years as natural land has been transformed from villages, forests and wetlands to suburban sprawl. The ongoing loss of natural areas that would have once served to dampen the impact of both storm surge and stormwater will change the way those phenomena affect even houses that didn’t flood during, say, the rainstorms that ravaged the state in 1999. All told, 430,000 North Carolinians live in the 100-year-floodplain on and off the coast, including much of villages like Princeville, a historic black enclave that flooded during Floyd and again during Matthew. “These villages and the towns built their infrastructure after World War II, and now growth is taking place really fast in big rings around that. All the water runs into that old core and gets backed up,” says Riggs. “What you’re going to see starting tomorrow will be a lot like what you saw in Houston.”","On Wednesday morning, Hurricane Florence was spinning towards North Carolina as a Category 4 storm.

Herbert Lash,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World equities fell more than 1 percent on Wednesday, sliding to three-month lows, as technology shares slumped on fears of slowing demand, while rising U.S. bond yields made stocks less compelling. On Wall Street, the Philadelphia Semiconductor index tumbled 3.07 percent after Swiss vacuum valve maker VAT Group said demand was softening from chip equipment makers. Among the tech sector’s worst performers in Europe were Austrian chipmaker AMS fell 6.6 percent and STMicroelectronics was down 5.6 percent. Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes fell 3/32 in price to push their yield up to 3.2196 percent. But the yield on shorter-term 2-year and 3-year notes was just under or hovered at 3 percent, respectively, providing long-absent competition for equities. The rise in U.S. Treasury yields has been bolstered by solid U.S. economic data that has reinforced expectations of multiple rate hikes over the next 12 months by the Federal Reserve. The fiscal and monetary policy signals for higher rates have been unambiguous, said Mike Terwilliger, portfolio manager of Resource Liquid Alternatives for the Resource Credit Income Fund in New York. “Investors missing this rate move is tantamount to letting yourself get run over by a glacier,” Terwilliger said. Traditionally stocks and bonds have been in a tug of war for capital and for the last 10 years bonds have pulling on that rope with one arm tied behind their back, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer and founding partner at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. “Short-term bonds are getting to be a compelling place to hang out,” he said. “This orphan status that equity markets have enjoyed for the last 10 years is disappearing and finally get some competition from the bond market.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 400.44 points, or 1.52 percent, to 26,030.13. The S&amp;P 500 lost 43.98 points, or 1.53 percent, to 2,836.36 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 169.06 points, or 2.18 percent, to 7,568.96. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.15 percent and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares lost 1.43 percent. The euro and sterling rose, underpinned by optimism for a Brexit deal, while the dollar lost ground against a basket of currencies even as U.S. yields posted fresh multi-year peaks. European Union Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier signaled progress on a deal with the UK over its withdrawal from the bloc. “There is more optimism that they will find some agreement between Britain and the European Union before Brexit,” said Steve Englander, global head of G10 FX research at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. The dollar index fell 0.24 percent, with the euro up 0.35 percent at $1.1529. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.24 percent versus the greenback at 112.67. Oil prices eased after the IMF lowered its global economic growth forecasts, but markets were supported as Hurricane Michael closed nearly 40 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output and U.S. sanctions restricted Iranian exports.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON/FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (Reuters) - Rescue teams were trying to reach hundreds of people on Monday and racing against rising rivers and floods that could last for days after Florence dumped record rain on the Carolinas and killed at least 31 people. Thousands of rescues have taken place in the two states and over 650 people were taken to safety in and around Wilmington, North Carolina, said Barbi Baker, a spokeswoman for New Hanover County. The city, which took a direct hit when Florence plowed into the state as a hurricane on Friday, has been largely cut off since then due to storm surges and flooding from the Cape Fear River. As the remnants of Florence moved into the U.S. Northeast, and the sun appeared in some areas for the first time in days, residents of the Carolinas confronted its after-effects, including power outages, impassable roads, and sewage spilling into flooded areas. Rex Gehring, 62, was unsure what he would do with the house he bought outside Fayetteville, another town on the Cape Fear River, after Hurricane Matthew in 2016 forced its previous owner into foreclosure. “We’re in a floodplain but a hundred-year one,” he said as floodwaters lapped at the house’s front steps. “I guess that means every two years now.” With 1,500 roads closed across North Carolina, fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage after Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain on the state since Thursday. Flooded roads have also prevented some North Carolina farmers from accessing their fields and livestock to assess damage, said Andrea Ashby, spokeswoman for the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. ‘DANGER IS IMMEDIATE’ “For many parts of North Carolina, the danger is still immediate,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference Monday. “Flood waters are rising as rivers crest and they will for days.” Cooper said 2,600 people were rescued in North Carolina, along with 300 animals, and that the rescues were continuing. About 14,000 people are in shelters, officials said. The dead included a 1-year-old boy swept away from his mother as they tried to escape their car amid floodwaters. The woman had driven around barricades to reach a closed road, the sheriff’s office in Union County, near North Carolina’s border with South Carolina, said on Facebook. “Don’t drive around barricades. We’re seeing this happen now and the result is not good,” Cooper said. Over 450,000 homes and businesses in North and South Carolina were still without power on Monday evening, down from a peak of nearly 1 million outages. Major rivers are expected to remain flooded for the next two to three weeks as rainwater drains into already engorged rivers across the state, said Steve Goldstein of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. DAMAGES UP TO $22 BILLION North Carolina had deployed around 2,000 boats and 36 helicopters to help people stranded in floods, Michael Sprayberry, the state’s director of emergency management, told ABC’s “This Week” program on Sunday. The Coast Guard had 26 helicopters and 11 aircraft looking for people in trouble and rescuing people, Coast Guard Rear Admiral Meredith Austin told reporters on Monday. Property damage from the storm is expected to total at least $17 billion to $22 billion, but that forecast could be conservative depending on further flooding, risk management firm Moody’s Analytics said. A power outage at a wastewater treatment plant in Wilmington resulted in partially treated sewage water being released into the Cape Fear River, said Reggie Cheatham, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Emergency Management. Sewage releases in the Neuse River also were reported, as well as overflowing manholes. Overflows also were reported at several hog “lagoons” - used to store waste from pig farms.

Emily Bohatch,"As nearly a million people hit the road before Hurricane Florence nears the coast, 934 inmates and as many as 119 prison staff were ordered to stay behind despite a mandatory evacuation. Despite an evacuation order encompassing the prison’s location in Jasper County issued Monday, S.C. Department of Corrections officials decided not to remove inmates at the Ridgeland Correctional Institution as of that afternoon, SCDC spokesman Dexter Lee said in an interview with The State. “Right now, we’re not in the process of moving inmates,” Lee said. “In the past, it’s been safer to leave them there.” During a press conference Monday afternoon, S.C. Gov. Henry McMaster revealed maps of the evacuation zones. McMaster commented that the darker the color, the more important it was for residents to evacuate. Ridgeland falls within a red area on the evacuation map. “We know the evacuation order I’m issuing will be inconvenient,” McMaster said during the evacuation press conference. “But we’re not going to gamble with the lives of the people of South Carolina. Not a one.” During a Tuesday press conference, McMaster lifted the evacuation order for Jasper County. Along with the nearly 1,000 prisoners ordered to stay behind during the evacuation, essential personnel would have been required to stay behind and work at the prison, Lee said. Guards would not have the choice to opt in or out if they are scheduled to work during Hurricane Florence, he added. Though parts of the lower Low Country aren’t included in the National Hurricane Center’s hurricane warning zone, Lee said there is some concern about conditions Florence may cause. “There’s a concern anytime (with flooding) in a storm of this magnitude,” Lee said. In 2016, during Hurricane Matthew, an inmate died at Ridgeland Correctional Institution, according to a previous report in The State. Then Gov. Nikki Haley said the death was seemingly unrelated, according to the report. Haley added there were no deaths directly related to the storm. MacDougall Correctional Institution in Dorchester County is also in the evacuation zone, Lee said. Lee was not immediately available to comment on the inmate population and staffing levels at MacDougall and did not comment about whether that prison would be evacuated. However, Lee did say that generally, SCDC believes it’s safer to not transfer inmates to another location. MacDougall is a Level 2 institution in Ridgeville, which houses medium-security inmates. Ridgeland Correctional is also a Level 2 institution, located in Ridgeland.","Despite an evacuation order encompassing the prison’s location in Jasper County, S.C.

"USA TODAY, Gregory Korte, USA TODAY","An aerial view shows the College Lake Dam in Lynchburg, Va. on Aug. 3, 2018. (Photo: Andrew P. Scott &amp; Steve Elfers, USA TODAY) Dam safety officials in the Southeast are inspecting dams, reservoirs and levees as Hurricane Florence barrels toward the region in the hope of preventing a repeat of the widespread dam failures that have followed heavy rains in recent years. South Carolina officials have inspected 181 of the highest-risk dams and have alerted dam owners to put their emergency plans into action. In North Carolina, the state dam safety engineer recommended Tuesday that reservoir owners lower their water levels by a foot per day as the hurricane approaches. Both Carolinas – and Maryland – recalled dam inspectors from a five-day national conference in Seattle this week to prepare for the first major hurricane of the season. The storm could drop three feet of rain on the East Coast beginning this weekend. Along the shoreline, the biggest concerns are high winds and rising sea levels, which could cause dangerous storm surges in coastal areas. But further inland — in the Midland and Piedmont regions — heavy rains could inundate streams and rivers and overwhelm the delicate system of dams that holds the water back. That's what happened three years ago, when heavy rains caused 51 dams in South Carolina to fail, leading to flash floods and contributing to the death toll of 19 people. The next year, Hurricane Matthew brought more than a foot of rain and 25 more dam failures. More: Hurricane Florence nears coast: 'This is a life-threatening situation' More: Hurricane Florence weakened but far from weak: What to know about storm's power More: Why hurricanes are doing more damage: It’s not the storms. It’s us. While larger dam failures are more catastrophic, they're also inspected and regulated more carefully. It's the smaller, privately owned and unregulated dams are most likely to fail, and the Southeast has the highest percentage of privately owned dams in the country, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Virginia and South Carolina lead the nation with 86 percent of dams under private ownership. Georgia ranks fourth at 84 percent, and North Carolina is seventh at 80 percent. Forty-nine states – all except Alabama – have agencies responsible for regulating and inspecting dams. But it's up to the dam owners to decide how to operate them, based on loosely coordinated emergency plans. ""We are asking dam owners to look at their water levels and lower them accordingly – and to coordinate with other dam owners, especially downstream,"" said Tommy Crosby, a spokesman for the South Carolina Department of Health &amp; Environmental Control. But those decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. Lake Hartwell, a man-made reservoir on the South Carolina-Georgia border, is holding water this week even though it's already above it's normal level. That's because a release now would saturate the ground for hundreds of miles, leaving areas more prone to flooding, said Billy Birdwell, spokesman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Savannah District. Many property owners don't know they're downstream from a high-risk dam, said Lori Spragens, executive director of the Association of State Dam Safety Officials. Only California requires that disclosure in real estate transactions. And communication between dam owners, inspectors and emergency management officials is often limited, she said. ""So many people had no clue there was a dam that could affect them,"" Spragens said. ""There really is a gap and a challenge that needs to be addressed. It’s never perfect.""

"USA TODAY, Elizabeth Weise, USA TODAY","In the wake of Hurricane Matthew, here's some tips to preserve as much power as possible for your mobile device. WUSA Patrick Tobias seals his phone in a bag after taking a picture of his flooded car, behind, as he stands in floodwater from Tropical Storm Harvey Wednesday, Aug. 30, 2017, in Kingwood, Texas. (Photo: AP Photo/Gregory Bull) SAN FRANCISCO — Smart phones and water just don’t mix, but when a hurricane hits, keeping a phone dry isn't always possible. Experts say even if a phone is drenched, there are steps you can take to recover it — but it takes patience and the ability to leave the phone alone. What kills a wet phone is electricity, said Gary Tan with DE iPhone repair, a San Francisco-based company that offers multiple sites for smart phone repair and drying. “Do not charge it. Do not plug it in to see if it works. If it’s on, electricity will flow, it will touch the water that’s inside and that’s when your fry the (circuit) board,” he said. This is also true even if your phone is still working after it was dropped in water. “You didn’t get lucky. Turn it off!"" said Craig Beinecke, co-founder of TekDry, a Denver, Colo.-based company that has more than 600 sites nationwide where consumers can quickly get small electronics dried out. ""We see a lot of people who come in and say, ‘I dropped it in water and I pulled it out really fast and I figured I got lucky, and then the next day the touch screen didn’t work,’” he said. What actually happened is that it took a while for the water to reach sensitive connections inside the phone. Once it did, the water shorted them out. In a small number of cases swamped phones are able to dry out on their own over the course of days or weeks. But it’s not common. And while some newer phones are water resistant and can withstand a quick drop in a bucket or toilet, none are water proof. More: More than 1 million to flee as Hurricane Florence rips toward East Coast More: If Hurricane Florence hits as a Category 4 storm, the toll could be devastating. Here's what could happen. A line of phones waiting to be dried out at a TekDry station during Hurricane Harvey (Photo: TekDry) Drying on the counter is as fast as the rice treatment Multiple websites suggest sticking electronics that have been submerged in liquid in a bag of uncooked rice, to draw the water out. But that actually doesn't work and can introduce dust and starch into the phone as well, said Beinecke. ""We did a study, and rice was slower to work than just leaving the phone out on the counter. And neither worked fast enough. After about 48 hours in rice, only 13 percent of the water came out of the phone,"" he said. By the time the phone had fully dried out, corrosion will have had time to damage the delicate electronics inside, he said. The preferred method to safely dry phones is to boil off the water inside them at low temperatures under vacuum. In vacuum drying, the items are placed in a chamber slightly smaller than a shoe box and then put under vacuum while being heated. The lower the pressure, the lower the temperature at which water boils. The machine allows the water inside the phone to boil off at temperatures that can't damage the components, usually within about 30 minutes. Companies that offer this service also do car key fobs, hearing aids, fitness trackers and TV remotes. Though for those who can't get somewhere to have their phone professionally dried immediately, there's still hope. In San Francisco, Tan said he’d had people bring in phones that stopped working after being sent through a washer and didn't bring them in for six months, figuring they were dead and gone. “We opened it up, dried it, cleaned it and in a couple of cases we’ve got them working again,” he said. Craig Beinecke puts a cell phone into the TekDry drying machine in Denver. (Photo: Trevor Hughes/USA TODAY) Ocean water is a different story Plain water, or even toilet or flood water, is bad enough. Salt water is another thing entirely, say experts. The salts in ocean water are strongly corrosive to electronics and can much more quickly damage a phone. If your phone gets wet with ocean water, the first thing you need to do is rinse it out, said Beinecke. That might seem counterintuitive, “but you’ve got to get the salt out. If the salt stays inside the phone, it can corrode out in as little as a day,” he said. As soon as you have access to fresh water, Beinecke suggests rinsing the phone with warm water, to flush as much of the salt water out as possible — and of course don’t turn it on until the phone is dried out.

(Photo: DE iPhone Repair) Do these two things before the storm hits In Hawaii as Hurricane Lane was bearing down on the islands, many first responders made sure to grab a stash of sandwich-sized resealable plastic bags and keep them in a pocket or bag. Once it started raining, they put their phone in one of the bags, pushed the air out and then zipped it up — holding the resulting bundle together with a rubber band. This, they explained, was a low-tech waterproof covering for their phones. They still had to take the phone out when making a call, but if they had to wade through water or got soaked as the rain poured down, they had some hope of keeping their smartphone dry. It’s by no means accident proof, said Beinike. But it’s better than nothing and a technique he uses when he bicycles on days it might rain. The second must-do is to write down on paper, or better yet memorize, a few crucial phone numbers. “We learned from Hurricane Harvey that most people nowadays don’t have any phone numbers memorized. So if they get into trouble and their phone’s not working, they have no way of getting in touch with anyone, even if they have access to a phone,” Beinecke said. He now cautions people to write down a few important phone numbers such as family and work well before the storm hits, and to keep the paper somewhere accessible. “Or just memorize them. Then you can’t lose them,” he said.

The Associated Press,"A new round of evacuations was ordered in South Carolina as the trillions of gallons of water dumped by Hurricane Florence meanders to the sea, raising river levels and threatening more destruction. With the crisis slowly moving to South Carolina, emergency managers on Friday ordered about 500 people to flee homes along the Lynches River. The National Weather Service said the river could reach record flood levels late Saturday or early Sunday, and shelters are open. Officials downstream sounded dire alarms, pointing out the property destruction and environment al disasters left in Florence's wake. ""We're at the end of the line of all waters to come down,"" said Georgetown County Administrator Sel Hemingway, as he warned the area may see a flood like it has never seen before. In North Carolina, a familiar story was unfolding as many places that flooded in Hurricane Matthew in 2016 were once again inundated. Two years ago, flooding ruined the baseboards and carpet of the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant in Spring Lake. The congregation rebuilt, This year, water from the Little River water broke the windows, leaving the pews a jumbled mess and soaked Bibles and hymn books on the floor. ""I'm so sad just thinking about all the work we put in. My gut is turning up,"" church member Dennis DeLong said. ""We put a lot of heart and soul into putting it back up."" South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster estimated damage from the flood in his state at $1.2 billion in a letter that says the flooding will be the worst disaster in the state's modern history. McMaster asked Congressional leaders to hurry federal aid. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said he knows the damage in his state will add up to billions of dollars, but said with the effects on the storm ongoing, there was no way to make a more accurate estimate. Meanwhile, the National Hurricane Center said it was monitoring four areas in the Atlantic for signs of a new tropical weather threat. One was off the coast of the Carolinas with a chance of drifting toward the coast. About 55,000 homes and businesses remain without power after Florence, nearly all in North Carolina, and down from a high of more than 900,000 in three states. Florence is blamed for at least 42 deaths in the Carolinas and Virginia, including that of an 81-year-old whose body was found in a submerged pickup truck in South Carolina. Well over half the dead were killed were in vehicles. Potential environmental problems remained. Duke Energy issued a high-level emergency alert after floodwaters from the Cape Fear River overtopped an earthen dike and inundated a large lake at a closed power plant near Wilmington, North Carolina. The utility said it did not think any coal ash was at risk. State-owned utility Santee Cooper in South Carolina is placing an inflatable dam around a coal ash pond near Conway, saying the extra 2.5 feet (76 centimeters) should be enough to keep floodwaters out. Officials warned human, hog and other animal waste were mixing in with floodwaters in the Carolinas. In Wilmington, things kept creeping back closer to normal in the state's largest coastal city. Officials announced the end of a curfew and the resumption of regular trash pickup. But they said access to the city of 120,000 was still limited and asked people who evacuated to wait a few more days. They also warned people to not get caught off guard as rivers that briefly receded were periodically rising back. The storm continues to severely hamper travel. Parts of the main north-south route on the East coast, Interstate 95, and the main road to Wilmington, Interstate 40, remain flooded and will likely be closed at least until nearly the end of September, North Carolina Department of Transportation Secretary Jim Trogdon said. More than a thousand other roads from major highways to neighborhood lanes are closed in the Carolinas, officials said. Some of them have been washed out entirely. The flood has been giving so much warning to Horry County, South Carolina, that officials published a detailed map of places that flooded in 2016 and warned those same places were going underwater again. One man had time to build a 6-foot-high (1.8-meter) dirt berm around his house. The Waccamaw River has started its slow rise in the city of 23,000, and forecasters expect it to swell more than 3 feet (0.90 meters) above the previous record crest by Tuesday while still rising. Some areas could stay underwater for weeks, forecasters warned. ——— Derosier reported from Spring Lake. Associated Press writers Jonathan Drew, Martha Waggoner and Gary D.

"USA TODAY, Ledyard King, USA TODAY","This time-lapsed video shows a NOAA airplane passing through Hurricane Florence near Bermuda. USA TODAY Brock Long, administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Photo: Deborah Barfield Berry/USA TODAY) WASHINGTON – A month after Brock Long was confirmed as FEMA's newest administrator, he told a group of governors last summer that he worried the nation suffered from ""hazard amnesia."" ""We've had some bad disasters,"" he told them. ""We've had Sandy (in 2012). We've had Matthew (in 2016). We've had flooding. ""But one of the things that keeps me up at night is this nation has not seen the devastation of a major landfall hurricane since 2005. So sometimes I think we forget the worst."" That was only a few weeks before Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria struck in succession, breaking the relative calm with a triple wallop that caused thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in losses. Now the North Carolina native is quarterbacking recovery efforts for the latest monster storm, a sprawling behemoth named Florence that's heading straight for his home state. The Category 4 hurricane, which is expected to make landfall late Thursday, is packing maximum sustained winds of almost 130 mph and threatening historic flooding. More than 1 million people have begun evacuating. ""Hurricane Florence is going to be a devastating storm to the Carolina Coast, Virginia and some of the Mid-Atlantic states due to damaging winds, storm surge and inland rainfall,"" Long said in a video tweeted Tuesday. ""Bottom line is, now's the time to be prepared."" Long is gearing up for what's expected to be a prolonged and difficult recovery over the coming weeks – and not only from Florence. Two more hurricanes, Isaac and Helene, have formed in the Atlantic, and the National Hurricane Center has identified tropical disturbances in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. FEMA, meanwhile, is trying to salvage its reputation after criticism that it was unprepared to respond to the devastation of Maria. That hurricane last September killed nearly 3,000 in Puerto Rico and caused $91 billion in losses. In a report issued in July, FEMA acknowledged staffing shortages and logistical challenges in responding to Puerto Rico, where aging infrastructure, damage to communication networks and the island terrain complicated relief efforts. Hurricane #Florence is forecast to cause life-threatening storm surge, inland flooding, and damaging winds along the Carolinas and Virginia. It's extremely important for everyone in the storm's path to heed warnings and listen to local officials. pic.twitter.com/kAAAX1kTDQ — FEMA (@fema) September 10, 2018 But Long also said the agency was facing an unprecedented workload, juggling responses to three catastrophic hurricanes, historic wildfires in California and dozens of other disasters. He said the agency has learned from last year and will be better prepared to confront disasters this year. ""It is always a question of when, not if, we will be called on again,"" Long wrote in a column last month for USA TODAY. ""FEMA began incorporating lessons in real time as they were identified and continues to do so to prepare for the 2018 hurricane season. We have substantially increased stockpiles of resources across the nation, focusing on remote, hard-to-reach locations."" Craig Fugate, the widely respected FEMA chief under President Barack Obama, said the criticism leveled against the agency after Maria was unfair. Fugate, who arrived at FEMA in 2009, helped restore the agency's reputation after Hurricane Katrina. Puerto Rico's power grid was in bad shape before Maria, he told USA TODAY. The logistics were challenging. And FEMA was responding to its third major hurricane within a month. ""They're going to be judged by things that sometimes are not even in their control,"" Fugate said. ""But this is not an agency in disarray. This is not an agency that needs to be fixed.

And even when you're doing that, by the time you're on your third catastrophic event, you start running out of stuff, and it's going to impact response."" Long and Fugate got to know each other in the 2000s, when Long was a regional hurricane program manager at FEMA and Fugate was director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management. Long later directed Alabama’s Emergency Management Agency before joining Illinois-based Hagerty Consulting. He assisted governments and companies on projects ranging from complex attack exercises to evacuation scenarios for large urban areas. Those who have worked with Long say he won't treat Florence any differently simply because it has his beloved home state in its cross hairs. But it should make coordination easier, because North Carolina Emergency Management Director Mike Sprayberry and many of the local officials already know him.

""All emergencies are local, and all responses are managed at the local level, so that will really enable what those emergency managers need as this event unfolds,"" he said. ""They'll already have that working relationship with Brock."" Fugate said he expects it will be easier to deal with a disaster on the mainland than one on an island where transportation and communication systems were demolished. Fugate's advice to the current FEMA administrator? Tune out the critics. ""Brock cannot go back change what happened in Maria,"" he said. ""The agency's got to focus on the disaster in front of them.

Two fatalities here were among the first storm-related deaths reported. Daniel J. Gross, The Greenville News Charles Carver of Wilmington, N.C., looks at damage, a tree on his home, as Hurricane Florence passes through on Friday. (Photo: KEN RUINARD/USA TODAY NETWORK) WILMINGTON, N.C. — Hurricane Florence made its swipe at Wilmington Friday, cutting power to thousands and priming eastern North Carolina for major flooding in the days ahead. Wind gusts paired with historic rainfall totals brought down trees in nearly every area of the Cape Fear region. A Wilmington mother and her infant child were the first two fatalities attributed to the storm. They died when a large tree came down over the back of their home, crushing and killing them while leaving the child's father hospitalized Friday morning. Between downed trees and rising water levels, some major roads were impassable and more secondary roads were also cut off. The Cape Fear River had spilled over the bank of Wilmington's riverfront by Friday afternoon. The marina leading to Wrightsville Beach had also risen significantly and flooded most of the parking lots, docks and roadways nearby. Last Slide Next Slide Residents and business owners around downtown came out from their hiding places as early as 8:30 a.m. Friday, about an hour after the eyewall of Florence had passed through. Massive power outages were reported, and downtown streets had fallen trees, broken storefront windows and damaged street signs. At a late afternoon news conference, New Hanover County officials said 106,000 Duke Energy customers were without power out of a total 127,000 customers, and they said that number was rising. The blackout spurred the county to implement a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. ""A curfew is the right thing for our community,"" said New Hanover County manager Chris Coudriet.

He stayed in the bar to ride out the storm. “We got a little bit of water inside, but things weren’t so bad,” Church said. “The wind was shaking the whole building.” Several large trees had toppled in the city’s historic district. In a historic neighborhood just outside of downtown, mature oaks and other large trees had fallen onto gardens, gates, roofs and parked cars. County officials said damage assessments would not likely begin until Saturday. Duke Energy crews will have to wait until storm conditions subside before fixing equipment. Power was expected to remain out in come locations for days. Neighbor of Hurricane Florence victim feels impact Ken Ruinard / staff, The Greenville News “Now we just have to figure out how to get hot coffee,” said Mary Holland, standing on the porch of her home that was built in 1889. The home was unscathed despite large trees looming overhead. Mary and Jeff Holland said they had just replaced their roof after Hurricane Matthew came through in 2016 and brought wind damage. Thankfully, they said, the new roof held up for Florence. Neighbor Charles Carver didn’t come away without damage to his property. A tall tree came down over the back of his tin roof and across the siding. His wooden fence was also knocked to the ground. He said he plans to spend the next few days cleaning up, making repairs and deciding whether to file a claim. Living in his 1886 home for 20 years, he’s been through a handful of storms. “We had a run of them in ‘96 when there was like five or six, or maybe more than that,” he said. “But this is the worst one since then.” That was the year Hurricane Fran made landfall near Wilmington as a Category 3 storm. Across the street from Carver, a woman’s entire front porch awning was ripped down in one piece. Nearby, Jennifer Barfield’s home was OK. She grew up in her home that has been passed down for generations. “We’ve ridden out a couple of them, but this one worried us,” Barfield said, explaining the history of her circa 1906 home. “My grandmother lived in this home.” Last Slide Next Slide Last Slide Next Slide Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2xgsnRf","Hurricane Florence made its swipe at Wilmington Friday, cutting power to thousands and priming eastern NC for major flooding in the days ahead.",2018-09-15T02:11:28Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Greenvilleonline.com'}","Florence: Wilmington resurfaces after landfall, now bracing for flooding and no power",https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/2018/09/14/wilmington-resurfaces-after-hurricane-florence-landfall/1304333002?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable,"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/09/14/PGRE/cddc532e-12d1-4e29-bb2c-0ecdc8019bd0-0913_Hurricane_Florence_Wilmington_press_conf_128.JPG?crop=2799,1577,x0,y15&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds",,Greenvilleonline.com,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Greenville News, Tim Smith, The Greenville News","Eric and Varbara Coates on their boat at Lightkeepers Marina talk about preparing their boat for the hurricane. They will be staying and keeping an eye on the docks from their condo overlooking the docks. Josh Morgan/The Greenville News, The Greenville News Masten Cloer prepares his boat for Hurricane Florence at the Lightkeepers Marina in North Myrtle Beach on Wednesday, Sept. 12, 2018. Cloer, who lives in North Carolina, said he drove down to protect his new boat and will be staying in it during the hurricane. (Photo: JOSH MORGAN/Staff) LITTLE RIVER, S.C. – Rolling up some plastic windows on his 46-foot cabin cruiser Wednesday, Masten Cloer admitted he was nervous. A new weather forecast predicted Hurricane Florence changing paths to make a landfall near his marina at the border of North Carolina and South Carolina. ""I talked to some of the older people down here, and they are worried,"" he said. Cloer, himself, though, is thus far undeterred. The 57-year-old from Hudson, North Carolina, is planning to ride out the powerful, destructive storm on his boat, named Later, while it's docked at the marina, located on the Intracoastal Waterway about 2 miles from the Atlantic shore of Cherry Grove Beach. ""We're pretty far from the beach,"" Cloer said. ""But all water rises together."" A backhoe business operator back home in the mountains of North Carolina near Blowing Rock, Cloer said he could and would disembark if the storm becomes too violent. More: Storm surge could be Hurricane Florence's deadliest threat More: Hurricane Florence path shift 'bizarre,' could bring 'catastrophic flooding' to Southeast He's one of dozens of boat owners at the Lightkeepers Village Marina who have chosen to keep their boats docked during the impending storm. Steve and Jill Forsythe are among them. They removed their boat's canvas, tied double lines around the tall pilings and secured the sails Wednesday in preparation for the storm. “We have a 46-foot boat with a 5-foot draft, so there are just not a ton of places you can put it,” Jill Forsythe said. “So we’re tying it up and hoping for the best.” Setting sail for a new location wasn't a reasonable option. ""We’re not as fast as the Navy in outrunning a storm,” she said. But the predicted path of Hurricane Florence was enough to encourage her and her husband to leave their boat behind. “We’re not going to stay for this one,"" she said. ""We’re going to head west to get out of the flood zone and then head north.” George Rubis, assistant dockmaster of the marina, said the marina has 125 slips, and about half of those boats have been moved. He said it is a personal decision by each boat's owner what decide to do in the face of a storm. Eric and Barbara Coates of Little River plan to keep their boat docked and stay in a nearby condo. “We’ll be staying here and hoping the boat is still here when it’s done,” Eric Coates said. His wife said they can see the boat, a 44-foot-long fast trawler, from their condo. The couple have owned their boat since 2010, and Eric said he has been boating for 30 years. “I’ve been in some storms,” he said, “but this one could be fun.” Many members of the surrounding neighborhood say they plan to stay in their residences, fortified by their experiences with prior hurricanes. Around the corner from the marina, Stacy and Billy Prince packed their vehicle to leave Wednesday afternoon. Stacey said it was the change in forecast that led to the decision. She and her husband took jewelry, photo albums, videos, some clothes and their dog, Dixie. “We’re from here all our lives,” Billy Prince said. “We’ve been through Hugo, Diane, Fran, all of them. We’ve never evacuated. But we’re not going to play around with a Category 4.” They said they are headed for Florida, possibly Orlando. “I just feel sorry for people who are new here and don’t have a clue,” Stacy said. Karly Suggs and Jesse Prince also were packing to leave Wednesday. The couple loaded their large pickup truck and SUV Wednesday from their Light Keepers Village residence. For them, too, it was the new forecast. “That’s what pushed us away,” Suggs said. Last Slide Next Slide They had thought about going south, but a family member who came from Georgia Tuesday said traffic on Interstate 95 was backed up bumper to bumper. So they plan to head toward Greensboro, North Carolina, stopping along the way to pick up Suggs’ mom and dad in Tabor City. Suggs said it was difficult deciding what to take. “Basically anything important, like birth certificates, college degree diplomas,” she said. They placed other items on furniture off the floor in case of flooding. Nearby, Keith Cooper, who has lived in his Little River neighborhood for a year after moving from Arizona, had decided to stay through the storm though his wife and family had left for Charlotte. “I’m afraid about getting access back in after it’s all over,” he said. “I have radios, water, batteries. I’m a former Boy Scout.” Also deciding to stay were Barbara and Gregg Smith. “At this point we’re staying,” Gregg Smith said. “She wants to ride it out. She has all her kids here, and she wants to be around her grandkids. I’m very concerned. This is not going to be a good one.” Barbara said the couple stayed in their home during Hurricane Matthew and “were fine,” as was the nearby marina. Hand-held radios and a generator are included in their gear.

Clive Thompson,"In 1968, the Foreign Policy Association gathered experts together to predict what life would be like in the year 2018 -- and issued their forecast in the book Toward the Year 2018. The book jacket promised that the contents were ""MORE AMAZING THAN SCIENCE FICTION,"" and, like a lot of sci fi, it wound up frequently missing the mark. The 1968 progrosticators figured that we people of the future would have TV ads for anti-gravity belts, the ""suppression of lightning,"" a country powered heavily by nuclear, and the ability to launch ""a man-made hurricane"" as an offensive weapon. But as this writeup in the New Yorker notes... But for every amusingly wrong prediction, there’s one unnervingly close to the mark. It’s the same Thomas Malone who, amid predictions of weaponized hurricanes, wonders aloud whether “large-scale climate modification will be effected inadvertently” from rising levels of carbon dioxide. Such global warming, he predicts, might require the creation of an international climate body with “policing powers”—an undertaking, he adds, heartbreakingly, that should be “as nonpolitical as possible.” Gordon F. MacDonald, a fellow early advocate on climate change, writes a chapter on space that largely shrugs at manned interplanetary travel—a near-heresy in 1968—by cannily observing that while the Apollo missions would soon exhaust their political usefulness, weather and communications satellites would not. “A global communication system... would permit the use of giant computer complexes,” he adds, noting the revolutionary potential of a data bank that “could be queried at any time.” What “Toward the Year 2018” gets most consistently right is the integration of computing into daily life. Massive information networks of fibre optics and satellite communication, accessed through portable devices in a “universality of telephony”—and an upheaval in privacy? It’s all in there. The Bell Labs director John R. Pierce, in a few masterful strokes, extrapolates the advent of Touch-Tone to text and picture transmission, and editing the results online—“This will even extend to justification and pagination in the preparation of documents of a quality comparable to today’s letterpress.” And it’s Ithiel de Sola Pool—he of the free love and controlled economies—who wonders, five decades before alarms were raised over Equifax, Facebook, and Google, how personal information will be “computer-stored and fantastically manipulative” in both senses of the word: “By 2018 a researcher sitting at his console will be able to compile a cross-tabulation of consumer purchases (from store records) by people of low IQ (from school records) who have an unemployed member of the family (from social security records),” Pool predicts. “That is, he will have the technological capacity to do so. Will he have the legal right?” They also predicted global warming and the fact that malevolent humans would abuse any newfangled communications technologies: “Applying technology, like all human efforts, bears bittersweet fruits,"" as one contributor notes.

James Rogers,"A giant fossilized tooth from a massive prehistoric shark has been stolen from a national park in Australia. The 3-inch tooth was taken from an undisclosed location on the remote Ningaloo Coast in Western Australia, the BBC reports. DINO DESTRUCTION: VANDALS WRECK DINOSAUR FOOTPRINT “We are investigating the theft of a 1.6 million year old megalodon (ancient shark) tooth on the Ningaloo Coast,” tweeted the Parks and Wildlife Service of Western Australia's Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions Monday. The tooth was stolen from Cape Range National Park, which is about 690 miles north of Perth. GIGANTIC MONSTER FISH WASHES UP ON AUSTRALIAN SHORE, BAFFLING LOCALS A giant predator, the now-extinct megalodon reached about 60 feet in length. The BBC reports that the megalodon tooth was one of two on the Ningaloo Coast, a vast and strikingly beautiful UNESCO World Heritage site. The megalodon, which is believed by some to be an ancestor of the great white shark, lived from 16 million to 2 million years ago, according to LiveScience. MASSIVE, 6-INCH HAIRY SPIDER SAVED FROM MIND-BLOWING AUSTRALIAN FLOOD Only a handful of people knew the location of the tooth, which was attached to rock, according to the BBC report. Arvid Hogstrom, a spokesman for Western Australia's Department of Environment and Conservation told the BBC that staff hid the tooth with “natural features.” The rare artifact, which was in a “semi-secret” location, was likely removed with a hammer and chisel. A member of the public reported the missing tooth to park rangers on Friday, March 9, according to a Facebook post by the Parks and Wildlife Service. COUSIN OF 'WORLD'S UGLIEST ANIMAL' FOUND NEAR AUSTRALIA Last year, vandals wrecked a dinosaur footprint in rock at a renowned paleontology site in Australia. Although rare, megalodon teeth have been discovered in other parts of the world. A huge megashark tooth, for example, was unearthed in 2016 on North Myrtle Beach, S.C., in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew. In 2013, a Texas couple on vacation in Florida found two matching halves of a megalodon’s tooth. The Associated Press contributed to this article.

Jeffrey Collins / AP,"GEORGETOWN, S.C. — The last community in the way of Hurricane Florence’s floodwaters as they slowly flow to the sea got some good news Wednesday — the predictions aren’t as dire as they once were. Officials originally expected flooding in the worst areas of Georgetown County to be from 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 meters). But the latest forecast lowered that estimate to 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters), according to the county’s Facebook page. Twelve days after the once-fierce hurricane arrived on the coast, and more than a week after it blew north and dissipated, rivers swollen by its relentless rains are still flooding homes and businesses in their paths as they make their way to the sea. The death toll from the storm is still adding up. North Carolina officials blamed the death of a 67-year-old man who fractured his neck cleaning up storm debris Sept. 18 in Craven County on the storm. Florence has killed at least 47 people — 36 in North Carolina; nine in South Carolina; and two in Virginia. The newest predictions from South Carolina officials moved back the peak of the flooding from Thursday to Friday in Georgetown County, where the most swollen waterways — the Waccamaw and Pee Dee rivers — meet three other rivers on their way to the Atlantic Ocean. The forecasts could change again, officials warned, and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster joined the call for residents to not let their guard down. “We ae still in full battle mode in Georgetown County,” McMaster said at a Wednesday news conference. The slow-moving disaster has allowed forecasters to pinpoint exactly who will flood. There have been few rescues or surprises in South Carolina — just black, reeking water slowly seeping in and even more slowly receding. “It’s kind of playing out exactly like we forecast,” said Conway Fire Chief Le Hendrick, who sent firefighters to houses that had never flooded more than a week ago to warn them water was coming. Those same homes were flooded when firefighters surveyed them Monday and Tuesday. There appeared to be good news in Conway too. The Waccamaw River, which flows through the city of 23,000, has spent nearly a day at just over 21.1 feet (6.4 meters), some 6 inches (15 centimeters) under the predicted crest. That could avert potential environmental and transportation problems. The river water was still just inches below a coal ash pond at a closed power plant in Conway, according to the state-owned utility Santee Cooper. The floodwater from the river also had not made it over a temporary barrier hastily built on U.S. Highway 501, the main link to Myrtle Beach. Water is touching the barrier of sand and plastic called the Lifeline, but is still well below the top of it, according to the state Department of Transportation. In North Carolina, residents in Lumberton sued CSX Corp. saying the railroad company refused to give permission to build a temporary sandbag berm under a bridge until an emergency order from the governor at the last minute. The lawsuit said the underpass also created a gap in a levee that made flooding worse during Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and cited a report in May where the state called for a floodgate. CSX issued a statement that it doesn’t comment on pending litigation, but noted the “extraordinary storm” devastated Lumberton and other communities with its flooding. Also in Robeson County, Sheriff Kenneth Sealey said his deputies with help from National Guard high-clearance trucks rescued 400 animals — which included dogs, cats, horses, peacocks, chickens, quail and potbellied pig — stranded on a rooftop by floodwaters in the Orrum community. About 300 more animals were found dead on the property over the weekend, Sealey said. Authorities were meeting with prosecutors Wednesday to see if the people responsible for the animals should face charges. ___ Associated Press writers Jonathan Drew, Gary D. Robertson and Alex Derosier in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.","GEORGETOWN, S.C. — The last community in the way of Hurricane Florence’s floodwaters as they slowly flow to the sea got some good news Wednesday — the predictions aren’t as dire as they once were.

On Saturday evening, the North Carolina Office of the Medical Examiner issued a news release saying that it had confirmed seven storm-related deaths, including a 41-year-old woman and her seven-month-old son who died in Wilmington on Friday when a tree fell on their home. The state also listed the deaths of a 78-year-old man in Lenoir County, who died when he was electrocuted; a 77-year-old man in Lenoir County who fell and died due to a cardiac problem while outside checking on dogs during the storm; an 81-year-old man in Wayne County who fell and struck his head while packing to evacuate; and a husband and wife who died in a house fire in Cumberland County. Local officials have confirmed three additional deaths in North Carolina connected to the storm. The Duplin County Sheriff’s Office said two people died when flash flooding overwhelmed roads on Saturday; in Pender County, officials said that a woman died Friday morning when she was having a heart attack and emergency crews were unable to reach her in time due to downed trees and debris in the road. In South Carolina, a 61-year-old woman was killed late Friday when the vehicle she was driving struck a tree, according to Gov.

Inside, Lisa Skipper was packing valuables in trash bags that she and her husband, Ricky, were about to load into a U-Haul van parked outside. Everything else they couldn’t bring – pots, pans, table lamps, pantry items, bottles of alcohol and others – was arranged on the kitchen counter, where floodwaters are less likely to reach them. The Waccamaw is expected to rise significantly over the next few days, as Tropical Storm Florence continues to dump rain over the Carolinas. Residents here also expect that rain falling on the southern half of North Carolina will stream to the south through the 140-mile-long river, which flows through both states. The National Weather Service forecasts that the river will rise to a little over 19 feet by Wednesday, about a foot higher than the record set by Hurricane Matthew in 2016. That year, a foot and a half of water flowed into the Skippers’ home. The house, built in the early 1960s, belongs to Ricky Skipper’s father, Earl, who evacuated earlier this week. His son and daughter-in-law, who live in a raised house down the street, stopped by to prepare his home for what they believe would be worse flooding they have seen in years. Sentimental items that belonged to Earl Skipper’s late wife, Frances, have been moved to a storage unit. Ricky Skipper said they built new floors in his father’s house right before Hurricane Matthew hit – only to replace them afterward. Now, they expect they will have to do the same again. But Earl Skipper loves living in the house because his wife loved it, Lisa Skipper said. He loves living near the river because his wife found delight in fishing it. “She loved this river,” Lisa said, as she looked out the windows in the nearly empty living room. “She lived on this river for a long time.” And so, after the waters rise and recede, the Skippers will return to this home by the river, as they always have. — Kristine Phillips Saturday 5:11 p.m.: Sesame Street tries to provide emotional shelter for kids affected by storm For thousands of children who have been affected by Florence or have watched menacing reports of whipping winds and mass flooding, the Weather Channel and Sesame Workshop have joined to help parents comfort their children and offer hope for the “adventure” that unfolds when neighborhoods rebuild. In a video accessible here, Elmo joined Weather Channel anchor Stephanie Abrams to talk about what hurricanes are — “a very strong storm with lots and lots of rain and wind,” and why they can feel so stressful and scary. They also demonstrate how to make a disaster kit — with snacks, a juice box and their favorite toy — and whom to turn to for help in an emergency. “The most important thing is to stay safe and to stay together,” Abrams says. The video is part of Sesame Workshop’s “Sesame Street in Communities” initiative, helping parents speak with their kids about tough topics, such as divorce. — Emily Wax-Thibodeaux Saturday 3:59 p.m.: Transportation official: Out-of-state drivers should avoid North Carolina altogether The head of the North Carolina Department of Transportation made a startling plea Saturday afternoon, asking travelers from the north and south to avoid the state entirely. “We are asking those that would be traveling through North Carolina to avoid North Carolina,” Jim Trogdon said. “This is what we need to do today just to make sure that motorists are safe.” Trogdon suggested that travelers essentially go around the state, detouring through Virginia, Tennessee and Georgia, if necessary. Mainly, he said he wanted to prevent drivers from getting stranded amid rising floodwaters and to keep roads as clear as possible for emergency workers. He said roads throughout the state were rapidly continuing to flood — the number of closures nearly doubled during the span of a few hours Saturday. Even major arteries such as Interstates 40 and 95 have been affected, and the situation is likely to worsen. “Road conditions across nearly all of our state will rapidly deteriorating in coming days,” Trogdon said. He noted that in his nearly three decades with the department, “I have never seen flash flooding like this occur in our state.” Gov. Roy Cooper echoed calls for drivers — whether from North Carolina or elsewhere — to stay off the roads as much as possible. “All roads in the state are at risk of floods,” Cooper said at an afternoon news conference. “Roads you think may be safe can be washed away in a matter of minutes.” — Brady Dennis Saturday 2:55 p.m.: South Carolina reports first fatality linked to Florence A 61-year-old woman died late Friday after crashing into a tree that had fallen across Highway 18 in South Carolina, becoming the state’s first fatality linked to Florence. Officials said Amber Dawn Lee, of Union, hit the tree around 9:40 p.m., not long after it was felled by the storm’s winds. The area is in upstate South Carolina, far from the coast. “Our prayers and hearts go out to her family and loved ones,” Gov. Henry McMaster (R) said at a news conference Saturday afternoon. “We are mighty sorry.” Capt. Kelley Hughes of the S.C. Highway Patrol said in an interview that residents nearby tried warning drivers about the fallen tree, which was difficult to see in the darkness. He said Lee died at the scene. There were no passengers with her in the car. Joel Morris, who lives near the scene of the accident, told a local television station, WYFF, that he saw the tree fall and was able to signal one driver to turn around. He told the station that when he saw Lee’s pickup approaching, he stood in the road and flashed his flashlight but was unable to get her to stop. The pickup slammed into the tree, which Hughes said was suspended about six feet above the road. The accident brings the death toll from Florence to at least six. Five deaths in North Carolina also have been attributed to the storm. — Brady Dennis Saturday 2:10 p.m.: A shelter springs a leak, a Waffle House offers comfort in Wilmington, N.C. The roof of a shelter housing about 200 people in Wilmington, N.C., sprung a leak Friday during the height of Florence and showered residents and their dogs with rain. New Hanover County officials said they evacuated about 150 residents to another shelter Saturday morning because it was too dangerous to do so during the height of the storm. About 50 chose to stay because the shelter, at Trask Middle School, accepts pets while other shelters do not. About 600 people are staying in local shelters. “We made what I think is the right decision to not relocate people during the peak of the storm,” said Chris Coudriet, the county manager. “There is no structural problem with the building. Is it wet? Yes, but the building itself is structurally sound.” Rain continues to pour over this region, where officials are warning that 14 more inches, on top of the 10 to 12 inches that have already fallen, are expected in the next 48 hours. The Cape Fear River is expected to crest late Monday or Tuesday, at a historic 25.8 feet. County and local officials said at a news conference that they are pleased with the state and federal response, but they also pleaded that those agencies get their teams to the Wilmington area as soon as possible, before the flooding worsens. “We’re just now entering the thick of it,” said New Hanover County Commission Chairman Woody White. “Overall, we survived this … but we’re still in the middle of it.” Wrightsville Beach Mayor Bill Blair said his community suffered significant damage, “but the structural damage is not as severe as it looks” on social media. Access to the popular beach community is still limited to police, fire, government and repair crews. Blair said teams are working to get water and sewer facilities open again. In Wilmington proper, fallen trees and power lines block many roads, and traffic lights are out virtually everywhere. About 112,000 people, out of 127,000 locally, remain without power, and Duke Energy officials warned Friday that it may be weeks before power is fully restored. Residents, wrestling with cabin fever after a full day indoors, began venturing out despite the pleas of officials to keep off the roads. At one of the very few businesses open Saturday, nearly two dozen people lined up outside a Waffle House on Market Street, seeking hot food and a chance to get outside. “My kids are tired of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,” said April Bellamy, 38. — Patricia Sullivan Saturday 1:23 p.m.: “The worst is yet to come.” As rivers rise, a new round of mandatory evacuations. Ahead of what officials fear will be more than 45 inches of rain in parts of North Carolina, at least three local governments want residents to seek safer ground. Cumberland County, the city of Fayetteville and the town of Wade have issued a mandatory evacuation order for all people living within one mile of the banks of the Cape Fear River and the Little River within Cumberland County “to minimize the imminent threat of injury or loss of life.” “There is the potential for life-threatening flooding, and those who reside in the area face imminent danger from the flood waters that will soon arrive,” Fayetteville city spokesman Nathan Walls said in a statement. “While the storm appears on the surface to be not as intense as expected, this is not the case. The worst is yet to come, as the flood waters from other areas are accumulating north of the county and filling the river basins beyond their capacities.” Walls said people who fail to heed the evacuation order “do so at their own risk,” as first responders might not be able to reach flooded areas in case of an emergency. “This one is deadly,” Fayetteville Mayor Mitch Colvin warned Saturday, saying people near the evacuation zones “have to get out or risk being stuck — no one may be able to come and get you for days.” Police and firefighters are going through the neighborhoods at risk and explaining why folks have to leave, he said. “We’re trying to make it totally clear that this is deadly,” Colvin said in a phone interview. “At end of day, we can’t force folks to leave, but we are letting them know if they don’t get out they are not going to get help for some time and we can’t put our first responders in that kind of danger. He said that residents went “through this trauma in 2016 during Hurricane Matthew when the river crested at 52 inches” and that four people died during flash flooding. “This is an even greater risk,” Colvin said. The warnings echo those from state leaders earlier Saturday urging residents that the most devastating effects from Florence could unfold in coming days as the threat of flooding grows. The state has asked residents to monitor this site, which shows which rivers are rising and allows people to sign up for flood alerts. *****MANDATORY EVACUATIONS***** There is a mandatory evacuation in place for citizens of Cumberland County, City of Fayetteville, and the town of Wade. All residents within one mile of the banks of the Cape Fear and Little River should leave IMMEDIATELY pic.twitter.com/pAzFhP2otZ — Fayetteville Police (@FayettevillePD) September 15, 2018 — Emily Wax-Thibodeaux and Brady Dennis Saturday 12:41 p.m.: At one hotel, hospitality amid the worries: “When you’re under our umbrella, we take care of you.” As soon as Florence reached Robeson County, about 75 miles inland, on Friday afternoon, essential services began to fall like dominoes. Lights flickered, then went out. The county issued an advisory to boil all water. Most people lost cellphone service — and, with it, their connection to the outside world. But loss of electricity couldn’t stop Southern hospitality. At 9 a.m. Saturday, staff at the Holiday Inn Express in Pembroke, N.C., went room to room informing guests that breakfast was served. The guests — several of them locals who had been flooded during Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and decided not to chance staying in their homes through another storm — wandered downstairs to find a buffet of scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, bacon, sausage and grits. Samantha Locklear, the housekeeper, had brought all the food from home and cooked it on a gas grill. “When you’re under our umbrella,” said Tiffany Booth, the hotel’s manager, “we take care of you.” Guests ate at tables illuminated by tea lights, talking quietly about the storm. Melinda Jacobs had been awake almost the whole night, frightened by the howling wind and pictures posted by friends on Facebook of flooded roads, signs ripped off familiar storefronts and trees limbs on top of crushed cars. “I thought, ‘I don’t understand how Noah made it through 40 days and 40 nights like this,’” she said. This summer, she had moved in with relatives who live near the beach in Ocean Isle, one of the communities under mandatory-evacuation orders. Early reports from the coast suggest that her town experienced 70 mph winds and several feet of storm surge, but she doesn’t know how her home fared. Sunday is Jacobs’s 42nd birthday. She has no idea where she will be or what she will still have. “It’s nerve-racking,” she said, “not knowing how everybody is, wondering if I got a place to go back to.” — Sarah Kaplan Saturday 12:07 p.m.: For one couple and two pets, an escape from rising floodwaters Denise and Jerry Railling had stayed in their one-story home in New Bern, N.C., even as the water inside reached their knees. On Saturday, a rescuer brought Denise out first, seated at the front of a water scooter, cradling her cat, Boo Boo, in a thick tan blanket. Denise was barefoot. She said she had done a lot of praying over the past few days. “We’ll find some clothes for you, some hot food,” said Ryan Bartholomew, a volunteer rescuer who’d come from Sacramento. Denise’s husband came next, wearing a pair of baby-blue Crocs. “We decided to get out when they said there was sewage in the water,” Jerry said. On dry land, he leaned against his Chevy SUV, which he’d parked on higher ground Wednesday afternoon. Then the rescue team made one last trip into his home, this time to fetch the dog, Snookie, who rode on the water scooter with a bright-red life jacket around her neck. Jerry said he couldn’t find the words to describe what he saw. Then he chose two: “Extreme chaos.” “Just look,” he said. — Rachel Siegel Saturday 11:35 a.m.: Florence breaks record in North Carolina for most rain in a single storm — 30 inches and counting More than 30 inches of rain have fallen in North Carolina, according to preliminary reports submitted to the National Weather Service, which would shatter the statewide storm rainfall record of 24.06 inches set during Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Flash-flood emergencies — the most critical category of flood warning — have been in effect for several counties since Friday night. Up to 50 inches of rain could fall through Sunday in southeast North Carolina, which is coming into focus as ground zero for Florence’s most devastating effects. A citizen weather observer posted a total of 30.58 inches of rain in Swansboro, which is in Onslow County. If verified, the amount would be a state record for a tropical storm or hurricane and would shatter the old record of 24 inches — set near Wilmington during Floyd. Many locations in southeast North Carolina are likely to smash this old record by the time the rain ends. The Capital Weather Gang reports: Despite its weakened status to a tropical storm, Florence has deluged parts of the North Carolina coastline with torrential and historic amounts of rain. Many areas in southeastern North Carolina have endured 15 to 30 inches of rain and up to 15 more could fall. The rain is resulting in catastrophic flooding in southeast North Carolina that is spreading into the interior, reaching even into the population centers of Raleigh and Charlotte. Already, the event has broken the state’s record for most rain ever observed in a tropical storm or hurricane, with a preliminary report of over 30 inches. The floodwaters are expected to push many rivers to all-time-high levels and, toward the mountains of western North Carolina and southwest Virginia, may spur life-threatening landslides. For more details, click here. — Brady Dennis and Angela Fritz Saturday 11:15 a.m.: N.C. governor: “Know that the water is rising fast.” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) warned Saturday morning that while the most damaging winds of Hurricane Florence have subsided, the most serious threat from the storm remains: water. “Know that the water is rising fast — everywhere, even in places that don’t usually flood,” Cooper said at a late-morning news conference, adding that Florence is in the process of dropping “epic” amounts of rainfall on the state. He also said that the worst effects probably lie ahead, as rivers will continue to rise and crest even after the storm has passed. Cooper warned residents across much of the state — from Fayetteville in the east to Asheville in the west — not to grow complacent. “Many people who think the storms have missed them have yet to see its threat,” he said, adding that officials “expect flooding and potential landslides beginning tonight and continuing into Monday.” Cooper and the state’s transportation director, James H. Trogdon III, pleaded with residents to stay off roads, warning that conditions would rapidly deteriorate as floodwaters rise. Trogdon said major roads in many counties already are impassable, and he expects a “significant” number of road closures in coming days. — Brady Dennis Saturday 10:37 a.m.: In a quiet beach town, hunting sea shells and waiting for Florence to leave The streets of Myrtle Beach remained deserted and businesses there remained closed Saturday morning as city and county officials urged people to stay in emergency shelters and off the roads. This popular tourist spot on the South Carolina shore has remained largely unscathed by Florence, unlike parts of North Carolina. The ocean is roiling, but floods have so far spared the streets near the shore. Joe Gacioch, 30, and his girlfriend, Ashley Gash, 23, who live a few miles inland and decided to stay put despite evacuation orders, drove to the beach to collect sea shells. They parked at the empty boardwalk near the restaurant where Gash works. “I got my shells!” Gash said, holding up a Ziplock bag. Gacioch said that he doesn’t think the rain is as bad as had been forecast and that local and state officials may have overreacted by evacuating much of the city. “But again, I understand why they did that. They’re concerned for people’s safety,” he said. “The governor, he did what he had to do. He’s supposed to make sure everybody’s safe.” Still, city officials insisted that the storm is far from over. Overnight, some city roadways were flooded and there were 60 reports of property damage, including downed trees and power lines and broken traffic lights. But so far, officials said, the damage remains minimal. “We want [people] to [be] back home as quickly as possible,” the city said in a Facebook post. “But first, Florence has to leave.” — Kristine Phillips Saturday 10:07 a.m.: “There’s a lot of rain to come,” FEMA warns While Florence’s wind speeds have lessened during its plodding crawl through the Carolinas, authorities have repeatedly warned residents not to take this as a sign that the danger has passed. “The way a hurricane is classified is based on the wind,” FEMA Associate Administrator Jeff Byard said at a briefing Saturday morning. “Wind can hurt you... but it is the water, it’s the surge, it’s the rain that effects and can kill you more than the wind can in a hurricane.” Byard’s message has been one echoed repeatedly by state and federal authorities in recent days, amid the downgrading of Florence as its wind speed declined, even as it still created threats of intense flooding and storm surge. “This is a massive storm that has put a lot of rain and a lot of water on our coast, inland,” Byard said. “There’s a lot of rain to come, there’s a lot of rain that’s fallen.” As he spoke, Florence was continuing its slow churn across South Carolina, a steady path that forecasts said it would continue throughout Saturday. “This thing will not move up the coast, it will not get out of the way, and we continue to just get copious amounts of rain,” Byard said. The first two questions at Saturday’s briefing were about FEMA Administrator William “Brock” Long, who was not present but has been under scrutiny this week amid an internal investigation of his use of government vehicles. Byard, asked whether Long will remain in his post, said: “Our administrator’s our administrator. He’s given our team very clear guidance that the focus is Florence. I want to make sure I echo that... FEMA is clearly engaged, we know where our focus needs to be, and that is on the response and recovery.” — Mark Berman Saturday 8:52 a.m.: Trump approves disaster declaration for North Carolina The White House announced Saturday morning that President Trump had approved a disaster declaration for North Carolina a day earlier, an order that opens up federal funding, including housing and home repair grants. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) had on Thursday requested such a declaration, writing in the request that officials in his state “have been overwhelmed in preparing for and the expected severity from the hurricane.” In a statement on Thursday announcing his request, Cooper said: “We know this massive storm will cause incredible damage and I’m asking Washington to act quickly so federal recovery help can come as soon as possible.” — Mark Berman Saturday 8:40 a.m.: 385 rescued amid flooding in New Bern, city says This city took a significant hit from Florence in the storm’s early hours, with intense flooding prompting hundreds of rescues in the city, which has a downtown flanked by two rivers. As of Saturday morning, 385 people had been rescued, according to Colleen Roberts, a spokeswoman for the city. She said shortly after 8 a.m. that authorities were working to determine how many people still need to be rescued; the rescue teams working Saturday were being pulled back in while they figure out how many people need to be saved, Roberts said. [ How water damages a flooded house — and what can be saved ] More than 1,200 people were in shelters Saturday morning, Roberts said, adding that the 24-hour curfew there remains in place. Sheena Jordan said the storm had a hellish impact on her neighborhood in New Bern. She said there’s flooding in her backyard, but she doesn’t know how deep. She has a gallon of drinkable water in her home, but she doesn’t know how long it will last between four people. She knows the water in New Bern will continue to rise, but she doesn’t know how she’d get to a shelter if she needed to leave. Jordan left her car at the town’s DoubleTree hotel, where she works as a housekeeper. She said she doesn’t know when her power went out or when she’ll get her next paycheck. As she sat on her porch, her nephew darted out the front door and ran toward the playground down the street. The water there was so high that he couldn’t see the bottom end of the seesaw. Not long after New Bern was hit by rising waters, the panicked calls began as people began seeking rescue, a plight that received national attention. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D), addressing the storm’s impact on Friday morning, highlighted what had happened there, saying that “the storm surge alone has overwhelmed the city of New Bern.” — Mark Berman in Washington and Rachel Siegel in New Bern. Saturday 8:14 a.m.: Florence “slowly” moving across South Carolina Tropical Storm Florence was “moving slowly across eastern South Carolina” on Saturday morning, producing “catastrophic flooding” in the Carolinas as it dumped still more rain across the region, according to the National Hurricane Center. According to the center’s morning bulletin, Florence is expected to drop intense rain across swaths of both North Carolina and South Carolina, with up to 30 or 40 inches forecast in some coastal areas. “This rainfall will continue to produce catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding,” the center said. By midnight Saturday, nearly two feet of rain was reported in Newport, N.C., the center reported. Even away from the most intense reach of the storm, parts of both Carolinas and Virginia could see up to 15 inches of rainfall. Storm surge also poses a continuing danger of flooding areas that would otherwise be dry, according to the bulletin. Florence’s wind speed has decreased, causing the system to be downgraded to a tropical storm, but tropical-storm-force winds are still extending up to 175 miles from its center. Gusts of 51 mph have been reported in North Carolina, the bulletin said. The storm continues moving west at a grinding, slow pace, and that plodding movement will continue throughout Saturday, according to the hurricane center. — Mark Berman Saturday 6:58 a.m.: Nearly 1 million power outages in the Carolinas As the sun rose over the Carolinas on Saturday morning, nearly a million power outages were reported across North Carolina and South Carolina, according to state officials. These outages had occurred as the storm’s assault continued Saturday, with Florence dumping still more rain and bringing yet more lashing winds to both states. More than 951,000 power outages were logged in both states, officials said, a number that ticked up in the hours before dawn. Most of those outages were reported in North Carolina, according to that state’s Department of Public Safety. The agency said 786,000 lacked power, with the highest concentration of outages in a handful of counties, including New Hanover, Brunswick, Onslow, Carteret, Cumberland, Robeson, Sampson and Wake. In South Carolina, the Division of Emergency Management said early Saturday that more than 165,000 households lacked power because of the storm. Power company officials warned this week that as many as 3 million people could lose power because of the storm, while authorities have cautioned residents to expect outages that could linger for days. — Mark Berman [ Hundreds rescued in town of New Bern as Hurricane Florence batters North Carolina coast ] Saturday 6:35 a.m.: Hurricane evacuees face long journeys, lengthy stays in search for safety For the people who left home because of Florence, filling shelters in the Southeast, these evacuations often mean the beginning of long, difficult journeys: By the time Florence bore down on the Carolinas on Friday, bringing 100-mph winds, more than 10 feet of storm surge and disastrous amounts of rain, about 20,000 people had sought refuge at one of 200 Red Cross shelters across the region, said Rebecca Torriani, a regional spokeswoman for the organization. Across the Carolinas and Georgia, several other large public facilities and makeshift camps opened to serve those who had fled their homes. Some patients had heart ailments, some were pregnant, some needed constant medication. Ages range from a days-old infant to a 100-year-old woman, said Amy Eathington, a retired nurse and Red Cross volunteer. “It’s very similar to working in an emergency room,” Eathington said. Head here to read more. Saturday 5:50 a.m. : Rain is picking up along North Carolina’s southeastern coast, as heavy bands of precipitation move inland off the Atlantic with Tropical Storm Florence. The National Weather Service says the heavy rainfall will add an additional 6 to 10 inches to these areas, exacerbating already serious flooding, by 11 a.m. Saturday. “Life-threatening storm surge” is expected to continue along portions of the North Carolina coast today, and “life-threatening, catastrophic flash floods and prolonged, significant river flooding” will go on for days, threatening areas from the coast west into the central Appalachian Mountains, where landslides are also possible. Wind is also picking up in some areas of the North and South Carolina coast, and tornado watches and warnings are in effect across several counties. There are now 780,964 people without power in North Carolina, according to the state’s Department of Public Safety. — Abigail Hauslohner Saturday 4:30 a.m.: Rivers are rising and nearly a million households have lost power Rivers are rising across North and South Carolina, with several expected to crest higher than they did two years ago in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, leaving standing floodwater in some rural communities for weeks. The National Weather Service has announced more flash flood emergencies in Onslow and Duplin counties in North Carolina. More than 940,000 households are without power across North and South Carolina, according to the North Carolina Department of Public Safety and South Carolina’s Division of Emergency Management. More than 80 percent of the outages so far are in North Carolina. — Abigail Hauslohner Saturday 2:30 a.m.: New daily rainfall record in Fayetteville, N.C. The National Weather Service has reported a new daily rainfall record of 3.11 inches set at Fayetteville Regional Airport, about 100 miles inland from the coast, on the banks of the Cape Fear River.

Sustained winds were down to 35 mph with the storm starting to speed up a little and move to the west at 8 mph. The center was located approximately 20 miles southwest of Columbia, South Carolina, as of 5 a.m. The storm came ashore as Hurricane Florence on Friday morning at about 7 a.m. with wind speeds of 90 mph. A member of the US Coast Guard walks down Mill Creek Road checking houses after tropical storm Florence hit Newport N.C., Saturday, Sept. 15, 2018. Florence has been blamed for 13 deaths in the Carolinas. Hundreds of water rescues have been carried out by local authorities, the Cajun Navy volunteers and the U.S. Coast Guard since Friday morning. Over 770,000 customers were still without power as of Saturday night. Despite the decrease in wind speeds, heavy rains still a pose a major flooding threat to both North and South Carolina. ""[Florence] will produce catastrophic flooding over parts of North and South Carolina for some time,"" Steve Goldstein, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's liaison to FEMA, said Saturday. Florence has dropped a tremendous amount of rain in eastern North Carolina, with a widespread 20 to 30 inches reported already. Radar is estimating that some areas between Wilmington and New Bern, North Carolina, have received over 30 inches of rain.

Harvey dropped 60.58 inches of rain last year in Texas, setting the state’s new record. Lane just last month dropped a maximum of 52.02 inches of rain in Hawaii, breaking the state record. The 30.59 inches that have fallen in Swansboro sets a new record for North Carolina. Florence also currently stands as the sixth-highest tropical cyclone rainfall total across the U.S. for records dating back to 1950. Heavy rain spreads inland Heavy rains bands are still coming onshore in eastern South Carolina and North Carolina on Sunday morning. Some of the heavier bands have shifted toward Fayetteville, Charlotte and Raleigh. SLIDESHOW: PHOTOS: Hurricane Florence batters the East Coast Torrential rain is causing inland flooding with major roadways, including large portions of I-95, closed. An additional 6 to 10 inches of rain is still possible along the southeast border of North Carolina and South Carolina. Life-threatening, catastrophic flash flooding is likely over the southern to central Appalachians from western North Carolina into western Virginia and eastern West Virginia. Torrential rain will cause flash flooding and increase the risk for landslides in the higher terrains. River flooding an issue next Torrential rain from Florence is currently causing rapid rises in area rivers. Major river flooding is expected on some rivers from southern Virginia to northern South Carolina, including most of North Carolina. The Lumber River, near Lumberton, North Carolina, will rise into major flood stage Sunday morning. It is expected to reach a level very near the record Hurricane Matthew set in 2016. Mandatory evacuations were issued for South Lumberton on Saturday. Jeff Pyron, left, and Daniel Lilly cover Lilly's roof after Hurricane Florence hit Davis N.C., Saturday, Sept. 15, 2018. The town had 4 1/2 feet of storm surge. The Northeast Cape Fear River, near Chinquapin, North Carolina, will rise above record flood levels set by Hurricane Floyd in 1999. This will cause devastating flooding across much of Onslow County with travel made impossible and many homes completely flooded. The Neuse River, both near Goldsboro and Kinston, North Carolina, will reach major flood stage late Sunday and into Monday. The Waccamaw River, near Conway, South Carolina, will rise near record levels by the end of the week. Resident Joseph Eudi looks at flood debris and storm damage from Hurricane Florence at a home on East Front Street in New Bern, N.C., Saturday, Sept. 15, 2018. Florence is still moving very slowly inland. The track shows Florence moving west through Sunday, and then gradually turning north by Monday. Florence will likely become a remnant low within 36 hours. Even though Florence is weakening, it will still bring significant rainfall inland to the Appalachians before moving toward the Northeast on Tuesday.

"USA TODAY, Dalvin Brown and Jorge L. Ortiz, USA TODAY","Coastal properties took a beating as Hurricane Michael roared ashore along the Florida Panhandle. USA TODAY The storm surge from Hurricane Michael pushes into the homes four hours prior to high tide on October 10, 2018 in the Florida Panhandle community of Shell Point Beach, Florida. (Photo: Mark Wallheiser, Getty Images) The strongest hurricane to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history blew away roofs and snapped trees with winds of up to 155 mph, just two short of a Category 5. And the news about Michael, now downgraded to a tropical storm, is about to get worse, as residents return to find their homes flooded by storm surge that reached 14 feet. Though a hurricanes power is typically measured by its winds, the storm surge is often just as destructive and even deadlier, accounting for about half the hurricane-related fatalities in the U.S. since 1970 and the majority of the 1,200 deaths caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. For folks dealing with flooding, what to do after the hurricane has passed can be as important as pre-storm preparations. Here are the key steps to take: TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF ""Make sure you're emotionally OK,"" said Elaina Sutley, assistant professor of structural engineering at the University of Kansas. ""Only then should you start assessing any structural damage."" What materials do I need? Make sure you have knee-high rubber boots, rubber gloves, long-sleeve clothing, a respirator, a flashlight, a camera and liquid bleach. Where do I start? Start by turning off any gas or power to prevent explosions or electrocution. Then begin drying out your home and addressing the structural damage such as a wall collapse or sinking ceilings. And remember: There may still be water left either in the basement or seeping from soaked furniture. Avoid coming in direct contact with any water, which may have been exposed to sewage, debris or dead animals. And let the house air out. ""You need to open up windows and doors. Let things dry out,"" Sutley said. Fans and dehumidifiers can help speed up the drying process. While everything dries, which can take a few days, homeowners are encouraged to throw out any food left in the home along with any absorbent material that has come in contact with water. And wash dinnerware, glasses and flatware before using them again. ""If there was saltwater flooding, there might be corrosion, so get an electrician to look at that,"" said Jeffrey Schlegelmilch of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. ""Even if it's not salt water, things could still be dangerous. Fact-check with a professional before plugging anything in."" What do I do with damaged items? Coastal areas that have experienced floods in the past will likely have protocols for picking up and handling debris such as drywall and furniture. To prevent the spread of mold and mildew, you may also have to remove flooring and insulation. Ideally, have a professional company do a mold assessment soon after the flooding to help you decide what items must be discarded and what can be saved. Time is of the essence because mold can develop within 24 hours. What can I keep? Family heirlooms, jewelry, photographs and other valuables can be air-dried and saved. Clean and disinfect them if they came in contact with floodwater. What should I avoid? Most of all, standing water, which is likely to be contaminated. But also look out for wildlife like snakes, raccoons or any critters trapped in your home brought in by the floodwaters. What happens if I wait? ""If your home is just left to sit, it will continue to deteriorate, and it becomes even more of a health threat,"" Schlegelmilch said. In other words, act now. TAKING CARE OF YOUR WALLET The sooner homeowners file claims with an insurance agency or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the faster a resolution can be reached. However, traditional homeowner policies don't cover flooding. Only flood insurance policies reimburse families for water damage caused by flooding. ""After Hurricane Matthew hit the southeastern United States, I worked on a project where we spoke to households and businesses about receiving assistance from their insurance or FEMA,"" Sutley said. ""Most people who had insurance and filed a claim received help within 30 days. Most people who applied for FEMA had received it within a month. What do I need? Insurance documents, home deeds and your Social Security card can get you started on making an insurance claim. Photos and videos of the property both before and after the flood are also essential, since recovery agencies will likely request proof of the damage. Where do I start? It's important to contact your insurance agency before you remove anything from your home. ""Insurance companies sometimes want to send someone down to investigate before anything is taken out,"" Schlegelmilch said. After contacting your insurance company, work can begin. Homeowners are encouraged to remove any carpet or drywall that has come in contact with water before mold starts to form. ""You don't want just to get surfaces to look clean; you want to make sure that there aren't any living mold spores,"" said Schlegelmilch, who recommended seeking guidance on which bleach to use from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What if I don't have insurance? It's pretty common for people not to have flood insurance, no matter their income level. In coastal regions, it may be mandatory. But for those who live further inland, there are often local aid options. ""Find out what types of public assistance is available in your area,"" Schlegelmilch said. ""There are a lot of charities that pop up to help people get back in their homes. Some move people to the top of the list who are low-income or have disabilities."" To find out if you qualify for assistance or for more information, check FEMA's website disasterassistance.gov.

Steve Ellis,"Hazel. Camille. Hugo. Andrew. Floyd. Isabel. Katrina. Ike. Sandy. Matthew. Harvey. Irma. Maria. The names are different, but the results are the same. Costly damage and loss of life from hurricanes. The Carolinas are facing the latest in this lineage : Florence. Another thing that hasn’t changed much, but should — federal policies and programs to prepare, mitigate, and recover from these inevitable disasters. Read the latest advisory on Hurricane Florence. As the costs keep piling up, we cannot afford business as usual. Four of the costliest hurricanes in history (totaling $336 billion) have happened this decade. The cost leader ( Katrina — $161 billion ) was just 13 years ago. And that nearly $500 billion in loss doesn’t include the immeasurable damage inflicted from thousands of lives cut short. Yet despite this, federal disaster policies remain mired in the past. Uncle Sam is all too willing to whip out the checkbook without any thought to accountability and change. Lawmakers don’t hold the executive branch accountable for where the funds are going. No one can tell you what happened with all the Superstorm Sandy funding, the same is true with Harvey and other hurricanes. The saying about the “fog of war” applies to the fog of disaster as well. And instead of an institutional PTSD, there is institutional amnesia. It’s time to think critically about what disaster spending is needed and how it should be treated in the budget. There are legitimate, immediate disaster costs that are covered by the Disaster Relief Fund, such as response, assistance to individuals, and debris removal. These funds are available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency as soon as the president declares a “major disaster.” For many disasters, the DRF funds are adequate for the federal response. Others require additional funds on an emergency basis. But unlike after Harvey and Sandy, they should be appropriated out over time as needs become clear and plans are put in place. Otherwise, huge wads of cash are more likely to be wasted and misdirected. Disasters are also the time to bring clarity to risks and focus to solutions. Every disaster is an opportunity — a tragic opportunity, but an opportunity nonetheless — to make communities less vulnerable and more resilient. There are a number of common-sense steps we should follow to ensure Washington effectively responds to this latest tragedy without making things worse. Reform the National Flood Insurance Program Reduce risks instead of increasing them. That means we need to improve mapping so homeowners know the risks they face. Insurance premium rates need to be based on these actual risks. Public subsidies can be used to help those who cannot afford insurance, but subsidies must be means tested. And clearly informing insurance policy holders of the subsidy helps communicate risk. It could be something as simple as a bill stating your premium is ($1,000 – government subsidy of $700 = you pay $300). It means policy makers must get out of the way of development of private-market alternatives. The sad truth is many, and likely the majority, of people that Hurricane Florence floods out of their homes don’t have flood insurance. There are 4.6 million housing units in the state but North Carolinians have only 134,306 NFIP policies insuring $33.7 billion worth of property. South Carolinians have 2.3 million housing units, but only 204,342 policies covering $53.9 billion. We saw last year in Houston that many people who got flooded didn’t have insurance, and North Carolina had a similar experience with Hurricane Matthew two years ago. But this is the devastating, ruinous blow: According to FEMA, after heavy rainfall in Baton Rouge, the average homeowner with flood insurance coverage got $86,500 to rebuild, the average person without got only $9,100 in individual disaster assistance. Rebuild communities better Communities can’t simply be rebuilt to pre-disaster conditions. Disasters reveal and underline vulnerability. So rebuild better. That means elevating structures, rebuilding outside the floodplain, and relocations that mitigate risk community-wide. If states and communities want federal support they should be required to build so they survive future disasters better and with less damage. We know there is a risk of flooding, so build to withstand that, at least. If not more. The Trump administration has continued an Obama administration effort known as the Federal Floodplain Risk Management Standard, to move in this direction. That needs to be expanded. And communities need to step up in protecting themselves. Take the time to get it right There is a difference between immediate need and rebuilding. And after large disasters there is, understandably, a louder and more urgent call for emergency spending. But taxpayer dollars aren’t endless. Debts have to be paid. Taxpayers, disaster-affected communities, and people far removed from the Carolinas who may be the next victim of a devastating flood, wildfire, earthquake, or other natural disaster can’t afford to let lawmakers take advantage of our compassion and desire to help our fellow citizens by loading up any disaster spending bills with extraneous items. Right now communities in the path of Hurricane Florence need assistance. And they’ll get it. But when the disaster has passed and the media and Congress have moved on, what we all need is clarity and certainty. Clarity as to the risks we actually face, and the tools we have to reduce these risks. Clarity as to the roles of individuals, communities, and federal taxpayers in deploying and paying for these tools. And certainty that federal disaster policy will be a tool to protect communities and finally put an end to business as usual. Steve Ellis is executive vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.","Every year, another disaster strikes.

"AP, AP","No. 3 Georgia (1-0, 0-0 SEC) at No. 24 South Carolina (1-0, 0-0), 3:30 p.m. ET (CBS) Line: Georgia by 9½. Series Record: Georgia leads 50-18-2. WHAT'S AT STAKE? The winner gets early control of the Southeastern Conference Eastern Division. The Bulldogs have not lost to South Carolina since 2014 and would love to continue that dominance as they try for another league title and trip to the College Football Playoff. The Gamecocks returned to the Top 25 for the first time in four years this past week. They hope to validate that inclusion with a victory. KEY MATCHUP QB Jake Fromm of Georgia vs. QB Jake Bentley of South Carolina. The two passers had big days in their opener as both came into the season with lofty expectations. Whoever best plays turnover-free football will likely come out on top. PLAYERS TO WATCH Georgia: RBs D'Andre Swift and Elijah Holyfield: The sophomore Swift and the junior Holyfield have to step in for the Bulldogs NFL runners from a year ago in Nick Chubb and Sony Michel. Swift got the start against Austin Peay and ran for 43 yards on eight carries. Holyfield had 24 yards on five carries. Both scored TDs. South Carolina: WR Deebo Samuel. He was the Gamecocks most dynamic playmaker a year ago until he got hurt in the third game and missed the rest of the season. A healthy Samuel returned last week and had seven catches for 56 yards, including a one-handed grab in the end zone. FACTS &amp; FIGURES Georgia has won the past three games in the series, including a 52-20 victory in 2015 where quarterback Greyson Lambert set an NCAA record by completing 24 of 25 passes (96 percent).... Two years ago, this game at Williams-Brice Stadium was moved to an NFL Sunday because of Hurricane Matthew. Georgia won 28-14 as it gained 326 yards on the ground.... South Carolina coach Will Muschamp is 1-5 against his alma mater, Georgia... Georgia ranked fourth best in the country at scoring from 20 yards and in last year, getting points on 53 of 55 trips.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Why do people ignore hurricane warnings? Hurricane Florence has been downgraded to a category two storm as it approaches the US but officials still warn of a ""disaster at the doorstep"". Florence's winds may have dropped to 110mph (175km/h) but its slow-moving nature could mean it lingers for days, bringing catastrophic flooding. Some 10 million people are now under some form of storm watch. Florence may now be heading further south, and Georgia is the latest state to declare an emergency. It joins North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and Washington DC. As of 23:00 Eastern Daylight Time on Wednesday (03:00 GMT Thursday), Florence was 280 miles (455km) south-east of Wilmington in North Carolina, the latest National Hurricane Centre advisory says. Forecasters have adjusted the predicted path of Florence. It is now expected to make landfall a little further south, on the Carolinas border on Thursday. Although the maximum sustained winds have fallen, they are not expected to weaken further and the forward speed of the hurricane is also dropping, meaning it could linger near the coastline through to Saturday, This means that torrential rainfall could last for significant periods and cause catastrophic flooding, including in inland areas such as Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said: ""The time to prepare is almost over, Disaster is at the doorstep and it's coming in."" Up to 1.7 million people have been ordered to evacuate across South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Some 5.25 million people are under hurricane warning or watch, and another 4.9 million people are under storm warning or watch, Associated Press reported. Media caption People have left homes and taken precautions ahead of the hurricane The biggest danger to life could be from storm surges, which are still predicted to be as high as 13ft (4m) between Cape Fear and Cape Lookout in North Carolina, areas that could also see up to 40in (101cm) of rain. Hurricane force winds will emanate up to 80 miles from the centre of the storm, say meteorologists. President Donald Trump issued a video message saying: ""This is going to be one of the biggest ones to ever hit our country... Protection of life is the absolute highest priority."" A National Weather Service forecaster said: ""This will likely be the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast. ""And that's saying a lot given the impacts we've seen from Hurricanes Diana, Hugo, Fran, Bonnie, Floyd and Matthew. ""I can't emphasise enough the potential for unbelievable damage from wind, storm surge and inland flooding with this storm."" Jeff Byard, of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said: ""This is going to be a Mike Tyson punch to the Carolina coast."" Florence could wreak more than $170bn (£130bn) of havoc and damage nearly 759,000 homes and businesses, says analytics firm CoreLogic. Energy companies warned Florence could knock out power in some areas for weeks Waves 83ft (25m) tall were recorded at sea on Wednesday morning. European astronaut Alexander Gerst shared images of Florence's eye wall from space, calling the storm a ""no-kidding nightmare"". But while many coastal residents have complied with mandatory evacuation orders, others are boarding up their homes and vowing to ride out the storm. Delicatessen owner in Wilmington, Brad Corpening, told Reuters he would stay, saying: ""I'm not approaching Florence from fear or panic. It's going to happen. We just need to figure out how to make it through."" Image copyright AFP Image caption Myrtle Beach in South Carolina. Some are shuttering up, some are riding it out Restaurant owner in the town, Solange Iliou Thompson, told Agence France-Presse: ""I'm staying. The building's solid and Buddha will protect us. ""What can you do? You can't stop Mother Nature."" Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged. Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h Houses suffer damage, severe flooding Storm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h Some roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses. Storm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+ Serious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland. Storm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless ""For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.""

ABC News Senior Meteorologist Rob Marciano tells us that it will be a long cleanup process for many residents. 2. Dow Jones tumbles more than 800 points Yesterday marked the worst day for Wall Street in eight months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 832 points, a 3 percent loss, at the close of trading, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 316 points, or 4 percent. Among the reasons for the selloff were investors shedding tech stocks in recent days. Business Insider Senior Markets Reporter Joe Ciolli explains Wednesday's losses: ""Tech stocks just aren't looking as unstoppable as they once did, and they're priced for perfection and really have nowhere to go but down."" 3. Department of Justice signs off on CVS-Aetna merger One is the country's largest pharmacy chain. The other is one of the biggest insurance companies. And yesterday, they won approval from the Justice Department to complete the biggest health insurance deal in history. For $69 billion, CVS will be allowed to merge with Aetna -- although there are a number of conditions. Beyond this deal, ABC News Deputy Political Director MaryAlice Parks said health care will be a big part of the midterm elections.

US lawmakers prompt investigation of Saudi journalist's disappearance It's still unclear what happened to Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Saudi journalist for the Washington Post, after he walked into the Saudi consulate last week in Istanbul. His family members said they were told by Turkish officials he was murdered, but the Saudi government denies that. The Trump administration has avoided taking a side in his disappearance, despite Republican and Democratic lawmakers' voicing outrage over Khashoggi's case. Yesterday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee took action, releasing a letter to prompt a White House investigation. ""Republicans on Capitol Hill, who are normally very hesitant to criticize or condemn the Saudis, have said this could mark a breaking point in the U.S.-Saudi relationship,"" ABC News' Conor Finnegan, who covers the State Department, told us.

Mark Osborne and Max Golembo,"As rain from the remnants of Hurricane Florence starts to move out of the Carolinas, residents are waiting and watching as rivers across the two states continue to swell and threaten neighborhoods with devastating flooding. Many areas of North Carolina continue to deal with fears of being cut off from relief -- power crews, food and supplies -- by flooded and washed-out roads. More than 2 feet of rain has fallen across North Carolina, including a preliminary total of 33.89 inches near Swansboro, North Carolina, the most rain from a single tropical system in the history of North Carolina. Marion, South Carolina, has set the high-water mark in its state history with 18.13 inches from Florence. Flash flood warnings continue to be in place, 72 hours after Florence made landfall on Friday as a Category 1 hurricane. Homes along the New River are flooded as a result of high tides and rain from Hurricane Florence which moved through the area in Jacksonville, N.C., Sunday, Sept. 16, 2018. The storm has claimed the lives of at least 17 people across the Carolinas. The latest death came in Gaston County, North Carolina, where a 3-month-old was killed when a tree fell on the child's mobile home Sunday just after noon. SLIDESHOW: PHOTOS: Hurricane Florence batters the East Coast ""This storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now,"" North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said Sunday, warning residents that there are still dangers to come even as Florence weakened to a tropical depression. ""Floodwaters are still rising across parts of our state and risk to life is rising with the angry waters."" Hundreds of roads, both big and small, have become largely impassable due to flooding. Stretches of I-95 in Lumberton, North Carolina, have been shut down due to flooding. Residents in South Lumberton were evacuated Sunday as the Lumberton River continued to rise. The Cape Fear River in Chanquapin, North Carolina, and Trent River in Trenton, North Carolina, are also above record levels. I-40 is closed due to being largely impassable in areas. Highway 70 is closed near Kinston, North Carolina, as well. Mandatory evacuations were also issued late Sunday in Hoke County, west of Fayetteville, North Carolina, due to the potential breach of a dam at McLaughlin Lake. Soldiers from Fort Bragg and the U.S. Coast Guard were called in to assist with the evacuations. With nearly 700,000 people without power late Sunday, trucks are having a hard time getting into some areas cut off by the flooded roads. Getting food to people cut off by the rising waters is also a problem. Helen McKoy walks down a flooded street in her neighborhood as Florence continues to dump heavy rain in Fayetteville, N.C., Sunday, Sept. 16, 2018. Elton Matheson, who rode out the storm, looks at the flooded waters in front of his home after Hurricane Florence hit Emerald Isle N.C.,Sunday, Sept. 16, 2018. ABC News spoke to Salvation Army chaplain Capt. Jon-Phil Winter outside a Sam's Club in Jacksonville, North Carolina, where the company had donated a large supply of food. ""With surrounding areas suffering as much as they are, it's not even possible to go to New Bern or Morehead City, or any place like that, because they've got their own problems,"" said Winter. We are kind of at the edge of the coast; we're kind of cut off and so as we would try to reach out to cities around us they're struggling themselves and so we can't pull on those resources.... With those resources not being there, it's potentially quite worrying. ""This will get us through with what we have coming in, maybe today, tomorrow and then we'll see where we are the next couple of days. Things may turn around in such a way that things are able to get in."" Winter saw the flooding that affected North Carolina from Hurricane Matthew in 2016, as well as the devastation he called ""on another level"" from Hurricane Katrina. ""This isn't as bad in some respects -- it's the sense of being cut off, that's the thing that I think is a bit of a worry, knowing that we don't have great access in and out of Jacksonville already, and once those roads are flooded we have no access in and out,"" he said. ""So just hoping that can kinda get cleared so we can get the help we need."" The majority of the rain will finally move out of the Carolinas by Tuesday morning. Virginia will see more rain over the next two days, with parts of the Roanoke region seeing 4 inches locally.",Travel is difficult in North Carolina due to road flooding.,2018-09-17T10:31:45Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}","Roads closed, towns cut off as historic flooding continues across Carolinas",https://abcnews.go.com/US/roads-closed-towns-cut-off-historic-flooding-continues/story?id=57873982,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/florence-man-flood-ap-mo-20180917_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chelsea Gohd,"NASA is surveying the damage to Puerto Rico's forests after the devastation caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Category 5 Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017 very shortly after Hurricane Irma, another Category 5 hurricane, hit the island. This caused severe damage and casualties from which the island's residents are still working to recover. A new flyover survey, described in a video from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, shows how Puerto Rico's lush forests were impacted by the hurricane. From the belly of a small plane, NASA flew an instrument called Goddard's Lidar, Hyperspectral and Thermal (G-LiHTs) airborne imager over Puerto Rico's forests. G-LiHT collected high-resolution photographs, surface temperatures and information about the height and structure of vegetation on the ground. The team had previously flown G-LiHT over Puerto Rico months before Hurricane Maria hit, so a pretty clear picture of the damage that the hurricane caused is obtained from comparing the two data sets. A NASA survey shows how Puerto Rico's forests were impacted by the two category 5 Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Irma. This image is how the forests ""look"" through G-LiHT, the airborne instrument scientists are using to complete this survey. Credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center/Matthew Radcliffe ""In many ways, Hurricane Maria has reset patches of forest across the island,"" Doug Morton, an Earth scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said in the video. Morton added that ""canopy trees normally have a large and sometimes circular crown, allowing them to spread their leaves, photosynthesize and live in the top of [the] canopy. Hurricane Maria came through and ripped off many of those large branches, leaving individuals standing almost like an individual stem."" Hurricane Maria had wind speeds topping out at 175 miles per hour and rains that pummeled towns and wreaked havoc on the island's power grid, so forest damage is no surprise. But, as Morton describes in the video, these trees will recover with time. ""They'll have to regrow those leaves or give up that space in the canopy to their neighbors as they regrow,"" Morton said. In the video, Morton shows how one tree knocked down its neighbors, which will allow sunlight to reach the forest floor and help new, young plant life to grow. He also points out that large trees, stripped of their large branches, will likely recover their leaves and branches with time. Email Chelsea Gohd at cgohd@space.com or follow her @chelsea_gohd.

Cheyenne Haslett,"Youth activists were set to tell Congress on Thursday that their lives are at stake unless the U.S. government takes action against climate change.
Despite their age, the activists testifying before the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis are experienced organizers, some of whom have been protesting for climate action in Washington, D.C., for years. Just last month, many joined the surge of young people who turned out in protests around the world in what was estimated to be the largest global day of climate action ever.
Aji Piper, an 18-year-old from Seattle, Washington, is a plaintiff in a lawsuit that claims that, if the U.S. government fails to protect the environment, members of his generation could be denied their constitutional rights to life, liberty and property. The lawsuit, filed in 2015, is set for a hearing before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Earlier this year, 30,000 young people signed onto a legal brief asking the appeals court to move the case forward.
Chris Suggs, a sophomore at the University of North Carolina and native of the state, saw firsthand the impact of climate change when his hometown was devastated by flooding after Hurricane Matthew. In 2014, he launched a nonprofit to get young people involved in rebuilding his community. Suggs and Piper will be joined by Melody Zhang, a student at the University of Michigan who's part of a young Evangelical group that acts to protect climate change with the backing of religion.
The three students are the first witnesses to testify before the new House select committee, created by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to address climate crisis in February.
""In contrast to a typical Congressional hearing, the committee will hear from young leaders who are urging policymakers to take climate action now and finally address the climate crisis,"" the committee said in a statement ahead of the hearing.
The committee is chaired by Rep. Kathy Castor, a Democrat from Florida. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a young face of climate action and an author of the Green New Deal, is not a member of the committee, which she'd previously criticized for lacking political power.","The young activists, some of whom are part of a lawsuit against the U.S. government to force climate action, will tell Congress that their lives are at stake.",2019-04-04T13:23:46Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",Young climate activists come before Congress to urge action,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/young-climate-activists-congress-urge-action/story?id=62155806,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/climate-youth-march-nc-ps-180824_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Zack Colman, Daniel Cusick, E&E News","Sheril Pritchett can’t get out of her room. It’s not because of damage from Hurricane Florence. Her apartment in Fayetteville, N.C., was spared, somehow, from the historic storm that dumped 30 inches of rain in some parts of the state. She’s not stranded by her earlier hip replacements, either. Pritchett is bed-ridden by stress. She, like many in the path of Florence, lives in federally subsidized housing. The 59-year-old followed instructions to evacuate, shuttling 110 miles with her husband to the nearest hotel they could find. Six nights, $600. It wasn’t her emergency money, but it was her savings for a house. She’s back now. Back to square one. Except that it’s not really the beginning, at all. Far from it. Moving too much is a way of life for many residents in low-income housing. Pritchett has been in her one-bedroom place for just over a year. It’s her fourth since uprooting in 2008 to be closer to her oldest daughter, who was having health issues. Every time she saves for a house of her own, something takes her cash. Then come the boxes, then the relocation. Pack. Unpack. Repeat. Pritchett already felt defeated. It’s the transience. The evacuation, the nights spent in a Holly Springs, N.C., hotel. It’s taken a toll. She lives in one of 3,863 public housing units located in the floodplain of North Carolina. For now. After Florence, she agonized for days whether she’d have a home at the end of it all. “It really scared me. I don’t have much,” she said over the phone. “I had to give up three bedrooms of stuff to move into this place, and I already felt bad about that. And this is all I have left. So I thought about, ’What if I lost that?’” Pritchett doesn’t need an active imagination to pick at that thought. Her youngest sister has been homeless since Hurricane Harvey swept her out of a Houston public housing unit. “She’s not even the same person anymore,” Pritchett said. “She’s suffering with depression, her anxiety is bad. She’s just moving from place to place—she’s just not even trying to find her own place anymore. She said she worked so hard for what she had and she’s not just able to replace it.” ‘It’s the cheapest land’ The remnants of Hurricane Florence caused flooding in Lumberton, N.C. Jason Miczek/Reuters/Newscom Hurricanes have done it before. Harvey and Florence are the newest to damage public housing buildings. They decimated key portions of an already limited housing stock for financially vulnerable people, said Sarah Mickelson, senior public policy director with the National Low Income Housing Coalition. After Harvey, some landlords of federally subsidized units evicted tenants to charge higher rents to wealthier people who were displaced by the hurricane, she said. Pritchett and her sister are not alone—in the loneliest sense. It’s no accident that these buildings ended up in low-lying areas. Land in the floodplain is cheaper and more available, suffering from a history of disinvestment, said Mustafa Santiago Ali, a former EPA official who now leads environmental justice efforts for the Hip Hop Caucus. Industrial and agricultural facilities, and all the pollution that comes with them, are often located in these intermittent waterways, too. “It’s the cheapest land and the most undesirable land, and usually that’s the most dangerous land,” Ali said. Residents of Lumberton, N.C., know that well. Hurricane Matthew destroyed four of the city’s public housing developments in 2016. Millions are being spent to rehabilitate them. Lumberton fared better with Florence—it only damaged 10 of the authority’s 500 occupied units, said Adrian Lowery, the housing authority’s executive director. Lowery’s greater concern is how disaster recovery funds will be distributed. He knows that Lumberton, as a low-income community, will have to lobby state and federal regulators to get its share. “I don’t want to say we’ll be left out, but we’ll be at the bottom of the totem pole,” Lowery said. “Our folks are going to have to fight for all they can get.” It’s a grim replay. Some of the same buildings that were damaged by Matthew were slammed again by Florence. They’ve been vacant this whole time. That means hundreds of people in a city already short on affordable housing have been displaced for two years. Now it promises to be longer for some of them. It’s a problem that city and state officials are aware of. Official planning documents prioritizing the expenditure of Federal Emergency Management Agency public assistance money noted that Matthew decimated affordable housing in Robeson County. The county is 67 percent non-white, and the North Carolina Housing Coalition says 42 percent of renters have a hard time paying for housing. Flooding and disasters compound chronic insecurity related to poverty. Public database searches of subsidized housing residents in Fayetteville, Lumberton and nearby Pembroke revealed patterns. Many were evicted after short stays, sometimes for missing payments as small as $150; some residents had criminal records; and others moved multiple times over short periods. All of that is already known. The Department of Housing and Urban Development and FEMA released a survey last month that showed renters were three times less likely than homeowners to have $2,000 on hand for evacuations. Important number: 104,497 About 10 percent of North Carolina’s public housing units are in the known floodplain, making it emblematic of the U.S., according to New York University’s Furman Center. Altogether, 9 percent of U.S. public housing units—104,497 total—and 8 percent of privately owned, federally subsidized rental housing—343,351 units—are in the combined 100- and 500-year floodplain. Actual susceptibility to flooding is probably even greater, as climate change and development render floodplain maps outdated. Those maps don’t project future effects from sea-level rise and warmer waters, which climate scientists said intensified Florence, Harvey and other storms. A public housing development in Lumberton was devastated after 2016’s Hurricane Matthew. Department of Housing and Human Development Climate change fueled a stronger storm surge during Florence, flooding 11,000 more homes than it would have in 1970, according to an analysis by nonprofit research organization First Street Foundation. It projected that climate change would help flood an additional 51,000 homes in 2050. Pritchett doesn’t need a report to see what’s happening. She wants higher ground. “I think it’s going to happen again next year. It’s happening more often over the years. I don’t know why, but it seems like it’s happening closer and closer together every time,” she said of floods and storms. “I’m gonna move because I don’t think I can deal with the stress anymore.” Pritchett applied for FEMA assistance, hoping to get reimbursed for the $600 she spent for the hotel. It’s probably going to be a long wait. Many federal programs for low-income people don’t work—or aren’t being used by the Trump administration, said Mickelson of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. President Trump did not activate FEMA’s disaster housing assistance program after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria last year. The program provides direct rental assistance and case managers for low-income residents displaced by disasters. FEMA’s transitional housing program—essentially, setting people up in hotels—has requirements that the poorest of Americans can’t meet, like putting down a credit card. Navigating the system can be hard for anyone. That’s even more true for impoverished victims of a storm, Mickelson said. Sixty percent of Maria victims were denied FEMA assistance, she said. Months after Harvey, just 26 percent of the people who applied for FEMA or Small Business Administration assistance had been approved, according to a December 2017 survey by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. That can lead to hard choices. Do damage victims stay with relatives? Double up with displaced families? Return to uninhabitable homes? Many just wind up on the streets or bouncing from place to place. That’s what happened to Adrienne Kennedy. Born and raised in Lumberton, the 43-year-old stayed as close to home as she could after Matthew: in her grandmother’s car. Then at her friend Wanda’s house for three weeks. Then at the supply store that she helped run for the county’s disaster recovery committee. A hotel for 10 months. Back to the store. Then, accepting the inevitable, she left her hometown for Fayetteville. Now she’s at a gymnasium there. She’s helping elderly poor people find their spot on the floor. They each have 75 square feet. Tape on the ground separates spaces. There are no cots. They’ve been “prioritized elsewhere,” Kennedy was told. Rumors swirl around the gym about when everyone can go home. No one knows. Lumberton officials still need to check for damage and mold. “Where we live are the majority of public housing units. Initially, I think that the plan for where public housing is located right now—which is floodplain, flood path, flood zone—the planners of this community had it all planned out,” said Kennedy, who doesn’t live in public housing but whose former Lumberton home sat just behind such units. “The policy didn’t change. Neither did the topography.” Geography and prejudice Claudine Hellmuth/E&amp;E News That’s no coincidence. Downtown Lumberton was built on the highest land around. After the Civil War, homes for black families were constructed south of the city limits, along the river in low-lying areas exposed to flooding. Exclusionary zoning, restrictive covenants and “redlining” all played a role in segregating neighborhoods. Over time, Lumberton incorporated those flood-prone, mostly black communities. Those development trends were common in the South after the Civil War, according to a 2006 study by Jeff Ueland and Barney Warf, two geography professors. Their research of 146 Southern cities showed that historical and institutional racism pushed black communities into less desirable and low-lying land. That public housing ended up in the floodplain is an extension of those policies, said Andrew Kahrl, a historian and professor of African-American studies at the University of Virginia. Wealthier white residents didn’t want public housing in their communities. Nor did the real estate industry, which worried that those facilities would depress home values. So they exercised political might. “When public housing was expanding, it was working in a way to reinforce housing and class segregation,” Kahrl said. “When you have that kind of system in place... then you come to a point where you have public housing in the floodplain.” The Rev. Mac Legerton of Pembroke is concerned about what that means for the future. He said climate change will harden the disparities between the wealthy and poor, the white and non-white. “The pattern of movement in metropolitan areas is that in white communities they mostly move north to higher ground and downtown communities become further integrated,” said Legerton, who is the executive director of the Center for Community Action. “That’s happened in Lumberton. The wealthier people moved out of downtown to higher ground.” The Trump administration canceled a policy that might have helped bridge some of that divide by making public housing more resilient. The “federal flood risk management standard” would have required federally funded infrastructure to be rebuilt stronger after a storm. That would have presumably applied to federal housing like those run by HUD. The policy, though, never got off the ground. Trump revoked it just days before Harvey hit Texas. The White House said more than a year ago that it was working on a replacement standard, but none has emerged. ‘I just froze’ Fixing institutionalized inequalities is daunting. Barbara Brown would know. Brown has seen hurricane-induced flooding from two perspectives—as a survivor of Hurricane Matthew and a commissioner for the Housing Authority of the City of Lumberton. Before Matthew, Brown lived in one of the city’s 11 low-income housing projects. It’s named Weaver Court, a cluster of one-story buildings less than a mile from the Lumber River. She joined the housing commission in the early 2000s and gave a voice to the city’s low-income residents. They happened to be her neighbors. Then, on Oct. 8, 2016, Matthew filled her home with more than 4 feet of water. “That water was moving like a snake, everything was just moving and banging around,” Brown recalled. “So I prayed, I asked God to save me. I prayed because I’m afraid of water.” She survived. But none of her belongings did. After seven months in a Comfort Inn in Durham, Brown moved back to Lumberton. She found a new apartment across town, in another public housing community called Eastwood Terrace. The new place sits on higher ground and feels like a continent away from the Lumber River. Brown avoids traveling to the west side of Lumberton because it conjures memories of Matthew. “When I go over on that side, I have to get out of there before dark because all I see is that water coming up again.” As Florence approached the Carolina coast earlier this month, Brown and her fiancé fled to Nash County, where they waited four days before making the 130-mile journey back home. On the way, Brown felt a familiar fear. “It was like I went into a trance or something. I just froze,” she said. “Even though I didn’t get flooded on this one, it left me with anxiety, it left me with depression. And I’m still depressed from the last one.” It’s those kinds of feelings that make Pritchett ready to move—if she can get out of her bedroom. Pritchett admits that she’s frozen by some sort of past trauma. Studies have shown that catastrophic storms trigger mental health issues, post-traumatic stress disorder and worse health outcomes among low-income people. So where will she go? “I don’t know. I don’t know,” Pritchett said. “It’s just not going to be near the river.” Reprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&amp;E News.

Meghan Keneally,"Joyce Boucino lives a block and a half from the water in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, but she’s not leaving. Interested in Hurricane Florence? Add Hurricane Florence as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricane Florence news, video, and analysis from ABC News. She and her husband, along with a few other residents who’re defying the mandatory evacuation orders, are staying put as powerful Hurricane Florence looms off the Carolina coast in the coming hours and days. “It feels more empty,” Boucino, 70, said of the neighborhood, which counts many seasonal residents. “And if you hear a noise, it gets your attention.” Two big factors in their decision, echoing other residents in North and South Carolina who are determined to ride out the hurricane at home,, are their pets and the confidence that their house is “very, very secure” because they oversaw the construction. The Boucinos have several dogs and cats and are also fostering feral kittens for the storm. “This is like having your children,” she said of the animals. “You’re not going to leave your children. Pets are a major reason for many who are choosing not to evacuate ahead of Hurricane Florence. These are some of the animals staying with Joyce Boucino in North Myrtle Beach. “They’re feeling the stress. They’re feeling the atmospheric pressure changes and the stress of their owners.” Rhonda Heath, who lives about 150 miles north in New Bern, North Carolina, faced a similar decision. Heath, 54, is a volunteer president of the Colonial Capital Humane Society in New Bern and works in the accounting department of a construction company. She is a lifelong resident of Craven County, and her single-story brick home falls in an area under a mandatory evacuation. She has “too many animals” at her home, including some she is fostering for the storm, to bring to a shelter, Heath said. “I feel more comfortable here,” she said, adding that if she were to leave, “I don’t know when we’d be able to get back.” “This one has actually got me concerned because of the intensity,” she said of the storm Heath has been preparing for the storm “since last week,” stocking up with canned goods, bread, water and potato chips; “things that you don’t have to heat up and things that you don’t have to have electricity for,” she said. “With me being in my house, I know I can take care of my animals here and I can take care of myself here,” Heath said. Still, she added, “I’ve been through a lot of them but this one has given me the most uneasy feeling I’ve had about one.” Workers are seen as they work to secure plywood ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Florence in Wilmington, North Carolina, Sept. 12, 2018. Jaime Marvulli expressed a similar worry about Hurricane Florence. She is a high school physical education and sports medicine teacher in Conway, South Carolina, who has lived in the state since moving there for college in 1999. The only other time she evacuated was as a college student in 1999 when her school issued a mandatory evacuation for Hurricane Floyd, Marvulli, 40, said. “It’s the first time that I’m actually packing a bag, getting my dogs prepped,” she said. “Honestly, this is the first time besides [the evacuation during college] that I’m actually packing some stuff, like if I have to grab and go.” Jaime Marvulli said that she has four dogs staying with her in her home in Conway, South Carolina, including her Weimaraner (pictured). Her pets -- a Weimaraner and a black Labrador -- are also a factor, as are the two pit bulls belonging to a friend who is staying with her. “Our house is divided right now,” she joked of keeping the dogs apart. Her home is roughly 20 miles from the ocean and not in a mandatory evacuation zone but “pretty close,” Marvulli said. Her community has banded together, with the residents of about a half-dozen houses staying put and checking in on one another. “We make sure we have all the supplies that we need between the six houses,” Marvulli said, noting that extra ice, flashlights, candles and lanterns were among the supplies she collected. While she is about 20 miles from the coast, Nikki Fontana’s house is a block and a half in from the ocean in North Myrtle Beach. Fontana, a town councilwoman, is in the mandatory evacuation zone and plans to leave but it staying as late as possible because, with her role in government, “I like to know what’s going on with my city in a storm.” She was born and raised in the area and has lived in a raised 1950s beach house for 18 years. The home has a garage and the office for her upholstery and rug cleaning business is on the ground level, while the two bedroom-home is above. Sand bags surround homes on North Topsail Beach, N.C., Sept. 12, 2018, as Hurricane Florence threatens the coast. “We have brought in all the outdoor furniture, plants, secured grills, hot tubs,” Fontana said, ticking off the steps she has taken to secure the home. “We’ve boarded up the windows, we moved our camper into our yard. It wouldn’t fit in the garage. One of our cars is boarded up in our garage. All the windows are boarded. “I worry about not the material things, not the houses, not the homes, not the businesses but the people first,” she said. She plans to go either to relatives’ homes or an emergency operation center if and when she does evacuate, which she did in 2016 when Hurricane Matthew hit. She recalled how eerie it felt to go back out into the town after the storm. “It was like being in another country,” Fontana recalled. “The entire city had lost power. It was dark out. It was kind of scary.” This time, Fontana said, she has driven up and down the beach in recent days, noting that most people appear to have cleared out. “It is a ghost town,” she said. “There’s no one out.”",Evacuation orders have been issued for more than a million people.,2018-09-13T17:22:13Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}",Why some people in hurricane's path are staying put: 'I feel more comfortable here',https://abcnews.go.com/US/people-hurricane-florences-path-explain-decision-ride-feel/story?id=57797540,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/hurricane-florence-evacuation-gty-mem-180913_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Elamin Abdelmahmoud,"Widespread evacuations have been ordered as Hurricane Florence threatens the Carolina coast Hurricane Florence is as serious as it gets. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has issued dire warnings about the storm, which is expected to hit in the coming days. FEMA Administrator Brock Long was quite direct about it: “The power is going to be off for weeks and you will be displaced from your home and the coastal areas.” More than a million people began evacuating portions of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia ahead of the powerful storm. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper made a plea to those under evacuation orders: “Even if you've ridden out storms before, this one's different.” An important piece of context here: Hurricane Florence looks a lot like three past deadly hurricanes : Matthew, Fran, and Hugo. One coastal geologist compared possible flooding from Florence to the “flood of the century” left behind by another deadly storm. Yesterday, we published maps of where Florence may hit hardest. After a FEMA briefing in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump said the hurricane is “tremendously big, tremendously wet. Tremendous amounts of water.” The kids who come after 9/11 Seventeen years ago yesterday was the most major “Where were you when…” moment of my generation. Those of us who have a distinct memory of 9/11 remember what politics was like before and after. Here’s the thing: Next fall, people born after that September day will be able to vote. Katherine Miller wrote a thoughtful piece on this massive generational divide and its political consequences. Here’s Miller: “For the last 17 years, a foundational understanding of the political moment is that it started on 9/11. What happens when an important segment of the adult population didn’t experience the sheer abruptness of that day?” Meanwhile, President Trump fist-pumped as he arrived in Pennsylvania for a 9/11 memorial service. It looked like this: SNAPSHOTS Time in prison is what European terrorists have in common, according to a new study. An academic research group says that more than half the Europeans who joined ISIS in Syria and Iraq had criminal backgrounds unrelated to terrorist activities. The research backs up what has long been suspected — that prison is a convenient recruiting zone for radical groups seeking new adherents. A man allegedly yelling “fuck Trump” tried to stab a Republican congressional candidate. Farzad Fazeli, who has previously criticized the president online, was arrested for trying to attack California candidate Rudy Peters. Peters told us the attack happened Sunday afternoon while he was manning his campaign booth at a street festival. The Australian cartoonist behind the Serena Williams cartoon deactivated his social media accounts. People called Mark Knight’s cartoon racist, and Knight was widely criticized on the internet for his illustration. Despite the backlash, the cartoonist initially defended the image. He told a radio station: “You can't punch down these days. What that means is you can't criticize minority groups for poor behavior … There’s nothing inaccurate in the cartoon, but I’m sorry it has been taken by social media and distorted so much.” Viola Davis said she regrets her role in The Help. “I just felt that at the end of the day that it wasn’t the voices of the maids that were heard,” the actor said in an interview with the New York Times. “I know Aibileen. I know Minny. They’re my grandma. They’re my mom. And I know that if you do a movie where the whole premise is, ‘I want to know what it feels like to work for white people and to bring up children in 1963, I want to hear how you really feel about it,’ I never heard that in the course of the movie.” You’ll be be able to get a fresh, 7-foot Christmas tree on Amazon Prime. Amazon is reportedly planning on selling live Christmas trees — and wreaths and garlands — starting in November. The varieties include Douglas firs, Fraser firs, and Norfolk Island pines, and they will be bound and shipped within 10 days of being cut. Amazon said some trees will even be eligible for free Prime shipping. Is it even Christmas if you don’t get into a fight about which tree is the right one? Here’s what you need to know about Apple’s iPhone event today “Gather round,” says the invitation, in a metallic gold color.

Note: All the maps in this article show losses verified by the Small Business Administration for disasters in which a presidential disaster declaration was issued. The values of the losses are expressed in 2017 dollars. The New York Times These places are part of a small fraction of the United States that has sustained most of the damage from major natural disasters, forming a pattern of destruction concentrated in particular areas. About 90 percent of the total losses across the United States occurred in ZIP codes that contain less than 20 percent of the population, according to an analysis of data from the Small Business Administration. The federal government, through disaster relief programs and flood insurance, subsidizes the cost of rebuilding in areas hit repeatedly by storms, floods and fires. Critics say that encourages too much development in those regions, wasting tens of billions of dollars in tax money and endangering lives. Christina DeConcini, the director of government affairs at the World Resources Institute, said that federal programs do not adequately emphasize adapting to the risks posed by climate change. She said that instead of just being responsive, the government should stress building for resilience against disasters. Some residents continue living in disaster-stricken areas because they cannot afford to leave. Others rebuff appeals to resettle, citing deep family ties or a sense of fatalism. Rather than move the town, “it’s easier to throw your hands up and say, ‘Forget it,’” said Linda Lowe, the president of a historical society in flood-prone Olive Hill, Ky. “Abandoning a location and moving a city makes sense from a scientific, risk point of view, but the fact is that to get to a place culturally and psychologically where that conversation can be tolerated is a difficult thing to imagine,” said Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. “It’s not all that rational — but I guess a lot of these things are not really rational.” As hurricane season begins, residents of Slidell, La., near New Orleans, are planning ahead. Susan McClamroch, who works at a museum there, said that locals joke that they “start eating everything in the freezer” this time of year because of the likelihood of a power failure after a hurricane. Brian Smith, who runs a print shop in Slidell, said the business flooded in 1995 and again during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. So when Hurricane Isaac hit in 2012, flooding his shop once more, he moved it away from the vulnerable downtown area. “I’m not going to take that chance again,” Mr. Smith said. Eastern Kentucky is similarly susceptible to disaster. Almost yearly, it is hit with severe storms. Susan Thomas, who owns a bookstore and coffee shop in Morehead, Ky., said that the store flooded once when her parents owned it. When it flooded again in 2010, she had to throw away 3,000 books. “Honestly, there was a moment where I was, like, can we recover from this?” she said, adding that she returned to check on the store every time it rained. The business moved to a new location in town the next year. Three Brothers Bakery in Houston has flooded five times since 2001, most recently during Hurricane Harvey. But its owners, Robert and Janice Jucker, the self-proclaimed “king and queen of disaster,” are not moving — and Ms. Jucker, who anticipates more storms, is unafraid. The Juckers received low-interest disaster loans from the Small Business Administration to rebuild their business after Hurricanes Ike and Harvey. Officials verified the damage and estimated the amount of their property loss. The agency tracks properties nationwide whose owners or renters applied for disaster loans. Data about these loans provide a window into the geographic pattern of destruction that disasters cause each year. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration attempts to calculate the full cost of major disasters, namely those that cause more than a billion dollars in damages. They estimate that 2017 was the costliest year on record, with 16 billion-dollar disasters that together cost the United States more than $300 billion. While natural disasters are unpredictable, the annual losses from billion-dollar disasters, adjusted for inflation, have increased over the last 40 years. In the first three months of 2018, billion-dollar storms hit the United States three times. In the first three months of an average year, one disaster that causes more than a billion dollars in damages occurs, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records dating back to 1980. Climate change is making some kinds of disasters more frequent. Studies show that large wildfires have become more common in the western United States because global warming has made Western forests drier. But rising damage costs are partly because of demographic shifts and development decisions that make natural disasters more destructive. Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University, said that the rise in population and wealth near the coast was contributing to most of the increase in destruction caused by hurricanes. In the last century, there has been no clear trend in the frequency of hurricanes that made landfall in the continental United States. Over the same period, the number of buildings has ballooned in parts of the country susceptible to tropical storms as the population in those places has also increased. In 2016, there were more than 3.6 times as many homes in states that border the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean as in 1940, according to the Census Bureau. The effects of global warming on individual storms have been difficult to determine, scientists say, because there are only about a dozen observed even in an active season. But scientists also contend that climate change is expected to lead to stronger, wetter hurricanes over all. It has also made them more destructive, Dr. Klotzbach said. Because global sea levels have risen, hurricanes create storm surges that go further inland, flooding homes and businesses. “You can build your house to withstand pretty much any wind, but the surge is what will get you,” he said. Change in global sea level since 1993 +3.5 inches 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 +3.5 inches ‘94 ‘96 ‘98 ‘00 ‘02 ‘04 ‘06 ‘08 ‘10 ‘12 ‘14 ‘16 ‘18 +3.5 inches ‘94 ‘98 ‘02 ‘06 ‘10 ‘14 ‘18 Note: Chart shows two-month averages adjusted for land movement. The New York Times | Source: NASA Only about 4 percent of all hurricanes that make landfall globally hit the United States, said Robert Mendelsohn, an economist at Yale University who studies the damage caused by hurricanes. Yet 60 percent of worldwide damage from hurricanes happens in the United States. Dr. Mendelsohn attributed this partly to federal government programs that discourage citizens and local governments from building walls to protect housing near the coast. Only in the United States do relief programs and subsidized insurance make it attractive for people to move toward disaster-prone areas, he said. Ark. Calif. Fla. Ga. Kan. La. Mich. Miss. Mo. N.Y.

Dennis Mersereau,"Hurricanes are a stunning, and dangerous, display of nature’s power. They’re some of the largest and most intense storms nature can produce. Today, we know more about these systems and have an easier time measuring and predicting them than ever before. There’s more than meets the eye when it comes to hurricanes. 1. THEY ARE ONLY ""HURRICANES"" AROUND NORTH AMERICA. A tropical cyclone is a compact, low-pressure system fueled by thunderstorms that draw energy from the heat generated by warm ocean waters. These tropical cyclones acquire different names depending on how strong they are and where in the world they form. A mature tropical cyclone is called a hurricane in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific Oceans. What’s known as a hurricane in the Atlantic is called a typhoon near Asia and simply a cyclone everywhere else in the world. 2. HURRICANES COME IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES. Not all hurricanes are picture-perfect. Some storms can look so disorganized that it takes an expert eye and advanced technology to spot them. A full-fledged hurricane can be as small as a few dozen miles across or as large as one-half of the United States, as was the case with Typhoon Tip in the western Pacific Ocean in 1979. The smallest tropical cyclone on record was 2008’s Tropical Storm Marco, a tiny storm in the Gulf of Mexico that almost made it to hurricane strength. Marco’s strong winds only extended 12 miles from the eye of the storm—a distance smaller than the length of Manhattan. 3. THE GREATEST DANGER IS IN THE EYEWALL. The spiraling bands of wind and rain that radiate from the center of a hurricane are what give these storms their distinctive buzzsaw shape. These bands can cause damage, flooding, and even tornadoes, but the worst part of a hurricane is the eyewall, or the tight group of thunderstorms that rage around the center of the storm. The most severe winds in a hurricane usually occupy a small part of the eyewall just to the right of the storm’s forward motion, an area known as the right-front quadrant. The worst damage is usually found where this part of the storm comes ashore. 4. IT’S WARM IN THE EYE. The core of a hurricane is very warm—they are tropical, after all. The eye of a hurricane is formed by air rushing down from the upper levels of the atmosphere to fill the void left by the low air pressure at the surface. Air dries out and warms up as it rapidly descends through the eye toward the surface. This allows temperatures in the eye of a strong hurricane to exceed 80°F thousands of feet above the Earth's surface, where it’s typically much colder. 5. THE EYE TELLS YOU A STORM’S SECRETS. Like humans, you can tell a lot about a hurricane by looking it in the eye. A ragged, asymmetrical eye means that the storm is struggling to strengthen. A smooth, round eye means that the storm is both stable and quite strong. A tiny eye—sometimes called a pinhole or pinpoint eye—is usually indicative of a very intense storm. 6. SOME STORMS EVEN HAVE TWO EYES. An eye doesn’t last forever. Storms frequently encounter a process known as an “eyewall replacement cycle,” which is where a storm develops a new eyewall to replace the old one. A storm weakens during one of these cycles, but it can quickly grow even more intense than it originally was once the replacement cycle is completed. When Hurricane Matthew scraped the Florida coast in October 2016, the storm’s impacts were slightly less severe because the storm underwent an eyewall replacement cycle just as it made its closest approach to land. 7. THE WIND IS ONLY PART OF THE DANGER. While strong winds get the most coverage on the news, wind isn’t always the most dangerous part of the storm. More than half of all deaths that result from a landfalling hurricane are due to the storm surge, or the sea water that gets pushed inland by a storm’s strong winds. Most storm surges are relatively small and only impact the immediate coast, but in a larger storm like Katrina or Sandy, the wind can push deep water so far inland that it completely submerges homes many miles from the coast. 8. PATRICIA WAS THE STRONGEST STORM EVER RECORDED. The strongest hurricane ever directly recorded was Hurricane Patricia in 2015 [ PDF ]. The storm bubbled up off the western coast of Mexico in October 2015, unexpectedly strengthening into a monster category 5 as it approached land. A Hurricane Hunter aircraft measured maximum sustained winds of 210 mph on the morning of October 23, 2015, the strongest sustained winds ever recorded in a tropical cyclone in history, and the storm reached its record of 215 mph shortly after the plane left the storm. Patricia weakened somewhat over the next day before it made landfall with 150 mph winds in a sparsely populated region of Mexico. 9. CALIFORNIA RARELY SEES TROPICAL CYCLONES. It can seem odd that California occupies hundreds of miles of coastline but always seems to evade the hurricane threat faced by the East Coast. California almost never sees tropical cyclones because the ocean is simply too cold to sustain a storm. Only a handful of tropical cyclones have ever reached California in recorded history—the worst hit San Diego in 1858. The San Diego Hurricane was an oddity that’s estimated to have reached category 1 intensity as it brushed the southern half of the Golden State. 10. HURRICANE HUNTERS FLY PLANES INTO STORMS … Aside from satellite and radar imagery, it’s pretty hard to know exactly what a hurricane is doing unless it passes directly over a buoy or a ship. This is where the Hurricane Hunters come in, a brave group of scientists with the United States Air Force and NOAA who fly specially outfitted airplanes directly into the worst of a storm to measure its winds and report back their findings. This practice began during World War II and has become a mainstay of hurricane forecasting in the decades since. 11. … AND DROP SENSORS TO MEASURE WAVES. The Hurricane Hunters assess the storm with all sorts of tools that measure temperature, pressure, wind, and moisture, and have weather radar onboard to give them a detailed view of the entire storm. They regularly release dropsondes to ""read"" the inside of the storm. Dropsondes are like weather balloons in reverse—instead of launching weather sensors from the ground into the sky, they drop them down through the sky to the ground. The Hurricane Hunters also have innovative sensors that measure waves and sea foam and use the data to accurately estimate how strong the winds are at the surface. 12. WE STARTED NAMING STORMS TO KEEP TRACK OF THEM. Meteorologists in the United States officially started naming tropical storms and hurricanes in the 1950s to make it easier to keep track in forecasts and news reports. Since then, naming tropical cyclones has become a worldwide effort coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization, the United Nations agency responsible for maintaining meteorological standards. Today, the Atlantic Ocean and eastern Pacific Ocean each receive a list of alternating masculine and feminine names that are reused every six years. 13. NAMES ARE RETIRED IF THE STORM WAS ESPECIALLY DESTRUCTIVE. If a storm is particularly destructive or deadly, the WMO will “retire” the name from official lists so it’s never used again out of respect for the families of the storm’s victims and survivors. When a name is retired, another name starting with the same letter takes its place. More than 80 names have been retired from the Atlantic Ocean’s list of names since 1954. The names Matthew and Otto were retired after the 2016 hurricane season, and they will be replaced with Martin and Owen when the list is reused in 2022.

"William Saletan, William Saletan","A motorist clears snow from his car at OHare International Airport after an early winter snowstorm hammered the airport on Monday in Chicago. The Mississippi Special Election Is a Glimpse Into Americas Polarized Future At the End of the Day, Muellers Investigation Is About Espionage A No LabelsAffiliated Caucus Is Trying to Pressure Nancy Pelosi Into Relinquishing Some Power. Its Not Working. How My Middle School Guidance Counselor Brought the Blue Wave to Our Very Red Town On Friday, the federal government released the Fourth National Climate Assessment, a report on the state of climate change. On Monday, President Trump rejected the reports findings. The reports authors, representing 13 federal agencies and hundreds of scientists, say [the] economic impact could be devastating, a reporter told the president. Yeah, Trump replied. I dont believe it. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders brushed off the report. Its not based on facts, she asserted. Its based on modeling. Trump and Sanders are repeating an old Republican talking point: that coal jobs and oil sales are real, but climate change is just speculation. But thats no longer true. Weve procrastinated about climate change for so long that its no longer hypothetical. Its happening. And its hitting Americans in their pocketbooks, especially in Trump country. The report calculates that by 2090, under present trends, climate change will cost the United States more than $500 billion every year in lost wages, heat fatalities, flooding, coastal property loss, road damage, electrical strain, and other expenses. Thats roughly the annual cost of Medicare or national defense. But this damage isnt speculative. The report shows its well underway. To start with, were cooking ourselves. The Southwest has broken regional heat records in five of the past six years. Southeastern states are leading the country in occupational heat-related deaths, and in 61 percent of Southeastern cities, heat waves have intensified. By 2090, under present trends, outdoor heat in the Southeast will cost workers $47 billion in annual lost wages. Temperatures in Phoenix will reach triple digits 150 days a year. Buckling roads have already cost Texas millions of dollars. The national cost of road repairs due to heat and water damage is creeping into the billions. In the West, were burning. Human-caused climate change is estimated to have doubled the area of forest burned in the western United States from 1984 to 2015, says the report. In 2015, wildfires incinerated a record 10 million acres, including 5 million in Alaska and more than a million in Montana. Thousands of homes burned in California, Colorado, and other states. The damage runs into the billions, as does annual federal spending on wildfire control. By the middle of this century, the report warns, the annual area burned in the western United States could increase 26 times from the present. In the heartland, were parching the earth. Climate change has dried out soil across the country. A 2017 drought caused $2.5 billion in damage. A 2015 drought cost twice that. A 2012 drought cost $33 billion, destroying crops across the plains and the Midwest. Livestock losses from heat stress are approaching $2 billion per year. The report says major portions of the Ogallala Aquifer, a huge area that stretches from South Dakota to Texasand covers states that produce one-fifth of the countrys corn, cotton, and wheatshould now be considered a nonrenewable resource. In the South and Southeast, were flooding. On average, sea levels have risen 3 inches since 1990, more than twice the rate of the previous century. But thanks to subsidence, parts of the Southeast have lost 1 to 3 feet of elevation, relative to sea level, in the past century. In Texas, sea level has risen as much as 17 inches relative to the coast, and nearly $10 billion in property now sits within a 5-foot reach of high tide. In Florida, the portfolio of property at risk is even bigger. The report documents increased flooding from Florida to Virginia. Annual occurrences of high tide coastal flooding have increased 5- to 10-fold since the 1960s in several low-lying coastal cities in the Southeast, says the report. In fact, flooding occurrences increased more than 50% in 2015 compared to 2014. Its not just the sea level thats changing. Its the rain. The last three decades are the most torrential on record, and extreme rainfall is becoming more pervasive. Across the Southeast since 2014, there have been numerous examples of intense rainfall eventsmany approaching levels that would be expected to occur only once every 500 years, says the report. Massive downpours caused $2 billion in damage in South Carolina in 2015 and $10 billion in Louisiana a year later. From 2015 to 2017, floods in Texas broke records. Warmer water is also feeding hurricanes. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused $10 billion in damage, mostly in the Carolinas. In 2017, Hurricane Irma caused $50 billion in damage, mostly in Florida. Hurricane Harvey smashed rainfall records, drowning Houston and shutting down much of the energy industry. The 2017 Atlantic Hurricane season alone is estimated to have caused more than $250 billion in damages, says the report. Based on past trends and recent sea surface temperatures, the heaviest rainfall amounts from intense storms such as Harvey are about 5%7% greater now than what they would have been a century ago. These arent hypotheticals. Theyre facts. Last year, the United States suffered more than $300 billion in damage from weather disasters, breaking the previous record by more than 40 percent. Nearly $1.5 trillion in real estate sits within an eighth of a mile of the coast, and rising tides are beginning to claim it. There are already indications in places like Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Norfolk, Virginia, that homes subject to recurring flooding may become unsellable, says the report. Risk portfolios in the housing finance, municipal bond, and insurance industries may need to be adjusted. Youre paying for all of this. You pay for federal flood insurance, which covered losses from the 2017 hurricanes. You pay for federal crop insurance, which shelled out nearly $15 billion to farmers in the 2012 drought. You pay for billions of dollars in federal outlays to control wildfires and coastal erosion. Youll pay billions more to upgrade electrical grids and elevate ports as the heat grows and the oceans rise. So when Trump says, I dont believe it, hes not puncturing a fantasy. Hes telling you not to believe whats happening right in front of you. Hes turning his back as heat, fires, droughts, and floods destroy lives and livelihoods. When your taxes, electrical bills, and insurance premiums go up, thats climate change. When you turn on your TV and see homes burning or families wading through streets, thats climate change. Its killing people and gutting communities. But its not bothering Donald Trump. Support our work: become a Slate Plus member.

Tracey Peake,"Chris Osburn is an associate professor of marine, earth and atmospheric sciences at NC State. His latest work, published in Geophysical Research Letters, looks at the effect that large, destructive storms such as 2016's Hurricane Matthew have on carbon sinks and on the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) being released into the atmosphere around North Carolina's Neuse River estuary and Pamlico Sound.
The Abstract (TA): Let's start by defining what you mean when you talk about carbon sinks.
Osburn: A carbon sink is a place where CO2 is stored as organic matter on land, either in soils or in wetlands, or in coastal water such as estuaries. CO2 is a natural byproduct of existence, and it's released when organic materials decay. For example, leaves that fall from trees are a source of organic carbon that can decay to CO2, but if the leaves fall and get buried in soil or fall into water in a wetland, they get stored there the material doesn't decay and release CO2. That storage is a carbon sink.
TA: How does carbon stored in a sink get back into the atmosphere?
Osburn: When soil erodes or wetlands get flushed out, the organic carbon stored there gets into a river system and then moves into an estuary or sound. Once that happens, there are two major ways that it can be removed. First, the organic material is food for naturally occurring bacteria. Just like us, bacteria release CO2 when they breathe. When there's more food available, there are more bacteria, and so more CO2 gets released. The other way that CO2 gets released is by sunlight. Much of this material, the organic matter, is colored, so it absorbs sunlight, which chemically converts a portion of that carbon back into CO2.
TA: What are the effects of major storms on this process?
Osburn: Big storm events flush the stored organic carbon downstream, where it's exposed to sunlight and bacteria, activating the processes that release CO2 and changing a system like the Pamlico Sound from a sink to a source. Our research shows that in the six weeks or so after Hurricane Matthew, the Pamlico Sound produced about 25 percent of its annual CO2 output. What's alarming on one hand is that you can mobilize and move a lot of this material in just one or two events per year.
TA: How much CO2 are we talking about?
Osburn: We estimated that the Neuse River Estuary and Pamlico Sound released nearly 79,000 metric tons of CO2 in the two months following Hurricane Matthew. That value equals the annual CO2 released by about 17,000 cars. Thus, these individual events can be significant; research prior to ours has found that one or two events per year can wipe out the entire CO2 uptake capacity of these coastal environments.
TA: What are your next steps?
Osburn: Earth's climate is controlled in part by its energy balance, which is strongly influenced by CO2 in the atmosphere. Extreme weather events have the potential to dramatically increase the release of CO2 to the atmosphere from coastal environments that might otherwise trap that CO2, so it's important to understand how the climate system interacts with the carbon cycle. Where the organic carbon comes from on land appears to be important, as well as how it's being released by bacteria or sunlight. Our next steps will be to study the rates at which sunlight and bacteria are releasing the carbon stored in this organic material back to the atmosphere as CO2.

https://www.facebook.com/zezimak,"Florence continues to inch across the Carolinas, spurring a widespread emergency across all of North Carolina, from the ocean east to mountain west. Floodwaters are expected to push many rivers to all-time highs and could spur life-threatening landslides as the storm’s remnants move west. The storm has been linked to several deaths, according to authorities. Follow the storm’s projected path here and read the latest forecasts here. Key updates: Death toll rises to 17 | Flash floods in Mecklenburg County 1:01 a.m.: ‘It don’t look good’ – North Carolina county orders mandatory evacuation in preparation for potential dam breach Hoke County (N.C.) officials announced on late Sunday night a mandatory evacuation for people living near McLaughlin Lake due to a concern that a dam could be breached as heavy rains continue to fall on the area. Hoke County is located about 25 miles west of Fayetteville, N.C. “It is seriously damaged and we’re just getting prepared for the worst,” Scott Locklear of Hoke County’s Office of Emergency Management told The Washington Post. “It don’t look good,” Locklear said, adding that water is already coming over the dam. According to the county’s announcement, both the Coast Guard and units from Fort Bragg are on the scene to assist with evacuations. The National Weather Service in Raleigh, N.C., also issued an update at 11:30 p.m. Sunday on the status of six rivers in North Carolina. Officials said two of these rivers, Little River and Rocky River, are in “major flood,” meaning there is “extensive inundation of structures and roads” in certain areas along the waterways. River Flood Warnings as of 1130 PM (1/3)... Neuse River at: Goldsboro – Currently in Moderate Flood and rising Smithfield – Currently in Moderate Flood and nearing crest Clayton – Recently fell Below Flood Stage and falling pic.twitter.com/wRknhAgh6p — NWS Raleigh (@NWSRaleigh) September 17, 2018 — Allyson Chiu 11:59 p.m.: As heavy rains continue, multiple flash flood and tornado warnings issued The storm is expected to continue producing “widespread heavy rains over much of North Carolina and northeastern South Carolina,” the National Hurricane Center announced Sunday at 11 p.m. An additional two to five inches of rain is predicted to fall on parts of the Carolinas, the Mid-Atlantic states and southern New England. Some areas could receive as much as eight inches. The center reported that as of Sunday night, Florence had dumped a total of 40 inches of rain in southern North Carolina and 20 inches in northern South Carolina. Due to the unceasing rain, officials warn that “flash flooding and catastrophic/historic river flooding” is still a concern for “large portions of the Carolinas.” The warnings also extend to the Mid-Atlantic and New England states, and there is a risk of landslides in affected areas. Throughout Sunday evening, multiple flash flood warnings were issued for North Carolina and southwest Virginia, the National Weather Service tweeted. Many of these warnings are in place until Monday morning. Tornado warnings were also issued for several cities in North Carolina. Parts of North Carolina and South Carolina were also put on a tornado watch until 5 a.m. Monday. A couple tornadoes remain possible in the area through Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is moving north at 10 mph with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph. — Allyson Chiu 7:27 p.m.: Storm death toll rises to 17 Officials in Gaston County, N.C., said a 3-month-old was killed Sunday when a tree fell through the family’s single-wide mobile home. The infant and the mother were taken to a hospital, where the baby died, said Maj. Jamie McConnell with Gaston County EMS. At least 11 people have died as a result of the storm in North Carolina, and six in South Carolina. — Katie Zezima 6:42 p.m.: At least 16 people have died in the storm At least 16 deaths are now attributed to the storm. A woman in Lexington County, S.C., lost control of her car, hit a tree and was ejected from the vehicle, according to the South Carolina Emergency Management Division. At least six people have now died in South Carolina. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said at least 10 people have died in that state. — Katie Zezima 6:10 p.m.: ‘Looks like we’ve got a new lake in Charlotte’ The National Weather Service declared a rare flash flood emergency for parts of Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, because streams and creeks were running unusually high, in some locations reaching record levels. Tim Habershaw and his roommate, Zachary Finley, walked in their Carolina Panthers jerseys down Central Avenue in Charlote to view swollen Briar Creek, a normally placid brook that had turned into a torrent. “I drove by earlier on my way home from work, and I was like, ‘Whoa, looks like we’ve got a new lake in Charlotte,’ ” said Habershaw, 51, a restaurant server who lives two miles away with Finley, 25, a line cook. “I went home and took a nap, and when I woke up, I told [Finley], ‘We’ve got to go see this.’ ” About 3,000 miles’ worth of creeks, the vast majority little more than unnamed trickles, crisscross Mecklenburg County in a vast lacework that flows to larger rivers and, eventually, to the Atlantic Ocean. Charlotte’s rolling topography tends to funnel floodwaters into low areas that usually correspond to creek beds. Habershaw has lived in Charlotte for 30 years and said he had never seen Briar Creek as high as it was Sunday afternoon. “It’s kind of scary,” he said, “but beautiful.” The heaviest rain fell in southeastern Mecklenburg County. Some places received 10 inches of rain this weekend. — Greg Lacour 5:30 p.m.: Hundreds of dialysis patients rescued from their homes Late Sunday afternoon, Tom Cotter, North Carolina team leader for the relief group Americares, was waiting in the parking lot of a shelter in Wilson, N.C., for the arrival of 105 dialysis patients who were on their way by bus after having been rescued from their flooded homes in Jacksonville, N.C., 90 miles to the south. Many of them had been rescued by boats from their homes, and some had not received treatment for as many as five days. Cotter had brought health screening devices, essential medicine, adult diapers, cleaning supplies and more. A dialysis center across the street will deliver care. “This is very much an ongoing disaster,” Cotter said. “People are still coming into these shelters.” — Steven Mufson 4:27 p.m.: Warily watching the rivers in South Carolina Renee Matthews has been walking to Lynches River at least once every day, checking how far it has risen. Two days ago, the river that surrounds her family’s property in rural Florence County, S.C., was dry and barely rose past her nephew’s knee. By Sunday, the river bank was nowhere to be seen. The boat landing that leads to the bank was buried in debris, and the four-foot concrete barrier next to it was nearly submerged. “It’s probably come up two to three feet,” she said, aiming her phone to take a picture. “You could walk right there two days ago. You could walk all around that tree two days ago,” she said, pointing at a submerged tree. And the deluge of rain has barely started. Flooding happens every few years in this wooded riverfront neighborhood of mobile homes and big houses, some of which were built several feet above the ground. “The water goes all the way to the top of that house,” Matthews said, pointing at an empty vacation home that stands at least six feet from the wet, grassy land. There has been no flooding yet in the county that shares a name with the storm. But officials are monitoring the Lynches River and other bodies of water inland as rain continues and rainfall from the north flows downstream, said Dusty Owens, director of the county’s emergency management division. Here in Florence County, several bodies of water – the Great Pee Dee River to the east, Lynches River to the south, and Black Creek to the north, are all expected to rise. Lynches River, for example, has risen by more than five feet since Friday. The Great Pee Dee could rise to 27 feet by Thursday, surpassing the flood stage by eight feet. “Next week, it’ll be our problem,” Matthews, 48, said. “This river’s going to keep rising.” — Kristine Phillips 3:47 p.m.: At least 15 people dead due to the storm At least 15 people have now died as a result of tropical depression Florence, which slammed into the Carolinas as a hurricane on Friday. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R) said five people were killed in the storm: Amber Dawn Lee of Union County; Mark Carter King and Deborah Collins Ryan, who lost their lives in a generator-related incident on Saturday; Michael D. Prince, who died this morning when he lost control of his car in Georgetown County; and Jeffrey B. Youngren, who died Sunday morning in Kershaw County after driving into a support beam. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said 10 people in the state have died due to the storm. — Felicia Sonmez 3:17 p.m.: An aging levee system holds, while a temporary barrier weakens As the swollen Lumber River in Lumberton, N.C., rose ever higher in Sunday’s pouring rain, the aging levee system in Robeson County held strong, said county spokeswoman Emily Jones. But a temporary sandbag barrier built by volunteers and National Guardsmen amid pouring rain this week had been “compromised” by the rising water levels, Jones said. Water had broken through that section of the river, which passed by railway tracks on the west side of town, during Hurricane Matthew in 2016, flooding businesses and homes. Sebastian Milton, a volunteer with the Cajun Navy who came to Lumberton from Covington, La., to help with rescue operations, said it’s a matter of time before the levee fails as well. [ Cajun Navy races to the Carolinas; citizen rescuers pull people from rising waters ] “That’s a man-made structure,” he said, “it can’t keep holding back the river.” Milton and fellow volunteers were posted on a bridge overlooking the Lumber River and a flooded section of Interstate 95 on Sunday afternoon. Their boats at the ready, they waited in pouring rain for the next emergency call to come in. “There’s still people out there,” Milton said, gesturing toward the expanse of dark water and trees that hid flooded homes. — Sarah Kaplan 2:49 p.m.: In Pembroke, N.C., ‘We’re having problems already.’ In Pembroke, N.C., emergency officials conducted about 120 evacuations and 20 rescues – complicated procedures like pulling people out of submerged cars – since the storm began. Charles Gregory Cummings, the town’s mayor, said officials had been working all week to make sure that the most vulnerable people in the community were safe from the storm. Police officers gave homeless citizens rides to the local shelters and conducted daily drives through public housing complexes, using a bullhorn to inform people about the coming deluge. Pamphlets were posted at every mobile home park bearing information about the forecast and where to seek shelter. Officers checked in daily at a local senior home to make sure their generators were working and they had enough food. On a drive through town to examine flooding “trouble spots,” Police Chief Ed Locklear noted that most of the public housing in Pembroke is located in the low-lying north side of town. There, canals and underground systems that drain water into the nearby swamp are easily overwhelmed by downpours. Several officials said that these canals were still clogged with downed trees and debris from Hurricane Matthew – the town hadn’t had the resources to fix the problem earlier, and only just received recovery funding from the federal government. Now Locklear cruised past a street to one of those housing complexes; it was submerged beneath what looked like a foot of muddy brown water. Sandbags rested against the homes’ front doors. “These are places that always flood,” Locklear said. “And you can see we’re having problems already.” — Sarah Kaplan 2:34 p.m.: Trump monitoring ‘the preparedness and response efforts’ The White House, in a statement, said President Trump is monitoring the storm and its effects: “Today, President Trump continues to monitor the preparedness and response efforts for Hurricane Florence. He was briefed again this afternoon by Sec. Nielsen, Admiral Schultz and Administrator Long. Yesterday, he spoke with Mayor Brenda Bethune of Myrtle Beach, SC and Mayor Dana Outlaw of New Bern, N.C. They discussed the rescue and response efforts in those communities and the President offered the full support of Federal government. Mayor Outlaw thanked President Trump for immediately authorizing the emergency declaration.” 2:31 p.m.: Mandatory evacuations in Fayetteville City officials in Fayetteville, N.C., said at an emergency meeting of the city council on Sunday that the Cape Fear River is expected to crest at 62 feet on Tuesday and recede sometime after 8 p.m. Friday. The river is already above flood stage, and there continues to be flash flooding and critical river flooding in the area, they said. Officials have been notifying residents that there is a mandatory evacuation order for those living within one mile of the Cape Fear and Little rivers. For other neighborhoods there is a voluntary evacuation order. There is also a curfew in effect until further notice. Thirteen roads in the city are closed so far due to high water or flooding, 50 to 60 traffic lights are out, and the city is closely monitoring the levels of nearby dams. Currently there are fewer than 10,000 people without power. Officials also said they have been pushing back against rumors that the city’s water supply is going to be shut off later Sunday afternoon; there are no plans for water to be shut off, they said. One official said that 160 people were transported from a nursing home to shelters last night. The city is working with EMS and others to provide transport to people in wheelchairs and those who need help getting out of bed. Officials are also working to open up more shelters for as many as 7,500 people who may be displaced. — Felicia Sonmez 1:46 p.m.: The storm is spawning an array of safety and environmental hazards Federal officials described an array of life-safety and environmental hazards spawned by Hurricane Florence in a Sunday afternoon teleconference. Among them: The floodwaters are potentially contaminated and could present a health hazard. “If you can avoid contact with floodwaters, do so,” said Reggie Cheatham, director of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Emergency Management. He said there are an estimated 3,300 “hog ponds” in North Carolina that hold manure. There is concern that heavy rainfall could cause them to overflow and send hog manure into waterways. Officials so far are “fairly confident” that farmers prepared adequately in advance of the storm to prevent the ponds from overtopping, Cheatham said. “But we’re not out of the woods yet.” Cheatham said that, at last count, there had been 28 boil-water orders issued by local water systems. Meanwhile there has been a significant spill of coal ash from a storage pond at a closed Duke Energy plant near Wilmington, N.C. Cheatham said 2,000 cubic yards of coal ash spilled into a ditch after floodwaters eroded a portion of the pond wall. That ditch leads to a cooling pond that has an outflow into the Cape Fear River, but he said there’s no evidence so far that the coal ash has reached that cooling pond. Duke Energy said in a statement Saturday that the company “does not believe this incident poses a risk to public health or the environment.” Federal officials are urging evacuees to stay where they are and not attempt to return home. “Don’t feel a need to rush home to file a claim” said National Flood Insurance Program chief executive David Maurstad. Coast Guard Adm. Meredith Austin said three major ports in the Carolinas remained closed, including the Cape Fear port near Wilmington. That closure is significant because the Cape Fear water utility has put out an urgent plea for fuel. “Cape Fear is the number one priority of getting a port open,” she said. “We are aware of the need to get fuel into the port.” FEMA associate administrator Jeff Byard provided the big picture: “This is a long event. We are definitely likely to have isolated communities.” — Joel Achenbach 1 p.m.: ‘This storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now.’ North Carolina officials said floodwaters continue to rage and residents across nearly the entire state are in danger from torrential rainfall, rising rivers, floodwaters and, in the mountains, mudslides. “This storm has never been more dangerous than it has right now,” in many areas of the state, Gov. Roy Cooper (D), said at a midday news conference. “Wherever you live in North Carolina, be on alert for sudden flooding.” Cooper said numerous rivers throughout the state – including the Cape Fear, Lumber, Neuse – are still rising and not expected to crest until later Sunday or Monday. The storm has dumped nearly two feet of rain in many places, and some places are being pummeled with to three inches of rain an hour. Flooding is getting worse in parts of the state, including Pollocksville, Lumberton, Kinston and Goldsboro. The danger is growing in North Carolina’s western mountains, where rains could lead to dangerous mudslides. Officials urged North Carolinians to stay off the roads. Many are closed; at least 171 primary roads are closed throughout the state, including portions of Interstates 95 and 40. People are urged not to drive east of Interstates 73/74 or U.S. Route 64 South. Many secondary roads are closed because of flooding. Cooper estimated that between 750,000 and 1 million people have evacuated certain areas, a figure that will rise with expected mandatory evacuations in some places as rivers rise. About 15,000 people are staying in about 150 shelters across the state, he said. Four medical shelters are open in North Carolina, serving at least 170 patients. More than 900 people have been rescued from floodwaters, Cooper said. At least 700,000 people remain without power and residents should expect to be without for days because so many roads are impassible. “People need to understand that some areas are likely to be without power for a while,” Cooper said. The governor said food, water and high-water vehicles are being delivered to hard-hit areas. The Coast Guard has rescued at least 50 people via helicopter. — Katie Zezima","Washington Post Florence dumps torrential rain, raises floodwaters across the Carolinas Washington Post Florence continues to inch across the Carolinas, spurring a widespread emergency across all of North Carolina, from the ocean east to mountain west.

Ana Luisa Suarez,"It is just about every Harry Potter lovers dream to travel to the magical world. We all waited anxiously to get our Hogwarts letter in the mail, but sadly, it never came. For those of us who are the biggest Potterheads, we try to incorporate the wizarding world into our lives any way we can. We rewatch the movies, reread the books, share them with our loved ones, and find ways to celebrate Harry Potter all year long. Two Maryland parents recently went above and beyond to share their HP love with their daughter. Katherine Pastas Nevitt and her husband, Matthew Scott Nevit are huge Harry Potter fans and they have passed down their appreciation of the series with their daughter, Vivienne. To celebrate her sixth birthday, Matthew and Katherine went all out and magically transformed their backyard into a piece of the wizarding world. They brought Diagon Alley to life in their yard and the results are absolutely breathtaking. On Facebook, Katherine posted, ""What do you do when your kids are big Harry Potter fans? You build them Diagon Alley, of course. Ollivanders, Flourish &amp; Blotts, Madam Malkin's and Mr. Mullpepper's Apothecary real shops that have working doors and windows. And yes, you can really, truly ""buy"" wizarding supplies from inside!"" It took the couple four weeks between July and August to accomplish this impressive feat. The floors and walls of the alley are made up of pallets, while the outside is painted to look like stone. They used repurposed china cabinets to recreate the windows. What is so impressive is that they were able to pull this off for almost entirely free by using recycled material they found through Craigslist ads, Second Chance Baltimore, and Habitat for Humanity. All in all, it cost them under $200 to accomplish bringing to life a movie-quality set piece for their daughter. In their Diagon Alley, they were able to build a Flourish &amp; Blotts, the bookstore that Harry, Hermione, Ron, and all of their classmates shopped at to purchase their Hogwarts textbooks. They built Ollivanders, the wand shop that many Hogwarts students purchased their first wand at. There is a Madam Malkins, the dress shop where Hogwarts robes are sold. And the couple also built an Apothecary that the students could purchase their potions supplies from. After their daughter's magical birthday, Katherine posted that the couple wanted to share their little bit of the Harry Potter world with others. They offered it for parties and photo shoots. The photographer who took the photos at Vivienne's birthday party made a connection in the wake of Hurricane Florence. While speaking with Apartment Therapy, Bridget from Bridget Slack Photography, explained how with the help of Laura Covington, they were all able to put on a charity photo shoot. Laura lost her home during Hurricane Florence, as her entire neighborhood in the River Bend area of New Bern was underwater. Even though she lost her own home, Laura sprung into action to collect donations for those who were affected by the storm. Bridget said: ""I asked Katherine at Diagon Alley Gambrills if I could use her venue to do a charity photoshoot. Katherine graciously donated the venue. In less than a week we put together the event. We had fantastic high school actor volunteers. The actors played merchants and portion makers in the stores. People paid $100 for the photos and brought donations and gift cards. I donated my time, editing and digital photo galleries to the families. Laura then drove all these supplies directly to the community. She spent the last week visiting families and passing out supplies. Laura is not done with her help for hurricane victims. She will continue to assist as all the families gut their homes and rebuild their lives. What I think is so magical is how the community came together."" It just goes to show how strong the Harry Potter community is and what a beautiful way everyone can come together.","It is just about every Harry Potter lovers dream to travel to the magical world.

"USA TODAY, Dalvin Brown, USA TODAY","Drone footage shows extensive flooding in Belhaven, North Carolina, after Hurricane Florence. Video shot by Tariq Zehawi and John Meore. USA TODAY A home sits in high water on W 6th Street after Hurricane Florence brought heavy rains to Washington, N.C. (Photo: Tariq Zehawi/NorthJersey.com) When floodwaters from now-Tropical Storm Florence finally subside and residents are allowed to return to their communities in North and South Carolina, the shift to recovery mode may seem overwhelming. But what you do in the days after a devastating storm can mean the difference between a relatively fast cleanup and an expensive months-long demolition nightmare. Experts advise these steps to help protect your safety and your wallet. Taking care of your health ""The first thing you need to do is take care of yourself. Make sure you're emotionally OK,"" said Elaina Sutley, assistant professor of structural engineering at The University of Kansas. ""Only then should you start assessing any structural damage."" What materials do I need? You should make sure you have knee-high rubber boots, long-sleeve clothing, a respirator, a flashlight, a camera and liquid bleach. Where do I start? Start by turning off any gas or power to prevent explosions or electrocution. Then begin drying out your home and addressing the structural damage such as a wall collapse or sinking ceilings. And remember: There may still be water left either in the basement or seeping from soaked furniture. ""You need to open up windows and doors. Let things dry out,"" Sutley said. Fans and humidifiers can help speed up the drying process. While everything dries, which can take a few days, homeowners are encouraged to toss any food left in the home along with any absorbent material that has come in contact with water.

(Photo: Frank Pompa, USA TODAY) ""If there was salt-water flooding, there might be corrosion so get an electrician to look at that,"" said Jeffrey Schlegelmilch of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness. ""Even if it's not salt water, things could still be dangerous. Fact-check with a professional before plugging anything in."" What do I do with damaged items? Coastal areas that have experienced floods in the past will likely have protocols for picking up and handling debris such as drywall and large furniture. What can I keep? Family heirlooms, jewelry, photographs and other valuables can be air-dried and saved. Clean and disinfect them if they came in contact with floodwater. What should I avoid? Other than contaminated water flow, there could also be animals trapped in your home brought in by the floodwaters. ""Areas like North Carolina have a lot of poisonous snakes. Floodwaters can bring these into your home. Look out for any critters that could be lurking in hidden areas,"" Schlegelmilch said. What happens if I wait? ""If your home is just left to sit, it will continue to deteriorate, and it becomes even more of a health threat,"" Schlegelmilch said. Summer's heat and humidity make for prime conditions for mold, so act fast, Sutley said.

(Photo: Alex Edelman, AFP/Getty Images) Taking care of your wallet The sooner homeowners file claims with an insurance agency or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the faster a resolution can be reached. However, traditional homeowner policies don't cover flooding. Only flood insurance policies reimburse families for water damage caused by flooding. ""After Hurricane Matthew hit the southeastern United States, I worked on a project where we spoke to households and businesses about receiving assistance from their insurance or FEMA,"" Sutley said. ""Most people who had insurance and filed a claim received help within 30 days. Most people who applied for FEMA had received it within a month."" What do I need? Insurance documents, home deeds and your Social Security card can get you started on making an insurance claim. Photos and videos of the property both before and after the flood are also essential since recovery agencies will likely request proof of the damage. Where do I start? It's important to contact your insurance agency before you remove anything from your home. ""Insurance companies sometimes want to send someone down to investigate before anything is taken out,"" Schlegelmilch said. After contacting your insurance company, work can began. Homeowners are encouraged to remove any carpet or drywall that has come in contact with water before mold starts to form. ""I would look to CDC guidance for which bleach to use. You don't want just to get surfaces to look clean, you want to make sure that there aren't any living mold spores,"" Schlegelmilch said. What if I don't have insurance? It's pretty common for people not to have flood insurance, no matter their income level. In coastal regions, it may be mandatory. But for those who live further inland, there are often local aid options. ""Find out what types of public assistance is available in your area,"" Schlegelmilch said. ""There are a lot of charities that pop up to help people get back in their homes. Some move people to the top of the list who are low income or have disabilities.""

Talal Ansari,"The owner of an animal rescue shelter was arrested on Friday on criminal charges after she housed the pets of residents who were fleeing the area as Hurricane Florence approached North Carolina. Tammie Hedges, the owner of Crazy's Claws N' Paws, took in more than 25 cats and dogs at a warehouse in Wayne County that was in the process of being converted into a shelter. Our mission was to save as many animals from the flood that we could. We went through Hurricane Matthew and it was horrible. There were many preventable deaths,"" Hedges told USA Today. One elderly couple dropped off 18 animals, some of which were sick or injured, she said. But the warehouse where Hedges was housing the animals 17 cats and 10 dogs had not been officially registered as an animal shelter. According Hedges, an official with Wayne County Animal Services had shown up to the shelter site claiming that they received a call about possible flooding at the warehouse. ""As we walked in, before we got to the animals, [the official] basically said i could hand the animals over voluntarily or he would get a warrant. At this time, I made the decision to voluntarily hand them over,"" Hedges wrote in a note posted on the Crazy's Claws N' Paws Facebook page. But later that week, Hedges was taken into custody, the post announced : ""Just to update everyone, Tammie was just arrested and is being taken to county jail. They sent two cars of men to arrest one 4'10"" female!"" ""Wayne County Animal Services made contact with Ms. Tammie Hedges and upon entering the facility they developed serious concerns regarding the practice of veterinary medicine without a license and the presence of controlled substances,"" the Wayne County Government wrote on their official Facebook page. ""Wayne County Animal Services turned the case over to the Wayne County District Attorneys office based on suspicion of practicing veterinarian medicine without a license and presence of controlled substances,"" the post continued, adding that Hedges was charged with 12 counts of practicing veterinary medicine without a license, and one count of solicitation of a controlled substance. Crazy's Claws N' Paws described the charges differently in a post: ""1 count of administering amoxicillin to Big Momma, 1 count of administering Tramadol to Big Momma, 3 counts of administering amoxicillin to a white Siamese cat, 3 counts of administering a topical antibiotic ointment (triple antibiotic from Dollar Tree) to a white Siamese cat, 3 counts of administering amoxicillin to a cat known as Sweet Pea, 1 count of administering amoxicillin to an unnamed black kitten, and 1 count of solicitation to commit a crime (asking for donation of Tramadol (that was suppose to be a request for a vet))."" Hedges was released on $10,000 bond, according to a post on the Crazy's Claws N' Paws page. ""The owners got to evacuate. They got to save themselves. But whos going to save those animals? Thats what we did. We saved them,"" Hedges said. In a statement, the Wayne County Government said that all surrendered animals were examined by a veterinarian, and that the county's animal services division is arranging for the pets to reunite with their owners.

Eric Holthaus,"This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. In a remote region of Antarctica known as Pine Island Bay, 2,500 miles from the tip of South America, two glaciers hold human civilization hostage. Stretching across a frozen plain more than 150 miles long, these glaciers, named Pine Island and Thwaites, have marched steadily for millennia toward the Amundsen Sea, part of the vast Southern Ocean. Further inland, the glaciers widen into a two-mile-thick reserve of ice covering an area the size of Texas. There’s no doubt this ice will melt as the world warms. The vital question is when. The glaciers of Pine Island Bay are two of the largest and fastest-melting in Antarctica. (A Rolling Stone feature earlier this year dubbed Thwaites “ The Doomsday Glacier.”) Together, they act as a plug holding back enough ice to pour 11 feet of sea-level rise into the world’s oceans—an amount that would submerge every coastal city on the planet. For that reason, finding out how fast these glaciers will collapse is one of the most important scientific questions in the world today. To figure that out, scientists have been looking back to the end of the last ice age, about 11,000 years ago, when global temperatures stood at roughly their current levels. The bad news? There’s growing evidence that the Pine Island Bay glaciers collapsed rapidly back then, flooding the world’s coastlines—partially the result of something called “marine ice-cliff instability.” The ocean floor gets deeper toward the center of this part of Antarctica, so each new iceberg that breaks away exposes taller and taller cliffs. Ice gets so heavy that these taller cliffs can’t support their own weight. Once they start to crumble, the destruction would be unstoppable. “Ice is only so strong, so it will collapse if these cliffs reach a certain height,” explains Kristin Poinar, a glaciologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “We need to know how fast it’s going to happen.” In the past few years, scientists have identified marine ice-cliff instability as a feedback loop that could kickstart the disintegration of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet this century—much more quickly than previously thought. Minute-by-minute, huge skyscraper-sized shards of ice cliffs would crumble into the sea, as tall as the Statue of Liberty and as deep underwater as the height of the Empire State Building. The result: a global catastrophe the likes of which we’ve never seen. Ice comes in many forms, with different consequences when it melts. Floating ice, like the kind that covers the Arctic Ocean in wintertime and comprises ice shelves, doesn’t raise sea levels. (Think of a melting ice cube, which won’t cause a drink to spill over.) Land-based ice, on the other hand, is much more troublesome. When it falls into the ocean, it adds to the overall volume of liquid in the seas. Thus, sea-level rise. Antarctica is a giant landmass—about half the size of Africa—and the ice that covers it averages more than a mile thick. Before human burning of fossil fuels triggered global warming, the continent’s ice was in relative balance: The snows in the interior of the continent roughly matched the icebergs that broke away from glaciers at its edges. Now, as carbon dioxide traps more heat in the atmosphere and warms the planet, the scales have tipped. A wholesale collapse of Pine Island and Thwaites would set off a catastrophe. Giant icebergs would stream away from Antarctica like a parade of frozen soldiers. All over the world, high tides would creep higher, slowly burying every shoreline on the planet, flooding coastal cities and creating hundreds of millions of climate refugees. All this could play out in a mere 20 to 50 years—much too quickly for humanity to adapt. “With marine ice cliff instability, sea-level rise for the next century is potentially much larger than we thought it might be five or 10 years ago,” Poinar says. A lot of this newfound concern is driven by the research of two climatologists: Rob DeConto at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and David Pollard at Penn State University. A study they published last year was the first to incorporate the latest understanding of marine ice-cliff instability into a continent-scale model of Antarctica. Their results drove estimates for how high the seas could rise this century sharply higher. “Antarctic model raises prospect of unstoppable ice collapse,” read the headline in the scientific journal Nature, a publication not known for hyperbole. Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings. But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario, the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up, their study showed. Three feet of sea-level rise would be bad, leading to more frequent flooding of US cities such as New Orleans, Houston, New York, and Miami. Pacific Island nations, like the Marshall Islands, would lose most of their territory. Unfortunately, it now seems like three feet is possible only under the rosiest of scenarios. At six feet, though, around 12 million people in the United States would be displaced, and the world’s most vulnerable megacities, like Shanghai, Mumbai, and Ho Chi Minh City, could be wiped off the map. At 11 feet, land currently inhabited by hundreds of millions of people worldwide would wind up underwater. South Florida would be largely uninhabitable; floods on the scale of Hurricane Sandy would strike twice a month in New York and New Jersey, as the tug of the moon alone would be enough to send tidewaters into homes and buildings. DeConto and Pollard’s breakthrough came from trying to match observations of ancient sea levels at shorelines around the world with current ice sheet behavior. Around 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were about as warm as they’re expected to be later this century, oceans were dozens of feet higher than today. Previous models suggested that it would take hundreds or thousands of years for sea-level rise of that magnitude to occur. But once they accounted for marine ice-cliff instability, DeConto and Pollard’s model pointed toward a catastrophe if the world maintains a “business as usual” path—meaning we don’t dramatically reduce carbon emissions. Rapid cuts in greenhouse gases, however, showed Antarctica remaining almost completely intact for hundreds of years. Pollard and DeConto are the first to admit that their model is still crude, but its results have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode. “It could happen faster or slower, I don’t think we really know yet,” says Jeremy Bassis, a leading ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan. “But it’s within the realm of possibility, and that’s kind of a scary thing.” Scientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates. These are, after all, mile-thick chunks of ice. The new evidence, though, says that once a certain temperature threshold is reached, ice shelves of glaciers that extend into the sea, like those near Pine Island Bay, will begin to melt from both above and below, weakening their structure and hastening their demise, and paving the way for ice-cliff instability to kick in. In a new study out last month in the journal Nature, a team of scientists from Cambridge and Sweden point to evidence from thousands of scratches left by ancient icebergs on the ocean floor, indicating that Pine Island’s glaciers shattered in a relatively short amount of time at the end of the last ice age. The only place in the world where you can see ice-cliff instability in action today is at Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland, one of the fastest-collapsing glaciers in the world. DeConto says that to construct their model, they took the collapse rate of Jakobshavn, cut it in half to be extra conservative, then applied it to Thwaites and Pine Island. But there’s reason to think Thwaites and Pine Island could go even faster than Jakobshavn. Right now, there’s a floating ice shelf protecting the two glaciers, helping to hold back the flow of ice into the sea. But recent examples from other regions, like the rapidly collapsing Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, show that once ice shelves break apart as a result of warming, their parent glaciers start to flow faster toward the sea, an effect that can weaken the stability of ice further inland, too. “If you remove the ice shelf, there’s a potential that not just ice-cliff instabilities will start occurring, but a process called marine ice-sheet instabilities,” says Matthew Wise, a polar scientist at the University of Cambridge. This signals the possible rapid destabilization of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet in this century. “Once the stresses exceed the strength of the ice,” Wise says, “it just falls off.” And, it’s not just Pine Island Bay. On our current course, other glaciers around Antarctica will be similarly vulnerable. And then there’s Greenland, which could contribute as much as 20 feet of sea-level rise if it melts. Next to a meteor strike, rapid sea-level rise from collapsing ice cliffs is one of the quickest ways our world can remake itself. This is about as fast as climate change gets. Still, some scientists aren’t fully convinced the alarm is warranted. Ted Scambos, lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado, says the new research by Wise and his colleagues, which identified ice-cliff instabilities in Pine Island Bay 11,000 years ago, is “tantalizing evidence.” But he says that research doesn’t establish how quickly it happened. “There’s a whole lot more to understand if we’re going to use this mechanism to predict how far Thwaites glacier and the other glaciers are going to retreat,” he says. “The question boils down to, what are the brakes on this process?” Scambos thinks it is unlikely that Thwaites or Pine Island would collapse all at once. For one thing, if rapid collapse did happen, it would produce a pile of icebergs that could act like a temporary ice shelf, slowing down the rate of retreat. Despite the differences of opinion, however, there’s growing agreement within the scientific community that we need to do much more to determine the risk of rapid sea-level rise. In 2015, the US and UK governments began to plan a rare and urgent joint research program to study Thwaites glacier. Called “How much, how fast?,” the effort is set to begin early next year and run for five years. Seeing the two governments pooling their resources is “really a sign of the importance of research like this,” NASA’s Poinar says. Given what’s at stake, the research program at Thwaites isn’t enough, but it might be the most researchers can get. “Realistically, it’s probably all that can be done in the next five years in the current funding environment,” says Pollard. He’s referring, of course, to the Trump administration’s disregard for science and adequate scientific funding; the White House’s 2018 budget proposal includes the first-ever cut to the National Science Foundation, which typically funds research in Antarctica. “It would be sensible to put a huge effort into this, from my perspective,” Pollard says. Structural engineers need to study Antarctica’s key glaciers as though they were analyzing a building, he says, probing for weak spots and understanding how exactly they might fail. “If you vastly increase the research now, [the cost] would still be trivial compared to the losses that might happen.” Bassis, the ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan, first described the theoretical process of marine ice-cliff instability in research published only a few years ago. He’s 40 years old, but his field has already changed enormously over the course of his career. In 2002, when Bassis was conducting his PhD research in a different region of Antarctica, he was shocked to return to his base camp and learn that the Larsen B ice shelf had vanished practically overnight. “Every revision to our understanding has said that ice sheets can change faster than we thought,” he says. “We didn’t predict that Pine Island was going to retreat, we didn’t predict that Larsen B was going to disintegrate. We tend to look at these things after they’ve happened.” There’s a recurring theme throughout these scientists’ findings in Antarctica: What we do now will determine how quickly Pine Island and Thwaites collapse. A fast transition away from fossil fuels in the next few decades could be enough to put off rapid sea-level rise for centuries. That’s a decision worth countless trillions of dollars and millions of lives. “The range of outcomes,” Bassis says, “is really going to depend on choices that people make.”",Rapid collapse of Antarctic glaciers could flood coastal cities by the end of this century.,2017-11-30T14:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Two Melting Antarctic Glaciers Could Decide the Fate of Our Coastlines,https://www.wired.com/story/two-melting-glaciers-could-decide-the-fate-of-our-coastlines/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a1f4e7f0cb1f52c24d06716/191:100/pass/glacier-TAFA.jpg,wired,Wired,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABC News,"Yolnick Jeune couldn't sleep for days, anxious over the fate of a program that has staved off the deportations of both herself and tens of thousands of other Haitians in the U.S. Then, President Donald Trump's administration this week announced one last 18-month extension of the Temporary Protected Status that has allowed her to work and provide for her five children, including a 7-year-old, U.S.-born girl. ""I can breathe a little and get some rest. This buys me time to figure out what's next,"" Jeune said Tuesday in Miami's Little Haiti community, standing next to her daughter Lagranda. But at the same time, Jeune is upset that the government on Monday said she and nearly 60,000 Haitians must return home July 2019, ruling out any further extensions of the immigration benefits given to Haitians who came before and in the aftermath of the Caribbean country's 2010 earthquake. ""I am very depressed to know that within 18 months, I have to go back,"" she said. Having been in Miami since 2009, Jeune has not returned to Haiti but hears from her sister and other relatives back in her native Port-de-Paix that conditions have not improved for those whose lives were upended by the earthquake. In Little Haiti, the mood was of both relief and anger. Many of the dozens lined up to receive turkeys at the cultural center ahead of Thanksgiving were confused over whether the program was in fact extended or ended and were hesitant to speak about immigration. ""This decision has thrown these families in complete whirlwind,"" said Marleine Bastien, executive director of the advocacy group Haitian Women of Miami, at a press conference Tuesday in Little Haiti. ""President Trump you did promise when you were campaigning that you would be Haiti's best champion,"" she said. ""Is this your idea of being our champion? I beg to differ."" The Department of Homeland Security said on Monday that conditions in Haiti have improved significantly since the earthquake. The announcement came 60 days before temporary status is set to expire, but many in Miami were expecting a shorter extension because in May the agency had only given six months instead of the usual 18. The program protects from deportation some 435,000 people from nine countries ravaged by natural disasters or war, who came to the U.S. legally or otherwise. Days after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake devastated Haiti in January 2010, President Barack Obama granted the 18-month protection status for Haitians in the U.S. who would otherwise have had to go home. He renewed it every time it ran out. Ira Kurzban, a lawyer who has represented former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in the U.S., called Trump administration's decision ""ill-advised"" and ""morally bankrupt"" and said he would challenge it in court. Although it remains one of the poorest nations in the world, Haiti has made advances spurred by international aid since the quake. The United Nations last month ended a peacekeeping mission in Haiti that, at its peak, included more than 10,000 troops. But Kurzban said people from the Caribbean nation still deserved temporary protection, because of political instability and other natural disasters such as Hurricane Matthew that tore through southern Haiti in October 2016, killing more than 500. Haiti wasn't the first country to be canceled. Trump has ended temporary permit programs for people from Sudan and Nicaragua. He postponed a decision until next July on how to deal with 86,000 Hondurans. About 300 people rallied a mile away from Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday before his scheduled arrival, demanding residence for those immigrants under the refugee programs. Jeune and others are hoping these 18 months are enough for Congress to find a permanent solution for Haitians. Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, along with fellow Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California, last week unveiled new legislation to protect undocumented immigrants living under temporary protected status. But Kurzban said the likelihood of legislation passing before the 2019 deadline is small. It's also not easy for refugees to change their temporary immigration status to a permanent one on their own, with only certain circuit courts in the nation allowing it, and not the appeals court that rules over Florida, Georgia and Alabama. Florida is the state with the most program holders of Haitian nationality. The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, estimates 32,500 Haitians in Florida have temporary protected status, with 18,800 U.S.-born children living in those households. But there are also thousands in states like New York and Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, where about 4,700 Haitians enjoy the protected status, Marianne Jeune said Trump's decision was a welcome development. The longtime health care worker said she will have enough time to hopefully make arrangements to remain in the U.S. with her three children, one of them born in the U.S. ""This is good news. Very, very good news,"" she said. She plans to marry the father of her 5-year-old daughter, who has U.S. citizenship, and seek permanent residency. In Little Haiti, Ronyde Christina Ponthieux, a 10-year-old fifth-grade student, was devastated. She cried on her father's shoulder on Tuesday when contemplating the possibility her parents may lose their immigration benefits. ""I have trouble sleeping at night sometimes, because I know that here's a possibility me and my family may be deported,"" Ronyde said. ""A couple of months ago, my dad, he had high-blood pressure. People are stressing because knowing that there may be a possibility of them being deported is a huge thing. I love my dad, I love my parents, and all of these people they are important to me."" ———— Associated Press writers Terry Spencer in West Palm Beach, and Philip Marcelo in Boston contributed to this report.","Los Angeles Times Haitians relieved to stay in US for now, upset status to end ABC News FILE - In this May 22, 2017, file photo, Pierrot Mervilier, center rear, hugs a girl that did not wish to be identified, living in the U.S. with Temporary Protected Status…",2017-11-21T22:35:00Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}","Haitians relieved to stay in US for now, upset status to end - ABC News",http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/60000-haitians-allowed-stay-us-2019-51294394,http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/WireAP_f3434f5618954b6fb86acdfdf1747979_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Justine Calma,"North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper addressed the president in a letter today, explaining that the ongoing partial government shutdown (now on its 19th day) is holding up key disaster relief for the state. North Carolina needs to repair flood damage from Hurricane Florence last year and 2016s Hurricane Matthew, and prepare itself for future storms.
Cooper writes: Our critical long-term work to rebuild stronger and smarter is delayed with every day that federal funds are held in Washington.Please work with Congressional leaders to end this shutdown so our communities can rebuild quickly and effectively.
Last April, North Carolina was allocated $168 million for disaster recovery from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). And in September, HUD allotted an additional $1.68 billion to be shared between North Carolina and other states affected by 2018 storms. But states cant access those funds until they are given guidance from HUD and the Federal Register, both of which are closed during the shutdown.
The shutdown is making things worse for disaster-affected communities across the board, but there was already a backlog in undisbursed funds. Bloomberg reported last week that the Trump administration has been sitting on $16 billion earmarked for storm protection while HUD delays the release of instructions for how states can apply for those funds.
Trump is more explicitly blocking disaster relief to disaster survivors in drier (and blue-er) parts of the U.S. In 2018, wildfires took the lives of nearly 100 people and completely leveled the town of Paradise, California. This morning he tweeted (then deleted, then retweeted after correcting some spelling errors): Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money.
Whether or not Trumps California-centered threats have teeth remains up in the air. Such a move would be without precedent, and The Washington Post reported this afternoon that its unclear whether the Federal Emergency Management Agency is taking steps to comply. To add to the confusion, much of Californias forests are federally managed — so Trump can ask feds can rake their own leaves once theyre back on the job.
Despite states pleas, signs do not look good for a resolution to the shutdown. President Trump stormed out of a meeting with Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday, tweeting that it had been a total waste of time.
He ended the tweet by saying, Nancy said, NO.

Myra P. Saefong,"Drivers are poised to pay the highest year-end U.S. average gasoline price in three years due to continued demand and a climb in exports of the fuel. On Monday, the national gas price average stood at $2.51 a gallon, according to motoring and leisure travel membership organization AAA. That’s 38 cents higher than the same time a year ago. Prices are expected to fall by 5 to 20 cents a gallon before year-end, to about $2.46 to $2.31, according to Jeanette Casselano, an AAA spokeswoman. Even so, motorists will still see the highest November and December gas prices since 2014, she said. November daily prices averaged $2.17 last year, $2.14 in 2015 and $2.89 in 2014. “Driving factors for cheaper gas prices this winter include colder temperatures, the threat of inclement weather and online shopping,” said Casselano. But this year, gas prices have “strayed” from typical trends, which historically see year-end gas prices relatively cheap because of a “drop-off in fall gasoline demand around Labor Day,” the AAA said in a press release. “The typical factors that drive gas prices down in the winter were outweighed by the impact of two major hurricanes, steady consumer demand and continued growth in gasoline exports.” Hurricane Harvey’s path of devastation in late August included the nation’s largest refining hub at the U.S. Gulf Coast, slowing production of gasoline and other petroleum products. Hurricane Matthew hit the Southeast U.S. in early October, disrupting supply and demand in the region. U.S. motor gasoline product supplied, which offers a gauge of implied demand, climbed to nearly 9.6 million barrels a day for the week ended Nov. 17, according to the Energy Information Administration. That was the highest weekly level since the week ended Sept. 8. The first half of this year saw U.S. exports of total motor gasoline average a record high of 756,000 barrels a day, a 3% rise from the first half of 2016, the AAA said. The second half of 2017 “has seen this trend continue to climb, with exports peaking to one of their highest points in 2017—906,000 [barrels a day]—last month,” it said. Looking ahead to next year, AAA said motorists can expect gasoline prices to “trend cheaper in the first few months” of 2018, with prices potentially averaging in the $2.25 to $2.35 range by February. One caveat, however, is the meeting of members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major oil producers Thursday. “Any decision to further cut or keep [crude-oil] production rates will influence longer-term [gasoline] forecasts for 2018, said AAA. Oil futures pulled back from more-than-two-year highs on Monday as traders weighed prospects for an extension of the output curbs. The U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate crude for January delivery CLF8, -1.22% on the New York Mercantile Exchange, was down $1.20, or 2%, to $57.75 a barrel.

Marc Jones,"LONDON (Reuters) - European stocks slumped to a 21-month low on Thursday after Wall Street’s worst losses in eight months triggered a surge of global selling that also hit Asia and emerging markets. Losses in London.FTSE, Paris.FCHI and Milan.FTMIB were at nearly 2 percent ahead of what looked set to be another early dive from Wall Street [.N], although it wasn't quite as dramatic as the overnight session in Asia. MSCI’s broadest index of Asian shares not including Japan.MIAPJ0000PUS ended down 3.6 percent, having struck its lowest level since March 2017. China’s main indexes had slumped over 5 percent [.SS]. It meant MSCI’s 24-country emerging market index.MSCIEF was having its worst day since early 2016 [EMRG/FRX], after Wall Street’s swoon had given the 47-country world index equivalent.WORLD its worst day since February. “Equity markets are locked in a sharp sell-off, with concern around how far yields will rise, warnings from the IMF about financial stability risks and continued trade tension all driving uncertainty,” summed up analysts at ANZ. The sell-off, which came as the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, said stock market valuations have been “extremely high”, erased hundreds of billions of dollars of global wealth. Japan's Nikkei.N225 ended down 3.9 percent, its steepest daily drop since March. The broader TOPIX.TOPX lost around $207 billion in market value, falling 3.5 percent. Shanghai's.SSEC drop was its most severe since February 2016 and left it at its lowest level since late 2014. Shares in Taiwan were even harder hit.TWII, losing 6.3 percent. Seoul's Kospi index.KS11 dropped 3.8 percent. “I think what happened was that we were a maximum elevation of risk appetite and maximum valuation of (U.S.) large caps and tech, so when you have that situation you are always vulnerable,” said UBP macro and FX strategist Koon Chow. Europe’s traders retreated to the safety of German and other higher-rated government bonds. Italian bonds aren’t on that list though, and though they squeezed through a 6.5 billion euro debt sale, they saw more selling amid ongoing concern about the country’s financial health. [GVD/EUR] “It remains to be seen whether the accelerating equity plunge is a healthy correction or the tip of the iceberg,” Commerzbank analysts said in a note. BLOOD ON THE STREET Sinking global shares had raised the stakes for U.S. inflation figures which ended up coming in relatively tame. High inflation would only stoke speculation of more aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve - one of the things that has spooked markets. On Wall Street, the S&amp;P500’s sharpest one-day fall since February on Tuesday had wiped out around $850 billion as the S&amp;P toppled over 3 percent and the Nasdaq’s high-flying tech shares tumbled even more on fears of slowing demand. The bloodletting attracted the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who pointed an accusing finger at the Fed for raising interest rates. “I really disagree with what the Fed is doing,” Trump told reporters before a political rally in Pennsylvania. “I think the Fed has gone crazy”. Hawkish commentary from Fed policymakers triggered the sell- off in Treasuries last week and sent long-term yields to their highest in seven years. The surge made stocks look less attractive compared with bonds while also threatening to curb economic activity and profits. “The rise in Treasury yields has been the primary catalyst for the sell-off in equities, since higher yields suggest a lower present value of future dividend streams, assuming an unchanged economic outlook,” said Steven Friedman, senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “It is also possible that equity investors are growing concerned that the Federal Reserve’s projected rate path will choke off the expansion.” (Graphic: Submerging markets - reut.rs/2yvgDeo ) YUAN A FLASHPOINT The shift in yields is also sucking funds out of emerging markets. More than $1 trillion has been wiped off MSCI’s EM index since January and there has been particular pressure on the Chinese yuan as Beijing fights a protracted trade battle with the United States. China's central bank has been allowing the yuan to gradually decline, breaking the 6.9000 barrier and leading speculators to push the dollar up to 6.9377 CNH= at 0602 GMT. China’s move has forced other emerging-market currencies to weaken to stay competitive and drawn the ire of the United States, which sees it as an unfair devaluation. “The yuan has already weakened significantly, to offset the tariffs announced so far,” said Alan Ruskin, Deutsche’s global head of G10 FX strategy. “Further weakness could exacerbate concerns of a self-fulfilling flight of capital and a loss of control.” The dollar was already losing ground to both the yen and the euro, as investors favored currencies of countries that boasted large current account surpluses. The euro was at $1.1550 EUR=, up from a low of $1.1429 early in the week. The dollar lapsed to 112.17 yen JPY=D3, a retreat from last week's 114.54 peak. That left the dollar at 95.263.DXY against a basket of currencies. [USD/] In commodity markets, gold struggled to get any safety bid and edged down to $1,192.77 XAU=. Oil prices skidded in line with U.S. equity markets, even though energy traders worried about shrinking Iranian supply from U.S. sanctions and kept an eye on Hurricane Michael, which shut down some U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output.

Brendan O'Brien,"(Reuters) - A gunman who killed two women at a Florida yoga studio and wounded five other people before taking his own life had previously been accused of harassing young women, police said on Saturday. Authorities said they do not know why Scott Beierle, 40, opened fire on Friday afternoon after posing as a customer to join the class at the Hot Yoga studio in Tallahassee. Detectives are searching for links between him and the victims. The bloodshed prompted the city’s mayor, Andrew Gillum, who is also Florida’s Democratic candidate for governor, to halt his campaign temporarily and return to Tallahassee. The two women who died were identified as a student and a faculty member from Florida State University. Police said Beierle was a graduate of FSU who served in the military, and that he had been the subject of calls to authorities in the Tallahassee area “related to harassment of young women.” In a statement, police said Beierle was staying in a local hotel at the time of the attack, and that investigators were also searching his home in Deltona, Florida, more than 200 miles (322 km) southeast of Tallahassee. Police did not give more details on incidents involving Beierle and young women. Citing court records, the Tallahassee Democrat newspaper reported that he was arrested in 2012 and 2016 on charges of grabbing women’s buttocks, but both cases were dismissed. An attorney who previously represented Beierle could not be reached for comment. Two women who were wounded in the shooting remained hospitalized in stable condition on Saturday, police said. Two other shooting victims and a man who was pistol-whipped by Beierle were treated and released. “There were indications that several people not only fought back but tried to save other people,” Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said at a news conference. DOCTOR AND STUDENT One of the women killed was identified as Nancy Van Vessem, 61, a doctor specializing in internal medicine who was a member of the faculty at Florida State University College of Medicine in Tallahassee. The other was named as Maura Binkley, a 21-year-old student at FSU. Their deaths were “just devastating to the FSU family,” said the university’s president, John Thrasher. Van Vessem also worked as chief medical director for Capital Health Plan, which described her in a statement as a “guiding, visionary force” and “one of the most respected, inspiring, and accomplished medical professionals in the state and country.” FSU said her research was focused on restructuring healthcare for people with multiple chronic diseases. According to the Miami Herald newspaper, Binkley had attended Dunwoody High School in suburban Atlanta, Georgia, and was a senior at FSU with an English and German double major. She participated in an FSU exchange program over the summer and spent four months studying at the University of Wuppertal, near Dusseldorf in Germany. “It can be really scary at first knowing that you are going to spend a semester far away from home,” Binkley told Florida State University News upon her return. “But in the end, the experience is so rewarding and makes the world seem so small.” Ahead of Tuesday’s election, Tallahassee’s murder rate has been an issue in the governor’s race, with Gillum’s opponent, Republican former U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis, accusing him of being weak on crime. Gillum said on Twitter that no act of gun violence was acceptable. DeSantis said the shooting was heartbreaking. Among officials who went to the studio after the shooting was city commissioner Scott Maddox. “In my public service career, I have had to be on some bad scenes. This is the worst. Please pray,” Maddox posted on Facebook. Dozens of yoga practitioners gathered on Saturday morning for an open-air session in front of the State Capitol. Called “Yoga For A Cause”, the event was in support of people affected by Hurricane Michael. The Tallahassee Police Department posted a photo of the gathering on Facebook with the quote “It holds so much meaning” and the hashtags #TallyStrong and #OurCityOurHome.

Mark Hand,"More than 9 million hogs and a sizable poultry industry could be at risk in North Carolina if Hurricane Florence dumps a foot or two of rainfall in the eastern part of the state — as some meteorologists are forecasting — where a large number of industrial farms are concentrated. Two years ago, Hurricane Matthew caused widespread damage and destruction to the Carolinas after making landfall in South Carolina. Up to 2 million chickens and turkeys and 5,000 hogs in North Carolina drowned in the 2016 storm. Hurricane Floyd was far more devastating as it dumped 24 inches of rain on the eastern part of North Carolina. Millions of farm animals, including about 100,000 pigs and hogs, died in North Carolina as a result of Floyd’s heavy rains. Hurricane Matthew caused 14 pig and hog waste ponds to flood in 2016, compared to a 55 waste ponds that flooded during Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Floodwaters caused by Floyd sent 120 million gallons of hog waste into the Tar, Neuse, Roanoke, Pamlico, New, and Cape Fear rivers. The waste from the farms leached into the local water supply for several months, from October 1999 until the following spring. Along the Gulf Coast, the 54 counties in Texas that were declared a disaster area after Hurricane Harvey struck the state in August 2017 are home to more than 1.2 million cows, about 27 percent of the state’s cattle, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But the number of dead cattle from Hurricane Harvey was projected to be far below the 5,000 cattle who died when Hurricane Ike slammed into the state in 2008. Meteorologists are predicting Florence, a Category 2 hurricane, will make landfall north of Wilmington, North Carolina early Friday, and then crawl through the state and elsewhere in the Southeast into early next week. Over the past week, in the lead-up to Florence making landfall, public health officials have warned that flooding from the storm in the state’s largest pig- and hog-producing counties could cause toxic debris from animal waste storage ponds to contaminate rivers and become a public health emergency. Less attention has been paid to the animals themselves. Unlike companion animals, which by law must be included in government evacuation plans during natural disasters, farm animals are afforded no legal protection. The farm animals live short lives, except for the breeding sows that get impregnated every four months. The sows live about four years in 2-foot-wide cages that don’t allow them to turn around. The hogs that are raised for meat typically live about four months, which is the length of time that allows them to reach market weight. Broiler chickens — the chickens raised for meat — reach market weight in about 45 days. Industrial hog farm. CREDIT: Jeff Vanuga/USDA “It’s hard to think of a worse life than how chickens, pigs, turkeys, and other farmed animals are treated on factory farms,” Kenny Torrella, communications director at Mercy for Animals, told ThinkProgress. “Either way, whether they live out the rest of the short lives inside these factory farms, or if they drown to death inside their cages or inside the factory farms, they suffer horribly.” In past hurricanes in North Carolina, millions of farm animals were left behind and drowned to death. “That’s because factory farmers view and treat these animals like they are mere meat-producing machines,” Torrella said. “The truth is that chickens, pigs, and turkeys are just as worth as protection as the cats and dogs that we know and love and share our homes with.” The specific path Florence will take remains uncertain. The slow-moving storm could turn south and spare eastern North Carolina from the catastrophic amounts of rainfall that devastated the state during Hurricane Floyd in 1999. The faster-moving Floyd dumped 24 inches of rain on large areas of eastern North Carolina. Steven Troxler, commissioner of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, wrote in a March 2014 letter to the Waterkeeper Alliance that Hurricane Floyd “was a once-in-a-lifetime event, with all mortality generated at one distinct point in time, exceeding the capacity of all of the state’s emergency management capabilities.” Floyd resulted in the “death of significant numbers of large animals of many species,” Troxler wrote. In the storm’s aftermath, “swine disposal was complicated by the fact that much of the mortality involved large sows and pigs on feed” as opposed to much smaller piglets. Industrialization and concentration has changed animal agriculture in North Carolina over the past 30 years. The number of animals slaughtered for food has increased while the number of farms has decreased. Source: The Weather Channel In the mid-1980s there were about 2.6 million hogs housed in 15,000 hog farms in North Carolina. The hog population had ballooned to almost 9 million in 2018, concentrated in about 2,300 farms. The state ranks second to Iowa in hog production. Pig and hog farmers across eastern North Carolina are making final preparations for the arrival of Florence. Farmers have taken precautions to protect animals, manage waste ponds, and prepare for power outages that are anticipated from the hurricane, according to the North Carolina Pork Council, the main trade association for the state’s pig and hog farmers. Farmers are shifting animals to higher ground and are working to move animals out of barns in known flood-prone areas, sending them to other farms to prevent deaths. They are also securing generators and fuel supplies in case of extended power outages. Poultry is the top agricultural industry in North Carolina. The state ranks third in the nation in chicken production and second in turkey production. Poultry production in the state has increased from 60 million to 148 million birds over the past 20 years. “Lessons were learned from Matthew a couple years back and we’ve had a lot more time this go-round to prepare for Florence,” Bob Ford, executive director of the North Carolina Poultry Federation, said Thursday in an email to ThinkProgress. “I think we’re in better shape and prepared than back during Matthew.” INDUSTRIAL TURKEY FARM.

Poultry farms have topped off feed bins and made sure farms have working generators with enough fuel in case the power goes out, according to Ford. “The welfare of the birds is most important and some have been relocated to other farms and higher ground,” he said. “It’s a slow moving storm so we’re expecting coastal flooding, but our farms are located more inland and should be able to withstand the rain and wind bands associated with Florence.”",More than 9 million hogs and a sizable poultry industry could be at risk in North Carolina if Hurricane Florence dumps a foot or two of rainfall in the eastern part of the state — as some meteorologists are forecasting — where a large number of industrial far…,2018-09-13T19:31:05Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Thinkprogress.org'}",Hurricane Florence’s torrential rains could drown millions of farm animals in North Carolina,https://thinkprogress.org/hurricane-florences-torrential-rains-could-drown-millions-of-farm-animals-in-north-carolina-23b43420db3d/,https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Hurricane-Floyd-killed-millions-of-farm-animals.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1,,Thinkprogress.org,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sam Barsanti,"Way back in February, we reported that Annette Bening was attached to star in FX’s American Crime Story: Katrina as Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco, but a few months later the production “stalled” and series mastermind Ryan Murphy decided to delay Katrina in favor of The Assassination Of Gianni Versace. In August, Murphy came back and announced that the show had been retooled, with the story now being adapted from Sheri Fink’s Five Days At Memorial instead of being a more general story of how the government screwed up its Hurricane Katrina response. Speaking with Vanity Fair, Bening explained that the new version of the show no longer had a place for her, since the story now concerns a hospital that was forced to euthanize a number of critical patients when it was left without power for days and Governor Blanco doesn’t have much of a role there. She says the original Five Days At Memorial book is one of the “completely brilliant and thorough and thoughtful” books about Katrina, so she seems to agree that Murphy made the right choice by focusing on that story. “It was a great, great tragedy,” she says of Katrina, adding that there was a lot of “unnecessary suffering and death because of racism and poverty,” so it was important that Murphy tell the story “in the way that he thinks is right.” Sarah Paulson is now set to star in Katrina, and Murphy is still hoping to find new roles for Dennis Quaid and Matthew Broderick, who were supposed to star in the original incarnation with Bening.","Way back in February, we reported that Annette Bening was attached to star in FX’s American Crime Story: Katrina as Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco, but a few months later the production “stalled” and series mastermind Ryan Murphy decided to delay Katrina …",2017-12-15T00:01:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Avclub.com'}",Annette Bening explains why she was written out of American Crime Story: Katrina,https://www.avclub.com/annette-bening-explains-why-she-was-written-out-of-amer-1821310539,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--QLbZdz1z--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/nzxqxz3vzovtsjdxqnn8.jpg",,Avclub.com,Hurricane Matthew,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Michael Biesecker / AP,"About 3.4 million chickens and turkeys and 5,500 hogs have been killed in flooding from Florence as rising North Carolina rivers swamped dozens of farm buildings where the animals were being raised for market, according to state officials. The N.C. Department of Agriculture issued the livestock mortality totals Tuesday, as major flooding is continuing after the slow-moving storm’s drenching rains. Sixteen North Carolina rivers were at major flood stage Tuesday, with an additional three forecasted to peak by Thursday. The Department of Environmental Quality said the earthen dam at one hog lagoon in Duplin County had breached, spilling its contents. Another 25 of the pits containing animal feces and urine have either suffered structural damage, had wastewater levels go over their tops from heavy rains or had been swamped by floodwaters. Large mounds of manure are also typically stored at poultry farms. North Carolina is among the top states in the nation in producing pork and poultry, with about 9 million hogs at any given time and 819 million chickens and 34 million turkeys raised each year. The N.C. Pork Council, an industry trade group, said the livestock losses from the storm should be taken in the context. “Our farmers took extraordinary measures in advance of this storm, including moving thousands of animals out of harm’s way as the hurricane approached,” the group said in a statement issued Tuesday. “We believe deeply in our commitment to provide care for our animals amid these incredibly challenging circumstances.” The industry lost about 2,800 hogs during flooding from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Sanderson Farms, a major poultry producer in the state, said it lost about 1.7 million chickens after flooding at more than 60 of the independent farms that supply its poultry processing plants. The company said its facilities suffered no major damage, but supply disruptions and flooded roadways had caused shutdowns at some plants. In addition, about 30 farms near Lumberton have been isolated by flood waters, hampering the delivery of feed to animals. The lack of food could cause additional birds to die if access isn’t restored quickly, the company said. Smithfield Foods, the world’s largest pork producer, said its plants also suffered no significant damage and are operating at limited capacity. The company said it would ramp up production as roads become passable. An environmental threat is also posed by human waste as low-lying municipal sewage plants flood. On Sunday, the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority reported that more than 5 million gallons of partially treated sewage had spilled into the Cape Fear River after power failed at its treatment plant. The Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that 16 community water treatment facilities in North Carolina are unable to supply drinking water and that seven publicly owned sewage treatment works are non-operational due to the flooding. Duke Energy is continuing cleanup operations Tuesday following a weekend breach at a coal ash landfill at its L.V. Sutton Power Station near Wilmington. Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said a full assessment of how much ash escaped from the waterlogged landfill is ongoing. The company initially estimated Saturday that about 2,000 cubic yards (1,530 cubic meters) of ash were displaced, enough to fill about 180 dump trucks. The coal-fired Sutton plant was retired in 2013 and replaced with a new facility that burns natural gas. The company has been excavating millions of tons of leftover ash from old pits there and removing the waste to a new lined landfill constructed on the property. The gray ash left behind when coal is burned contains toxic heavy metals, including arsenic, lead and mercury. Photos from the site provided to AP by Cape Fear River Watch, an environmental advocacy group, show cascades of gray-colored water spilling from at least two breaches at the landfill and flowing toward Sutton Lake, the plant’s former cooling pond which is now used for public recreation, including fishing and boating. Sutton Lake drains into the Cape Fear River. Sheehan said Duke’s assessment is that there was minimal chance any contaminants from the spill had reached the river. At a different power plant near Goldsboro, three old coal ash dumps capped with soil were inundated by the Neuse River. Duke said they had no indication those dumps at the H.F. Lee Power Plant were leaking ash into the river. Duke’s handling of ash waste has faced intense scrutiny since a drainage pipe collapsed under a waste pit at an old plant in Eden in 2014, triggering a massive spill that coated 70 miles (110 kilometers) of the Dan River in gray sludge. The utility later agreed to plead guilty to nine Clean Water Act violations and pay $102 million in fines and restitution for illegally discharging pollution from ash dumps at five North Carolina power plants. It plans to close all its ash dumps by 2029. In South Carolina, workers with electricity provider Santee Cooper erected a temporary dike in hopes of preventing flooding of an old coal ash dump at the demolished Grainger Generating Station near Conway. The dump is adjacent to the Waccamaw River, which is expected to crest at nearly 20 feet (6 meters) this weekend. That’s nine feet above flood stage and would set a new record height.",Rising North Carolina rivers swamped dozens of farm buildings where the animals were being raised for market,2018-09-19T11:55:58Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","3.4 Million Chickens and Turkeys and 5,500 Hogs Have Died in Flooding From Florence",http://time.com/5400429/florence-poultry-hogs/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/florence-flood-poultry-hog.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Hurricane Matthew,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jeff Tollefson,"Hurricane Florence in the Atlantic Ocean, as seen from the International Space Station on 12 September. Credit: NASA Predicting the path and the impacts of tropical cyclones is never easy, but Hurricane Florence, a powerful storm currently bearing down on the United States’s southeastern seaboard, has proved more mercurial than most. Florence has thrived hundreds of kilometres north of typical hurricanes, and is now turning south when the average storm would normally turn north. But forecasting the hurricane’s trajectory is just the first step. Scientists are also racing to project the flooding that will occur as the storm pushes ocean water into the coast and drops rain inland. Civil engineer Rick Luettich specializes in predicting storm surges. Credit: UNC That’s where Rick Luettich comes in. He is a civil engineer who studies storm behaviour at the University of North Carolina in Morehead City, and heads the university’s Coastal Resilience Center, with funding from the US Department of Homeland Security. Luettich and his colleagues specialize in modelling storm surges, which occur as atmospheric pressure drops and powerful winds drive ocean waves into the land. Government agencies use the centre’s projections to prepare communities as storms approach, launch recovery efforts in the aftermath and map out the risk of future floods. In recent days, Luettich has been thinking about parallels between Florence and﻿ other storms — including Hurricane Harvey, which inundated Houston, Texas, in 2017; Hazel, a record storm that hammered the US east coast in 1954; and Matthew, which ravaged Haiti before wreaking havoc across the US southeast in 2016. Luettich says that Florence might well represent a new kind of threat. We asked him to tell us more. What makes Florence so unusual? This storm has a lot of things that are unusual about it. First off, it formed at a fairly high latitude. And the storm has become much more erratic and much slower than past storms. As a result, the impact zone has broadened considerably. We could be looking at a storm that comes to the coast and then stalls, very much like Harvey did. Does climate change have anything to do with it? Interestingly enough, one of the predictions of the past few years is that climate change expands the region over which storms will be initialized. And once they get started, the warmer ocean water can sustain these storms. I’m sure there will be studies post-season, but this may turn out to be one that fits very well into that category of what we may be looking for in the future. What kind of impacts are your models projecting? At this point, what we are looking at is storm surges of 10–12 feet [3–3.6 metres]. That’s about the height of the dunes. We’re expecting major beach erosion. We’re expecting dunes to be eroded. We’re expecting overwash in some areas, and in areas where there is overwash, there will be flooding behind the dunes. It’s a violent process. Much of the region’s coastline is lined by natural strips of sand called barrier islands. How much protection do they provide? The barrier islands are the first line of defence. But we’re expecting water to push up into estuaries that sit behind these barrier islands. Oftentimes they are funnel shaped, so the water can actually hit higher elevations than one sees along the coast. Those estuaries — and creeks and small riverlets — don’t have dunes along the edges of them, so when the water gets in, it spills over. Facilities, buildings and people who are in those areas will see flooding. Why does the speed of the storm matter? It’s a combination of storm surge and flooding due to rainfall. Rather than cross land and continue, this one looks like it’s going to approach land and then perhaps parallel it for a while. Along the way, you’ll see multiple high-tide cycles. A tide of plus or minus 2.5–3 feet [75–90 centimetres] can make a substantial difference. This slow storm paralleling the shore guarantees it’s going to hit at high tide, and probably, several high tides. And then the rainfall associated with a slow moving storm brings water from the back side. I don’t know that we have a good analogue in history. How do you define coastal resilience? Coastal resilience is all about being able to deal with these events better and recover more efficiently. A lot of that has to do with planning, and with understanding people and how they respond. Once one of these events goes by, then you are faced with some sort of recovery process. There’s a lot of social science that goes to trying to manage that process. The immediate reaction is, ‘Boy, I’m going to build this back just the way I had it before.” That is often the worst reaction, but oftentimes it’s the human reaction. People like to live on the coast, and the federal government still subsidizes the practice through flood insurance. Do you think the United States is getting any wiser about coastal development? I’m fundamentally an optimist. There’s evidence that we are making progress. A substantial amount of money from Hurricane Matthew is going to buy outs [of properties in flood-prone areas], so that we can move people who are in the worst locations to areas that are not at risk from these coastal events. This is going to require a culture change. We are seeing signs of that, although it’s flat out not going to happen over night. What happens the day after the storm passes at your lab? We will do our very best recreation of what has happened. We’ll have the benefit of knowing where the storm went, how strong it was, how big it was, how fast it was moving, how much precipitation it actually had. There is a lot of data out there, but with our models, we can really fill in the gaps. FEMA [the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is in charge of the government response] will use that to do initial damage estimates. After that, we’ll go through a very careful analysis of how well our model performed. But to be very honest, there’s another storm that looks like it may be popping up in the Gulf [of Mexico], and so we may just switch gears from this storm to that one.

Natasha Frost,"Hurricane Michael, recently upgraded to a Category 4 storm, could be the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Floridas panhandle region in more than 150 years. Forecasters say it may bring as much as a foot of rain, winds as strong as 150 miles per hour, andperhaps most formidablya storm surge of up to 14 feet. What is a storm surge? A storm surge is created when wind and atmospheric pressure changes cause seas to riseimagine a bulldozer pushing thousands of gallons of ocean water inland into homes and along roads, knocking over anything in its path. If it sounds a little like a tsunami, youre not too far off, as this simulation shows : What can a storm surge do? A surge of just a couple of feet can displace cars and knock people off their feet, then pull them under. At this point, its too late to evacuate. Storm surges are often the deadliest part of a hurricane, particularly above five or six feet, when large objects may be concealed in the flood and propelled along like battering rams. A nine-foot surge, as the Weather Channel reports, is generally not survivable. Michael is projected to hit Florida around the panhandle region, which is especially vulnerable, due to the concave shape of the gulf coast and the adjacent shallow shelf water. National Weather Service warnings caution that some buildings may be completely washed away, and to expect some homes to be left uninhabitable for an extended period after the storm. Massive power outages are all but certain. What is the size of the surge from Hurricane Matthew? As of 11am US eastern time today (Oct. 10), the storm surge in Apalachicola had already reached 6 feet, just shy of its record of 6.4 feet, with waters continuing to rise. Other locations should prepare for even greater storm surges : Aucilla River to Cedar Key: 6 to 9 feet Cedar Key to Chassahowitzka: 4 to 6 feet Chassahowitzka to Anna Maria Island, including Tampa Bay: 2 to 4 feet Okaloosa-Walton county line to Tyndall Air Force Base: 6 to 9 feet Tyndall Air Force Base to Aucilla River: 9 to 14 feet If youre in a surge area, the best thing to do is to heed official advice and evacuate as quickly as possible. Map out your route before you go and ensure your car is full of gas. Do not get on the road without a planned route or a place to go. If its too late, dont assume youll be able to outdrive the surge. Instead, focus on finding shelter, and on getting as high up as you possibly can.","Hurricane Michael, recently upgraded to a Category 4 storm, could be the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Florida’s panhandle region in more than 150…",2018-10-10T17:51:42Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Qz.com'}",The deadliest thing about Hurricane Michael may be a 14-foot storm surge,https://qz.com/1419432/hurricane-michael-what-is-a-storm-surge/,https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RTX6ELZ5-e1539191986888.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1400,,Qz.com,Hurricane Matthew,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Dennis Perkins on News, shared by Dennis Perkins to The A.V. Club","The Daily Show had already booked chef and philanthropist José Andrés to appear on Thursday’s show before Donald Trump started tweeting his latest baseless, self-exonerating conspiracy theory about the number of American citizens who died in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. (Short version, best read in Grampa Simpson voice: “The Democrats are making up dead people to make me look bad!”) But Andrés’ appearance turned out to be uniquely newsworthy, since the renowned chef was right in the thick of the devastation caused by the storm (and exacerbated by the Trump administration’s well-documented neglect), serving millions of meals alongside his organization World Central Kitchen. There to promote his book about the experience, We Fed An Island, Andrés was asked by host Trevor Noah about Trump’s repeated claims of an “A-plus” handling of the crisis. “I mean, we should help our president,” Andrés deadpanned, continuing, “We should be showing empathy he does not have.” The chef, an outspoken Trump critic who once pulled out of a deal to open one of his restaurants at a Trump hotel after Trump’s racist attacks on Mexicans, suggested that Trump’s “stupid tweets” hint that Trump does, indeed, possess the human capacity to feel for others’ suffering, but that it “gets lost between his hair and somewhere else.” Solid enough burn, but Andrés knows plenty about helping others, as he and his organization (which also provided food and assistance to people in Haiti in the wake of Hurricane Matthew and Houston after Hurricane Harvey) spent months on the ground in Puerto Rico. (In fact, his organization is reported to have provided more meals that the Red Cross or Salvation Army, not that anyone’s keeping score.) Speaking of the dedication and resilience of the people of Puerto Rico, the chef told of a little girl who was put in charge of a sandwich assembly line, telling the president, “If a 10-year-old can lead a line of 100 people making sandwiches, shouldn’t you be leading better?”","The Daily Show had already booked chef and philanthropist José Andrés to appear on Thursday’s show before Donald Trump started tweeting his latest baseless, self-exonerating conspiracy theory about the number of American citizens who died in Puerto Rico after…",2018-09-14T11:07:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Avclub.com'}",Chef José Andrés suggests Trump take leadership lessons from Puerto Rican kids on The Daily Show,https://news.avclub.com/chef-jose-andres-suggests-trump-take-empathy-lessons-fr-1829052731,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--ssQpCqBL--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/xocyncplyrwktruo0cte.png",,Avclub.com,Hurricane Matthew,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zahra Hirji,"Wrapped in a white blanket, a small woman with grey hair was rolled out in a wheelchair from the front hall of Cedar Creek Assisted Living, located on the outskirts of Fayetteville, North Carolina, to an evacuation bus waiting in the flooded parking lot. One member of FEMA’s Nebraska Task Force 1 unit held her feet up off the wet ground. Another from the search and rescue squad pushed the wheelchair, and a third held a big blue-and-white striped umbrella, slightly storm-battered, in an effort to shelter the elderly woman from Florence’s constant rains. An iteration of this scene was repeated for the facility’s at least 124 residents, many who are elderly and have severe disabilities, between 7 p.m. and midnight on Saturday, Sept. 15. “I’ve never seen so much help in my life,” said Cherie Readus, the nursing home’s head administrator, when FEMA’s multiple vans full of responders drove up to start the evacuation to Shiloh Methodist, a nearby church. “We didn’t know we were going to evacuate. This church opened up their doors literally at the last minute,” Readus told BuzzFeed News. “Some of our residents are very, very old … You can see the urgency.” As Readus was talking, she was readying food supplies for the shelter and checking in with residents that called her over. Readus has been sleeping over at the shelter for multiple nights, and was planning to stay with the residents at the church. The move came hours after a mandatory evacuation notice was issued for Fayetteville residents living within a mile of the nearby Cape Fear river to leave by mid-day Sunday. While this facility was not within that zone, there was concern about staying as the water rose in the parking lot. According to the National Weather Service, the river levels near the city were upwards of 36 feet by 7 a.m. on Sunday morning, where a major flood level is considered 35 feet. The river levels are expecting to keep rising in the coming days as more rains come down, possibly surpassing the river’s record level of about 58 feet set by Hurricane Matthew in 2016. The nursing home’s residents were told over the intercom that evening they would be moved due to the storm, and to bring themselves and any last minute items to the cafeteria. According to the facility’s staff, they had pre-packed a three-day supply of clothes in advance of the storm, but many residents did not remember. Many of the residents were already in bed when the evacuation announcement came. By the time the FEMA team showed up — a crew of mostly firefighters that drove out from Nebraska — the residents were largely tired, scared, and confused. Speaking to anyone who would listen, the residents during the evacuation would say, “I’m scared.” Or ask, “Can I get more clothes?” “Where are we going?” “What’s going on?"" The residents were a diverse mix of men and women of all races, ages, and disabilities. More than half were in wheelchairs or sitting on their walkers. Some talked to themselves, others screamed incoherently. Most were silent. While the best prepared had on pants, sweaters, and socks and shoes, many wore only t-shirts or nightgowns, and slippers, socks, or nothing on their feet. Compared to evacuating a facility after it has flooded, “this is the time to do it,” David Kirchofer, one of the FEMA responders, told BuzzFeed News. During the Nebraska unit’s deployment to Texas during Hurricane Harvey, they helped rescue wet nursing home residents in a partially flooded building. “We have to help the elderly,” Kirchofer added. During the night, he sung, spoke, and sweet talked to those waiting to be taken to the bus. “I know you’re tired,” he told one woman, and later helped get her a blanket. “A lot of craziness going on right now, isn’t there?” Mark Bridwell, a medical specialist on the FEMA team, told another resident. During the night, Bridwell treated one senior man with chest pains, and initially treated one woman who hurt her ankle before an ambulance showed up. He also had to patch up one of his own guys who smashed several of his fingers, and lost a few fingernails, while carrying out big boxes of the nursing home’s supplies to a bus. For some residents, this was their second Florence evacuation. Earlier in the week, two neighboring facilities – Lumberton Assisted Living and Heritage Place — brought their residents to Creek Side for fear of local flooding. The Lumberton facility evacuated to this same Fayetteville nursing home during Matthew, and the building was so badly damaged residents couldn’t move back for a year, according to Mary Nearly, a Lumberton staff member that followed the residents to Creek Side during Florence. After fixing the floors, the walls, and more, the senior citizens moved back in November 2017. “We are worried,” Nearly said. “We hope we can go back,” Noralene Locklear, another Lumberton staffer, told BuzzFeed News. After the residents got to Creek Side, the power went out. It was pitch black at night, according to Readus, and the power only came back on hours before they decided to evacuate. And at least one of the facilities’ doors was damaged by the storm and won’t properly close. This meant an alarm would intermittently blare during the evacuation, and would have to be repeatedly manually reset. Besides the FEMA team, the evacuation was assisted by members of the US Forest Service, Army officers from the nearby Fort Bragg, and Fayetteville Firefighters. “We have flooding in our city – that’s not unusual,” Mitchell Morgan, Fayetteville’s assistant fire chief, told BuzzFeed News. But the level of flooding expected, he said, “that’s unusual.” During Matthew, the flooding was unexpected and sudden. But this time, it’s slow, and spread out over days. “It’s strange to see and to know it’s coming,” Morgan said. A nursing home in Hope Mills, a nearby town, was evacuated the day before, according to Morgan, and a VA nursing home that houses reportedly more than 100 bed-confined patients will have to be moved on Sunday. More than three hours into the evacuation, Readus retreated to the front office for a brief rest. ""I’ll just be happy when the residents have been moved to safety,"" she said, but noted her job still wouldn't be done. She still needed to alert many of the patient’s families about the evacuation. Once the last resident was loaded into the bus, Roger Bonin, the FEMA chief, said he was proud of his guys for staying so positive and keeping the residents calm. Since the Nebraska unit was deployed last week, this was their first evacuation. “I got a marriage offer,” he later added. One woman told him: ""If you were just a little bit older, and could hold a steady job, I’d marry you.""","“I’ve never seen so much help in my life.” The scene on the ground as FEMA workers rushed to help an assisted living facility in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

WRAL,"By MICHAEL BIESECKER, Associated Press About 3.4 million chickens have been killed in flooding from Florence as rising North Carolina rivers swamped at least 60 farm buildings where the animals were being raised for market, according to the North Carolina Department of Agriculture. Sanderson Farms said Tuesday 1.7 million of the losses occurred at independent farms that supply its poultry processing plants. The company said its facilities suffered no major damage, but supply disruptions and flooded roadways had caused shutdowns at some plants. In addition, about 30 farms near Lumberton have been isolated by flood waters, hampering the delivery of feed to animals. The lack of food could cause additional birds to die if access isn't restored quickly, the company said. The Department of Agriculture said that about 5,500 pigs were also killed in the storm, and that number could changed based on further recovery efforts. The pork industry trade group says farmers have been working before and after the storm to move at-risk animals to higher ground. The industry lost about 2,800 hogs during flooding from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. The Department of Environmental Quality said the earthen dam at one hog lagoon in Duplin County had breached, spilling its contents. Another 25 of the pits containing animal feces and urine have either suffered structural damage, had wastewater levels go over their tops from heavy rains or had been swamped by floodwaters. Large mounds of manure are also typically stored at poultry farms. Even though the sun shown in parts of the state Tuesday, major flooding is continuing after Florence's passage and is expected to worsen in some areas. Sixteen North Carolina rivers were at major flood stage Tuesday with an additional three forecast to peak by Thursday. An environmental threat is also posed by human waste as low-lying municipal sewage plants flood. On Sunday, the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority reported that more than 5 million gallons of partially treated sewage had spilled into the Cape Fear River after power failed at its treatment plant. The Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that 16 community water treatment facilities in North Carolina are unable to supply drinking water and that seven publicly owned sewage treatment works are non-operational due to the flooding. Duke Energy is continuing cleanup operations Tuesday following a weekend breach at a coal ash landfill at its L.V. Sutton Power Station near Wilmington. Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said a full assessment of how much ash escaped from the waterlogged landfill is ongoing. The company initially estimated Saturday that about 2,000 cubic yards (1,530 cubic meters) of ash were displaced, enough to fill about 180 dump trucks. The coal-fired Sutton plant was retired in 2013 and replaced with a new facility that burns natural gas. The company has been excavating millions of tons of leftover ash from old pits there and removing the waste to a new lined landfill constructed on the property. The gray ash left behind when coal is burned contains toxic heavy metals, including arsenic, lead and mercury. Photos from the site provided to AP by Cape Fear River Watch, an environmental advocacy group, show cascades of gray-colored water spilling from at least two breaches at the landfill and flowing toward Sutton Lake, the plant's former cooling pond which is now used for public recreation, including fishing and boating. Sutton Lake drains into the Cape Fear River. Sheehan said Duke's assessment is that there was minimal chance any contaminants from the spill had reached the river. At a different power plant near Goldsboro, three old coal ash dumps capped with soil were inundated by the Neuse River. Duke said they had no indication those dumps at the H.F. Lee Power Plant were leaking ash into the river. Duke's handling of ash waste has faced intense scrutiny since a drainage pipe collapsed under a waste pit at an old plant in Eden in 2014, triggering a massive spill that coated 70 miles (110 kilometers) of the Dan River in gray sludge. The utility later agreed to plead guilty to nine Clean Water Act violations and pay $102 million in fines and restitution for illegally discharging pollution from ash dumps at five North Carolina power plants. It plans to close all its ash dumps by 2029. In South Carolina, workers with electricity provider Santee Cooper erected a temporary dike in hopes of preventing flooding of an old coal ash dump at the demolished Grainger Generating Station near Conway. The dump is adjacent to the Waccamaw River, which is expected to crest at nearly 20 feet (6 meters) this weekend. That's nine feet above flood stage and would set a new record height. ___ Follow Associated Press investigative reporter Michael Biesecker at twitter.com/mbieseck","WRAL.com 3.4 million chickens drown as NC rivers swollen by Florence WRAL.com By MICHAEL BIESECKER, Associated Press.

Lena Grossman,"Matthew McConaughey surprised many first responders all across Houston on Sunday as a part of National First Responders Day. McConaughey and the Bourbon maker Wild Turkey teamed up again this year for the ""Wild Turkey Gives back"" campaign. The True Detective star, who hails from Texas himself, spent the day traveling around to different stations and hospitals in Houston that were impacted by the devastating Hurricane Harvey, which hit the area in the summer of 2017. McConaughey is also the Creative Director of Wild Turkey. The actor was joined by Wild Turkey Master Distiller Eddie Russell and Houston's Mayor Sylvester Turner for the visits to Houston's heroes. McConaughey stopped by Houston Fire Station 26, Houston Police Department, Houston Emergency 911 Call Center and Ben Taub Hospital. The Dallas Buyers Club actor discussed why supporting Hurricane Harvey responders was important to him. ""I'm Texas born and raised, so acknowledging the hard work and dedication of first responders in Houston is meaningful to me personally,"" the actor said in a memo sent to E! News.

Dominique Mosbergen,"Lobbyists and a well-connected GOP political backer played outsized roles in shaping Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt’s travel plans, according to new reports. Pruitt, already the target of multiple investigations for lavish spending and possible ethics violations, relied on the same lobbyist who helped plan a controversial trip to Morocco in December to arrange details of travel to Australia earlier last year, CNN reported on Thursday. Additionally, Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate and GOP backer, played a major role in helping shape Pruitt’s planned trip to Israel in February, The Washington Post reported. It’s very unusual for a person outside government to arrange travel plans for a Cabinet official, ethics experts have noted, and some critics have questioned whether Pruitt violated federal law by recruiting lobbyists and friends for this role. Public officials are prohibited from using their position to financially benefit friends. The Post reported that Pruitt had been enlisting “well-connected friends and political allies” to help plan overseas travel since he took office. “Pruitt drew up a list of at least a dozen countries he hoped to visit and urged aides to help him find official reasons to travel,” the paper added. Reports earlier this week revealed that Pruitt relied heavily on a longtime friend and former Comcast lobbyist, Richard Smotkin, to help plan his expensive trip to Morocco. Smotkin reportedly was hired as a lobbyist by the Moroccan government shortly after Pruitt’s visit, raising questions about whether the embattled EPA chief’s trip served to benefit Smotkin financially. Smotkin also was involved in Pruitt planned trip to Australia last year, according to CNN. The lobbyist played a “critical” role in connecting the EPA head to Matthew Freedman, treasurer of the business lobby group the American Australian Council, and intended to travel to Australia with Pruitt, according to the report. Freedman reportedly also was involved in planning the Australia trip and conferred with Pruitt’s staff to arrange the EPA chief’s schedule and talking points. Freedman suggested to Pruitt’s aides that the Institute of Public Affairs, a climate skeptic think tank, serve as co-host of Pruitt’s visit, reported The Guardian this week, citing emails recently released to the Sierra Club under the Freedom of Information Act. The Australia visit, which had been slated to take place around September 2017, was eventually canceled. The EPA said at the time that Hurricane Harvey had derailed Pruitt’s travel schedule. The planned trip to Israel in February was canceled days before the EPA head was scheduled to leave, after news broke that Pruitt’s first-class travel had cost taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars. An Adelson associate reportedly met with two Pruitt aides to discuss the Israel itinerary in the days leading up to Pruitt’s departure. Adelson was said to have helped connect Pruitt with Water-Gen, an Israeli water purification company that makes products the EPA recently agreed to test. On Thursday, Democratic lawmakers wrote to the EPA administrator calling for more details about “the role Mr. Adelson or other non-governmental officials played” in the agreement with Water-Gen and the planned trip to Israel. How influential outsiders have played a role in Pruitt's travel, after he charted at least a dozen countries he wanted to visit over the course of a year. W/ @brady_dennis https://t.co/FSpjZg1iCt — Juliet Eilperin (@eilperin) May 4, 2018 Pruitt is already facing multiple federal investigations into his spending and potential ethics lapses, including a $50-a-night condo he rented from the wife of an energy lobbyist. The New York Times reported Thursday that Pruitt secretly purchased a home with a lobbyist when he was a state senator in Oklahoma. The lobbyist at the time was pushing changes in workers’ compensation rules that Pruitt championed in the legislature, according to the report. Amid the storm of scandals, three of Pruitt’s top aides ― his top spokeswoman, a top aide on toxic cleanups and the head of his security detail ― abruptly resigned this week.

JT Genter,"Hurricane Michael officially made landfall around 2pm ET on the Florida Gulf Coast just southeast of Panama City, FL. As of the National Hurricane Center advisory just before landfall, the hurricane packed top sustained winds of 155mph and had a central pressure of 919 millibars. This landfall will go down in the record books as the strongest hurricane measured by both wind speed and pressure to make landfall on the contiguous US since 1969 when the Hurricane Camille slammed into Mississippi, killing 259 and causing $1.43 billion (inflation-adjusted) in damages. Hurricane Michael is likely to be the third straight M-named hurricane to be retired after 2016’s Hurricane Matthew and 2017’s Hurricane Maria. The incredible power of the storm is pummeling the Florida coast with a lot more than just winds and rain. The storm surge was predicted to be between 9-14 feet at the worst. And the Apalachicola, FL tide gauge that we’ve been monitoring the past few days has spiked up to 8.5 feet of storm surge: Six airports in the Florida Panhandle announced closures ahead of the storm. Currently, 11 airfields have been shut down — including Albany (ABY) and Valdosta (VLD) in Georgia and Dothan Regional Airport (DHN) in Alabama. Airfields closed due to Hurricane Michael, effective 1:53pm ET Wednesday. Image generated via Great Circle Mapper. As the hurricane quickly sweeps through the Southeast, we will likely see additional small airport closures as well as delays and cancellations at larger airports. Delta’s Atlanta (ATL) and American Airlines’ Charlotte (CLT) are going to avoid direct hits by Hurricane Michael. Current wind speed probabilities put less than a 30% chance of tropical storm force winds at either airport. However, both are likely to suffer delays and cancellations as conditions worsen. FlightAwares cancellation tracker counts 298 flights that have been cancelled so far Wednesday with another 126 cancelled for Thursday and 26 for Friday. Heres the total number of cancellations for Tuesday-Friday for airports in the path of the storm: Charlotte (CLT): 139 cancellations Atlanta (ATL): 96 cancellations Pensacola (PNS): 70 cancellations Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport (VPS): 56 cancellations Panama City (ECP): 54 cancellations Tallahassee (TLH): 53 cancellations Charleston, SC (CHS): 33 cancellations Between these airport closures and airlines wanting to stay far from the core of the historic hurricane, there’s quite a gap in the airspace around Hurricane Michael: Having to go around such a massive storm is requiring some airlines to take a substantially longer route. For example, American Airlines isn’t getting anywhere close to the core of the storm. Meanwhile, Spirit is cutting it a lot closer and Southwest is taking the shortest route going over the core of the hurricane: While most airlines are giving the hurricane a wide berth and many airfields closed in the path of the storm, airlines are still operating in and out of Mobile (MOB) and, of course, you know how Delta loves to fly in and around hurricanes. A SkyWest-operated Delta Connection flight landed in Mobile (MOB) just after 11am CT on a flight in from Atlanta (ATL): Shortly after, the flight turned and flew back to Atlanta (ATL), taking off shortly before 12pm CT in light winds. Although earlier flights into Mobile had diverted perhaps emboldened by Delta’s success United (ExpressJet) and American (Mesa) are also now operating flights into the outskirts of Hurricane Michael.

Aimée Lutkin,"On Monday, Homeland Security official announced the end of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for the almost 60,000 Haitian people living in the US since their country suffered massive damage from an earthquake in 2010. People previously allowed to live and work here under TPS have until July 2019 to leave, or face deportation. The New York Times reports that TPS for Haiti was last extended in May, but for only 6 months, with former Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly warning that Haitians “need to start thinking about returning.” TPS status is regularly reviewed, and the Obama administration also rescinded it for various countries in Africa affected by the ebola outbreak. According to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security, conditions in Haiti have improved: “Since the 2010 earthquake, the number of displaced people in Haiti has decreased by 97 percent,” the statement said. “Significant steps have been taken to improve the stability and quality of life for Haitian citizens, and Haiti is able to safely receive traditional levels of returned citizens.” But this assertion is widely contested, with many saying Haiti is in no condition to suddenly provide for 60,000 people. In addition to slow recovery from the 2010 earthquake, the country sustained considerable damage during Hurricane Matthew, in 2016. The program was created in 1990 as a way to protect residents whose home countries are too dangerous to return to, and serves 320,000 people living in the US. Last month, acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke ended Temporary Protected Status for Nicaragua, which includes about 2,500 people. Haitians are the second largest group currently under TPS in the US after people from El Salvador. El Salvador’s TPS is under review, and an announcement regarding their status is expected next month.","On Monday, Homeland Security official announced the end of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for the almost 60,000 Haitian people living in the US since their country suffered massive damage from an earthquake in 2010.

Tom Popomaronis,"Every month, I have a 'what I need to re-stock on from Amazon' day. This month, it was time to replace my water filter, so off to Amazon I went. I searched for 'water filter', scanned through the first page of results (because who goes to the second page... seriously ) and found what appeared to be a winner. Amazon Best Seller : Check Amazon Prime : Check Price Point : Surprisingly low (but how?) Usually, the lower the price, the happier I am. However, ever since I wrote about price gauging and what seemed to be suspicious Amazon activity, I've been particularly interested in exploring anything that raised an eyebrow, even if the price was favorable to a consumer. So, I loaded up on the coffee and got to work. It might sound like a conspiracy theory worthy of Chinatown, but don't break out your tinfoil hats just yet. Look at the Waterdrop water filter. It's a hot product from an Amazon Top 500 seller, a company called EcoLife Technologies LLC. But, it's totally going against Amazon's rules. The Epic Policy Contradiction Last year, Amazon added strict requirements for water filters sold on its platform. The e-tailer said it would suppress any item listings that didn't fulfill its standards. Any suppressed item Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) was liable to be destroyed or returned at the seller's expense. Each product ""must be certified to at least the NSF/ANSI-42 standard (including Material Safety, Structural Integrity, and System Performance)."" The key point here is ""System Performance."" Here's where things get interesting. If you look at the NSF's website, you'll find that EcoLife's products don't adhere to Amazon's System Performance standards. As quoted on the NSF's site: ""Conforms to the material and structural integrity requirements only."" Does this mean that Amazon is selling us water filters that are underperforming? Not necessarily, no, but I do know that Amazon apparently let this company slip through their filter (pun intended). Oh, but the fun doesn't end there. I did a little more research and found some surprising facts. First. EcoLife Technologies LLC is registered in both California and Colorado (the official website says they are in California ). Okay, not a big deal -- but I also found out that EcoLife gets their water filters imported from China through a company called Qingdao Ecopure Filter Co., which produces EcoAqua filters. Further, there's a UK company called Waterdrop Filters whose website is registered to someone at VYAIR, another manufacturer which sells EcoAqua filters on Amazon. Hmmm...curious What's going on here? Well, it's a possibility that EcoLife isn't from the US and is just using the system for their own gain. The NSF site shows that EcoLife has a Nevada area code, a Colorado address, but that the facility is in China. It's also likely that EcoLife is both the manufacturer and seller as there's not enough markup to indicate reselling. Don't get me wrong. I love Amazon and all its great deals. But I think criticism should be given when it's due and such curious behavior shouldn't go unnoticed. It's not the first time, either. Last year, I chastised Amazon for blaming its algorithm when it allowed sellers to hike up water prices during Hurricane Irma. Others have criticized the platform for wooing Chinese vendors which produced counterfeit goods. A t-shirt designer named Matthew Snow found that 15-20 sellers in Hong Kong and China were duplicating his products. To fight this, Snow was required to ""test buy"" all 1,500 counterfeited items and send them, along with his legitimate items, to Amazon for testing - something which would've cost him $40,000.

KENDRA PIERRE-LOUIS,"Last week, Andy Curliss, chief executive of the North Carolina Pork Council, said that the pig producers had learned a lot from Hurricane Floyd. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew caused 14 lagoons to flood but none breached, according to the pork council. “A lot of the farms that were flooded were bought out and closed,” he said. “That’s why you didn’t see the same impact in Matthew — we had maybe 15 floods, no breaches.” As of Tuesday afternoon, the North Carolina Pork Council’s website listed only 26 lagoons as affected by the storm, far fewer than the number cited by the Department of Environmental Quality. As Florence approached, farmers tried to free up more space in lagoons ahead of the storm by spraying manure onto fields, said Heather Overton, a spokeswoman for the state’s Agriculture Department. Will Hendrick, a staff attorney with the environmental nonprofit group Waterkeeper Alliance, said that manure sprayed on fields could run off into rivers, streams, and groundwater supplies if the fields flooded.","At least 77 lagoons in North Carolina have either released pig waste into the environment or are at imminent risk of doing so, according to state officials.",2018-09-19T09:00:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Lagoons of Pig Waste Are Overflowing After Florence.

Alejandro Tauber,"We should have known that Facebook was abusing our data. Why? Because lots of privacy activists told us so. Since most of them are too good of a human to rub that in our nose, we went ahead and forced them to accept our spoonfed quote. Hopefully, next time we will listen. Rick Falkvinge, founder Pirate Party “ I told you so. ” Also, “We told you about the NSA, and you didn’t listen. We told you about Facebook, and you didn’t listen. A surveillance society can be erected in just ten years, but takes centuries to roll back. Please pay attention to what’s happening before we’ve got generations of dystopic work ahead of us. The civil liberties of our parents are not being passed down to our children.” Cory Doctorow, author, editor of Boing Boing “ I told you so. ” And added: “One more thing: I think this is the moment of ‘peak indifference.’ We spent 20 years trying to get ppl to care about privacy, but failed, for the same reason that climate change warnings fell on deaf ears: a powerful mix of expensively sown doubt from profiteers and the difficulty of understanding consequences that are separated by a lot of time and space from their actions. No one could get better at hitting a ball if they only found out which swings connected twenty years after the fact — the outcomes of our privacy choices are often not manifested for decades. Once the consequences roll in — whether its Cambridge Analytica or Hurricane Maria — we hit peak indifference. From now on, the number of ppl who understand there’s a problem will only ever go up, because we’ve carbonized the atmosphere (and also filled the online atmosphere with critical masses of immortal personal information smog) and the effects of that pollution will mount and mount, remorselessly, and it will become harder and harder to deny that there is a problem. After peak indifference, tactics change. We don’t need to devote nearly as much energy to convincing people that there’s a problem; our failures to do so in the decades gone by will do that job for us. Now we need to convince them that something can be done about it. Instead of warning them that FB and the rest of the surveillance-industrial complex are bad for their health, now we have to convince them that FB and their pals *knew* they were melting the world, and that they did it anyway, because they figured they’d make so much money from their despoilment that they could afford private guards and high ground to retreat to as the floodtides rose. Now our job is to give people the names and phone numbers and home addresses of the despoilers, and start handing out pitchforks and torches.” Aral Balkan, digital activist Credit: Wikimedia “I told you so.” Also, “Yes, I’ve been warning about the dangers of surveillance capitalism and data collection by the likes of Google, Facebook and the entire adtech industry for years. In fact, here, “have a cookie” because you’re being tracked by those same companies as you read this very article on The Next Web. (Unless you have a tracker blocker active, that is.) No, there’s no pleasure in being right about this. Especially when this toxic business model is so ubiquitous that you cannot even read about it without being exposed to it. Surveillance Capitalism isn’t just how Facebook and Google make money, it is how most publishers, including The Next Web make money. Thankfully, there are people working on ethical alternatives to this mainstream like the federated Twitter alternative Mastodon and Indienet; our own federated personal web site project supported by the The City of Ghent. If you want a future where you can live without constantly being tracked and profiled, help fund and support such initiatives.” Andrew Keen, author The Internet Is Not the Answer Credit: Wikimedia “I told you so.” But also: “Actually I didn’t tell you so. I was mostly wrong. In 2007, I predicted that Facebook wouldn’t grow into a significant business. What did I ever know?” Esther Dyson, author, chair EDventure Holdings Credit: Wikimedia “I told you so.” And, “I would actually say that the “I told you so!” is more about individuals’ responsibility for understanding what is going on… rather than expecting a for-profit, Silicon Valley company to be a protector of their products’ “rights.” (And it’s certainly not about FB in particular, because I probably said it back in the 90s. Facebook’s product is users’ attention (sold to advertisers), and that has been clear for a long time. Yes, in addition FB was extremely careless in terms of monitoring third parties’ (e.g. Cambridge Analytica’s) behavior. But to say that this is unexpected or a surprise is about as sensible as saying that sexual harassment by people with power is a surprise. “Everyone” knew, but there was collective reluctance to take on the issue at a scale that would actually have impact. And now, in both cases, things have changed. In essence, FB’s problem is a supply-chain problem: They don’t want to know the details of how their customers’ attention is created/attracted. The attention/advertising business is a murky world of packagers and resellers and “well, we had a contract with them but of course we had no way of actually monitoring their adherence.” now, as with food and labor, people are demanding that the final seller look back into the supply chain.” Peter Sunde, founder The Pirate Bay, Njalla, Flattr Credit: Wikimedia “I told you so.” Also, “Well, you can call me Nostradamus if you ’d like, because I ’m always right. It’s not even hard to see what’s coming in the near future, just look at history and know that it repeats itself. It’s a saying because it’s true. :) So, yeah, I did tell everyone this. Lots of times. And was always surprised at how little people have cared about this. I even hoped for a crash, similar to what has happened now with Cambridge Anal ytica, since people need a wakeup call. Look at what Swedish TV reported about Grindr (the HIV-thing) and people might realise that we’re lucky it wasn’t worse than just getting Trump elected… :-)” Richard Stallman, president Free Software Foundation Credit: Wikimedia “I told you so.” But, “If you quote me as saying ‘ I told you so,’ in a context that limits it to Facebook, that would misrepresent me. It would be a gross understatement. What I have told people, for years, is: The only database of personal data that can’t be used to hurt us is the one that is not collected. For your freedom’s sake, join me in rejecting and resisting systems that collect data about our actions, communications and movements. Want to quote me saying that?” Cindy Cohn, executive director Electronic Frontier Foundation “I told you so.” Moreover: “For reference, it’s not just Facebook, but rather the whole system of ad-based models.

The Associated Press,"This time-lapsed video shows a NOAA airplane passing through Hurricane Florence near Bermuda. USA TODAY A passenger plane soaring into the sky. (Photo: GETTY IMAGES) Safety officials say a near collision of airliners in San Francisco last year was a few feet from becoming the worst crash in aviation history. The National Transportation Safety Board issued a final report Thursday on the incident in which an Air Canada jet nearly crashed into planes lined up on the ground at San Francisco International Airport shortly before midnight on July 7, 2017. Only a few feet of separation prevented this from possibly becoming the worst aviation accident in history, NTSB Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg said in a statement accompanying the report. The Air Canada jet swooped to just 60 feet above the ground while passing over other planes packed with passengers waiting to take off. Another board member, Earl Weener, said the Air Canada plane came within feet of hitting another plane and colliding with several others. Over 1,000 people were at imminent risk of serious injury or death, he said. The deadliest aviation accident occurred in 1977, when two Boeing 747 jets collided on a runway in Tenerife on the Canary Islands, leaving 583 people dead.

The National Transportation Safety Board issued a final report Thursday, Oct. 11, 2018 on the July 2017 close call in which an Air Canada jet nearly crashed into planes lined up on the ground at San Francisco International Airport. (Photo: Jeff Chiu, AP) The Air Canada pilots were slow to report the incident to superiors, underscoring the need for faster reporting of dangerous incidents before evidence is lost. The Air Canada captain, identified in NTSB documents as Dimitrios Kisses, was supposed to report the San Francisco incident to the airline as soon as possible but didnt because he was very tired and it was late. He waited until the next day. By that time, the plane was used for another flight, and the audio loop on the cockpit voice recorder was taped over. The NTSB did not allege that Kisses and co-pilot Matthew Dampier deliberately delayed reporting the incident, but it did say that investigators could have gained a better understanding of what the crew was doing before the close call. The NTSB is considering recommending that cockpit recorders capture the last 25 hours of flying time, up from two hours under current rules. Board member Weener also criticized the airline industrys reliance on self-reporting of safety issues, saying the industry and the Federal Aviation Administration should consider stronger measures to intervene after a dangerous situation. Weener noted that other pilots were alert enough to turn on lights to warn the off-course Air Canada jet. Yet once the danger passed, he said, they took no action to prompt an intervention and evaluation of the Air Canada crew. The five-member board determined last month that the incident was caused by the Air Canada pilots being confused because one of two parallel runways was closed that night. The closure was noted in a briefing to the pilots, and nine other planes had made routine landings after the runway was shut down. The safety board also criticized the FAA for having just one controller on duty at the time of the incident, and recommended better lighting to tell pilots when a runway is closed at night.

(Photo: Jacquelyn Martin, AP) Kavanaugh showdown set In what's sure to be a historic day in Washington and beyond, lawmakers and the American public will hear Thursday from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the first of multiple women who have accused the judge of sexual misconduct. A college professor, Ford alleges Kavanaugh pinned and groped her and tried to pull off her clothes in 1982 while both were in high school. Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied Ford's accusation, as well as other women's claims of sexual assault and harassment and of facilitating gang rapes. President Donald Trump, who nominated Kavanaugh for the nation's highest court and has defended him amid the allegations, said he'll be watching the hearing and that it's possible he could change his mind on Kavanaugh. Rosenstein watch: Meeting with Trump may have to wait The future of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation appeared to hang in the balance earlier this week amid reports that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could exit the Justice Department. But President Trump said at a news conference Wednesday he would ""much prefer keeping"" him. Trump was slated to meet with Rosenstein Thursday after reports the deputy AG talked about considering secretly recording Trump and invoking the 25th Amendment to seek the president's removal. Trump said that Rosenstein assured him the reports weren't true and that he may delay the meeting in order to not distract from the hearing on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

Neil Patel,"I’m a bit of a cable news junkie. Now, I don’t watch it often, but am generally more interested how a news product can draw people in hold their attention for hours, and keep them coming back everyday. But why is this so interesting? And why should marketers care? Because news itself can be pretty boring. For your average 9-5 American with two kids and a mortgage, there’s not a big reason to watch news. And the thing is, news outlets know this. They know reporting on the latest earthquake in Oklahoma is mundane and doesn’t matter. Unless you spice it up a little bit. Get people’s emotions involved. Make viewers scared or angry. So here’s why all marketers can take a lesson from cable news. Cable News is Entertainment Masquerading as News Their expertise does not lie in reporting the news or helping you understand the world’s events. Instead, they’re experts at messaging and grabbing your attention and holding it for hours, everyday. Because the only way to get viewers is to entertain. It’s designed for channel changers. Those people with their hand on the television remote, flipping through channels. Cable news is designed to capture that 1-2 seconds of the channel changer, and holding that attention. In this post, I’m going to examine the different ways news programs (primarily CNN and Fox) use emotions and classic Hollywood-style entertainment techniques to grab viewer’s attention and make sure they come back night after night. Then, we’ll see how marketers can steal these for their own gain. 1. Use Numbers to Your Advantage Numbers can tell a story. They let the viewer understand impacts and effects. Numbers can be attention grabbing. And cable outlets know this. They love using numbers, especially when it relates to danger. Don’t believe me? Just wait for a hurricane or any other major natural disaster. You’ll see cable and other news programs use numbers whenever a hurricane hits the U.S. And it’s generally meant for fear mongering. It’s typically “5 million people in the storm’s path” and “13,000 homes underwater” and “20 million people under evacuation orders”. It’s forceful messaging that grabs attention. Here, in big text, Fox tells viewers how many are without power: CNN uses a different number, but makes it clear so the channel changers see it right away: During Hurricane Matthew, Fox reports on evacuation numbers : Here’s how CNN reports on Hurricane Maria: Rescues underway in Puerto Rico as Millions Without Power captures the eye. It takes a few seconds to read, but draws you in. Who would turn the channel after reading that banner? Another hurricane, and more attention grabbing numbers. And if that wasn’t enough, they also threw one of their correspondents into a hurricane! This correspondent is away from the hurricane, but that doesn’t stop them from throwing the Millions Could Be WIthout Electricity For Weeks banner: You get the idea. Numbers grab people’s attention. They may not hold the attention for a long time, but they do catch the eye. Now, let’s look at how some marketers are using numbers to their advantage, and how you can as well. Lessons For Marketers Some marketers use numbers as social proof. Help Scout uses numbers to show how many customers they have: Or to encourage you to signup for their email list: LifeLock uses numbers to sow fear (more on that later) for visitors – and make their product the protection: It’s also important to note that they’re using a recent data breach to sell their product. If marketing is all about timing, then LifeLock is getting their marketing right and profiting from it by pouncing on opportunities. McDonalds used to post the “Billions and Billions served” under the golden arches. Here they give a more specific number while keeping the emphasis, billions served, the same. Rainforest Trust, an organization that preserves forests, tells visitors how many acres of forest they’ve saved: Combine that with a call to action to save more land, and it makes for a great use of numbers to draw donations. I’ll frequently use numbers in blog posts to capture reader’s attention. In one of my videos, I give the reader a specific number: Think about it – what headline would get more people to read my article (or in this case, watch the video): How I Built 23,540 Unique Links to NeilPatel.com Or this headline: How I Built Links to NeilPatel.com The number adds to the impact and gives the headline more of a “punch”. I didn’t just build a few links – I built over 20,000 links to the Neil Patel blog. I guarantee that I got more views on this video because I gave readers a specific number. On the Quick Sprout blog, I’ve used this advertisement for many years with a lot of success: I didn’t just increase pageviews. I helped a company grow to 500 million pageviews. In this video, I give viewers a few numbers to chew on in my intro: What’s the message here? Rich people listen to podcasts. The impact? 60% of podcast listeners make over $150,000. And they listen to roughly 5 hours of podcasts per week. I used the cable news model – what’s the story, and how do you capture people’s attention using numbers to explain the impact? So, how can you use numbers to persuade? Here are a few ideas: Try adding numbers for social proof. How many customers to do you have? If you have a lot relative to the market you’re in, put it on your homepage. Let people know how many people are using your products and services. Add numbers in testimonials. You didn’t just save a customer some money. How much did you save them? Add numbers to the results you achieved. This is particularly useful if you’re a freelance. You didn’t just help Widget’s Inc improve conversions; you helped them double their conversions in 3 months. It’s more specific, and packs a punch. An x increase in x amount of time. Now let’s move onto another favorite tactic of cable news outlets, instilling fear. What better way to hold a viewer’s attention? 2. Fear Will Grab Attention Watching news media outlets in the summer and fall of 2014, you’d think that walking outside would make you susceptible to Ebola. This is despite four cases of ebola and just one death. This CNN headline takes advantage of two things people are scared of – deadly diseases and terrorist organizations. If you’re flipping through channels, what does this headline do to you? It grabs your attention. Makes you stop and turn up the volume, lean in, pay attention, and maybe makes you a little scared. For some people, it may make them think the end of the world is near. In this way, fear picks up where the numbers left off. The numbers will capture the eye of channel surfers, and the emotion of fear will keep them glued to you for hours. CNN wasn’t alone with the fear-mongering. Here’s the version from Fox : Did any of these things come true? Was Ebola used as a biological agent? Did terrorist organizations contaminate the water supply with the Ebola virus and hurt millions? Of course not! But it’s easy to say it now. Back then, Ebola covered the news cycle. People were scared. So the headlines that cable news outlets used capitalized on that fear (which news itself built) and only grew that fear that most people already had. Just watch as Jon Stewart brilliantly tears down the news media’s attempts to dramatize the Ebola outbreak: So, how can you use fear marketing ? Lessons for Marketers Perhaps the most common use of fear is the Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). And with FOMO, you can use two classic tactics – scarcity and urgency. This Facebook ad has a good message. Anyone that’s scrolling through Facebook, sees this ad, and likes the shirt will buy it. It’s limited edition, meaning that it won’t be around for a long time, and now there’s only a few left in stock? Where do I place my order? This Facebook ad has a simple FOMO message. The pre-sale is available now. Get your tickets before anyone else or else you’ll miss out. The “best worst movie” The Room recently had a nationwide one-day special screening.

Because it works really well. As long as you have a product or service that people want and value, adding some scarcity to it will make people buy it up as quickly as possible. Think about it – if your product is widely available, will anyone be in a hurry to buy it? Probably not. They may even rethink buying it. But adding a little scarcity to it will make people value it more and makes them more likely to buy. I’ve used FOMO before to promote some of my webinars: My webinar is starting in two minutes, better not miss it! The other way marketers use fear is to buy some protection against a threat. We saw the example above with Lifelock. Millions of people potentially have their identity stolen? And we sell identity theft protection? Cha-ching! Ramit Sethi wants to make it clear – use his courses and you’ll learn how to make more money. If you don’t use it, you’re not making your earnings potential (thus you’re Missing Out on money that could be yours): The quiz is a lead generation tool. Start the quiz, give them your email to get the results, and you’ll be thrown into a drip campaign in no time. And then start making more money in “as little as an hour”. Who could pass that up? Viruses and malware spreading across computers isn’t as common as it once was, but customers are still afraid of their computer becoming “infected”. And Symantec marketers use that fear: These marketers use the fear as a lead generation tool. Who’s clicking on this link and reviewing the cleanup plan? Time to retarget them and sell our antivirus software. Use fear at the right times. Marketing is about timing; so don’t rely on fear all the time. Use it at the appropriate time and it will be more effective for you. Use fear like you’d use a service, only at the right time, for a limited amount of time, and for the appropriate use. 3. Use Bold Graphics Television is the ultimate vision medium, and much of the web is as well. Boring graphics with bland colors won’t draw viewers. Let’s face it – people don’t want to read a wall of text, and they don’t want to read long headlines. They want fancy colors and beautiful people reading them the news. When Jeff Zucker took over CNN, he was charged with turning around a ratings decline. One of the first things they did was debut a new graphics package : Large, bold typography combined with all capitalization on a white background Have you watched The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer lately? You’d think their news set was taken straight from a Hollywood movie: Just take a look at that set! Dozens of different images on at once (in the background), big typography on the screens, and combined with the Breaking News headline (because apparently everything is breaking news) and the countdown clock makes this the perfect cable news show. We’re “awaiting”, which means viewers can’t click away, the countdown clock (which starts with at least *29 hours*) means that even if you leave to watch something else, you’ll have to come back and see where the clock is now and continually check to see if the Shutdown Countdown is called off. This is turning the political theater that is Washington, DC into theater television. Jeff Zucker, I admire you. Well-done sir. Lessons For Marketers The lesson here is to find the balance between big graphics that stand out without overwhelming. Combine great graphics and design with strong messaging (like cable news) and you’ll earn the visitors attention. The graphics I use on Neil Patel use bold colors combined with simple messaging. Do you want more traffic to your site? Put in your URL and see what I can do for you. The graphics stand out, the message is clear, now the choice is up to the visitor. The Apple Homepod page uses big typography and beautiful image of the product: Go ahead and visit the HomePod page and scroll through. Just try to click away. You can’t do it. Why? Because it unfolds like a product description. The graphics keep you scrolling and the copy keeps you reading. The font is big, bold, and stands out against a white background. And the product images draw the eye in. The Red Cross homepage has one job – get donations from visitors. Here, they don’t use beautiful graphics. Because why would you do that if you want people to donate to a project in need? They need to see sadness or human struggle. So, they go with this: The little girl holding the little puppy after what appears to be a natural disaster. They’re saved, but sad and clearly in need. How can you help? Give them some money so they “respond to someone in crisis”. Charity: Water uses graphics to show visitors what they’ll accomplish with a donation – helping rural and poorer countries get access to clean, drinkable water: This is an example of marketers using an end result to deliver conversions. Clean water coming out of a jug. A happy woman that finally receives uncontaminated water. It’s not about the organization or the charity, it’s about the mission and what it accomplishes for people. Visitors want to know why they should donate, and this graphic makes it clear. Conclusion So why does any of this matter to marketers? Because it teaches us about messaging, catching and keeping someone’s attention. And in today’s world, it’s a marvel at how cable news does this. They take a boring product (news) and turn it into entertainment that some people can’t look away. Your product may be exciting to you, but to others it may come across as boring. You should be aware of this and appeal to people’s interests. The classic things that capture people’s attention and hold it. Use numbers to people can understand your impact, use fear to sell, and graphics to keep people’s attention. What have you, as a marketer, learned from cable news or any great television producers?

David Cohen,"Facebook and the American Red Cross are teaming up to ensure that people are prepared for this year’s Atlantic hurricane season, which begins Friday. The social network said more people visit its Crisis Response center during hurricanes than during any other type of event, adding that Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Matthew were among the top 10 crises that spurred people to use its Safety Check feature, which has been used more than 9 million times during and after hurricanes. More than 1.5 million people have joined groups related to hurricane-relief efforts, Facebook added. Facebook and the American Red Cross shared the following tips for staying safe during hurricane season, also directing users here to learn more: Build an emergency kit with one gallon of water per person, per day; non-perishable food; a flashlight; a battery-powered radio; a first aid kit; medications; supplies for an infant, if applicable; a multipurpose tool; personal hygiene items; copies of important papers; cell-phone chargers; extra cash; blankets; maps of the area; and emergency contact information. Many of these items are available through the Red Cross Store. Talk with household members and create an evacuation plan. Practicing the plan minimizes confusion and fear during the event. Be informed. Learn about the community’s emergency-response plan. Plan routes to local shelters, register family members with special medical needs as required and make plans for pets. The two organizations added that social media is critical to emergency preparedness, response and recovery. One of the best ways to prepare for hurricane season is to learn about how you can use social media to connect and find support during a crisis. Facebook’s Crisis Response allows people affected by a crisis to tell friends they’re safe, find or offer help and get the latest news and information. Specifically, you can use Crisis Response to: Quickly let your loved ones know you’re safe and, if you know people near the affected area, you can also ask them to mark themselves safe. Connect with other people affected by crises to give or get resources like water, supplies or shelter from one another Find up-to-date information about a crisis from a variety of news sources. Donate or raise money to support those affected by crises.","Facebook and the American Red Cross are teaming up to ensure that people are prepared for this year's Atlantic hurricane season, which begins Friday.

Aditi Shrikant,"Why some people buy Pop-Tarts and liquor before a hurricane — and some people don’t prepare at all. Florida’s government ordered at least 120,000 people from the panhandle to evacuate in preparation for Hurricane Michael’s landfall on Wednesday. The effects of the Category 4 storm will be felt not only on the state’s coast, but in Georgia, Virginia, and the Carolinas, which are still recovering from Hurricane Florence. These effects include life-threatening winds and coastal flooding that could reach 9 to 14 feet in some areas. A Category 4 storm has never made landfall in this region of Florida. While the conditions have caused some to flee the coast, as always, there are those who are staying put and preparing to weather the storm. Hurricane prep includes sealing windows and doors, boarding up windows, and shopping for the essentials like food, water, and batteries. This scurry for supplies often leads to chaos. Frenzied grocery stores are a common, understandable side effect of hurricane preparation. The stores stock extra cases of water, batteries, and toilet paper in anticipation of crowds, and the stereotype is that people stock up on bread, milk, and eggs. But there’s more to hurricane preparation than the basics; while some people buy comfort foods, others don’t prepare at all. Why some people indulge and others ignore has a lot to do with how we feel safe in this country, and whom we trust to warn us when disaster hits. Why Walmart stocks up on strawberry Pop-Tarts When Hurricane Isaac was descending on Louisiana in 2012, Elyria Kemp was there to study how people felt about the disaster. In her 2014 report “ The Calm before the Storm: Examining Emotion Regulation Consumption in the Face of an Impending Disaster,” she detailed the heightened emotions residents experienced in the lead-up to the storm, and what they consumed because of them. The most common emotional responses were anxiety, fear, anger, and sadness. And the most common purchases? Unsurprisingly, bottled water, batteries, and flashlights, but also cookies, chips, and alcohol. “These negative emotional experiences lead them to not only purchase the necessities one may need during a hurricane; they also would buy hedonic products,” Kemp says. The tendency of those bracing for a hurricane to stockpile junk food has been well-documented. In 2004, Walmart reported that it orders extra strawberry Pop-Tarts before a hurricane because sales spike significantly. Liquor and beer sales also rise, and many people throw hurricane parties. Milk, bread, and eggs have also been noticed as a natural disaster preparation trifecta ( dubbed the Trinity of Winter-Storm Panic-Shopping by the Atlantic), despite their short shelf life. In September, the Charlotte Observer reported that “jugs of milk and loaves of bread were flying off the shelves” by those preparing for Hurricane Florence, to which one reader commented: “You want to know why other parts of the country think Southerners are dumb? Well, if you expect to be without power for days or weeks, loading up on the 2 most perishable items (milk, bread) is about the dumbest thing you can do.” But what said reader and many others may not understand is that buying food before a hurricane is equal parts survival and sanity. According to Kemp’s research, people bought high-fat, perishable foods to promote comfort and calmness, not because they thought these were practical purchases. It’s called emotion-regulation consumption — the idea is if someone is stuck waiting for a stressful situation like a hurricane to befall them, consuming the foods they like can lower stress and make them happier. “Positive emotions have the ability to undo the effects of negative emotions, so that’s why we purchase these products,” Kemp says. AFP/Getty Images One loaf of bread seen on a grocery store shelf as people prepared for Hurricane Matthew to make landfall in Florida in 2016. Why some people don’t prepare However, not everyone will be pigging out during Hurricane Michael. According to Jay Shimshack, an associate professor of public policy and economics at the University of Virginia, some people won’t even have purchased the essentials like bottled water, flashlights, and batteries. His 2018 study “ Disaster preparedness and disaster response: Evidence from sales of emergency supplies before and after hurricanes ” gathered grocery store scanner data from 2002 to 2012 to record what people bought and when during all US hurricanes. Shimshack’s team found that although many people buy hurricane preparedness supplies roughly one day before landfall, many buy them afterward, often after the government has warned residents to be off the roads. “There are people buying things ahead of time, but maybe fewer than you might imagine, and right before the storm, which is not consistent with the advice they are being given,” Shimshack says. “There are also big increases in sales relative to what we would expect them to be after the storm makes landfall. And that suggests people have a need.” He says this information suggests that residents were not prepared beforehand, and there could be a few reasons for that. One is that people may not be receiving information about a threat, and if they are, they are not perceiving the information as a threat to them personally. Historically, Shimshack says, the number of direct deaths — fatalities due to wind or storm surges — outnumbered the number of indirect deaths, fatalities caused by things like downed power lines or people driving in a flood. But in 2000, those numbers reversed, and now there are more indirect fatalities. In other words, many are dying because they are unaware of how dangerous the situation actually is. Shimshack says it also could be the “ostrich effect” — a term referring to those who avert attention from damaging but important information, like an ostrich sticking its head in the sand. And of course, he says, it could be optimism bias, where a person thinks they are at less risk for experiencing a negative event compared to others — the “but that would never happen to me” mentality. Just like a smoker is aware of how dangerous cigarettes are but doesn’t think the dangers will affect them, it’s possible that those who don’t prepare have watched the news and seen the damage that other Category 4 hurricanes cause, but they just don’t think it will happen to them. Optimism bias is also more likely to play a role in decision-making around infrequent events, such as a hurricane. Preparation divides often fall along racial and economic lines But there is one factor that implies that it’s messaging, not mindset, that leads to complacency — the stark sociodemographic differences between those who bought supplies before hurricane landfall and those who bought it after. According to Shimshack’s research, those who bought supplies before landfall tended to be higher-income, more educated, and whiter. Those who bought after tended to be less educated, lower-income minorities who are “less likely to receive, trust and respond to risk information,” Shimshack says — especially when that information is coming from government sources. According to the study, African Americans have an unusually large increase in purchases of emergency supplies after landfall, which suggest that African Americans have the greatest need following a hurricane. To improve this, Shimshack says that new targeted messaging campaigns should be created to reach at-risk populations, as it’s dangerous for people to be shopping during the life-threatening situations hurricanes sometimes create. “It suggests our public policy may be working well for some groups and is working far less well for other groups, and we may need a different approach,” he says.

,"At a Glance Florence's heavy rain is forecast to cause catastrophic flooding. Rainfall totals up to 40 inches are possible. This is due to Florence's slow movement for several days. Major to record river flooding is forecast in parts of the Carolinas into next week. Extreme amounts of rain from Florence will continue to hammer the Carolinas and western Virginia through this weekend, triggering flash flooding and river flooding that could reach major to record levels. Now that Florence has arrived in the Carolinas, it will slowly crawl through the region this weekend. Because of that slow movement, heavy rainfall is likely to trigger catastrophic flooding in some areas. Put simply, Florence is a ""Category 5 flood threat."" River flooding could rival that during Hurricane Matthew (2016) or Hurricane Floyd (1999) in some locations. Current Radar, Watches and Warnings (Watches and warnings are issued by the National Weather Service.) As of Saturday morning, Swansboro, North Carolina, had received 30.59 inches of rain. That total, if confirmed, would smash the state record rainfall total from a tropical cyclone in North Carolina of 24.06 inches from Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Final rainfall totals are forecast to be 20 to 40 inches in southeastern North Carolina and northeastern South Carolina, according to the National Hurricane Center. The rest of South Carolina, North Carolina and into southwestern Virginia could see 5 to 10 inches of rain, with localized amounts to 15 inches. Parts of eastern West Virginia and west-central Virginia may see 3 to 6 inches of rain. You don't need rain nearly as heavy as what is being forecast near the coast of the Carolinas to trigger major flash flooding and landslides in the Appalachians, due to the runoff enhancement of terrain. Florence Rainfall Outlook (This should be interpreted as a broad outlook of where the heaviest rain may fall and may shift based on the forecast path. Extreme amounts may occur where bands of rain stall over a period of several hours.) Flash flood watches have been posted by the National Weather Service in much of South Carolina, North Carolina and far southwestern Virginia. (From the National Weather Service.) Heavy rain could also spread into parts of West Virginia and the northeastern United States Monday and Tuesday as Florence's remnants track through those areas. (MORE: Florence's Remnants Will Bring a Soaking Rain, Possible Flooding to the Northeast ) With such extreme amounts of rain, major to record river flooding is forecast in parts of the Carolinas. Here are some notable locations where significant river flooding may occur, but keep in mind, forecast changes are possible. - Neuse River at Kinston, North Carolina : Major flooding (21 feet) expected this weekend and it may rise to 27 feet early in the week ahead. At that level, the NWS says ""disastrous flooding"" occurs, comparable to Matthew and Floyd. Numerous homes and businesses are flooded. - N.E. Cape Fear River at Burgaw, North Carolina : Major flooding (16 feet) is forecast this weekend, and record flooding could occur early next week. The current flood of record is a crest of 22.5 feet from Hurricane Floyd in 1999. The National Weather Service noted that homes are flooded when the river reaches 16 feet, and many more take on water as it rises toward the record height. - N.E. Cape Fear River at Chinquapin, North Carolina : Major flooding (16 feet) is forecast this weekend, and record flooding could occur early next week. The current flood of record is a crest of 23.5 feet from Hurricane Floyd in 1999. ""Devastating flooding"" occurs across the county once the river reaches 23 feet, according to the NWS. - Lumber River at Lumberton, North Carolina : Major flooding (19 feet) is expected this weekend, and the river level could approach the record set in Hurricane Matthew (2016) of 24.39 feet. Flooding of homes can begin once the river reaches 17 feet. If it rises to 24 feet, Interstate 95 may experience flooding between exits 17 and 19. - Little River at Manchester, North Carolina : Major flooding (27 feet) is expected by this weekend. The river could rise above Hurricane Matthew's record flood level of 32.19 feet early next week. - Cape Fear River at Fayetteville, North Carolina : Major flooding (58 feet) is forecast by early next week. It could rise to its fifth-highest level on record if it tops Matthew's flood of 58.94 feet. - Waccamaw River near Conway, South Carolina : Major flooding may begin early in the new week (14 feet), and record flooding is possible by the middle part of next week. The previous flood of record is 17.87 feet from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Water begins to surround homes when the river reaches 13 feet. - Major flooding is also forecast on the Little Pee Dee River at Galivants Ferry, South Carolina, the Pee Dee River at Pee Dee, South Carolina, the Neuse River near Goldsboro, North Carolina, and the Dan River in southwestern Virginia. Recent Major Inland Flood Events The most notable recent inland flood from a tropical storm or hurricane was Hurricane Matthew, which produced a swath of 10 to 19 inches of rain from northeastern Florida through the eastern Carolinas and southeastern Virginia in October 2016, leading to flooding that topped levels from Floyd along the Neuse River at Goldsboro and Kinston, North Carolina. A truck drives through floodwaters from Hurricane Matthew in Lumberton, North Carolina, Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2016. (AP Photo/Chuck Burton) The other most recent example in this region was Hurricane Floyd in 1999, when torrential rain on ground saturated from Tropical Storm Dennis a few weeks prior led to massive flooding in North Carolina. Incredibly, the rainfall totals from Florence may top those during Floyd in parts of North Carolina. Hurricane Irene in 2011 produced a swath of heavy rain up the East Coast, but it is probably most memorable for the massive inland flooding it triggered in Vermont and other parts of New England and New York state. Arguably, the most notorious inland Eastern flood event in recent memory was also from a remnant tropical cyclone, Agnes, in June 1972, which resulted in $2.1 billion of damage in the U.S., most of which came from inland flooding. Catastrophic inland flooding is likely in some areas from Florence, featuring both short-term flash flooding and lingering mainstem river flooding that could last for weeks. According to a National Hurricane Center study, roughly three of every four deaths in tropical cyclones in the U.S. are from water, either from storm surge (49 percent) or rainfall flooding (27 percent). Only 8 percent of U.S. deaths are from wind.","FLOODS OF FLORENCE (Main headline, 1st story, link ) Related stories: C O N E WINDS 50 MPH Advertise here",2018-09-15T14:01:37Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Weather.com'}",FLOODS OF FLORENCE,https://weather.com/safety/hurricane/news/2018-09-14-hurricane-tropical-storm-florence-major-record-river-flooding,https://s.w-x.co/flo-flood-sat-am_0.jpg,,Weather.com,Hurricane Matthew,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other things to know: Across Ontario, marijuana sales will be limited to mail-order only, meaning buyers wont have access to weed in stores. (Which also means no quick trips across the border from Detroit or Buffalo). Smokeable marijuana will be the primary thing available. Cannabis concentrates and vape juice will remain illegal for now. Edibles will be available in about a year. YOU CAN'T BRING IT WITH YOU. Nope, nope, nope.

Walkouts. American public school teachers are a profession in crisis. To find out how that looks and feels in the classroom, 15 teams of USA TODAY Network journalists spent a day with teachers around the nation. What we found was a struggle between teachers love of teaching and despair over their finances. Teachers felt loved by their students, but disrespected by their society. That disrespect took many forms: parents who were too involved or uninvolved; pay scales that required 12- or 14-hour work days to make ends meet; mandates that hampered teachers ability to teach the way they want; and school budgets that forced teachers to pay for even the most basic materials. The system is broken. Heres what teachers across the U.S. have to say. Their passion for teaching and children may be the only thing keeping them invested in the profession.

"AP, AP","FILE - In this Sept. 8, 2018, file photo, North Carolina coach Larry Fedora, right, walks next to players warming up for an NCAA college football game against East Carolina in Greenville, N.C. Fedora's Tar Heels host Virginia Tech on Saturday. (AP Photo/Karl B DeBlaker, File) (Photo: The Associated Press) CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) Virginia Tech has had its top performances this season when playing on the road against Atlantic Coast Conference opponents. Throw in the fact the Hokies are coming off a loss, and Saturday's trip to North Carolina looks like the kind of game that often brings out their best. Virginia Tech (3-2, 2-0 ACC) has earned both of its league wins on the road, first at Florida State to start the year and then at Duke on Sept. 29. Those wins came by a combined 38 points, and they improved the Hokies to 7-3 in league road games under Justin Fuente. One of those came in their last trip to Chapel Hill, a 34-3 win against the Tar Heels in 2016 played in monsoon-like conditions from the remnants of Hurricane Matthew. ""I heard quite a bit of chatter about 'We're 2-0 in the league' and all that sort of stuff,"" Fuente said. ""To me, that's counterproductive to what we're trying to get done here. We need to focus on our improvement and finding a way to get better and give ourselves a chance to win, regardless of a league game, non-league game."" Virginia Tech is coming off a 45-23 home loss to fifth-ranked Notre Dame, which knocked the Hokies out of the AP Top 25. A win against the Tar Heels (1-3, 1-1) will improve the Hokies to 9-1 under Fuente in the game following a loss. For North Carolina, it will be another chance to try to reset a problem-filled season. The Tar Heels started 0-2 and had a game canceled due to Hurricane Florence, then responded by showing some life in a home win against Pittsburgh. Yet they followed that by committing six turnovers in a 47-10 loss at Miami on a short week before heading into an open date. Saturday's game will mark the first chance to see whether the Tar Heels have found any long-term answers. ""We are coming off a very productive bye week where we got a lot of fundamental work with our football team and got a lot of reps,"" UNC coach Larry Fedora said. ""So we hope that's going to pay off for us as we go through the rest of the season."" Some other things to know about Saturday's Virginia Tech-UNC game: TURNOVER PROBLEMS The Tar Heels rank among the Bowl Subdivision's worst in turnover margin (minus-8), and three of their six turnovers were returned for touchdowns against the Hurricanes. SURRATT'S HEALTH The status of UNC quarterback Chazz Surratt is unclear. His mother, Brandi, said her son is set to have wrist surgery on Wednesday in what would be a season-ending procedure. Fedora who typically doesn't discuss injuries declined to talk about Surratt's status earlier this week. Surratt rotated with Nathan Elliott as the No. 2 quarterback against Miami in his season debut following a suspension for selling team-issued shoes and threw three interceptions two returned for scores. WILLIS' PLAY Kansas transfer Ryan Willis has thrown for 641 yards with five touchdowns and one interception in two starts since replacing the injured Josh Jackson for the Hokies. Willis has the mobility to escape defenders, but he was stripped of the ball on a scramble for a long touchdown return against the Fighting Irish. The coaching staff spent the week reinforcing that he doesn't need to try to do too much. HAZELTON WATCH Damon Hazelton has emerged as the Hokies' go-to receiver and leads them with 27 receptions for 479 yards and five touchdowns. He's caught a touchdown pass in each of their first five games, tying Isaiah Ford's program record. And he had 12 catches for 131 yards and a TD against Notre Dame. RED ZONE Virginia Tech leads the ACC in red-zone efficiency, scoring on 18 of 19 trips inside an opponent's 20-yard line with 13 touchdowns. Compare that to the Tar Heels, who have allowed opponents to go 15 for 15 with 11 touchdowns in the red zone this season. ___ AP Sports Writer Hank Kurz in Richmond, Virginia contributed to this report. ___ More AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25 ___ Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

JT Genter,"In just more than two days, a storm named Michael rapidly intensified from a tropical depression to a major hurricane packing 120mph top sustained winds. Currently, Hurricane Michael is forecast to become just the third major hurricane to make landfall in the continental US in the past 13 years when it makes landfall Wednesday afternoon. As of the 5pm ET National Hurricane Center advisory, the hurricane is expected to strengthen further and make landfall as a strong Category 3 hurricane with 125mph top sustained winds. The storm’s minimum pressure is currently 957 millibars, meaning the hurricane is even more intense than 2016’s Hurricane Matthew at the time of its landfall on the US. The hurricane’s raw power and rapid strengthening is clear from recent satellite data: While the Category 3 winds are likely to cause widespread damage, Hurricane Michael’s most destructive force is likely to be its life-threatening storm surge. The shaping of the Florida coast means water is being funneled into the Big Bend of Florida. The worst storm surge is expected between Mexico Beach and Keaton Beach, where 9 to 13 feet of flooding is possible. Water levels are already rising in these areas and will continue to rise well in advance of the center of Michael. The observed tides in multiple parts of the Florida Gulf Coast are currently reading more than two feet higher than the predicted tide level: While the main flooding threat from Hurricane Michael is going to be from storm surge, there’s also potential for damaging flash flooding from the powerful hurricane’s rain. A total of 6-10 inches of rain are expected across much of the Southeast. Unfortunately, due to the hurricane’s quick forward momentum, some of the areas hard hit by Hurricane Florence are expected to get another round of heavy rains on top of already-saturated ground. Flight Cancellations Although the main disruption to flights will come later this week, hundreds of flights have already been cancelled ahead of Hurricane Michael. FlightAware’s cancellation tracker counts 153 flights have been cancelled Wednesday and another 16 on Thursday.

IE Online,"Published: September 24, 2018 9:33:45 am Nine days after Florence came ashore, the National Weather Service said flooding would likely persist in coastal parts of the Carolinas for days as the high-water crest of numerous rivers keeps moving downstream toward the ocean. (Source: File photo) Rain-swollen rivers in North and South Carolina kept rising on Sunday and were forecast to remain at flood level for days, the National Weather Service said more than a week after the landfall of Hurricane Florence, already blamed for at least 40 deaths. As many as 8,000 people in and around Georgetown, South Carolina, have been strongly urged to evacuate flood-prone areas along the Waccamaw and Pee Dee rivers early this week, Georgetown County spokeswoman Jackie Broach-Akers told Reuters. Emergency management officials began sending pre-recorded telephone messages to residents in harms way over the weekend, and will probably start going door-to-door in the next few days, she said. Authorities expect 5 to 10 feet (1.5 m to 3 m) of flooding in neighborhoods encompassing some 3,500 homes close to where the two rain-gorged rivers flow into Winyah Bay on the way to the Atlantic, Broach-Akers said. The flood zone includes Georgetown, at the rivers confluence, and the coastal resort community of Pawleys Island. The county plans to open emergency shelters at 7 a.m. on Monday, and hotels outside the flood zone in nearby Myrtle Beach are offering discounts for evacuees. Public schools will be closed until further notice, Broach-Akers said. State transportation crews were working to erect temporary dams on either side of U.S. Highway 17, the main coastal route through the area, and National Guard engineers were installing a floating bridge at Georgetown in case the highway is washed out at the river. WILMINGTONS WATER STREET UNDERWATER About 100 miles (160 km) up the coast, a commercial section of downtown Wilmington, North Carolina, by the Cape Fear River was under a foot of water, with flooding expected to rise by a further 2 feet (0.61 m) with high tide on Sunday evening, city spokesman Dylan Lee said. Flooding in Wilmington was expected to peak on Monday along the citys Water Street riverfront, where many businesses had stacked sandbags in advance, Lee said. But the city said its offices would reopen on Monday after having been closed for a week. Nine days after Florence came ashore, the National Weather Service said flooding would likely persist in coastal parts of the Carolinas for days as the high-water crest of numerous rivers keeps moving downstream toward the ocean. This isnt over, said Bob Oravec, a meteorologist with the NWS Weather Prediction Center. All that water is going to take a good while to recede, he said. Damage can still be done. Itll be a slow drop. The storm dumped 30 to 40 inches (75 to 100 cm) of rain on the Wilmington area alone after making landfall nearby on Sept. 14. Floodwaters have begun to recede farther inland. That left hundreds of dead fish stranded on a highway near Wallace, about 35 miles (56 km) from the nearest beach, according to the Penderlea Fire Department, which posted video of firefighters hosing the fish off Interstate 40. Well, we can add washing fish off of the interstate to the long list of interesting things firefighters get to experience! the department said on Facebook. Remnants of the once-mighty storm brought heavy rains across a wide swath of the country, prompting flood watches and warnings from Texas to Virginia and Maryland, at least through Monday, the weather service said. About 5,000 people across North Carolina have been rescued by boat or helicopter since the storm made landfall, twice as many as in Hurricane Matthew two years ago, according to state officials.

Kyla Mandel,"Three hog waste lagoons are believed to have breached due to Hurricane Florence’s record rainfall, according to the North Carolina Pork Council. Six sites have suffered structural damage so far and nearly 130 other lagoons are overflowing or at risk of flooding. This is almost four times the number of sites considered at risk since Monday. It is also significantly worse than the damage caused by Hurricane Matthew in 2016, which only resulted in a partial breach of one lagoon while 14 others were inundated. But the full extent of the damage will likely only be known once more people are able to return to their homes and farms. Widespread flooding is still blocking many roads, making many areas inaccessible and the majority of industrial animal farms sit in very low-lying counties. According to the latest figures released by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) on Thursday afternoon, 132 lagoons are either damaged or have been significantly flooded. This means hog waste from the factory farm lagoons — uncovered holes in the ground that hold a mix of water, excrement, and anaerobic bacteria — is being released into the flood waters, risking widespread contamination. According to the North Carolina Pork Council’s September 19 update, of the lagoons that have breached — meaning there was structural damage due to the lagoon’s banks eroding — two have lost all of their liquids while solid waste remains contained. There are no details about the third breach. A further 30 lagoons have been so flooded the waste has overflowed, while 21 others are fully inundated by water and are at risk of overflowing. Seventy-five others have less than three inches to go before they’re flooded over. North Carolina is known for its pork industry. The state has 9.7 million pigs, which produce 10 billion gallons of manure each year. The majority of the state’s 2,100 industrial farms sit in the low-lying counties of Sampson and Duplin, which have now each had a lagoon breach. When the untreated waste enters the water it can lead to algal blooms and mass fish die-offs. Salmonella, giardia, and E. coli are all possible contamination risks. Excess nitrates linked to manure can also pose health risks, including blue baby syndrome. Previous contamination experienced due to Hurricane Matthew included food poisoning and skin infections. Elevated fecal coliform bacteria in the water was still found four months after the storm hit, according to DEQ analysis. But it’s not just during storms that public health is at risk. Some 160,000 North Carolinians live within a half-mile of a pig or poultry farm. Earlier this year, residents finally settled a long-standing complaint with DEQ that alleged the state’s general permitting process for swine farms disproportionately burdened communities of color. Many also fear that due to budget cuts, operations often aren’t inspected as frequently as some residents and environmental groups would like. There are also persistent concerns about groundwater pollution given the manure is still being stored in open-air, unlined pits. Farmers are working with the state DEQ to manage the situation, a statement on Wednesday by the Pork Council states. For some, this means lowering the lagoon levels by transferring liquids off site using tanker trucks or piping it to nearby lagoons that have more space. Farmers have taken “extraordinary steps” to protect their animals, the council says, including staying in the barns “for days without access to the outside world.” Meanwhile others can only access their barns by boat or helicopter. The storm, however, has so far killed 5,500 pigs and 3.4 million chickens. The total livestock deaths due to Hurricane Florence is double that of Hurricane Matthew two years ago. Until the ultimate impact of the storm is assessed, Hurricane Floyd in 1999 remains the most devastating to the state’s agriculture industry. This storm caused 55 waste ponds to flood and killed millions of farm animals, including 100,000 pigs and hogs.","Three hog waste lagoons are believed to have breached due to Hurricane Florence’s record rainfall, according to the North Carolina Pork Council.

"Thomas Frank, E&E News","The $14 billion network of levees and floodwalls that was built to protect greater New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina was a seemingly invincible bulwark against flooding.
But now, 11 months after the Army Corps of Engineers completed one of the largest public works projects in world history, the agency says the system will stop providing adequate protection in as little as four years because of rising sea levels and shrinking levees.
The growing vulnerability of the New Orleans area is forcing the Army Corps to begin assessing repair work, including raising hundreds of miles of levees and floodwalls that form a meandering earth and concrete fortress around the city and its adjacent suburbs.
“These systems that maybe were protecting us before are no longer going to be able to protect us without adjustments,” said Emily Vuxton, policy director of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, an environmental group. She said repair costs could be “hundreds of millions” of dollars, with 75% paid by federal taxpayers.
“I think this work is necessary. We have to protect the population of New Orleans,” Vuxton said.
The protection system was built over a decade and finished last May when the Army Corps completed a final component that involves pumps.
The agency’s projection that the system will “no longer provide [required] risk reduction as early as 2023” illustrates the rapidly changing conditions being experienced both globally as sea levels rise faster than expected and locally as erosion wipes out protective barrier islands and marshlands in southeastern Louisiana.
Of primary concern are the earthen levees that form the backbone of the 350-mile maze of protection that includes concrete floodwalls, pump stations and gated structures, Army Corps spokesman Matthew Roe said.
The levees are losing height as they start to settle—a natural phenomenon that is exacerbated by the soft soils in southern Louisiana. Some floodwalls are built into the levees.
But “the global incidence of sea level rise” also is contributing to the inadequacy of the levees, the Army Corps said in the April 2 Federal Register notice announcing that it is studying system improvements.
“It’s happening a little bit faster than our projections in 2007,” Roe said.
Numerous studies in recent years have warned of New Orleans’ unusual vulnerability to sea-level rise. The National Academy of Sciences projected in 2016 that New Orleans could be one of the hardest-hit cities in the world along with Manila, Philippines; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Bangkok.
“The public may feel complacent. The [protective] system was built, and they think it’s done. They look at that levee as a static monolith,” said John Lopez, director of the coastal and community program for the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, an environmental group. “But the crisis never really was over. We improved the system, but we have always been under threat.”
Sea-level rise raises questions about whether the protective system—known officially as the Greater New Orleans Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System—should be built to a higher standard.
When Congress approved funding after Katrina, it required the system to protect against a so-called 100-year flood, which has a 1% likelihood of occurring in any year.
“We should be looking at higher than a 100-year standard, but not through levees alone,” Lopez said, calling for Congress to pay for natural barriers that build up coastal buffers. “We need a higher standard, but it should never be a single-type solution because we’ve seen that doesn’t work.”
As the Army Corps studies reinforcing the system, it will model the effect of roughly 150 storms ranging from a small tropical depression to a mammoth 500-year storm that has only a 0.2% chance of occurring each year, said Roe, the agency spokesman. A first draft of a report is scheduled to be done by December, after which the Army Corps will accept public comments.
Reinforcing the levees—a process known misleadingly as “lifting""—involves scraping off the top layer of grass and a fabric mattress and piling on additional earth before restoring the surface layer. It is unclear how much earth will need to be added to the levees, which stand as high as 35 feet.
But the Army Corps said in its Federal Register notice that “absent future levee lifts to offset consolidation, settlement, subsidence, and sea level rise, risk to life and property in the Greater New Orleans area will progressively increase.”

E.A. Crunden,"The East Coast is bracing itself this week as Hurricane Florence draws near, threatening states throughout the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Depending on where the storm eventually hits, this week could see a “worst-case scenario” situation for several states, with some areas prepared for a disaster reminiscent of last year’s Hurricane Harvey. Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina have all declared a state of emergency in advance of Florence, which was a Category 4 hurricane as of Monday morning. The storm is currently churning off the East Coast, with its projected path indicating landfall around Thursday evening or Friday morning. Forecasters have been hesitant to predict Florence’s path — hurricanes often change direction quickly and many spin off into the sea without ever reaching land. But the powerful storm’s steady course has alarmed experts, who now worry the hurricane is likely to make landfall at either its current speed or at a slightly reduced strength. “There is an increasing risk of life-threatening impacts from Florence: Storm surge at the coast, freshwater flooding from a prolonged and exceptionally heavy rainfall event inland and damaging hurricane-force winds,” the National Hurricane Center emphasized in a notice on Monday morning. Florence’s current path appears to be a worst-case scenario trajectory, potentially imperiling a large number of states with long-term weather implications. Last year, warmer-than-average waters off the Gulf of Mexico allowed Hurricane Harvey to supercharge and then stall over southeastern Texas, submerging the sprawling city of Houston and leaving thousands of people without long-term housing or access to basic necessities. That could happen again this year. Florence is passing through warmer-than-average water on its way to the East Coast, which is helping the storm to gain speed. Once it arrives, forecasters are concerned the hurricane will stall over the region, drenching the Southeast and imperiling the Mid-Atlantic, potentially for several days. To the south, Georgia could be impacted; up north, both Washington, D.C. and Baltimore are eyeing heavy rains with possibly severe flooding. The Northeast has already seen historic rainfall this year and states as far north as New York are preparing for Florence’s aftermath. States directly in the line of fire are eyeing a far more dire situation. In 1999, Hurricane Floyd brought devastating floods to North Carolina, killing at least 74 people and destroying land and homes. It also unleashed environmental havoc. Hundreds of hog and poultry farms were flooded, leading to animals drowning and feces and waste being carried into the ocean while jeopardizing groundwater. Widespread algae blooms and fish kills were also later traced back to the natural disaster. Nearly two decades later, Hurricane Matthew renewed those concerns, similarly exposing water to agricultural runoff. With Florence’s landfall in the Carolinas projected at 70 percent likelihood, it’s possible that the area could once again be faced with the same scenario. Another source of concern are several ongoing pipeline projects. Both the Atlantic Coast (ACP) and Mountain Valley (MVP) pipelines are under construction in Virginia. In the southwestern part of the state, the MVP in particular could be vulnerable to a severe storm, potentially endangering both residents and the environment. Officials are wasting no time in cautioning their constituents about Florence’s power. During a news conference on Sunday, South Carolina’s governor, Henry McMaster (R), warned residents to evacuate. “Make your plans now. You have to get your medicines ready to go, if you have prescriptions you need to get filled,” said McMaster. “Make sure you lock things up because you may not be coming home for several days.” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) similarly emphasized preparedness and resilience. “We got to hope and pray for the best but we have to prepare for the worst. The good thing is that we still have a few days for people to get ready,” Cooper said Sunday. Far from the mainland United States, however, Florence’s winds are likely to spark high waves off the coasts of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, among others. And ongoing hurricane activity isn’t limited to Florence. Already this year, Hawaii, a state that almost never experiences hurricanes, has seen landfall from one that dropped in strength to a heavy storm. Another hurricane, Olivia, is currently headed directly for the islands. In the Atlantic, at least two other hurricanes are gaining strength in addition to Florence. Hurricane Helene is spinning near the Cape Verde islands, while Hurricane Isaac is gaining strength and could hit a number of Caribbean islands still recovering from Hurricane Maria last year. That includes Puerto Rico, where many residents are living under blue tarps in place of roofs a year after the Category 4 hurricane made landfall.","The East Coast is bracing itself this week as Hurricane Florence draws near, threatening states throughout the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.

"Tilly Alcayna, Harvard University / The Conversation","In an era of seemingly ceaseless tragedies, it can be hard to stay on top of the news. This week, six wildfires have burned up over 141,000 acres in California – an area larger than the cities of New York and Boston combined – killing two people. A few weeks prior, the headlines were on Iran’s deadly earthquake. Before that, it was the Rohingya refugee crisis. You may have managed to take in all that information. But do you know about the November plague outbreak in Madagascar that has infected 2,119 people and killed 171? What about flooding in South Asia a few months back, which affected more than 41 million people in India, Bangladesh and Nepal? If it’s all new to you, you’re hardly alone. According to the International Federation of the Red Cross, 91 percent of global crises go unnoticed. As a researcher at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, a Harvard University center dedicated to advancing the science and practice of humanitarian action, our aim is to change that. Why? Evidence shows that ignoring all these small crises is a recipe for global disaster. The many sides of world crises Crises can take many forms, from hurricanes and floods to epidemics and complex emergencies like war. They also have varying levels of intensity: Taking only Latin America and the Caribbean, between 1994 and 2014, for every one large-scale crisis, there were approximately 177 smaller crises. November 2017 saw not only a 7.1 magnitude earthquake kill over 400 people in Iran and Iraq, for example, but also flash floods, a typhoon and earthquakes in Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia, among other countries. People generally pay less attention to these events, in part because there isn’t much data on them. Still, while the impacts of an individual small crises may be less – both in terms of death toll and physical damage – together minor crises can have huge human consequences. According to a 2015 United Nations report, the accumulated losses from small and recurrent events like flash floods, fires and drought account for 42 percent or more of total economic losses in low- and middle-income countries. For particularly disaster-prone nations, the toll can be much higher. In Madagascar, for example, the annual economic losses from minor crises between 2001 and 2011 were equivalent to 75 percent of annual public investment during that same period. This is a serious economic erosion challenge for any country, but especially a low-income nation like Madagascar. Plus, even in places where insurance exists, such events are rarely covered. As such, small crises can plunge families into debt. They also create food insecurity, drive environment damage and hurt mental health. Small crises may also lay the foundations for greater tragedy to come. Before the Syrian civil war began in 2011, for example, drought and food shortages were compelling out-of-work farmers to leave rural areas starting in 2007. Over several years, people from the countryside migrated en masse into big cities like Damascus. This influx, in turn, exacerbated Syria’s existing political instability and contributed to the initial waves of political unrest that began rocking the country in 2011. The end result is now one of the biggest humanitarian crises of our time. Neglected crises I call the kind of incidents that occasionally grace international headlines but tend to fade quickly into the background “neglected crises.” Currently, repeated famines in Somalia and Ethiopia fall into this category, as do the ongoing civil wars in Yemen and the Central African Republic. Protracted violence and displacement in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda have also made brief appearances in international news, only to disappear for those not suffering through them. These problems aren’t just neglected in the news – they’re also critically underfunded. From 2016 to 2017, the United Nations fell short of its requested US$22.8 billion in global humanitarian assistance by fully $20.1 billion. Consequently, neglected crises tend to get little economic and humanitarian support, even when great human suffering results from them. More than a million people have been uprooted by conflict in the Central African Republic, yet budget shortfalls compelled aid workers distributing food to displaced people to withdraw in early 2017. Silent crises Then there are what I call “silent crises.” These events may be noteworthy for local government and the United Nations, but less so internationally. Zika is a case in point. For two years before this mosquito-borne illness exploded across Latin America in 2015, it infected 30,000 people in French Polynesia. But as no deaths were reported and the consequences of infections remained uncertain, almost no one paid attention. Unseasonably wet or dry weather is another issue that both the media and humanitarian relief organizations tend to neglect. That, too, is short-sighted. The United Nations has found that between 1990 and 2014, the cumulative effects of droughts and floods in Latin America “generated more than half of all human losses due to climate events.” Bad weather during those 15 years damaged the homes, crops and land of 115 million Latin Americans. And because climate change-related disasters are strongly associated with poverty and inequality, these aberrant weather phenomena disproportionately hurt people in low- and middle-income countries. Neglected rural problems often culminate in big urban crises. Take the 2010 Haitian earthquake, for example. Its epicenter struck near Port-au-Prince, a city that had doubled in size between 1986 and 2006 as government neglect of agricultural policy and the well-being of people in the countryside forced millions of farmers to relocate to the capital. By 2010, 86 percent of Port-au-Prince residents lived in dense informal settlements, many of them located on mountainsides, along rivers and in other fragile areas. Urban crises Haiti’s exploding urban growth echoes a global trend. In 1950, only 30 percent of people lived in cities. Today, the global urban population exceeds the rural population. Exploding urban populations, combined with poor planning, have led to overcrowding, insufficient public services and rising urban inequality. When disaster then strikes in such cities, the death toll can be astounding. Haiti’s 2010 earthquake claimed approximately 310,000 lives, including 25 percent of all the country’s civil servants, and displaced more than 1.5 million. Today, 2.5 million Haitians still subsist on humanitarian assistance. Seven years later, more than $13.5 billion in international aid money has gone into funding the country’s recovery, including the added toll of 2016’s Hurricane Matthew. That’s because post-disaster response is incredibly expensive. In 2013, the Red Cross calculated that for every $1 spent on preparedness activities, $4 could be saved in response internationally So, if saving lives is not reason enough to pay more attention to small crises, perhaps money will be.

Alexis Ward,"Haiti -- ""It was a terrible night,"" recalls Marc Antoine Nesi. ""The wind ripped roofs off houses, many people were injured."" Nesi, a city official in his mid-30s from Saint-Louis-du-Sud, a small coastal town in southwest Haiti, lived through Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. Video: Marc Antoine Nesi recalls his experiences during Hurricane Matthew. ""Many homes were left completely destroyed by the storm, the roads were blocked by fallen trees and our water was contaminated,"" Nesi says. ""Cholera began to spread."" Around 2 million people were directly affected by Hurricane Matthew and its aftermath. The storm had destroyed their harvests, and famine was only avoided because aid organizations continued delivering food to Haiti even months after the natural disaster. Haiti was a poor country to begin with. In 2010, the Caribbean country was hit by a severe earthquake. Haiti experienced a cholera epidemic at that time, as well, which had been introduced inadvertently by United Nations peacekeeping troops. Hundreds of thousands of people fell ill, and over 10,000 died. Cholera still persists in Haiti, appearning and disappearing in waves. A hospital in Jérémie damaged by Hurricane Matthew How is Haiti faring today? Almost one-and-a-half years after Hurricane Matthew, people have at least partially rebuilt their homes and their villages, often with the help of international aid organizations. But are they prepared if another natural disaster hits? 'People Were Drinking from the River' After the storm, the drinking water was contaminated, leading to the spread of cholera. ""People were drinking from the river, many got sick and some died,"" says Birame Sarr, country director in Haiti for the Workers' Samaritan Federation (ASB), a German aid organization. ""We had to stop that."" ASB built several water filtration systems, but the organization sees its aid work as being only a temporary solution. ""Many families lost not only their homes in the hurricane, but also their gardens and fields and they had to start from scratch,"" says Alexander Mauz, project coordinator for ASB's foreign aid department. ""We help them until they can provide for themselves again."" A water filtration system in Saint-Louis-du-Sud built by ASB 'The Most Basic Things Are Often Lacking' One of the most urgent problems in Haiti is medical care. In the southwest of the country, Hurricane Matthew almost completely destroyed most of the clinics, which were poorly equipped to begin with. Haiti only has around 60 state-owned, charitable and private hospitals to care for a population of 11 million. Almost all of them are located in the larger cities -- 15 are in the capital, Port-au-Prince. The problem here is that 40 percent of the Haitian population lives in rural areas and can't reach an emergency room quickly. Haiti's emergency room doctors already face enormous challenges even in normal circumstances. After the hurricane, there were very few ER doctors to treat the thousands of injured. Small towns like Saint-Louis-du-Sud had no access to emergency medical services or ambulances. Djamson Mereste is an internist who works at the state-run University Hospital in Port-au-Prince, the largest in the city. Even there, the most basic things are often lacking, he explains. ""Just imagine an injured, bleeding patient arrives at the ER and the doctor says: 'Sorry, but you have to first go to the pharmacy to buy dressing, medicine and rubber gloves.'"" Dr. Djamson Mereste at the University Hospital in Port-au-Prince ""Sometimes a simple asthma attack can be fatal just because the patient can't afford the inhaler,"" Mereste says. Be it blood bags, bandages or oxygen, the patient has to pay for it all in cash. The doctor's work may be free of charge in some state-run hospitals, but many patients still have to take on debts, with farmers in some instances selling their cattle and goats, just to pay for medical care. This is, after all, a country where over half the population lives on less than $2 a day. Cut Off from the Rest of the Country Dr. Angello Duvelson is the director of the public health authority in the Département de la Grand'Anse, the region where Hurricane Matthew caused the most devastation. In the regional capital Jérémie, the storm severely damanged virtually all the buildings and almost every tree. After the storm abated, the only highway was impassable, so the city was completely cut off for several days. ""The hurricane taught us that we have to expand and improve our own medical facilities at every level,"" Duvelson says. Private organizations are also getting involved in the effort. The volunteer medical service Secouriste Pour La Vie (SPV) was launched in 2017. Doctors, nurses and medical students offer their help in the event of accidents, natural disasters or during large public events. Hurricane Matthew was the major impetus for the group's formation. Video: Volunteer medical workers assist during carnival celebrations in Port-au-Prince. During carnival season in Port-au-Prince, the SPV volunteers mix with the revelers. ""We have divided our 32 members into four groups and stand at strategic locations in the city center,"" says Jean Doloreste Lajoie, a doctor in his mid-20s who helped found the organization. ""We provide first aid and coordinate with the ambulance crews of the state civil defense."" Accidents or fights are frequent occurrences during carnival. ""We don't have ambulances yet, but our members are ready if anyone needs help,"" Lajoie says. Emergency Medicine without Standards Dr. Galit Sacajiu, an American internist, wants to ensure that doctors and nurses in Haiti are trained to provide the best possible care during emergencies. She founded the nonprofit group Haiti Medical Education Project (HME) after volunteering in Haiti in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. The group develops teaching plans, offers seminars via distance learning and runs training courses on the ground in Haiti. ""Our focus is the training of doctors and nurses,"" Sacajiu says. ""There are no clearly defined standards for emergency medicine in Haiti."" Video: Doctor Galit Sacajiu offers seminars to doctors and nurses in Haiti. At Justinien University Hospital in Cap-Haïtien, a historic port town with more than 250,000 inhabitants, 20 participants are taking a training course. Oxygen masks, ventilation bags and other instruments from the ER are spread out on tables. A few life-size CPR mannequins are being used to practice cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The doctors and nurses are learning up-to-date emergency medicine techniques and how to provide high-quality care for patients even when the medical equipment is poor. The courses were originally developed in 1996 for doctors in the U.S. state of Minnesota, where emergency physicians in rural areas also had to deal with limited technical resources. ""The curriculum is very realistic,"" says Sterman Toussaint, a guest lecturer. ""Doctors and nurses form a team and are therefore trained together. That's something people here aren't used to."" Teaching is carried out in Creole as well as French and English. ""The participants understand everything more quickly when I speak in Creole,"" says Jerry Dely, a surgeon from Cap-Haïtien. ""They're more relaxed, even though the material they are learning is complicated."" Nurses in the emergency room at the state-run Justinien Hospital in Cap-Haïtien, Haiti. So far, 50 doctors and nurses have successfully completed HME courses in Haiti. Despite being exhausted after her first day in class, Woudline Begun is enthusiastic. ""This course will help me,"" the nurse says, ""because theory and practice are closely intertwined. This will improve our quality of care in the ER."" The young doctors and nurses training with HME hope that they will soon be able to offer their compatriots a level of medical care that meets international standards, particularly when it comes to emergency care. They also see the need for continuing medical education in Haiti that is both standardized and compulsory. Whether they can get the financial and political support from the government that these plans would require, however, remains to be seen.","A year and a half after Hurricane Matthew, Haiti's health care system is still ill-equipped for another major disaster.

"Adam Aton, Daniel Cusick, E&E News","While Hurricane Florence was still barreling toward the East Coast, the Navy shipped its vessels out of harm’s way. But the sailors had another problem: What would happen to their cars parked back at base if Florence hit coastal Virginia? While Florence largely steered clear of the cars parked at the naval base in Hampton Roads, Va., the episode was emblematic of the type of cascading problems that planners will increasingly have to take into account. That type of trickle-down issue illustrates the gaps in planning for climate change, Ann Phillips, a retired Navy rear admiral, said yesterday at a panel on how climate change will challenge military and civilian infrastructure. “In the Navy, we don’t value or fund infrastructure,” said Phillips, a board member of the Center for Climate and Security think tank, which hosted the panel to highlight the second edition of its report on the most vulnerable military sites. “We like stuff. We don’t like infrastructure.” The military might be even less prepared than some coastal cities, panelists said. The same officials might run a city for a few years, giving them time to notice the effects of climate change and get adaptation programs running. But most regions get a new commander every two years or so. That’s been the case in Hampton Roads, the southeastern region of Virginia that hosts a large Navy base along with several other military sites. A commander who prioritized climate change policies was followed by one who did not, Phillips said. “An excellent officer, a fine gentleman, has never been to Hampton Roads before, can’t spell sea-level rise,” she said. “[That] doesn’t stop anything that’s going on, but it’s just not their No. 1 priority.” The military has been working on climate risks for years. Phillips pointed to a software project with NASA, now part of the larger Adapt Virginia portal, that she said is helping reduce flood damages from hundreds of millions of dollars to hundreds of thousands. Such work is expected to continue, in part due to a provision in the military spending bill that allows the Department of Defense to fund adaptation projects outside the fence line of bases, said David Titley, a retired Navy rear admiral who now teaches at Pennsylvania State University. “There’s lip service, and then there’s doing, sorta, some things—actually more than you would expect—more than you would expect from the White House tweets, I’ll put it that way,” he said. Florence offered coastal communities a preview of their long-term flood risk from sea-level rise. But in the short term, experts said, it’s unrealistic to assume people will change their behavior based on one storm. Susan Cohen, a Navy biologist, said a real estate agent she knows in the vulnerable area of Topsail Beach, N.C., closed on a house the same day that Florence was making landfall. “We make these crazy decisions, but we live in paradise [and] we don’t want to leave,” she said. “And then we have storms like this, and we’re all going to cash our federal insurance checks.” Meanwhile, the First Street Foundation, a nonprofit research organization, yesterday released an analysis showing that sea-level rise off the Carolina coast contributed to storm surge flooding of 11,000 more homes than would have been inundated under similar storm conditions in 1970. The finding is based on geospatial analysis of Florence’s storm surge across the Carolina coast in 2018 compared with 1970, when average sea levels were 6 inches lower than today. Overall, the scientists found that Florence’s storm surge affected more than 51,000 homes and buildings by pushing seawater over at least 25 percent of each property. But that number would have been only 40,000 properties under sea-level conditions 48 years ago, and possibly as few as 23,000 properties when factoring for the growth in residential and commercial development since 1970. “Even though the impact of Hurricane Florence continues to be felt, we already know that sea-level rise has made the damage significantly worse, as observed with other recent storms,” said Steven McAlpine, First Street’s head of data science. The analysis further found that under an Army Corps of Engineers-projected 15 inches of sea-level rise by 2050, Florence’s storm surge would have been nearly twice as destructive, damaging an estimated 102,000 homes and businesses. “With sea levels and coastal development on the rise, the impacts of hurricane storm surge will only get worse,” said the group’s executive director, Matthew Eby. “The time to rethink America’s sea-level rise and adaptation strategy is now.” Reprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&amp;E News.

Steve Greene,"Fans of seeing Matthew Broderick on a TV screen, today you’ve presumably been waiting for. Word came Friday that the actor would have not one but three fresh new roles in the coming year, all on shows with distinct comedic flavors. Perhaps most notably is an upcoming recurring part on Pamela Adlon’s FX series “ Better Things.” For those more inclined to broadcast comedies, he’ll be one of the actors filling the Roseanne void on the newly unveiled “ The Conners,” where he’ll play alongside fellow Broadway vet Laurie Metcalf as Jackie’s new fling. His first episode, a Halloween-themed one, is slated to air at the end of this month. Read More: Criterion Collection Announces December Titles, Including ‘Election’ and ‘Monterey Pop’ Broderick will also be going back to school for the upcoming Netflix series “Daybreak.” The show (which you may have been hearing about from writer Ira Madison III’s Twitter feed ) follows a group of teenagers navigating their way through Glendale, CA in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. The series is a led by a band of students and outsiders, but Broderick will be playing the school’s chummy, kind-hearted principal. These comedy roles will serve as a nice counterbalance to the emotionally gutting projects he’s been involved in over the past few years. He voiced a character in two of last year’s most charged episodes of fellow Netflix series “BoJack Horseman” and played a small role in Kenneth Lonergan’s “Manchester by the Sea.” Ever the stage vet, Broderick also played the part of Adult Ralphie the narrator in last year’s Fox version of “A Christmas Story Live!” Broderick was set to return to an on-camera TV role sooner than this, when he was announced to play former FEMA director Michael Brown in a Hurricane Katrina-themed season of Ryan Murphy’s ongoing “American Crime Story” anthology series.

The owner at Sweet Candy Cafe, Felicia Evans Long started a foundation called 'Tim's Toys Project' after her husband passed away back in 2014. 
Long said this is her fourth annual event and this year the family that was chosen lost their valuables due to the floods. 
""They made us leave our house, they were scared it might get flooded out. Which it did, the roads to our apartment got flooded and we could not go to our apartments until it was safe for us,"" said participant Sheila McKeithan. 
Each year, Long gives toys that children like during the holiday season. ""It's really important to me to keep his name and keep his legacy going and what better way to do that then to service our community,"" said Long. 
Long reached out to the principal at Knuckles Elementary School where she was directed to Sheila and her two children. 
""It's hard to know there's people who have been hit twice. We wanted to make sure we captured a family who was affected by both storms and hopefully we can ease their financial burden off the parents by donating the toys,"" said Long. 
Sheila was surprised when receiving a call from the Long and said she's grateful for what this organization has done. "" I couldn't believe it. I mean I didn't know anything about it. It was wonderful,"" said McKeithan.

Thomson Reuters Foundation,"With a better way to predict a storm's power, people will be more prepared in knowing whether a hurricane headed their way will cause devastating floods and winds By Jon Herskovitz AUSTIN, Texas, July 15 (Reuters) - Despite advances in predicting where hurricanes are heading, forecasters are still struggling to determine a crucial factor in deciding emergency measures and evacuations: their intensity. With a better way to predict a storm's power, or intensity, people on the ground will be more prepared in knowing whether a hurricane headed their way will cause devastating floods and winds that can uproot trees like Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last year, or just shake branches and rattle windows. ""The fact that we have a much better understanding of where these storms are going to go is a great first step. We sort of have half the circle filled in, and we need to get that other half filled in, which is that intensity component,"" said Steve Bowen, director and meteorologist for insurer Aon Benfield's Impact Forecasting team. Due to warming sea and air temperatures, there is also more energy in storms, which might affect intensity predictions, some climate scientists have said. ""Climate change potentially affects the frequency, intensity and tracks of tropical cyclones,"" MIT climate professor Kerry Emanuel wrote in a recent academic paper. Measuring a hurricane's intensity quickly and formulating predictions on its changes is key to giving people on the ground time to prepare as the Atlantic hurricane season peaks this year after a devastating 2017 season. Maria, one in a series of devastating hurricanes last year, killed an estimated 4,465 people, knocked out the electric grid and caused $90 billion in damage in Puerto Rico. The National Hurricane Center said in a report last year that it failed to adequately predict the rapid intensification of Hurricane Matthew in 2016 to a Category 5 storm with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 kph). The storm carved a destructive path in the Caribbean, killing more than 1,000 people in Haiti, according to data gathered by Reuters. HEART OF THE HURRICANE There are more than a dozen scientific models for predicting hurricane intensity but they are of limited use, scientists say. While the science of tracking a storm relies heavily on data about conditions on its periphery, predicting intensity relies on finding where its energy is coming from by measuring what is happening in the middle of it. Typically, that means flying a hurricane hunter aircraft inside the storm, measuring wind speeds from a weather buoy as a storm passes overhead or relying on satellites that may fly over once every other day. One project to obtain more data to predict intensity is the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System or CYGNSS for short, a constellation of eight low-orbit satellites launched by NASA in 2016. Previous satellites, which flew over relatively infrequently, had trouble measuring ocean surface winds at the center of storms, with their signals often being degraded by heavy rain at the core, NASA said. ""For storms that are changing really quickly, you could miss something like rapid intensification,"" said Christopher Ruf, principal investigator for CYGNSS and a climate science professor at the University of Michigan. CYGNSS was designed to measure surface winds in and near the inner core of tropical systems, including regions that could not previously be measured from space. With more satellites passing over more often, and being in a position closer to the storms, it offers more real-time data to be plugged into intensity models, researchers said. At present, researchers are focusing on the 2017 season when hurricanes devastated Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, causing hundreds of billions of dollars in damage. They are replaying data gathered from CYGNSS to see how it affected the quality of the forecasts and how it can be better used to predict intensity. CYGNSS could be fully operational next year, researchers said. Michael Brennan, branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the National Hurricane Center, said the 2017 hurricane season saw a great deal of rapid intensification when storms quickly picked up, or lost, power. The center launched a 10-year Hurricane Forecast Improvement Program in 2009 that has helped it better understand where storms are going and the power they will possess by coordinating hurricane research to improve the task. Last year, in the Atlantic basin, forecasters correctly forecasted six of 39 instances of rapid intensification, Brennan said. ""It doesn't sound like a really great number, but 10 years ago that number would have been zero,"" he said.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Lely Image caption The floating farm will start with about 40 cows milked by robots The world's first offshore dairy farm opens in the Port of Rotterdam this year, with the aim of helping the city produce more of its own food sustainably. But will such farms ever be able to produce enough to feed the world's growing urban populations? A Dutch property company, Beladon, is launching the world's first ""floating farm"" in a city port. It has built the offshore facility right in the middle of Rotterdam's Merwehaven harbour and will use it to farm 40 Meuse-Rhine-Issel cows milked by robots. Built-up urban areas may not seem like the most sensible places to run farms, but reducing the distance food travels before it reaches consumers' plates makes environmental sense as it reduces transport pollution. And if the global population grows to 9.8 billion by 2050 as expected, 70% are forecast to live in cities - up from 55% today. Image copyright Floating Farm Image caption An artist's impression of how Beladon's floating farm will look when finished So urban indoor farms, where produce is grown vertically on stacks of shelves under ultraviolet lights, are - literally - on the rise. Beladon's farm, which is on three levels and is anchored to the ocean floor, is expected to open at the end of 2018 and produce about 800 litres of milk a day. Peter van Wingerden, an engineer at Beladon, came up with the idea in 2012 when he was in New York working on a floating housing project on the Hudson river. While there, Hurricane Sandy struck, flooding the city streets and crippling its transport networks. Deliveries struggled to get through and within two days it was hard to find fresh produce in shops. ""Seeing the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy I was struck by the need for food to be produced as near as possible to consumers,"" says Mr van Wingerden. Image copyright Jan van der Meijde Image caption Minke van Wingerden thinks floating farms have great potential for cities built near water ""So the idea came up to produce fresh food in a climate-adaptive way on the water."" The concept would be resilient against hurricanes, too, he adds. At first people thought the idea was ""weird, funny or unbelievable"", he says, but they have started to come round. ""With increasing demand for healthy food, fast-growing urbanisation and climate change, we can't rely on the food production systems of the past any more,"" he says. Later in 2012, his team began working on the design and talking to the Port Authority in Rotterdam. Despite its initial hesitations about the potential noise and smell, the port gave Beladon a space to build a prototype. Since then the farm has taken shape, and earlier this summer its floating platform was moved by barge from Zaandam in the north of Holland, to Rotterdam. Peter's wife and business partner, Minke van Wingerden, says the farm will start with 40 cows, enough for the venture to break even. But she says it is ""easily scalable"", with larger operations promising ""obvious efficiencies"". The farm also aims to reuse and recycle as much as it can. ""At least 80% of what our cows eat will be waste products from Rotterdam's food industry,"" says the farm's general manager, Albert Boersen. That might include grains discarded by local breweries, leftovers from restaurants and cafes, by-products from local wheat mills, and even grass clippings, all collected and delivered in electric trucks provided by local ""green waste"" firm GroenCollect. ""We will grow duckweed as an animal feed, too,"" says Ms van Wingerden. ""It is high in protein, fast-growing and can be nurtured with cow urine. We will have an installation of four or five vertical platforms growing the plant under special LED lights."" Image copyright Amaya Hagelaar Image caption Waste fodder for the cows will be collected from restaurants and breweries in electric vans The project will even generate some of its own energy - hydrogen produced through electrolysis powered by solar panels. Once up and running, the farm will produce and pasteurise milk and yoghurt on-site and sell it in Rotterdam. It will also process and sell its own cow manure. Dr Fenton Beed, a team leader at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, thinks urban farms are useful because they tend to use less water, fertiliser and pesticide than conventional production systems. But he also acknowledges that space limitations may prevent enough food being produced to supply the world's burgeoning urban populations. ""Constraints to producing food in controlled environments include costs for initial investment, LED lighting and continuous energy supplies,"" says Dr Beed. ""That means that unless policies incentivise the engagement of smaller producers, this technology will be reserved for income-rich private and public entities.""

The San Francisco-based start-up produces leafy greens in indoor farms and claims it can grow up to 350 times more per square metre than outdoor field farms. Its crops are grown on six-metre vertical poles, using hydroponics - a water-only feeding system - and LED lights. No soil or pesticides are used. Infrared sensors monitor how the crops are faring so that the system can adjust light, heat and water flow accordingly. Since it was founded in 2013, Plenty has raised $226m (£177m) from investors such as Amazon's Jeff Bezos, SoftBank's Vision Fund and Innovation Endeavors. This year it will expand its US operations and open its first farm in the Middle East.

Back in the Netherlands, Peter and Minke van Wingerden are looking at opportunities to build more floating farms around the country, as well as in Asia. ""We hope to make many more floating farms, but also welcome others copying us or coming up with concepts contributing to these goals,"" says Mr van Wingerden.

mdixon@politico.com (Matt Dixon),"Though the storm will have an impact on every campaign in its path, the spotlight will naturally gravitate towards Florida Gov. Rick Scott, whose favorability rating rose after prior hurricanes. | John Raoux/AP Photo A hurricane has Tallahassee right in its forecast path, putting it on a collision course with Floridas two nationally watched races for governor and U.S. Senate and providing Gov. Rick Scott with a chance for a campaign windfall. Just days before Hurricane Michael formed in the Gulf of Mexico, Scotts Senate campaign coincidentally began running an ad touting his leadership after hurricanes Hermine and Matthew in 2016 and Irma in 2017. This latest storm offers him another high-profile, take-charge moment in the homestretch of one of the nations tightest Senate races. Story Continued Below The governors race is also feeling the impact of hurricane politics: a social media fight broke out over negative TV ads running as storm prep begins. Democrat Andrew Gillum pulled his TV spots from media markets set to be walloped by the storm, while his Republican opponent Ron DeSantis did not. As a result, Democrats have collectively been pointing figures at Republicans for what they say is unseemly politicking as a potentially life-threatening storm approaches. At the same time, the GOP was quietly griping about Democratic trackers following Scott at official storm briefings. Though the storm will have an impact on every campaign in its path, the spotlight will naturally gravitate towards Scott, whose favorability rating rose after prior hurricanes. Scott, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, is repeating the same formula that served him and his predecessors well: ostensibly leave the campaign trail behind and appear at emergency operations centers as the state executive leading and issuing warnings and updates in a time of crisis. That approach ensures that Floridians throughout the state can see the governor on the local news or the Weather Channel just as voters are casting absentee ballots in the run-up to Election Day. So far, nearly 2.6 million ballots have already been mailed. Scott appeared Sunday night briefing residents from the state Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee. On Monday, he traveled to Panama City for a briefing and press conference at the Bay County Emergency Operations Center and then flew to Orlando where President Trump praised his leadership onstage at a police chiefs convention. ""This is gold for Rick Scott, said Brad Coker, a pollster with Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research. It gives him the chance to raise his profile and show he can execute under pressure. It worked for Gov. [Jeb] Bush before him. And it worked for Scott after [Hurricane] Irma. As the storm approaches Florida, Scott who has trailed Nelson marginally in much of the races public polling saw his efforts amplified by Trump, who was in Orlando Monday. I told Rick Scott, We are ready for you, Trump said during the event. We have already briefed FEMA. It looks like a big one. Can you believe it? The presidents comments came at the annual convention of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. The planned theme was law enforcement, but both Trump and Scott focused the beginning of their remarks on the storm. Scott used his time to stress his relationship with the Trump administration, which played a big role Floridas recovery from a busy 2017 hurricane season. We have a hurricane coming to our state right now, Scott said. We are doing everything we can to get ready. President Trump could not have done any more than he has, Scott continued, talking about federal government aid after past storms. He has promised all resources we need. Scotts emergence as the de facto face of the state during storms coupled with the fact he is a longtime political ally of Trump has knee-capped Nelsons ability to gain attention or tout his own ability to bring federal resources, which run through a White House much more inclined to deliver public credit to Scott. Scott has already experienced a political adrenaline shot from his past role in overseeing hurricane-preparation and recovery. One month after Irma made landfall in the Florida Keys on Sept. 10, 2017, a Mason-Dixon poll of Florida voters showed 66 percent rated Scotts handling of the storm as excellent or good. Another 44 percent had a favorable impression of Scott compared to 33 percent who had an unfavorable view. That meant Scotts net favorability rating was 11 percentage points an 8-point improvement from a Mason-Dixon poll Coker conducted eight months before. Nelson also rearranged his schedule and visited Bay Countys EOC after Scott. The senators campaign, like Scotts, says Nelson is putting politics aside to prepare for the advent and aftermath of the storm. In Bay County today to ensure local officials have everything they need ahead of the storm, Nelson tweeted Monday afternoon as he met with officials likely to see a direct hit. Nelson said Monday he asked Scott to extend the voter registration deadline for the November election. Currently, anyone not registered to vote by the end of Tuesday will not be allowed to cast ballots in the general election. Earlier in the year with Democrats internal polling showing the positive effects of Irma on Scotts poll numbers Nelsons campaign ran a digital ad pointing out how Scott contributors made a handsome profit from hurricane debris removal contracts he let without a bid. Democrats previously ran another digital ad in which they said Scott had blood on his hands for the deaths of seniors at a nursing home that ran out of power and whose calls the governor did not return, even though he gave the facility his cellphone number. Scotts office has dismissed the ads as inaccurate political gamesmanship. But by virtue of his office, the senator cant compete with the governors bully pulpit. Neither can the Democrat who seeks to replace Scott, Andrew Gillum. As mayor of Tallahassee which is well within the forecast path of the storm hitting Wednesday Gillum is getting his share of the news spotlight. But not all of it has been welcome. Trump took a shot at Gillum while in Orlando Monday, saying he runs a place that has a lot of problems and I know it very well, but it's got a lot of problems, tremendous corruption, tremendous crime."" Gillum quickly responded on Twitter. Hey @realDonaldTrump don't come to my state and talk trash about my city while we are preparing for a Category 3 hurricane. We need a partner right now, not a partisan, he wrote. Just days before Hurricane Michael formed, the Republican Party of Florida began running two commercials ( here and here ) attacking Gillum over his handling of Hurricane Hermine in 2016, when a number of Tallahassee residents felt the city didnt act quickly enough to restore power. Gillums campaign responded with a web ad featuring Leon County Sheriff Walt McNeil accusing DeSantis of lying about Hermines aftermath. Scott joined in on the criticism of Gillum but was less vocal about power outages in Jacksonville, where his former handpicked state party chairman, Lenny Curry, is mayor and was dealing with the effects of Hurricane Matthew. Once Michael was forecast to strike Florida, former Gov. and current Rep. Charlie Crist an ally of Gillums who ran against Scott in 2014 took to Twitter and called on DeSantis to take the hurricane-themed attack ads down. There is a long tradition in Fla. of setting aside partisan differences regarding hurricanes and other emergencies. During Hurricane Season, Ron DeSantis instead chose the Donald Trump playbook, attacking his opponent with disregard for the truth, and weaponizing the struggle... that everyday Floridians face when in the path of a storm, Crist wrote. With Floridians now in the path of Tropical Storm Michael, it's time for all of us to come together, to support those who might be affected by the looming storm...The fabric of our state is made stronger by the way Floridians unite in these moments, and rather than ripping us apart with his negative campaign, Ron DeSantis should unite with the rest of Florida, take down his false attack ads, and help those facing down this coming storm. DeSantis campaign said in a written statement that we are not going to respond to what are obviously politically motivated comments from Charlie Crist. The ads are scheduled to be cycled out mid-week anyway. Like Nelson in his campaign, DeSantis finds himself at a political disadvantage when it comes to media coverage of his candidacy during the storm. The national press is going to pay attention to Tallahassees mayor when the city is in the storms forecast track, providing Gillum with a chance to prove critics wrong, said Coker. And as a former congressman who vacated his seat to run for governor, DeSantis has no official office or responsibilities to easily parlay into press coverage. But for all the poll numbers showing the benefits of leading during a storm, Quinnipiac Universitys assistant polling director, Peter A. Brown, cautions that Florida campaigns probably wont hinge on the upcoming storm. Though Quinnipiacs poll over time showed that Scotts approval ratings improved before and after Irma in 2017, it didnt conduct its surveys immediately before and after the storm to get a more exact read. In polling language, the n on this the number of hurricanes that have occurred -- is very small. Its not a good random sample. There arent enough incidents to say X = Y, Brown said. Its certainly true that there have in past been some incidents where natural disasters or hurricanes have given a couple of governors opportunities to play to their strong suits.

"Opinion contributors, Opinion contributors","An Amtrak train accident in DuPont, Wash., on Dec. 18, 2017. (Photo: Elaine Thompson, AP) When an Amtrak train derailed near Tacoma, Wash. this month, military personnel from nearby Madigan Army Medical Center were the first rescuers on scene. Nineteen injured survivors were taken to Madigan for trauma care. Once at the medical center, they were treated by military health care professionals, many of whom honed their skills in Afghanistan and Iraq. Madigan’s quick response was possible because it participates in Washington State’s trauma system. In the decades leading up to the derailment, Madigan Army Medical Center staff worked tirelessly to gain and maintain authorization to treat civilian trauma patients at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. In preparation for assuming this responsibility, the medical center sought and secured American College of Surgeons accreditation as a level II trauma center. More: Are your donations to charities doing all the good they could? More: 2018: What could possibly go wrong? Five possibilities. Thanks to this preparatory work and Madigan’s daily involvement in delivering trauma care to military and civilian personnel alike, the hospital’s staff was able to swiftly respond to play a key role in treating those injured in the derailment. This is but the latest example of the value of military-civilian partnerships in trauma care. In Las Vegas last October, military professionals from nearby Nellis Air Force Base provided care to civilian victims of the mass shooting as part of an agreement between the Defense Department and the University Medical Center in Las Vegas. When another mass shooting occurred one month later in Sutherland Springs, Texas, eight victims were transported by ground or air to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, currently the Department of Defense’s only level I trauma center. Brooke also supported the civilian response to Hurricane Harvey, including caring for patients who were ill or injured following that disaster. About 18 of these civilian-military partnerships exist in one form or another across the country. In each instance, state and local governments and civilian institutions have worked with the military to hammer out agreements that underpin the collaboration in patient care. In some cases, the agreements allow civilian ambulances and patients to quickly access military medical centers on Defense installations, and in others the agreements allow military doctors, nurses and medics to provide care at civilian medical centers. Despite their apparent value, these arrangements can be difficult to forge. For example, although Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., is renowned for treating combat wounded flown in from around the world and is an ACS-designated level II trauma center, it is not part of the state’s trauma network. Another major DoD facility in Northern Virginia, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital, has not yet sought designation as a trauma center. As a result, if a mass casualty event occurred the National Capital Region, neither hospital would be in a position to accept civilian casualties. Several obstacles must be overcome to realize the benefits of military-civilian trauma partnerships. Civilian trauma centers willing to host military surgeons and other providers must meet complex legal and regulatory requirements, and determine how to integrate rotating groups of military health professionals into their trauma teams. From the military’s standpoint, there can be trepidation about sending highly trained health care professionals to non-Defense institutions, potentially reducing their availability to staff military health facilities. Some worry that bringing military medical centers into state trauma networks may adversely affect civilian practice patterns. The logistics of giving civilian ambulances speedy access to military installations can be challenging. More: Domestic violence is a tragedy. It's not a predictor of mass murder. POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media The successes in Washington State, Nevada and Texas demonstrate the benefits of overcoming these obstacles. Congress has already made its wishes clear — Section 703 of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act calls on military medical centers to serve as referral hubs and provide “level one or level two trauma care capabilities.” Pending legislative proposals such as the Mission Zero Act further outline and provide incentives to build on this concept. If Walter Reed, Fort Belvoir and other military medical centers were brought into civilian trauma systems, it would strengthen the capacity of the civilian sector to respond to disasters and acts of violence. It would also help military surgeons, ER doctors, critical care nurses and other team members to keep their skills sharp between deployments. Leveraging expertise and capacity through civilian-military partnerships makes sense. It will not only save lives; it will strengthen our national security. Col. Todd E. Rasmussen is a professor of surgery and associate dean for research at the School of Medicine at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Md. Col Matthew J.

Elizabeth Howell,"Hurricanes are devastating for the populations they hit, not only because of the damage caused by winds but also because of the increased risk of diseases after the storm passes. To help people affected by these storms, researchers used data from NASA's Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite to make predictions about cholera outbreaks. Cholera, according to the Mayo Clinic, is a bacterial disease that spreads through contaminated water or food. Symptoms of cholera can include nausea, vomiting, severe diarrhea, dehydration and even death if left untreated. There were more than 130,000 reported cases of cholera worldwide in 2016, according to the World Health Organization, but estimates of the true number of cholera cases are much higher – between 1.4 million to 4 million cases annually. ""In the countries less developed with infrastructure that is not the equivalent, let's say, of Europe or the United States or Canada, then, the population that has to rely on river water or pond water is at risk for cholera,"" microbiologist Rita Colwell said in a new video from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. She is a microbiologist and professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, and at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. [ Photos: NASA's Rain-Tracking GPM Satellite Mission in Pictures ] According to NASA, cholera outbreaks come in two types: endemic (or seasonal), or an epidemic that happens suddenly. If the use of drinking water and its availability change after a natural disaster, human behavior will also change as people seek out water. But it is difficult to predict the risk of cholera because little information is available on pathogen abundance in local water systems as well as on larger trends in weather and climate. Researchers focused on Haiti, which suffered a massive cholera outbreak in 2010 after a difficult year of natural disasters. A devastating earthquake and an aftershock hit Haiti in January 2010, followed by the hottest summer in generations. A cholera outbreak occurred in October of the same year, just weeks before Hurricane Tomas grazed the island and unleashed heavy rains. ""The data that we were able to pull together showed that in 2010 it was the hottest summer in 50 years. And then, as if that weren't enough, there was a hurricane that skirted the island, but it dumped the heaviest rainfall in 50 years,"" added Colwell, who is the former director of the National Science Foundation. Antarpreet Jutla, a hydrologist at West Virginia University, was part of a team that created an algorithm to determine the risk of cholera. This gave the researchers ""the first clues"" on the cholera outbreak in Haiti after the earthquake, he said in the NASA video. Then, Hurricane Matthew swept through Haiti in 2016. By that time, the GPM mission had been in space for two years, tracking global snowfall and precipitation. Jutla's team reused their cholera prediction algorithm, adding improved satellite data from the GPM mission, to see where cholera might occur. The model includes factors such as monthly air temperature, population density, precipitation, the severity of the natural disaster and availability of infrastructure for water, sanitation and hygiene. ""We were able to, in real time, predict the risk of cholera infection in human population at least four weeks in advance. We did the same thing for Yemen,"" Jutla said. ""We knew there was a mass movement of human population due to civil unrest in that part of the world, and then we had very heavy precipitation. And then we immediately started monitoring conditions. And that basically converged to give us a risk on where and when this disease will lock in on human population."" The researchers said they hope to improve the spatial scale of the model as they include more data sets. ""I think we can predict and prevent [cholera], and I'd like to see that happen very quickly, in the next three to five years, and I'd like to see the satellite system to be part of the regular public health tools so that we can do prediction as well as the tracking of epidemics that's done traditionally now,"" Colwell said.
