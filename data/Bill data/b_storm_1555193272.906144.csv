Mike Epstein,"A storm is coming for Fortnite. No, not the blue wave that keeps forcing you forwarda legal storm. Earlier this month, a trio of creators sued Fortnites publisher, Epic Games, over its use of the dance moves they created, which gamers can perform (and purchase) in-game with the push of a button.
Given Fortnites success, any lawsuit that could disrupt its ability to turn the games popularity into cash is a huge problem for Epic. That said, the lawsuit also has wider implication for other developers that potentially charge for pop culture dances or emotes in their games, as well as the wider cultural landscapeTV shows, movies, etc.
Everythings happening pretty fast, and theres a lot of legal jargon getting thrown around these cases, so it might be tough to understand the whole story. Lets go through the basics, so you know whats what and can follow these artists cases as the legal cases start to heat up.
Whos suing Epic?
Three artists have filed copyright lawsuits against Epic, claiming they deserve compensation for the use of dances Epic created in Fortnite without their permission (or any kind of attribution). This has led many players to associate the dances with Fortnite instead of the dances originators, and has earned the dancers a whopping zero dollars from the sales Epic makes of the dancers original creations.
The first suit was filed by rap artist 2 Milly for using the dance he created to go with his song, Milly Rock without permission or credit. Heres the songs music video, which features the dance:
And heres the Swipe it emote in Fortnite:
The second lawsuit, which seems to have gotten the most attention so far, is from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air actor Alfonso Ribeiro. Everyone knows Tom Jones-loving Carlton dance, otherwise known as Fresh within Fortnite:
Lastly, Russell Horningalso known as The Backpack Kidhas filed a third lawsuit over the use of his signature dance move, flossing, which Fortnite simply calls the Floss. (Technically, Anita Redd, Hornings mother, filed the lawsuit on his behalf because hes a minor.)
All three lawsuits request that Epic remove the emotes that correspond to the dances from the game, presumably until they pay a licensing fee, as well as damages. If youd like to read the complete claims for all three lawsuits, Variety has published the full filing paperwork.
Its also worth pointing out that this is not just about Fortnite. According to TMZ, 2 Milly, Ribeiro and Horning have filed a second set of lawsuits against a second game publisher, 2K Sports, over the use of their dances in its NBA 2K basketball game series.

Why is this happening now?
A trio of lawsuits at once may seem sudden, but a number of artists have publicly admonished Fortnite for using their dances without permission over the past six months.
In July, Chance the Rapper published a series of tweets suggesting that Epic should attribute Fortnites emotes to the dances theyre based on and, when applicable, license the songs connected to them.
Another artist, BlocBoy JB, tweeted shortly after that he would like to receive royalties from games that use the signature dance from his song Shoot, which Fortnite fans may recognize as the Hype dance emote.
In November, Scrubs actor Donald Faison said that Epic jacked his Poison dance from the show to make Fortnites default victory dance.
All of this, as Chance points out in his original tweet thread, is also part of a larger cycle of cultural appropriation. Four of the five artists weve mentioned whose dances have been put into Fortnite without permission are black. Corporate entities have found ways to repurpose and profit off creative works of black artists for a long, long time.
To put it another way: Artists have been pissed for a while. It was just a matter of time before someone decided to make things official and file a lawsuit.
Do they have a case?
Epic has told multipleoutlets it does not plan to comment publicly on the suits while theyre ongoing, but it seems unlikely that they will claim otherwise.
Instead, Epic may try to claim that the dances are not distinctive enough to be worthy of copyright protection. It is possible to copyright dance choreography, but the U.S. Copyright office specifically states that commonplace movement and gestures cannot be copyrighted. That includes specific short dances like the YMCA, because its just people making shapes with their arms. According to a legal expert who spoke to Variety, Epic may also claim that the dances in Fortnite are part of a larger procedure that goes beyond doing the dance.

What does this mean for Fortnite?
Right now, nothing. No injunctions have been filed requesting Epic stop selling the emotes immediately, so they will probably stay in the game for the foreseeable future. If a court rules in favor of any or all of the creators, Epic may remove the dances to avoid paying the creators going forward. Even if the dances stay, though, any court decision would likely change how Epicand other game developersapproach making emotes, particularly if they are being sold as in-game purchases.
To prevent exposure to lawsuits from other artists, companies would, in theory, start negotiating and purchasing permission to depict well-known dances in games, much like how companies pay licensing fees to play songs in games, TV, and film. This could include paying royalties to artists, if these dances show up as an in-game purchase.
A private settlement between Epic and those suing it, even if the creators get paid, would not create a legal precedentmaintaining the status quo. The artists behind the lawsuits have reason to hold out for an unequivocal victory, however: All three are currently in the process of formally securing the rights to their dances, and the results of the suit could impact his claim.
Since none of these lawsuits have been scheduled for trial yet, it will likely be months, maybe even years, before the results become clear.","A storm is coming for Fortnite.

Patrick Allan,"You see those green, billowing storm clouds over there? Those are bad. Not because you’ll get whisked away to some annoying musical world—no, because those clouds mean that storm is particularly nasty and dangerous. It might even mean a tornado is approaching. Do you know how to actually protect yourself during an earthquake or hurricane? What about a… Read more Read Green clouds have long been considered a signal of a coming tornado or hail storm by the people living in Tornado Alley, a large are of the U.S. that spans northern Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and beyond. Traditional folk wisdom says that the ominous color of the clouds comes from all the frogs and grasshoppers the tornadoes sucked up into the sky. How ribbiting! ( Crickets chirp.) But don’t worry, frog and grasshopper lovers, that’s obviously not what’s going on with these scary water vapor behemoths. So why the green? Youtuber and stormchaser Pecos Hank explains that it all comes down to the color spectrum, and the way objects absorb and reflect sunlight: Some of the biggest thunderstorms can generate areas of concentrated heavy rain and hail that look like waterfalls. Storm chasers call this the “core.” Sometimes storm clouds part giving you a glimpse into the core aloft. If you’re underneath the storm base, around midday, the core is often blueish or a gorgeous turquoise. But in the late afternoon and evening when most storm activity occurs, angled golden and reddish sunset light might mix with the blue precipitation core and the net effect is a greenish color. Yellow and blue makes green! William Beasley, professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, agrees. He explains to Scientific American that it all comes down to the moisture particles found in these afternoon thunderstorm clouds. They absorb red light and make the scattered light appear blue. When they’re set against an environment heavy red light, like a low sun during “golden hour” or a sunset, the net effect is a sort of greenish color. Here’s the thing, though: according to physicist Craig Bohre n at Pennsylvania State University, green storm clouds don’t necessarily mean a tornado or hail storm is coming. Basically, a hail storm or tornado can happen with or without green clouds. That’s why it’s important to be prepared for such events and not only rely on what you can see. It’s National Preparedness Month, which means it’s time to make sure you’re ready for whatever life … Read more Read That said, green clouds are a fairly decent predictor of severe thunderstorms in general. Green clouds are often tall clouds, says Scott Bachmeier, a meteorologist at the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies at UW–Madison, and tall clouds are a major ingredient for potential hail storms and tornados. So, while seeing green doesn’t mean a tornado is coming, it does mean that a tornado could be coming. No matter what, you’re in for some severe weather, friend. If you’d like to avoid heavy rain, high winds, and lightning, green skies are still a good warning sign to pack it up and get out of dodge. If you see some green clouds coming your way in the afternoon, it’s time to leave the area, or at least go inside where you can easily follow your emergency plan if need be. And if you don’t have an emergency plan yet, you should make one.","You see those green, billowing storm clouds over there? Those are bad.

Michael Hardy,"For the past decade, photographer Mitch Dobrowner has spent a few weeks every summer pursuing extreme weather across the midwestern United States with veteran storm chaser Roger Hill, who, according to the Guinness Book of World Records, has witnessed more tornadoes (more than 650) than anyone in history. During their first outing, in 2009, Dobrowner and Hill spotted a high-precipitation supercell thunderstorm in the Black Hills of South Dakota at noon and followed it all day in Hill's eight-seater van until giving up the chase at midnight in Valentine, Nebraska. ""It looked like a spaceship,"" recalls Hill, who runs Silver Lining Tours, which offers 11 storm-chasing outings each year. ""Hail the size of grapefruits, lightning strikes every three or four seconds."" Dobrowner's black and white images of that megastorm are some of the most spectacular in his ever-expanding portfolio of extreme weather photography. Although tornadoes get all the attention on TV, Dobrowner is more interested in supercells, massive storm systems that sometimes spawn tornadoes. ""I see them as living things,"" he says. ""Some are gorgeous and beautiful, some are tornadic and violent. And the longer they last the more form they take. Eventually, they mature and die. So I try to take a portrait, almost like with a person."" Unlike some storm chasers, Dobrowner isn't a thrill-seeker. He wants to capture the majesty, not the danger, of extreme meteorological events. ""I know they're destructive at times, but I don't want to photograph that,"" he says. ""I'll leave that to others who are really good at that. I see them as beautiful phenomena."" Riding along with an expert like Hill allows Dobrowner to focus on his craft. ""There's a lot of chaos going onthere's wind, there's lightning, there's noise, hail. And the composition's constantly changing, so you have to really focus on what's going on around you,"" Dobrowner says. ""I'm just listening for when Roger says, 'We gotta get out of here.'"" Growing up on Long Island, Dobrowner says he had no real conception of such severe weather events until he left home at 21 to drive across the American Southwest. Even today, after years of shooting storms, he sometimes finds himself awestruck by the scale of nature's wrath. ""It's like being in front of King Kong,"" he says. ""I don't get scaredI feel kind of honored to be standing in front of it. Sometimes I don't even photograph the storm because I just want to enjoy it.""

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright WYFF Image caption News channel WYFF 4 paid tribute to its two journalists Two journalists were killed in a ""freak of nature"" accident while covering weather conditions in North Carolina during storm Alberto. Mike McCormick and Aaron Smeltzer, from news outlet WYFF, died when a falling tree crushed their car as they drove down a highway. Fire chief Geoff Tennant had recorded an interview with the pair minutes before he received the emergency call. He said they had each exchanged wishes to stay safe just 10 minutes earlier. Mr McCormick was a reporter and anchor, and Mr Smeltzer was a photojournalist. Both were on assignment covering the extreme weather. The tree, Mr Tennant said, ""probably fell in excess of 30 feet"". While the deaths of the two journalists are not being directly attributed to the storm itself, the heavy rainfall had waterlogged the soil, probably contributing to the tree's fall. ""It is one of those things you know is going to happen, or you can predict it may happen - you don't know when,"" Mr Tennant said. He said the death of both men has ""personally affected me"", and that although it was his first meeting with Mr McCormick and Mr Smeltzer, ""you feel a sense of responsibility for them"". The news station which employed both men paid tribute to them in its reporting. ""Our news family grieves over the loss of two special journalists - and two special friends,"" news anchor Carol Goldsmith said as she reported the news on WYFF 4's evening news. Mr McCormick was an anchor and reporter covering the Spartanburg area with more than a decade's experience in the role. Mr Smeltzer had joined WYFF this year from local competitor station WSPA. In their own story on the tragedy, WSPA 7's anchors said: ""The journalists who died in today's crash were friends to many of us. ""They were committed to their work, to this community, and while we are of course competitors on air, Mike and Aaron were our friends and they were part of our larger journalism family. ""We will miss them both terribly."" Viewers also sent in their messages of sympathy after the news was broadcast. Subtropical storm Alberto is the first named Atlantic storm of 2018. It made landfall on Florida's north-western coast on Monday, which was also the Memorial Day holiday in the United States.

Shannon Stirone,"This week belongs to darkness, both Mars- and moon-related. Over on Mark Watney’s home away from home, there’s a storm a-coming: The Red Planet is dusty, covered with sandy dunes like many of the deserts on Earth, and its weather system is known to kick up a lot of that fine material. One of those big global dust storms is expected to hit sometime in 2018, potentially lasting through early 2019. And that spells trouble for the actual Martian, the Opportunity Rover, which has been exploring the rusty planet for 14 years. Unlike the Curiosity rover, which gets its power from a plutonium-powered generator, Opportunity is solar powered. If enough sunlight is blocked by the dust, Oppy might have to enter hibernation mode and ride out the storm. While it has managed to survive previous dust storms, the upcoming 2018-2019 storm could be the one that puts the brakes on it for good. The moon itself will go dark this week, at least from our perspective. On January 31, the Earth, the sun, and the moon will get in line, causing what NASA is calling a ‘super blue blood moon.’ (Yes, the term is kind of overblown; it really just means an eclipse that makes the moon kind of reddish). Those on the west coast of the United States will be treated to the best show, starting at 6:07am PST. Scientists will be watching, too.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"• Nearly half the flights at New York’s LaGuardia Airport and around a quarter of the flights at Newark Liberty International Airport were called off. The Newark airport also sidelined its AirTrain because of high winds and replaced it with shuttle buses. • More than 200,000 people were without power in Virginia, Dominion Energy reported, mostly in the northern part of the state. Forecasters were warning that other parts of the East Coast might lose power, too. • The National Weather Service said coastal flooding from high seas and storm surge could impact areas from New Jersey to Massachusetts, and warned of inland flooding from the heavy rains. • New York City and Long Island can expect heavy rain — an estimated two to three inches — and some snow mixed in, but the biggest concern will be the damaging winds in the afternoon and evening. Read more in New York Today. • Some communities in Massachusetts, including Scituate and Newburyport, urged residents to evacuate ahead of the storm. The state’s governor, Charlie Baker, warned Friday’s storm could be more severe than the Jan. 4 storm that brought historic flooding to the city. Another ‘bomb cyclone’ is expected. The dire warnings prompted Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York to activate the State Emergency Operations Center on Thursday. Governor Baker of Massachusetts said he had called in the National Guard. The Jan. 4 storm gained much attention in part because some meteorologists described it as a “bomb cyclone.” (The name essentially derives from how quickly the barometric pressure falls.) Meteorologists say the pressure in the center of this weekend’s storm will plummet so fast that it, too, is likely to become a bomb cyclone. Kim Buttrick, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s office in Taunton, Mass., said the storm was essentially an area of low pressure that was moving northeast — strengthening and spiraling before it comes to a halt for about two days. While the system spins north, the strong winds will whip out around it, Ms. Buttrick said, churning up the seas and adding to the conditions that, along with “astronomically high tides” and other factors, could create the catastrophic flooding. Video The rising waters are looking ‘really bad’ near Boston. At Revere Beach, north of Boston, the tumultuous Atlantic Ocean was churning up on the shore on Friday morning, and threatening to flood homes and businesses along the beach. “The water is bad, really bad,” said Fernando Loaiza, the manager of Antonia’s restaurant. Motorists were inching slowly along the boulevard that runs the length of the beach. All along the Massachusetts coast, residents were bracing for high tides. Combined with buffeting winds, seas were expected to surge beyond the record-breaking levels of the Jan. 4 storm, which caused major damage.

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","This tax season promises to be an...interesting one, with the government shutdown and new tax law provisions colliding to create a perfect storm of confusion and inefficiency. 
Well get to implications of the shutdown in a later post. For now, its important to understand how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changed up the credits and deductions available to tax payers. Heres what to know about tax deductions this year. 
Tax Deductions
Tax deductions lower your taxes by lowering the income you pay taxes on. So, for example, if your income is $50,000 and you take the standard deduction of $12,000 this year, you pay taxes on $38,000. (If youre really curious how your income is taxed, read this piece on marginal tax rates.)
You have the option of taking the standard deduction:
Standard Deduction: The tax law raised the standard deduction to $12,000 for 2018 for individuals, and $24,000 for married couples, making it more attractive for more filers.
Or itemizing your deductions. You might choose to itemize if your deductions are worth more than $12,000. For example:
Mortgage Interest: If you have a mortgage on a first home, second home, a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (if the loan was used to expand/improve your home), you can deduct interest payments on the loan/loans, up to $750,000. This is down from $1 million in 2017.
State, and Local Income Taxes: You can deduct state and local taxes. But, you can only deduct up to $10,000 of state, local and property taxes combined, as stipulated by the 2017 tax law.
Property Taxes: You can deduct real estate taxes if youre a homeowner. But, as noted, you can deduct up to $10,000 of state, local and property taxes combined.
Medical Expenses: You can deduct medical expenses (like prescription costs, premiums, etc.) if those expenses have surpassed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income. For 2019, youll only be able to deduct expenses exceeding 10 percent of your AGI. (Your adjusted gross income (AGI) is your taxable income minus any adjustments to income such as deductions, contributions to a traditional IRA and student loan interest, explains TurboTax.)
Investment Interest Expense: This is one area that has changed quite a bit for 2018. Essentially, you can deduct interest you paid on money borrowed to buy taxable investments, up to the amount earned from the investment.
Charitable Giving: You can deduct contributions of money or property made to qualified organizations...up to 50 percent of your adjusted gross income, according to the IRS. For cash-only gifts, the tax law increased the limit to 60 percent of AGI. 
Other deductions you may have used in previous years were likely eliminated under the law, including alimony payments resulting from a divorce settled after 2018, employee business expenses, investment fees, moving expenses, personal exemptions and tax preparation expenses.
President Donald Trumps big, beautiful Christmas present to the American people came Dec. 22,
Read more Read
Non-Itemized Deductions
If youre not itemizing, there are still some deductions you can take, technically referred to as adjustments to income or above-the-line deductions. These adjustments reduce your AGI, and your overall tax bill.
Health Savings Account Deduction: You know how were always extolling the tax efficiency of something like a HSA? This is where part of that comes into play. Money you contribute not only grows tax-free, but you can deduct how much you contribute.
IRA Contributions: If you contribute to a traditional IRA (not a Roth), you can deduct that amount if you meet certain qualifications. 
Educator Expenses: You can deduct up to $250 you spent out-of-pocket on supplies if you are a teacher.
Student Loan Interest: You can deduct the lesser of $2,500 or the total amount of interest you paid on public or private student loans, assuming you meet these qualifications.
Self-Employment Taxes. If youre self-employed, you can deduct the employer portion of your Medicare and Social Security taxes, since you are paying both employee and employer taxes.
Self-Employed Retirement Contributions: If you have a SEP IRA or or SIMPLE IRA or 401(k), you can deduct the full amount you contribute for the year.
Self-Employed Insurance Premiums: You can deduct 100 percent of health insurance premiums you paid for you and your family, assuming your spouse does not have access to insurance through work.
Thats a good starting point. If you work with a tax professional (or use software like TurboTax), be sure to ask what others you might be missing. And stay tuned for our piece on 2018 tax credits.","This tax season promises to be an...interesting one, with the government shutdown and new tax law provisions colliding to create a perfect storm of confusion and inefficiency.

Patrick Allan,"A massive, super cold storm is set to slam into the East later this week thanks to a process known as “bombogenesis,” and it’s going to have a massive impact on air travel. If you’re flying later this week, you might want to think of a backup plan, or at least pack a nice long book. Next time you go to book a flight you might want to look at the early-morning options first.… Read more Read According to the NOAA, bombogenesis is term used by meteorologists to describe the process of a cyclone that rapidly intensifies as it drops in atmospheric pressure (also known as a “bomb cyclone). In this case, it’s because there’s cold air from the land colliding with warm air over the ocean water. Think of it as a winter hurricane. It sounds scary, but it’s actually pretty common, especially on the East Coast where this type of thing occurs almost every year, albeit usually on a smaller scale. Unfortunately, this particular storm is shaping up to be a pretty big one, and freezing temperatures, massive blizzards, tons of ice, and high-speed winds are going to make it really hard for planes to fly and for airports to keep things running smoothly. This probably isn’t going to go too well. If you have a flight in or out of any airports on the East Coast—from Florida’s Tallahassee International (TLH) all the way up to Maine’s Bangor International (BGR)—you should contact your airline immediately and see what’s going on. Many airlines are preparing for major delays and cancellations, but they’re also offering travel waivers to passengers in case you’d like to change your flights to a later date at no additional cost. These airlines include Alaska, American, Delta, Frontier, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit, United, and more. JT Genter at The Points Guy blog has a thorough list of what each airline is offering for this particular weather event. It’s important you take some initiative here and contact your airline so you know the specifics for your flight itinerary, but it’s also helpful if you can be flexible and delay your trip. Delays are all but guaranteed, and cancellations are definitely possible as well. Keep in mind that when you bought a ticket you agreed that the airline is not responsible for paying for your food or hotel stays in the event of weather-related delays or cancellations. Be prepared for the worst to happen and plan accordingly. Safe travels.","A massive, super cold storm is set to slam into the East later this week thanks to a process known as “bombogenesis,” and it’s going to have a massive impact on air travel.

Rachel Becker,"When Hurricane Michael crashed into the Florida Panhandle on October 10th, the storm cut power to parts of Florida and Georgia in its path, new NASA images show. The pictures are a stark reminder of our energy infrastructure’s vulnerability to natural disasters. The pictures went up today on NASA’s Earth Observatory blog, but lights have started to turn back on since the “after” image was snapped on October 12th. At this point, the number of customers without power has dropped to 163,000 from the 2.6 million that lost power after the storm, according to the Edison Electric Institute. (To be clear, that count reflects the number of meters that aren’t getting electricity, not the number of people, which is probably higher.) Some areas may have to wait weeks or even months for the grid to be repaired enough for the power to turn back on, NASA’s Earth Observatory says. That’s a lot of time for people to be without electricity for things like powering refrigerators, charging up medical devices, and running AC units. So why don’t hurricane-prone regions like Florida bury their power lines instead of stringing them up just to be torn down by powerful winds? Last year, 6.7 million of Florida’s electricity customers lost power after Hurricane Irma hit, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That’s almost two-thirds of the customers in the state. It’s a question that Ted Kury, director of energy studies at the University of Florida, has been studying. And the answer is: it’s complicated, he writes in an article for The Conversation. Sure, burying power lines underground keeps them safe from wind, but it can also increase the risk that storm surge and flooding could damage the wires. Plus, putting wires underground is expensive, and it can make it more difficult to get at the power lines for repairs. Power companies have to weigh the pros and cons of undergrounding versus more mainstream strategies like making sure a stiff wind won’t topple trees onto power lines. And as climate change increases hurricane intensity, the stakes for that calculation will continue to rise.","When Hurricane Michael crashed into the Florida Panhandle on October 10th, the storm cut power to parts of Florida and Georgia that were in its path, new NASA images show.

Eric Niiler,"The governments new weather forecast model has a slight problem: It predicts that outside temperatures will be a few degrees colder than what nature delivers. This cold bias means that local meteorologists are abandoning the National Weather Service in favor of forecasts produced by British and European weather agencies.
For the past few weeks, the National Weather Service has been forecasting snowfall that ends up disappearing, according to Doug Kammerer, chief meteorologist at WRC-TV in Washington, DC. Its just not performing well, Kammerer says. It has continued to show us getting big-time snowstorms in this area, where the European model will not show it.
The new model, known as GFS-FV3 (Finite Volume on a Cubed Sphere dynamical core), has often overpredicted snow in the Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston, a region where incorrect forecasts affect the lives of tens of millions of people.
The existing NWS forecast model, called the Global Forecast System, or GFS, has long been considered second in accuracy to the European models. Now Kammerer and others say the new FV3 upgrade is worse than the forecast model put out by our neighbors to the north. The running joke now among meteorologists is that [the FV3] is looking more like the Canadian model, Kammerer says. For those not plugged into weather humor, apparently the Canadian model also predicts big snowstorms that ultimately vanish.
The FV3 was developed over the past three years by NOAAs Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. FV3 forecasts were released a few weeks ago for testing by local meteorologists, and many of them took to Twitter to complain about the results. I have no faith in the FV3 [for snowfall], tweeted Boston-based Judah Cohen, a meteorologist at Atmospheric Environmental Research, a private firm that provides forecasts to commercial and government clients.
On Wednesday, the National Weather Service tweeted that the FV3 will be fully operational on March 20. But a NWS official told WIRED on Friday that the agency might push it back a few weeks because of all the complaints.
The FV3 upgrade uses an enhanced set of algorithms that have been developed in the past few years by climate scientists to describe the interaction between the atmosphere and the oceans. These algorithms, which capture the physics of cloud formation, tropical storms, and polar winds, among other things, are then populated with temperature data from satellites and surface observations to generate a three- or 10-day forecast.
No model is perfect, says David Novak, acting director of the NWS National Center for Environmental Prediction. The weather community knows this. Novak acknowledges that the FV3 has a cold bias and that the agency is working to fix it. It tends to be colder than what is observed. It appears to be a systematic issue, we are doing our due diligence and investigating these reports.
Novak says the 35-day government shutdown slowed final testing of the FV3. When federal climate scientists and programmers got back to work on January 25, the agency expected the model to be almost ready to go live. It looks like that deadline will now be pushed back.
He argues, however, that the FV3 isnt all bad. He says it produces more accurate forecasts of hurricane intensity and the jet stream, the current of high-altitude air around the northern hemisphere that drives much of the United States weather patterns. We found a lot of the good things, Novak says. We do know there are some areas that may need additional improvement.
NOAA recently signed an agreement with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a Boulder-based research facility that also develops forecast models. Antonio Busalacchi, director of NCARs parent agency, says hes optimistic that the new NWS model will get better over time. Its premature to evaluate any one modeling system based on a snapshot with snowfall forecasts, Busalacchi says. One needs to look at the totality of the system.
At the same time, Busalacchi says that NWS and its parent agency, NOAA, might want to rely on help from academic scientists who are developing their own forecast models. We want to get in a position where the research community and operational community are more collaborative than we have been in the past, he says.
As for Kammerer, he says he'll keep watching the new NWS model as he prepares his own forecast for the weather in Washington, DC. But maybe not for the next snow day.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Things that look unintentionally like dicks will never not be funny. And so I present to you, dear reader, the map above that depicts the odds of topical storm-force winds from Tropical Storm Walaka. This is truly the only funny thing on this horrible Friday so lets enjoy it. And while youre here, lets talk about how Alaska could improbably be hit by the dongicaneor at least its remnantsearly next week. Tropical Storm Walaka already occupies a special place in history as the last named storm on Central Pacifics list. But Walaka could go out with a bang by pursuing a weird track. After shooting to the west of Hawaii, the storm has continued its run northward. Walaka will tilt northeast over the weekend, which is how you end up with the phallic-shaped map of wind probabilities pointed squarely at Alaska. Its expected to transition to an extratropical storm or even just remnants as it cruises into the Gulf of Alaska, but Walaka seems very likely to hit the state in some form. The National Weather Service office in Juneau is forecasting that it will reach the state late this weekend with winds near 34 mph. Because it will still have a tap of tropical moisture, it should also bring a good amount of rainfall to the southern panhandle, though theres still some uncertainty. Typhoons in the northwest Pacific regularly make a huge C-shaped curve from China and Japan back toward Alaska, generating some of the Bering Seas most explosive storms. But storms like Walaka, which formed in the central Pacific, rarely find their way this far north or curving back this far east. You have to have a perfect confluence of conditions, Brian Brettschneider, a climate researcher with the University of Alaska Fairbanks, told Earther. You need a strong hurricane west of Hawaii that is tracking north. The position of the subtropical ridge has to be just right to cause the storm to recurve north and northeast. It has to be picked up by an upper-level trough but without being absorbed right away. Waters in the Gulf of Alaska are also nice and toasty for this time of year, running up to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) above normal. That will also lend a hand to Walakas strength and longevity. Bettschneider highlighted the remnants of hurricanes Ana and Ignacio in 2014 and 2015, respectively, as storms that made the trip from the eastern Pacific to Alaska. But an unnamed storm in 1975 and Hurricane Oho in 2015 are among the only storms on record from the central Pacific to reach the Last Frontier, both as extratropical storms. That 1975 storm was closest a tropical storm has come to Alaska. So Walaka is in rare territory, which is pretty cool. But also, the wind map looks like a dick.","Things that look unintentionally like dicks will never not be funny.

RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.,"The amount the ground can soak up is limited, because it is so wet, but thats a lot better than having it frozen, because frozen ground is like a parking lot, Mr. Pearson added. Water just flows right off.
Over all, he said, the storm does not seem as powerful at this point as the March tempest, but it still has a lot of moisture and lot of potential to cause a lot of problems, he said. Its still going to pack a punch.
Forecasters say that for a storm to officially qualify as a bomb cyclone, the atmospheric pressure must drop at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, creating a particularly strong and rapidly intensifying storm. This one might not produce quite that steep a pressure drop, they say.
But temperatures are set to plunge quickly just the same, as a low-pressure system drawing in moisture to the Midwest is displaced by a high-pressure system full of colder air. Omaha, for example, is predicted to see its daytime high temperature fall from almost 80 degrees on Monday to about 40 degrees on Friday.
The bigger flood risk this time may center on the Mississippi River and its swollen tributaries rather than the Missouri River, where levels have been receding, said Jeff Berardelli, a meteorologist.
It will be a more prolific snow producer and a more blinding blizzard than the bomb cyclone was, Mr. Berardelli said of the new storm, partly because it may idle over much of the Midwest for a time.
Its likely going to slow down and stall, he said. Literally, the storm will barely move.
But like Mr. Pearson, Mr. Berardelli said that a higher proportion of snow than rain may be a good thing.
If it melts over a longer period of time, that would be better, he said. We dont want it all happening in a day or two.","Flooding in the town of Hamburg, Iowa, on March 20.

The State Senate and Assembly majorities each have a vote on the board, and so does the governor. Unanimity is required. The Queens neighborhood where Amazon is heading is represented by State Senator Michael Gianaris, a Democrat who has spoken out against the deal. In January, he becomes the second-most powerful senator in the chamber. Whether Gianaris actually wants to kill the deal or merely exact more concessions from Amazon remains to be seen, Ms. Rubinstein writes.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Bombs. They’re on the nation’s collective mind. Earther can’t really give you any insights into our big button boy’s mindset on the nuclear front, but we’ve got you covered when it comes to this bomb cyclone thing that’s about to “ blast the East Coast.” Snow is falling in northern Florida thanks to moist air from the Gulf of Mexico intersecting with the frigid cold hanging over the eastern U.S. The impending storm will get really organized and march up toward the Mid-Atlantic this evening, where there are rare blizzard watches already in effect. By late tonight or early tomorrow, snow, storm surge, and powerful winds will smack the Northeast. Along the way, this extratropical cyclone will undergo “explosive bombogenesis.” Or, in less nerdy terms, it will bomb out. And that has got people on edge. You’ve probably seen the Washington Post tweet that sparked the whole bomb cyclone freakout (it is a Very Good Tweet): In some ways, the freakout is warranted. This is shaping up to be a massive, dangerous storm that could fell records and cause widespread power outages. Snow in Florida is really, deeply weird and wrong. The cold air rushing in after the storm passes could be deadly. But let’s step back for a sec and talk about what’s actually going on. In simple terms, bombogenesis describes what happens when a storm’s central pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. The lower the pressure, the more intense the storm. Those types of rapid drops can happen in hurricanes, but only extratropical cyclones—storms that have cold air at their core—technically qualify as bomb cyclones. That means you generally only get weather bombs in winter, and often in coastal areas where cold land meets relatively warm ocean water. The bigger the difference between warm and cold air masses, the bigger the potential for bombogenesis. “The contrast between the warm and cold air gives you an indication of the energy available to intensify an extratropical cyclone,” Andrea Lang, a meteorologist at the University of Albany, told Earther. “In this case, large contrasts in temperature between Arctic air currently over the Northeast and warm Atlantic waters suggest the potential for an intense cyclone.” This week’s bomb storm could see pressure drop an unbelievable 45 millibars in 24 hours, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration model ensemble. It’s forecast to bottom out around 950 millibars, a central pressure typically associated with Category 3 hurricanes (though this storm will not bring Category 3 winds). While this storm could be one for the record books, storms bombing out isn’t that rare. Jonathan Martin, a meteorology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told BuzzFeed that you can expect about 10 of these types of storms across the northern hemisphere in any given winter. In the Northeast, many storms that bomb out take the form of nor’easters, winter storms that have their strongest winds out of the northeast. In Europe, they’re usually wind storms. Elsewhere like the Bering Sea, they’re just really nasty storms. Scientists have been throwing around some combination of the terms “bomb,” “bombogenesis,” “weather”,and “climatological” since the 1940s. They somewhat entered the mainstream lexicon in 1980. That year, MIT professors Fred Sanders and John Gyakumpublished the amazingly-titled study “Synoptic-Dynamic Climatology of the ‘Bomb.’” It’s one of the first papers to deconstruct the process of bombogenesis. Sanders attributes the focus on rapidly dropping pressure in storms to Tor Bergeron, a Swedish meteorologist who also gave us our working theory of how precipitation forms in the 1930s. So, this whole cyclone bomb thing has been a known quantity for a while. That doesn’t mean this storm won’t be bad, or that you shouldn’t be prepared for power outages, especially considering the bone-rattling cold that will follow. But make sure to allocate your freakout between meteorological and existential threats accordingly.",Bombs. They’re on the nation’s collective mind.

Beth Skwarecki,"A hurricane’s category only tells you about its wind speed, but much of its devastation comes from flooding. With Hurricane Florence, some areas could see as many as 30 inches of rain plus ten feet of storm surge. What is a storm surge? The winds of a hurricane push water around, even while the storm is still in the ocean. Water that is pushed onto land becomes the storm surge. Think of how the tide can roll in from the sea and cover up land that was previously bare. It’s like that, except you have tides in addition to the storm surge, raising water levels even higher. Where does the storm surge happen? It’s not just an issue at the coast. Storm surges can cause flooding in upstream rivers, or in any low-lying areas the surge water reaches. North Carolina is so flat that the surge is expected to cause flooding many miles inland. How much flooding should we expect? Total flooding depends on the storm surge, including storm tides, plus rainfall. It varies depending on the exact contours of the land. And your safety in the storm depends on other factors as well: perhaps your house will be dry, but if all the roads are flooded, that doesn’t help you much. Bottom line, if you or a loved one are in the area, the most important map is an evacuation map. But if you’re curious about the predicted flooding, here is the storm surge prediction map from the National Hurricane Center. Predictions change as more information comes in, and the NHC notes that the map “includes many assumptions and has limitations, and it cannot tell you what amount of flooding will definitely occur at any given location.” Hurricane Florence is expected to make landfall along the Atlantic coast as early as this coming… Read more Read Rainfall predictions are shown on a separate map, and those predictions are likewise going to change as forecasters watch the storm approach. In the meantime, keep an eye on public advisories from weather.gov and listen to local warnings and evacuation orders. Also check out our rundown of hurricane tracking tools.

Miriam Kramer,"A darkly colored storm on Neptune that's the diameter of the Atlantic Ocean is shrinking. The Hubble Space Telescope first spotted the dying storm in 2015 and has kept an eye on it over the past few years. The most recent photos from the Hubble show that the storm is shrinking. SEE ALSO: Never-Before-Seen Alien Planet Caught on Camera This isn't totally unexpected. While storms like Jupiter's Great Red Spot have been raging for centuries, Neptune's storms tend to be more short-lived, NASA said. Oh, also, the dark storm may smell like rotten eggs. According to NASA, the storm is probably made of hydrogen sulfide, meaning that, yes, it probably has that distinct, gassy smell. The storm's ""particles themselves are still highly reflective; they are just slightly darker than the particles in the surrounding atmosphere,"" Joshua Tollefson from the University of California at Berkeley said in a statement. Although scientists understand that the storm is shrinking, Neptune's tempests still hold some mysteries. First of all, researchers aren't exactly sure how these storms form in the first place — though they do have some guesses. “We have no evidence of how these vortices are formed or how fast they rotate,” Agustín Sánchez-Lavega from the University of the Basque Country, said in the statement. “It is most likely that they arise from an instability in the sheared eastward and westward winds.” Also, the storm isn't dying in the way the scientists expected. Hubble photos showing the death of the storm. Image: NASA, ESA, and M.H. Wong and A.I. Hsu (UC Berkeley) Earlier simulations showing the deaths of these kinds of storms suggested that ""anticyclones under Neptune’s wind shear would probably drift toward the equator,"" Michael Wong of the University of California at Berkeley, said in the statement. ""We thought that once the vortex got too close to the equator, it would break up and perhaps create a spectacular outburst of cloud activity.” That wasn't the case. Instead, the storm seems like it's just fading into nothing as it moves toward Neptune's south pole and not the planet's equator as expected, NASA said. Storms like this one on Neptune were first spotted by the Voyager 2 spacecraft during its trip through the solar system.

PALKO KARASZ,"LONDON — Storm Eleanor tore through Europe on Wednesday with winds of up to 100 miles per hour, bringing lightning and heavy rain, battering houses with hail, flooding streets and uprooting trees. The storm — named Burglind in Austria, Germany and Switzerland — arrived in tandem with a cold front, hitting Ireland before passing through Britain and on to Continent. Travelers were delayed, and the storm was expected to be felt as far north as the Baltics and as far south as Italy. Weather warnings were the order of the day, with forecasts of violent winds, mostly in coastal areas.

Mark Kaufman,"The dust storm on Mars continues to grow. On Wednesday, NASA announced the storm has progressed from a continent-sized tempest to an event that has engulfed the entire red planet.

SEE ALSO: NASA's Opportunity rover braves huge dust storm on Mars as scientists keep watch But a storm can't keep the Curiosity rover down. The space robot, which has been exploring the Martian surface since 2012, took a pretty amazing selfie as the storm was heating up on June 15. That said, NASA's other functioning rover on Mars isn't doing quite as well in the storm. For two weeks, the storm has smothered the Mars Opportunity rover, turning day to night and blocking nearly all light from reaching the robot's solar arrays. A shade simulation of dust blocking out the Martian sun. Opportunity has been experiencing the far right conditions. Image: nasa The energy-starved machine has been in sleep-mode for the past week, and is no longer communicating with NASA engineers — though, they're hopeful the robot will charge up when the storm dissipates. That said, even if Curiosity experiences near total darkness, it won't lose power like Opportunity. Curiosity, a car-sized rover, runs on nuclear energy. It's unknown how long this dust storm will last, though previous Martian dust storms have persisted for weeks to months. It's also unknown why some Martian storms stay relatively small and die off after a week, while others continue to grow. ""We don't have any good idea,"" Scott Guzewich, an atmospheric scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, said of these storms in a statement. But Curiosity, along with spacecraft orbiting Mars, are now in an ideal position to send information about this progressing dust storm back to Guzewich and other NASA scientists. Mars, though, is an ideal place for dust storms to occur. Unlike Earth, it has no trees and vegetation to keep dirt rooted to the Earth. And Mars' oceans have long since evaporated away, leaving a vast dust-ridden desert at the mercy of the callous Martian winds.","The dust storm on Mars continues to grow.

Emily Price,"A bomb cyclone hit Colorado on Wednesday. While the term sounds like something out of science fiction, its quite realbomb cyclone is a scientific term describing the aftermath of bombogenesis, which is another word Im thankful is now in my vocabulary. So, to understand a bomb cyclone you first need to understand a bombogenesis.
Bombogenesis
According to the National Ocean Service, a bombogenesis describes a midlatitude cyclone that rapidly intensifies. 
Heres the full definition from the ocean service.
[Bombogenesis] occurs when a midlatitude cyclone rapidly intensifies, dropping at least 24 millibars over 24 hours. A millibar measures atmospheric pressure. This can happen when a cold air mass collides with a warm air mass, such as air over warm ocean waters. The formation of this rapidly strengthening weather system is a process called bombogenesis, which creates what is known as a bomb cyclone.
Its referred to as a bomb because its an explosive storm that cpmes on quickly. Bombogenesis is a combination of the two words bomb and cyclogenesis. All storms are considered cyclones, and genesis means the beginning. So Bombogenesis is the beginning of an explosive storm.
Bomb cyclone
The lower the pressure gets, the stronger the storm, or bomb cyclone, will be. Stronger storms can mean high winds and large amounts of snow.
In the case of Denver, when an Arctic air mass from the north hit the warm, humid air mass that was over the area at the time, the pressure dropped quickly and the bomb cyclone was formed.
This essentially means that it was a strong storm that appeared quickly, rather than a slow storm that everyone was able to track on its approach.
While we dont hear about them too often, bomb cyclones typically occur at least once a year, according to the National Weather Service. With climate change, theyre something we might start to see a lot more of as cold air continues to migrate a bit farther south than it has in the past.","A “bomb cyclone” hit Colorado on Wednesday.

Ron Miller,"In a town full of venture capital firms, Storm Ventures has made its mark with a singular focus on the enterprise. This week, the company announced it has taken on two freshly minted partners, Arun Penmetsa and Paul Willard, to continue the mission. They are doubling the number of partners with this announcement. Penmetsa has been a principal at Storm for the last 3.5 years before being promoted to partner recently. Before joining Storm he worked as an engineer at Oracle and Google. Meanwhile, Willard, who was previously a partner at Subtraction Capital and has had stints as CMO at Atlassian and Practice Fusion also joined Storm as a partner this year. The two men join a firm with over $800 million in assets under management and each brings real world experience working at successful enterprise companies Willard says he felt like he found kindred spirits when started talking to the folks at Storm because their mission matched so well with his work helping young enterprise companies. “Part of the reason I came on board is I align so well with them,” Willard told TechCrunch. As he pointed out, the company has been working with early-stage enterprise startups for the past 17 years and most VC firms in Silicon Valley are lacking that concentrated enterprise experience. “Everyone else might have a partner or two, but the enterprise is not the [primary] focus of their existence,” he said. Penmetsa, who was hired by Storm out of graduate school at Stanford, has worked his way up the company the ladder the old fashioned way. He says working at a venture capital company that emphasizes the enterprise has its advantages. “Storm’s strategy is pretty focused on enterprise and enterprise SaaS companies. We focus on that one area, and spending more time in that area, we have some sense of how [enterprise] companies evolve. It’s not a blueprint, but patterns do emerge,” he explained. In his role at Storm before the promotion, Penmetsa worked with a variety of enterprise startups including TruStar Technology, a security startup concentrating on threat information sharing and ShoCard, a blockchain identity startup. He plans to continue to looking at security, while also exploring digital healthcare as well. Willard, who was an aerospace engineer at Boeing in the 1990s, has a passion for airline-related startups, and when he was at Subtraction he helped a number of companies including Zipline, which is building robot airplanes to deliver emergency supplies like blood and medicine and Boom, a company building a new generation of supersonic transport planes. He plans to bring that experience to bear at Storm as well. While he says that he is open to talking to any enterprise software startup, he has his eye on Robotics as a Service and drone companies in particular at the moment. The two new partners are already on board and at work at Storm. Today marks the formal announcement of their hiring.

Emily Price,"If youre in New York City of Chicago this weekend you might potentially be able to catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights.
The experience is thanks to s geomagnetic storm that is expected to occur in the area Saturday. Typically geomagnetic storms create solar winds that cause gas particles in Earths atmosphere to radiate light when it hits them. Saturday that geo agent storm will be hit with a coronal mass ejections (CME), which is a collection of charged particles from the layer of gas that surrounds the sun, The Points Guy reports.
The one thing scientists dont know is how strong the storm will be, and that strength will play a direct role in where youll be able to see the Northern Lights.
As for where you might see them tonight, that answer is specifically extremely northern areas like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Maine. If the storm is a strong one, Chicago and New York could also see the lights. Canada, Scandinavia, and parts of northern Britain and Ireland also might have a chance of seeing the lights.

David Murphy,"Kaeo Milker has had a long and eye-opening career at Blizzard Entertainment: QA, facilities management, recruiting and, now, heading up the companys big MOBA franchise, Heroes of the Storm. Youre probably more likely to follow his advice than follow him down a lane, though; although hes the captain of the Heroes ship, hes quick to admit that you wont find him at the top of the games leaderboards. We caught up with Kaeo at this years BlizzCon, and he gave some excellent advice about how to manage what you think you should do as a career versus what youd love to do as a career. Name: Kaeo Milker Location: Irvine, California Current gig: Production Director, Heroes of the Storm Current computer: a Blizzard-specced machine One word that best describes how you work: Triage First of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where you are today. I took a very long and windy road to get here. My undergrad, I went to school to be a veterinarian. That was my path that I was going down. I was an animal science major in college and... its a very different path where I am now. I love video games, though, and I love Blizzard. Blizzard was the pinnacle for me. I lived in Southern California and I found out they were hiring for game testers for Warcraft 3, and I basically quit another career and came into Blizzard to try to get my foot in the door and see what it was all about. I had no idea what video game development was. There were not a lot of resources then; there werent really things you could study in school, necessarily, that would take you down the path of game development, because it was still pretty young industry at that point. I loved it. I wanted to see what it is. I wanted to be a part of it. And I basically did anything. They were just testing games, and that parlayed into a bizarre role of recruiting-slash-facilities management. Every opportunity given to me, I just was trying to do the best job I couldbe kind and collaborative to everybody that I came across, and make sure that people knew me as just a hard-working nice person that they wanted to be around. As opportunities unfoldedas the company grewthere were more and more things that I was getting responsibility for. And I did my best not to screw all those things up along the way. And I think I continue to get rewarded with more responsibility over time, for just proving myself as a valuable person in this organization. Take us through a recent workday. A typical Monday, Im coming into the office. First thing, I have a directors meeting with the leadership team of my game itself. So I sit down with that group of people and we basically just talk about everything thats on our mind coming back from the weekend. We play the game a lot, so we talk about the game itself; we talk about our challenges from the week before. We start aligning on the things we want to make sure were all conscious of as we move into the work weekendall the crazy things that are going on with our game and its development. Thats a very collaborative process. While Im the senior-most developer on the team, I rely heavily on a technical director, the lead of engineering team, an art director, and two design leads. We all work really closely together to keep track of the game and make sure were all staying on the right things at any moment in time. I get a lot of mail; Im copied on a lot of things. So I had not just a lot of rules, like, literally, thousands of rules, I had 17 years worth of rules, because I never clean them out. They basically just accumulated. But I got to a place where my rules started interacting in a really bad way, and I was losing things, and I actually killed every single rule I had. That goes into a leadership meeting for Blizzard that I go to. I step out of the Heroes portion of it, and its a bunch of leaders from across the game teams and across Blizzard having a similar conversation that I just had about my Heroes team, but now were talking about Blizzard as a whole. I get a lot of perspectives and insights and input from them, and have the opportunity for me to raise challenges and questions and also listen to the things that theyre bringing up. So its, again, a very collaborative, very supportive environment, with a lot of people who genuinely care about not just the work that were doing on our individual games, but what what the collective work of the company is at any given moment. And then I go into a series of meetingsa lot of meetings. Actually, we fight against meetings. We want meetings to be short and effective, and we dont want any more meetings than what we need to have, but I am getting kicked into a lot of them. Some of them are informational, where Im a fly on the wall, just trying to pay attention and hear what everybodys talking about. A lot of it is challenges of creative things or prioritization calls that were trying to make across the game. A lot of interaction with external teams too, so I might bounce from a design meeting where Im focused on Heroes, the game, to a meeting with our our web and mobile team, or talking about our new forums that are going to roll out, and then go into a lot of one-on-ones. I have a lot of direct reports, people who work with me, but I also want to talk to everybody on our team. Its really important to me to stay in contact with them. Ill hear their perspectives on the game, on the way were running the team in the game, so that we can all kind of align to do the best work possible. This is a creative environment and Blizzard is fueled by peoples passions. Its really important that people are motivated and excited. And thats the only way that were all able to do this magic that is game development, where youre kind of just making stuff out of the ether. And that leads into my lunches, which usually our one-on-one lunches as well. Ill go to lunch with someone and well just be talking about career development, the games, or a big challenge that were dealing with at that moment in time. Thats a lot of digging deep into the problem of the moment. And production is a lot of problem-solving: just working a problem, focusing on the right thing, and making our way through it. We have play test every day. So a chunk of my day will be getting involved in a test, either with the design group, or it could be with our UI team, just getting a snapshot of something tangible that I can log into the game, check out, and give feedback on to make sure that it feels like were aligned to the right things. And then I do a lot of strategic work with outside leaders as well, talking about the overarching course of the game and all the content that were aligning to. Theres a lot of meetings with PR, and marketing, and publishing about how weve done all this great work with the game, now how do we want to talk about it. What are the moments that we want to be shouting from the rooftops and where do we want to create that anticipation for the next thing that were building toward? I dont know what we just did, but its kind of beautiful and kind of scary at the same time. What apps, gadgets, or tools cant you live without? Theres all kinds. We use Confluence a lot for many things at Blizzard, so whether its make meeting notes, or setting up the stage for a big conversation we want to have directly with people, or exposing things for our entire team they can weigh in on, whether its art, or design, our scheduling, everythings kind of built into there so that we can share information and have a mechanism to track and comment on it. We have a lot of internally developed tools that we use as well. One of the big ones is something called Play Tester, which is a way for the design team to basically create a list of all the things in a given build that they want people to check out and playfocusing the peoples attention on certain areas of the game. That tool not only gives us that information, but it allows us to quickly download and play the correct build on the correct correct environment so that we can actually jump in, play the game, and check out those things. Whats your workspace setup like? I do a billion things in Excel, even when I have bigger tools at my disposal. My actual workspace is an office with a whole bunch of chairs in it. Usually if Im in my office, and not on the way to a meeting, its an unending stream of people. My door is usually open and people will just come in and talk to me about random things. We do have white boards, and they are pretty crazy. Theres a lot of stuff on my whiteboard right now that I didnt erase because it was so chaotic. I was like, I dont know what we just did, but its kind of beautiful and kind of scary at the same time. My job overlaps with the production of the game, so I use Excel for a lot of tracking and visualizing things, but my job also intersects with the business of the game, too, so Im doing a lot of data analysis of things that come from Tableau, like data on the game itself, or data on the business of the game. For my own curiosity, or to answer questions that I have at any given moment, Im doing a lot of number crunching, and Excel is usually might go-to tool for for doing that Whats your best shortcut or life hack? My world is very chaotic, and theres a lot of things, so its going back to a very basic to-do list. When I say triage, its about sitting down and prioritizing. There are many things that are going to give in a day for me, and so its critical for me to identify the things that I want to ensure that I dont give on, so that Im making conscious choices of what Im letting go of and Im focusing on the things that are most critical for me to actually accomplish today. So, something as simple as just a basic to-do listand this is the one thing I write on paper physically, too. Everything else is digital except for this to-do list, so that Im going back to something tangible and physical that is ultimately guiding me on ensuring that if I do nothing else today, I have to do these things. Whats your best email hack? For a very long time, I was driven by rules. I get a lot of mail; Im copied on a lot of things. So I had not just a lot of rules, like, literally, thousands of rules, I had 17 years worth of rules, because I never clean them out. They basically just accumulated. But I got to a place where my rules started interacting in a really bad way, and I was losing things, and I actually killed every single rule I had. Now, even though I get literally thousands of emails, I am filtering my mail manually again. It was a weird thing to go back to, but its been better in the end, and its also made me a lot more disciplined about what Im responding to, what Im reading, and the things that I want push asidethat Im making a conscious choice to push them aside instead of some rule from 2003 that did it. Take us through an interesting, unusual, or finicky process you have in place at work. Heroes makes patches and releases constantly. At any moment, there might be three or four or five releases in simultaneous parallel development, and we get to the point where we want to lock those things down as we approach actually launching them to the public. To do that, we start closing gates off. Many developers do this stuff, but for us, we used to have a thing called silver ticket, which was the path to golden ticket. Once you get to golden ticket, nothing changes without an approval. Like, I got a golden ticket, I can change this now. We had to extend that, though, because we werent very disciplined about sticking to golden ticketso we created silver ticket. Today, that process is very, very curated. At any moment, were stampeding towards locking down a built so that we can release it. And because we dont change our dates on anything herebasically, the game patches on a regular cadencethe question is Whats going to be in the patch? Did all the things that we wanted to do make it? Or did we yank a whole bunch of them out because we didnt have time for them? The games still going to patch, its just a question of whats inside of that patch. This process by which we arrive at our final release candidate, which is a version of the build thats actually going to go out to the public, is insane. Its just so much wrangling from a lot of people to to make sure that we lock ourselves out and close off every spigot of stuff that pours into that in time to release it. It never ends. We do that process today, and were starting into golden ticket mode on the next one immediately because Heroes releases are so close together. Our Live Operations team lives in perpetual state of release finalization. For anybody who finalizes releases, thats not a fun state to live in, but theyre mastering it and are really, really good at it. Who are the people who help you get things done, and how do you rely on them? It takes village to make a game. I rely on everybody, from my leadership team, to other directors on my team, to every producer. Again, as as the Production Director, Im ultimately overseeing the pipelines for the game, our structure and strategy of the way were actually developing it. I have a team of producers at every level, going from associate producers to lead producers, that I trust to carry forth the timelines while also maintaining something very special to Blizzard. We dont ship things until theyre ready. Heroes moves very fast, so we have to this weird alchemy of how do we maintain Blizzard quality at the same time as moving incredibly quickly and releasing all the time. And it was a very different thing for us. We had to change our mentality and our workflow and our tools, everything had to change around that notion. And the production team is really the glue that holds it all together and keeps people honest, Production at Blizzard is not like this authority that comes in and says, You must do this and you must do it now. I kind of call us opportunistic enablers. Its about looking for those moments that we can help, that we can speed things up, that we can remove the roadblocks, that we can unblock people on, facilitate communication, everything we can do to keep the machine moving. And so production is the biggest part of that. Whats your favorite side project? Its not really a side project, But for me, its like a real shifting gears: Blizzcon. We create these moments where we want to talk about a lot of things for our game, and its a celebration to me, really, because we work on all this stuff, and theres a couple of times a year that we get the biggest platforms possible that we can speak to them. Now were physically here at Blizzcon on a Friday, and thats the magical time where we get to meet the players, and we get to talk to the journalists, and watch the esports, and all these things become real to us. Its not the work anymore, its the result of all that work and its a really special time to celebrate Whats the best advice youve ever received? I grew up with parents who were really passionate about their jobs. Their jobs werent about money, it was about something that they were excited to get up every morning and go to. My veterinary path was me trying to go, Well, I need to be professional. So this is professional, and I love animals, and its good, its all going to work out. But there was this moment where I had this turning point of, Should I go down this path of video games or continue down that? I talked to them, and they reiterated to me, You need to follow your passions. Thats what weve always done, and we would encourage you to do that as well. And I had to make some difficult life choices at that moment to change my path. I started from nothing, and there were no guarantees that this was all going to go anywhere at all. But having that support to just go, You have to go for these things, this is importantit transformed me. In Heroes, one of the best things you can do to be a better player is to stop dying. Whats a problem youre still trying to solve? Theres nothing that we do that I ever say, Cool. Were done with that. Check that box, were done, and lets move on to something else. Its always a question of, What if we try that? I love that. That part of it is exciting work. Id get really bored, I think, if I mastered game development. That challenge never goes away. On one hand, you never get some permanent sense of satisfaction, like, I mastered it! I did it! But that quest to get better, and see the constant improvements, is so satisfying. How are your skills as a Heroes of the Storm gamer, and do you feel you have to maintain those because you kind of run the ship? As a producer, its not like Im a balance designer and that my job is to competitively balance the game. I lean into that a little bit, because I am not by any means the best Heroes player in the world. I do play a lot of Heroes of the Storm ; Ive played, like, 7,000 games. I play pretty much every night for a couple hours. I sacrifice sleep to play Heroes. I genuinely enjoy the game and have a lot of fun with it, but Im a very average player. I had an experience at Gamescom, just in August, where they put me on stage with Team Liquid, a pro team, and members of Dignitas, another pro team. And there I was, and it was atrocious. I was so apologetic to them, and theyre like, No, its cool, well play with you,and Im like, Oh, dont do this to me ever again. I think theres this thing of like, Hey, youre not good at the game, so how can you make it, but for most of the things Im making calls on, how good I am has no bearing on it. Its more about me looking at the big picture of the game and thinking about whats important and hearing the feedback from players. Do you have a favorite Heroes of the Storm character? We released a character named Blaze in January. Usually Ill play a new hero until the next hero comes out, and Ill bounce around. Ive been playing Blaze almost nonstop since January, which is kind of insane. I just fell in love his his kit, the way his abilities interact. He also has a lot of sustain and escapes and things so he doesnt die a lot. In Heroes, one of the best things you can do to be a better player is to stop dying.","Kaeo Milker has had a long and eye-opening career at Blizzard Entertainment: QA, facilities management, recruiting and, now, heading up the company’s big MOBA franchise, Heroes of the Storm.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"In many ways, climate change has made hurricanes worse: A rise in sea level is causing higher storm surges, and warmer air is leading to rainier storms. With Hurricane Michael, local geography also has a role to play in the storms impact. If the predictions of its path hold, the hurricane will be the first to hit this area since Hurricane Hermine in 2016, said Jamie Rhome, a storm surge specialist at the National Hurricane Center. That storm was a Category 1. Hurricane Michael is expected to strike land as a Category 3, a major storm with wind speeds of 111 to 129 m.p.h. Thats enough to uproot trees and tear off roof decking. Wind, while a source of destruction in storms, is not the only threat. Surge can devastate coastal communities, and the rain dumped by storms can cause flooding far inland. Mr. Rhome noted that while this hurricanes path was still not certain, its probable impact at the bend of Florida on the way into the Panhandle could be very destructive. Its an incredibly vulnerable spot, he said. Regardless of whether the track moves a little to the left or the right, or wobbles, he said, its going to be a bad storm surge event for somebody. Rick Luettich, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of North Carolina, said that the area was especially susceptible to a large storm surge because of its funnel-shaped geometry and broad, shallow continental shelf. If there is good news, he said its that the area of possible impact is not as densely populated as other parts of the Gulf Coast, and therefore the human consequences of such a large surge should be less severe than if it hit further west on the Florida Panhandle or further east, in say, Tampa.",Tropical Storm Michael was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on Monday as it barreled toward the Gulf Coast. It could hit Florida as a Category 3 storm.,2018-10-09T09:12:53Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Hurricane Michael: Major Storm Bears Down on Florida Panhandle,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/us/hurricane-michael.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/world/10michael-live-1/10michael-live-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,storm,0
Rachel Becker,"After intensifying overnight, Hurricane Michael is now pummeling the Florida Panhandle as a Category 4 storm — the strongest hurricane on record to ever strike the region. Hundreds of thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate as Michael’s winds top speeds of 145 miles per hour, NBC News reports. Storm surge is expected to bring flood waters reaching 14 feet high — and already, there are “life threatening storm surge and catastrophic winds moving on shore,” the National Hurricane Center says. For those who stayed put, it’s time to seek shelter out of the way of waves and wind, Florida Governor Rick Scott warned on Twitter: “The time for evacuating along the coast has come and gone.” An extreme wind warning is currently in effect for locations between Laguna Beach and Eastpoint until 2:15PM ET. Wind gusts in excess of 130 mph are expected. Shelter in place IMMEDIATELY! #HurricaneMichael pic.twitter.com/jogpNWMwTv — NWS Tallahassee (@NWSTallahassee) October 10, 2018 The storm is unusually strong because of a few things: warm water in the Gulf, favorable wind conditions, and humidity. “Those are the perfect ingredients for a storm like this to really blossom,” says Marshall Shepherd, director of the University of Georgia’s atmospheric sciences program and former president of the American Meteorological Society. It’s possible the storm could get stronger still before landfall, the National Hurricane Center says. And after Hurricane Michael hits, Shepherd doubts we’ll see a hurricane with the same name again. “It’s a life-altering, society-altering situation,” he says. “Storms of this magnitude and impact, the name is typically retired. And I fully expect this to be the case for Michael.” The Verge spoke with Shepherd about Hurricane Michael’s unprecedented strength. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. How did Hurricane Michael get so strong? Overnight it’s really blossomed into a Category 4, and the primary reasons are that it was moving into very warm water, which is somewhat unusual for this late in October. It moved into a very favorable upper wind situation where there was not very much wind shear, and there’s a lot of moisture in the eastern United States out ahead of a cold front that’s coming from the west. When Michael was further south, it was in a very difficult wind shear environment. As you know, hurricanes don’t like wind shear — when the winds change direction or speed as you go up in altitude. One of the things that’s really interesting about Hurricane Michael is that it was very resilient. It was actually still intensifying even in an environment with a lot of wind shear, which was odd. So I knew once it got into an environment with less wind shear and over warm Gulf waters, the thing was going to just explode — and that’s what we’re seeing. From space, satellites from @NASAEarth + @NOAA see #HurricaneMichael as a major hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. Our latest space views: https://t.co/BvWmva7yU8 Latest storm weather from @NWS : https://t.co/Qk1x9RNd0k Be prepared + @FEMA resources: https://t.co/q2cgBnVW3h pic.twitter.com/wFhoVKGbU2 — NASA (@NASA) October 10, 2018 Is there anything else that can explain how Michael intensified so rapidly? We’ve been seeing these hot towers — these tall thunderstorms that form in the eyewall of the hurricane. I’ve been talking about these since my days as a scientist at NASA, because there are studies that show that when you have these hot towers, they’re more likely to indicate that the storm will go through a rapid intensification phase because they’re releasing so much heat that all that water vapor is condensing into cloud water in the storm. When water vapor condenses to form cloud water, it releases this burst of heat called latent heat — that’s really the fuel supply for these hurricane heat engines. When you have these hot towers, they’re like the supercharged pistons in the engine, if you will. You’ve got this ample warm water, you’ve got not a lot of wind shear overnight when the storm really intensified, so you can have a very efficient engine where all this water vapor is being converted to energy. What sort of hazards can we expect from the hurricane? If it stays at this intensity, and there’s evidence that it’s even still intensifying at this moment, this is going to be the strongest storm, at least on record, to ever hit this part of Florida. I think a lot of times we can overemphasize, or over play, the wind threat in a hurricane. I don’t think that’s the case with this one. There’s going to be significant wind impacts, not only at the landfall point and around the Panhandle of Florida because the storm is so large, it’s so strong. And because of the pace that it’s moving, even inland in parts of Alabama and Georgia there are going to be hurricane strength winds. So the winds are going to be a significant impact. The storm surge could be record-breaking in the coastal regions to the right of the storm. We could be seeing record eight to 13, perhaps more, feet of storm surge. [We] can’t downplay the rain. It’s not going to be a situation like Harvey and Florence where the thing stalls out and dumps three or four feet of rain. But there still could be half a foot to a foot of rainfall. And then, of course, to the right of the storm as it moves into Georgia and the Carolinas, you’ll get the tornado threats, too. It’s a horrible situation. Is it late in the year to be seeing a hurricane in the Gulf? I thought we were past the peak of hurricane season. Keep in mind with water, it takes several months for the transition from cold to warm and warm to cold. Even though air temperatures are starting to cool down, the heat characteristics of water means that the water has residual warmth for a while. That’s why the peak of the hurricane season is typically in September even though the actual hurricane season starts in June. So there’s this lag. So the waters are gradually starting to cool down from that peak in September, but they’re still typically warm enough to support hurricanes. We get hurricanes all of the time in October, that’s not unprecedented. And frankly when we do get October hurricanes, they form exactly where Michael formed, which is down in the southern Caribbean and moving into the Gulf. This is exactly what we expect from an October hurricane. I’m just cautioning that there is nothing particularly unique about a hurricane in October that takes this particular track. But yes, it certainly is interesting that it has tapped into enough warm water to explosively develop. How is climate change contributing to Hurricane Michael’s intensification? Storms like this are undoubtedly pushing more water into the coast because sea levels are higher. So when we have these types of storms and storm surge, the storm will be pushing a higher level of water than it would 50 or 70 years ago. That is something that I’m very comfortable saying, but I think only the studies over time will play out whether the warmer oceans — because of our broader, background climate change — are fueling more higher-octane storms. Physically, we understand that that should be the case, I want to clarify that. We understand from a scientific standpoint that a warming climate is causing warmer oceans, and you would think from a physics understanding of how these storms work that would lead to more intense storms. Whether I can say conclusively that that’s why this particular storm is more intense, I just think it would be irresponsible for me to speculate on that. What’s your advice to people in the area? It’s almost too late if you’re in Florida to do anything. People should have been gone a day or two ago. If they stayed in, all we can do is pray and hope that they’re okay. As the storm moves further inland, I am concerned that people further inland in my state of Georgia, for example, may not be really aware of the fact that they’re going to experience strong tropical storm to weak hurricane force winds in some parts well inland. I think that might catch a few people off guard. So hopefully they’re prepared for long power outages, perhaps trees falling down on their homes or in their yards. And for Georgia, I’m even worried about crop damage. That part of Georgia is a very agriculturally intense region of our state. It’s harvest time for some crops, so I even worry about that. How fast are we expecting this storm to move through the region? This storm is going to move quickly, which won’t mean four feet of rain like we saw in Florence or Harvey. But the downside of a quick-moving storm is that places further inland still feel the impact of a pretty powerful punch from the hurricane, because it takes a while to weaken. This is a very different storm than a Florence and a Harvey, but it carries its own unique threats because of the fact that places inland will see hurricane force winds or strong tropical storm force winds.","After intensifying overnight, Hurricane Michael is on track to pummel the Florida Panhandle on October 10th as a Category 4 storm.

ALAN BLINDER,"The language, familiar to people living along the Gulf, came as the state and local authorities readied for a storm whose primary threats appeared to be rainfall and storm surge. Some areas of the coast could record a foot of rain, forecasters said, and officials warned of the threat of flooding. The governors of Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi declared emergencies. Many schools along the coast were closed Tuesday morning, with others expected to shut down in the afternoon. Some districts announced that their classrooms would also be empty on Wednesday. The City of Biloxi, Miss., ordered its harbors and marinas evacuated, affecting about 300 vessels, but local leaders were plainly trying to avoid wide panic. “We’re asking people to do the same things that we’re doing: prepare,” Mayor Andrew Gilich said in a statement. “There’s no reason to be alarmed. We’re being told to expect rain and wind, and we’re preparing accordingly. We expected our citizens to be doing the same.” Although New Orleans, the economic and cultural center of the coast, was not expected to suffer a direct strike, the city’s new mayor, LaToya Cantrell, issued an emergency declaration and a voluntary evacuation order for certain neighborhoods.

SETH FREED WESSLER,"One of the few Trump-era denaturalization cases that has received substantial press attention, that of Norma Borgoño, a 64-year-old secretary and grandmother who was naturalized in 2007, is also facing civil counts, with the same lower burden of proof. The case stems from an ICE investigation that is unrelated to Janus. Four years after becoming a citizen, she pleaded guilty to assisting her boss defraud a bank and cooperated in the investigation. In May 2018 she found herself facing denaturalization, following a probe by Homeland Security Investigations. The Office of Immigration Litigation claimed that Borgoño should have alerted U.S.C.I.S. to her role in the ongoing crime when she applied for citizenship even though its plausible she may not have been aware, at that point, that she was participating in a crime.
At this point youd be disrupting an American family, Leon Rodriguez, who served as the head of U.S.C.I.S. during the later part of the Obama administration, told me of cases like Borgoños and Durelands. What do we gain as a society from that? Sessions will talk about sound principles of asylum, but, truly, what do we gain from doing this?
Throughout Odette Durelands trial, her lawyer maintained her innocence. But she also argued that even if the jury believed Dureland had applied for asylum under a different name, it shouldnt matter. Odette had become a citizen through her husbands application, moving from asylee to green-card holder to citizen based on fully adjudicated claims. If Dureland became a citizen through a process that would be unproblematic were it not for this supposed Alindor application, why should that now affect her right to remain in the United States?
The jury was unconvinced. The government had shown evidence that Dureland has relatives named Alindor, and that various details on the Alindor application looked similar to those on the one she later filed. The jury found Dureland guilty of criminal naturalization fraud. The integrity of our nations legal immigration system is paramount, the acting director of U.S.C.I.S. in Tampa said in a press statement after the conviction. This conviction sends a clear message that attempting to fraudulently obtain United States citizenship will not be tolerated. Our nations citizens deserve nothing less. The judge sentenced Dureland to five months in prison. The conviction automatically led to Durelands losing her citizenship.
After serving her sentence, Immigration and Customs Enforcement moved her to a detention center in August, with plans to deport her. She spent a month there before Gilbert managed to scrape together $10,000 for bond. The couple has hired an immigration attorney, who says he will try to convince an immigration judge that she should be allowed, effectively, to start the immigration process again, to obtain a new green card as the wife of a citizen or the mother of a citizen in the military. But lawyers familiar with denaturalization cases say that because she has been convicted of a crime, its unlikely shell prevail. Without a judges approval, ICE will almost certainly deport her.
In September, I sat with Dureland and her family at their home. A bowl of star fruit, picked from the tree outside, sat on the table. Dureland held her head up with her hands, her elbows resting on the table. Her eyes were heavy. Less than two days before, she was released from federal immigration detention.I didnt know if I would come home again, Dureland told me, standing beside her 15-year-old son, Gethro. She placed her hand on the top of her sons head, which he rested on her shoulder. She liked to pretend, before she was locked up, that she and her youngest child were the same height, but he had grown in the six months that she was away; there was no more pretending. She laughed. But despite her easygoing demeanor with her son, Dureland was weary from her time in detention, and she told me she needed to nap. When I returned a few hours later, the house was filled with the smell of spices and cooked onions. It had been six months since Dureland had made a meal. I missed my kitchen, she said.
She sat back down at the table. Detention was a scary place, Dureland told me. When I got there, everybody was being deported. And I was thinking, I have nobody in Haiti. If I were deported to Haiti, I would be by myself.
Before she became a citizen, Dureland always knew that if something happened, if she were convicted of some crime, say, she could be deported. She lived a careful life. When she took the oath in 2012, that feeling that it could be taken away finally disappeared. I became an American, Dureland said. I am an American. But even as she said it, she knew it was no longer true.",The prosecution of naturalized United States citizens is a sign of a gathering storm.,2018-12-19T15:32:57Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Is Denaturalization the Next Front in the Trump Administration’s War on Immigration?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/magazine/naturalized-citizenship-immigration-trump.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/23/magazine/23mag-Denaturalization-slide-RDD7/23mag-Denaturalization-slide-RDD7-facebookJumbo.png,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,storm,0
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","It feels like 2018 is the year of rapid intensification. Storm after storm after storm has spun up from humble begins to cyclonic monster around the world. The latest cyclone to join the ignominious club is Typhoon Yutu which is in the midst of spinning up into a forecast Category 5 super typhoon by Wednesday. Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands lie squarely in the typhoons path. Yutu spent all of Tuesday ramping up and as of the latest Joint Typhoon Warning Center bulletin, it had estimated winds of 127 mph. Thats the equivalent of a very strong Category 3 storm, and with nothing but warm water in its path, Yutu is expected to continuing amping up. The storms winds could be roaring around 155 mph as it approaches Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands on Thursday morning local time. The National Weather Service Guam office has posted a typhoon warning calling for powerful surf and up to half a foot of rain. The hilly terrain of Guam will be but a speed bump for Yutu, which is forecast to keep climbing in intensity through the end of the week. Its winds could reach an astounding 172 mph, which would put it among the strongest storm on Earth this year. Thankfully, it will achieve that terrifying feat over open water with no threat to land. Some weather experts have been watching the storm via satellite and wondering if the official forecast is a bit underdone and if Yutu could be more intense than current estimates. Thats because theres a subjective element involved. Satellites dont measure storms wind speeds directly, but provide a snapshot of convection and the processes that indicate how healthy a storm is. Meteorologists use that data to estimate wind speeds using something called the Dvorak technique. Without getting into a bunch of equations, suffice to say forecasters use what the satellite imagery reveals about convection, temperatures within the storm, and a few other factors to come up with a T number, which can be translated into an estimated wind speed. The technique is super useful for remote parts of the Pacific that dont have the benefit of estimates from aircraft like the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administrations Hurricane Hunters. And Chris Velden, a hurricane expert at the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS), told Earther that using the technique gets the mean state right most of the time, but it can break down when you have anomalous conditions like a very rapidly intensifying storm or decaying storm. Yutu is one of those storms, and while Velden said he felt the current official forecast was pretty spot-on, that doesnt mean the storm wont continue to push the limits of whats possible. This has potential to grow into a Category 5 real quickly, he said. People at the Joint Typhoon Warning Center are watching this. They know what theyre doing.",It feels like 2018 is the year of rapid intensification. Storm after storm after storm has spun up from humble begins to cyclonic monster around the world.

If you have a flight over the center of the country youll likely be in the clear, but if your travel plans involve either leaving from or traveling to a number of midwest destinations or a layover in any of those cities, you could be in for a pretty rough time.
In light of the issue, a number of major airlines are offering to waive change fees for plane tickets. That means you can swap your ticket for one at a later date or one that connects through another town, and only pay the price difference between your current plane ticket and the new one you select.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"You know the drill: when it snows on America’s East coast, everyone else has to read endless explanations of “weather bombs” and “polar vortices,” regardless of where on Earth they live. But you have to admit, this thing looks amazing. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s GOES satellite snapped this picture of winter storm Grayson hammering the United States’ East Coast. I generally think winter storm names are a dumb idea, but this storm validates just how intense a Nor’easter can be. You probably have already read about what’s going on, so I’ll be brief: You’re looking at warm air from the Gulf of Mexico intersecting with frigid air in the North.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"These new views of Mars, taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, show that the entire planet is now engulfed in the dust storm that began in late May. And while orbiters are studying the storm to understand it better, it could spell trouble for the rovers on its surface. Storms like these occur every six to eight Earth years, according to a NASA release. The most recent one began as a smaller storm, first observed on May 30, which forced the Opportunity rover to enter hibernation mode in early June. By June 20th, the storm encircled the planet. “It’s exciting because it’s the strongest dust storm we’ve EVER seen on Mars,” Tanya Harrison, director of Arizona State University’s NewSpace Initiative told Gizmodo via Twitter direct message. “It’s worrisome for Opportunity because she’s not getting enough sunlight to keep her batteries charged, but thermal models tell us temperature is on our side.” Opportunity will remain asleep until the dust settles, probably some time in September, when scientists will try to wake it up. The main concern is whether the solar-powered rover can survive the cold without power to keep warm, though the thick dust may absorb heat and prevent Opportunity from feeling the worst of the frigid temperature. Harrison said that scientists are optimistic. Meanwhile, other experiments are working to understand the tempest—NASA’s Mars Odyssey orbiter is tracking the planet’s temperature and atmospheric composition to better study it, according to that release. NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter takes color photos of the atmosphere and measures temperature, while its MAVEN orbiter is studying how the storm affects the top of the Martian atmosphere, above the dust. They want to know how small storms turn into planet-wide events. And 5,000 miles away from Opportunity, the Curiosity rover is in less danger. It is nuclear powered, so it need not hibernate. It is attempting to measure the properties of the dust particles while it continues drilling into rock, but as we reported, the dust could possibly harm its cameras. Scientists are excited to study the storm to learn about our red neighbor. “The storm gives us the chance to better understand how these storms grow from regional to planet-encircling, and what kind of effects they have on the albedo patterns [how the planet reflects sunlight] on the surface.” [ NASA ]","These new views of Mars, taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, show that the entire planet is now engulfed in the dust storm that began in late May.

The group reportedly smashed windows and furniture in the building, located in the capital Port Moresby. The impoverished island hosted leaders from both sides of the Pacific last week despite the high costs involved. The summit had seen delegates stay on cruise ships and the government buy 40 Maserati luxury cars for the event. The angry police and security forces headed to parliament to vent their anger after a meeting with police authorities over the allowances, member of parliament Bryan Kramer said in a video posted on Facebook. A witness outside parliament described ""hundreds of police and troops"" on the building's front steps, complaining they had not been paid their special bonus of 350 kina (£81, US$104), according to news agency AFP. ""It was the armed forces, police and correctional workers. They have entered the parliament and just smashed everything up,"" parliamentarian Allan Bird told Reuters.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Mario Aguilar to Gizmodo","As scientists warnings about climate change become increasingly dire, our conversations about extreme weather events have become increasingly political. There will always be those who chastise the climate-concerned public for politicizing the storm but theres also an argument for doing just that when it is the refusal of specific politicians to act on climate that increases our vulnerability to powerful storms, wildfires, and more. But drawing linkages between our weather, our climate, and our politics is quite a different thing than blaming victims of a tragedy for their own suffering. That latter, far uglier form of politicization reared its head last week when the Guardian ran an article under a headline seemingly tailor-made to drive the partisan wedge between us even deeper: Victims of Hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers. The headlines implicationthat by voting for the wrong politicians, folks in the Florida Panhandle were somehow getting whats coming sparked swift condemnation on social media. And to the credit of author John Abraham, a professor at the University of St. Thomas, he asked the Guardian to change it after publication, and the Guardian did. But the victim-shaming sentiment the Guardian telegraphed is sadly nothing new. In the aftermath of a storm, those who stay behind are often condemned for not evacuating, even though evacuation is a privilege not everyone can afford. In the wake of the deadly Oso landslide that struck Washington State in 2014, people whose homes were destroyed were blamed for building on unstable ground in the first place. When Hawaiis Kilauea erupted last spring, residents of Leilani Estates took heat for buying property atop an active volcano. The list goes on and on. After a disaster happens, it is a very common human trait to immediately find a way to assign blame, disaster researcher and former Gizmodo writer Mika McKinnon told Earther. A large chunk of why we do this is to say well, it wouldnt happen to me. Perhaps, then, it isnt surprising that how victims voted is starting to creep into conversations about who is to blame when it comes to climate change-fueled disasters, however reprehensible that kind of talk may be. Faith Kearns, a scientist at the California Institute for Water Resources, says shes seen victim shaming based on ideology become increasingly common as we wrestle with how to talk about climate change after a disaster. As an example she pointed to the massive wildfire that tore through Fort McMurray in 2016, which brought out the worst on social media, with some, including former New Democratic Party candidate Tom Moffatt, calling it karmic that a town in the Canadian oil-sands was devoured by a blaze likely exacerbated by climate change. A brief scan of responses to the recent Guardian article reveals there are indeed jerks who saw citizens of the red-leaning Florida Panhandle getting what they deserve when Hurricane Michael struck last week. Matthew Motta, a postdoc studying science communication at the University of Pennsylvania, wasnt aware of any research showing that a significant number liberals blame conservative voters for extreme weather, or, more perniciously, revel in disasters striking their communities. But he said the deep partisan divide over climate change makes it the sort of issue where we might expect to see affective polarization, that is, polarization that causes us to dislike the other side even more. And its not just random internet commenters who are liable to resent and blame those they disagree with on climate change. Sarah Myhre, a climate scientist at the University of Washington, told Earther that derision or dismissal of the uninformed or misinformed public is a sentiment shes been exposed to quite a few times, particularly among male colleagues whove never had their authority questioned ever. The righteousness of male power brokers when they are not believed gets re-routed into anger and cynicism, Myhre told Earther. She said we need more leadership from women, particularly women of color, to reframe our conversations about climate change centering the values of human rights. NASA climate scientist Kate Marvel emphasized that blaming disaster victims, which she described as at best unproductive and at worst just morally abhorrent, sets up a false narrative when it comes to climate change. After all, its hardly the citizens of the Florida Panhandle among the poorest in the statewho are responsible for our planetary fever. That distinction goes to the fossil fuel industry, which has reaped unimaginable profits off our outdated energy system. It goes to the shareholders and executives whove hid their own companies research on the link between carbon emissions and warming, whove built misinformation campaigns to sow confusion among the public, and even now, when the science is too clear for bald-faced denials, who have convinced us we are all equally to blame. And it goes to politicians who continue to bury their heads in the sand at industrys behest. Politicizing the storm can be the right thing to do. But if were using politics to punch down, were giving these real power brokers a pass.","As scientists’ warnings about climate change become increasingly dire, our conversations about extreme weather events have become increasingly political.

George Dvorsky,"These photos taken by the Curiosity rover span about a couple of weeks, starting with a shot of the area before the storm appeared. GIF: NASA For the past two weeks, a massive dust storm has churned on Mars, forcing NASA to put its Opportunity rover into hibernation mode. But Curiosity, a rover on the other side of the planet, is now feeling the effects of the storm as well, revealing the dramatic, planet-size scale of this dusty weather system. The extent of this dust storm is nearly incomprehensible—about the combined size of North America and Russia. NASA says the storm now spans the entire circumference of Mars, making it a planet-encircling dust event. The Opportunity rover, which is dependent upon solar power, is (fingers crossed) only temporarily out of commission. The Curiosity rover, located about 5,000 miles (8,200) away from Opportunity, is now feeling the effects as well, with the amount of airborne dust above it doubling in the past week. The dimming created by this atmospheric haze, measured in tau, is now about 8.0 at Gale Crater, which is the highest recorded tau in the history of the Curiosity mission. At Opportunity’s location, the tau is at 11, making it really dark. But unlike Opportunity, Curiosity is in no danger of losing power, as it relies on a nuclear-powered battery. That’s not to say the storm isn’t affecting Curiosity. Because of the dim lighting, Curiosity’s cameras require extra exposure time, and extra exposure time means the optical equipment is more vulnerable to all the dust that’s blowing around. The current situation is not ideal. But Curiosity did manage to take some recent photos of the Martian landscape, revealing an increasingly dense wall of haze, which is about six to eight times thicker than usual. On Earth, planet-encircling storms aren’t really possible thanks to our thick atmosphere, stronger gravity, and plenty of vegetation cover (which binds the soil to the ground). It’s a vastly different story on Mars, as NASA explains : Martian dust storms are common, especially during southern hemisphere spring and summer, when the planet is closest to the Sun. As the atmosphere warms, winds generated by larger contrasts in surface temperature at different locations mobilize dust particles the size of individual talcum powder grains. Carbon dioxide frozen on the winter polar cap evaporates, thickening the atmosphere and increasing the surface pressure. This enhances the process by helping suspend the dust particles in the air. In some cases, the dust clouds reach up to 40 miles (60 kilometers) or more in elevation. Some storms on Mars last for a few weeks, while others go on for years. The factors that drive these variations are still not fully understood, which is why this storm, the most powerful to hit the Red Planet since 2007, is of great interest to scientists. As a neat aside, Mars isn’t the only planet to experience planet-encircling storms. Back in 2013, astronomers detected a massive thunder-and-lighting storm on Saturn that created a seamless ring around the gas giant. That’s a total distance of 190,000 miles (300,000 km), as compared to Mars, which has a circumference of 13,325 miles (21,300 km).

Jack Stewart,"More than a million people have been told to leave their homes, get away from the coast and low lying areas, and get to safety, as Hurricane Florence bears down on the Carolinas and Virginia. But a new group of temporary, risk-taking, residents is getting ready to ride out the storm. Drone pilots are watching forecasts, and staging in areas where they’ll be safe, but useful, ready to rush into action as soon as possible, as a now vital part of the disaster response. “When we’re pre-deployed, we have our rations—it’s an ongoing joke of beef jerky and pretzels,” says Hadley Doyle-González, who runs SMG Drones, in Palm Beach, Florida. “We have a ridiculous amount of batteries,” she says. “We need to be able to fly for 24 hours with no power.” During Hurricane Irma, which hit Florida this time last year, she was deployed to Naples, and holed up in a hotel. She made sure all her equipment was in waterproof cases and moved her car to higher ground. When the winds died down, she headed out to capture high resolution images of houses, buildings, or utilities, which can show damage early, and get help and repairs, as well as insurance money, to where it's needed. “You’re charging every battery you have to the nth degree,” says Craig Besse, flight ops manager for Airbus Aerial, who was also deployed in Irma's aftermath. You need 20 to 30 gallons of water per person, and to make sure your truck is loaded with food, water, and fuel. “Get that last shower in,” he says, before supplies are cut off. Then, it’s about being flexible. “It’s not going to go the way you expected.” LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Drones As Hurricane Florence continues its unstoppable march toward the Atlantic coast, both Besse and Doyle-González are managing teams of drone pilots and going through those same final preparations. They are just a few of the expected thousands of drones and pilots getting ready to fly over the damage left by the storm. When Florence hits the coast, it will bring torrential downpours, wind blasts, coastal erosion, and the possibility of a storm surge of seawater causing flooding. The National Hurricane Center has predicted ""life-threatening storm surge and rainfall."" Accuweather is warning that the angle at which the storm will impact the coast—nearly perpendicular—means the winds on the east side will be particularly effective at driving waves, and that surge, onto shore. It’s predicting $60 billion in economic impact and damage. Air travel, of course, will be disrupted. The FAA says to expect flight cancellations and airport closures. Air traffic controllers will evacuate tall towers in extreme winds, but stay on duty on a lower, secure level. Airport workers will disable airport surveillance radar antennas so they spin freely, to save them from wind damage, and get up and running as quickly as possible once the threat has passed. The assembled drone pilots, though, won't wait for commercial aviation to restart before they take off. Insurance companies are the biggest clients for their services, so they can figure out where to send resources, and in some cases, to settle claims within hours. Utility companies employ drone pilots to spot downed power lines. Infrastructure engineers can see flooded roads. And they can do it all long before it's possible or safe to reach these areas on the ground. At the Airbus Aerial headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, Jesse Kallman, president of the imaging company, has taken over a conference room, with a team of 10. Together they’re putting well prepared plans into action, to combine data from Airbus’ satellites, fixed wing aircraft, and drones. Insurance companies are sending over databases of where their policy holders are concentrated. Utilities are spelling out where they have vulnerable infrastructure like long power lines. The company is also pulling together pre-event data: ""before” pictures to contrast with the “after.” Getting those “after” images is the challenge. No aircraft can fly in the storm itself, and even when it passes, they have to get into place to start work. “We work with the satellite team to try to understand the optimal times to acquire data, and work through all the types of data needed,” says Kallman. A detailed understanding of the path of the storm can give them a head start. “Once the weather clears, we want to be prepared to get planes and drones up in the air,” says Jonathan Gadd, who manages drone and planes at EagleView, another imaging company, for which Doyle-González is subcontracting. It’s not just quadcopters that can be useful. Small, manned planes can also cover more distance, but at a greater cost. EagleView is working to stage 15 fixed-wing aircraft in Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee, and Florida. Planes are not only useful for supplementing drones for image capture, particularly on long runs, but they’re also crucial for transport. EagleView’s pilots can act as couriers, flying into affected areas, collecting hard drives of video and image data, and flying them to HQ in Rochester, New York. Drone operators train for this type of work, and know enough to stay out of the way of first responders. The FAA is appealing to amateurs to do the same. Professional drone pilots can apply for emergency certificates of operation from the sky safety regulator if they need to work in areas that have been blanketed with temporary flight restrictions. Combining this bird's eye view with some clever computing lets insurance agencies move faster than ever before, like Allstate did after Hurricane Irma. “We had a customer in Orlando, and we called him, and said we believe your roof has damage,” says spokesperson Justin Herndon. “That was before he filed a claim.” The man had money in his bank account within five hours. Well after the storm has gone, drones can help with the heavy lifting. In hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico last year, utilities used drones to restring downed power lines in hard to access areas. But now, America's drone pilots are lying in wait for Florence's rage. “This one’s supposed to linger—it’s going to be a lot slower of a go time than what we’re used to,” says Doyle-González. Teams will have to spend more like 48 hours surviving on their jerky and pretzels, sitting and waiting, sleeping while they can. Then they’ll be ready to start work—even if it means a few days before their next shower.

ANA SWANSON and KENNETH P. VOGEL,"“The dinner bell is ringing for the trade bar and associated lobbyists and consultants,” said Chip Roh, a former partner at Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges. Lawyers and lobbyists are employed on both sides, arguing for and against exemptions, he said, adding, “It creates a fertile field.” But the Trump administration has yet to clarify what precisely will qualify trading partners for an exemption, other than a vague reference to protecting America’s national security and reducing its trade deficit. That has led to a chaotic and anxious period as companies and countries try their best to meet unclear specifications, and the clock continues to tick toward tariffs that are expected to go into effect next Friday, wiping out valuable contracts and putting global supply chains at risk. Robert Lighthizer, the government’s top trade negotiator, has been charged with helping decide which countries will be excluded, while Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, has been tasked with a parallel process for exempting imports of certain products that are not widely available in the United States. The Commerce Department has developed its procedures for such exclusions, but it has not yet released them publicly. Those will be issued by Sunday, a spokesman said. The European Union commissioner for trade, Cecilia Malmstrom, speaking on Wednesday to the European Parliament, said she left a meeting with Mr. Lighthizer over the weekend in Brussels without “sufficient clarity” about how countries would secure exclusions. In the interim, trade lawyers and lobbyists in Washington have begun offering assistance in securing exemptions and exclusions for foreign countries, companies and their United States partners. Lobbyists said they intended to seek support from elected officials in pushing for exemptions, and some lawmakers have already weighed in. Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, has already helped make the case for an exemption for a major pipeline project in her state, predicting that the tariffs could add $500 million to the cost of a $43 billion natural gas export terminal that her state is building with China. The American Petroleum Institute sent 12 top executives from energy companies including BP America, Exxon Mobil, Phillips 66 and Shell to lobby Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. The assembled group explained that free trade has been a boon to the industry and stressed the importance of steel to its operations, according to a person briefed on the meeting. Mr. Trump in turn told the executives that his administration wanted to make sure that the tariffs did not hurt the industry, the person briefed on the meeting said.

Credit Dan Koeck/Reuters The trade group issued a statement on Thursday saying that its executives “highlighted a host of the industry’s priority issues, including the importance of trade policies that recognize the integrated nature of North American and global markets.” In recent days, Hogan Lovells and Covington &amp; Burling — firms that specialize in international trade law and lobbying — published memos heralding their ability to help clients obtain exemptions, and dropping hints as to how they might go about doing so. Hogan Lovells noted that existing contracts for steel or aluminum imports could potentially receive “grandfather” exemptions. One company whose costs could rise because of the tariffs, Kinder Morgan, a pipeline maker based in Houston, recently signed Hogan Lovells to lobby on the impact of the “imposition of steel tariffs on pipeline construction,” according to a congressional filing posted last week. CGCN Group, a lobbying firm, recommends that companies highlight the advantages of global trade to a public that has grown skeptical, according to polls. “Proponents of free trade need to tailor their arguments to those Americans who have watched factories close and wages stagnate,” according to a memo that CGCN sent last week to clients and prospective clients. It suggested that companies seeking exemptions refrain from warning of tumbling stock prices or potential layoffs, and instead argue that “the more money companies spend on steel and aluminum, the less they have to hire workers or give them a raise.” Daniel Porter, chief trade lawyer for the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, said he was counseling his clients that the exemption process could look similar to previous tariff processes, which allowed companies to file for exemptions and then gave their American competitors a chance to object to any of those requests. With the current steel and aluminum tariffs, however, there is likely to be one notable change: Only companies based in the United States will be allowed to file for exclusions. That means steel makers in Japan and Europe will need to get their American customers to come forward and file the request on their behalf.

Credit Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg Companies like California Steel Industries, which makes flat rolled steel, and the Union Pacific railroad said they depended on foreign steel and were bracing for higher prices if they could not secure exemptions. Lance M. Fritz, the chief executive of Union Pacific, said the railroad’s most heavily trafficked routes were made with steel from Nippon Steel of Japan, which is harder and more durable than products available in the United States. If Japan does not secure an exemption, Mr. Fritz said, Union Pacific planned to apply for a product exclusion. Foreign metal makers are also worried that American mills will push aggressively against these exclusions, cutting off products that American companies buy. “There is that classic gray middle, where the customers say the U.S. mill can’t do an adequate job, and the U.S. mill says, ‘No, you’re being too finicky,’” Mr. Porter said. “Even with the back door, some very real American manufacturing entities are going to be hurt by this.” That fight is already on display, as American metal producers press the administration to avoid giving in to metal users, like food packagers and beer companies, who are agitating for exemptions. On Tuesday, the presidents of four trade associations — the American Beverage Association, the Beer Institute, the Brewers Association and the Can Manufacturers Institute — sent a letter to Mr. Ross asking for more clarification on the timing and process for exemptions. They argued that a delay would undoubtedly increase costs for manufacturers and could lead to unintended consequences. A separate letter on Thursday from the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which supported the tariffs, urged Mr. Ross and Mr. Lighthizer not to undermine them by issuing country exemptions and product exclusions that were too broad. The group said that new steel jobs in Granite City, Ill., and Lorain, Ohio, had already been announced in response to the tariffs and that overly broad exemptions could undermine that progress.

Credit Al Drago for The New York Times Foreign governments are also looking for ways to avoid being hit by the tariffs, including having top officials speak personally to Mr. Trump. “Everybody is going to be calling in their chits and trying to make their points about why their exemptions make sense, but not everyone will be successful,” said Danny E. Sebright, the president of the U.S.-U.A.E. Business Council, a nonprofit group that seeks to bolster trade between the United States and the United Arab Emirates. The United Arab Emirates is a top exporter of aluminum to the United States. Mr. Sebright said that he expected Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the effective ruler of the Emirates, to visit the United States in the coming weeks, and that aluminum would be a topic of conversation. “They’re going to work with the Trump administration on this, there is not going to be retaliation,” Mr. Sebright said. Australia has trumpeted an apparent exemption from Mr. Trump’s tariffs, which an Australian government official said on Monday was achieved as a result of “high level and sustained advocacy” by some of its highest-ranking officials. The country’s interlocutors included Greg Norman, a pro golfer and friend of the president who signed a letter telling him that the tariffs could have a negative effect on the relationship between the United States and Australia. Other governments plan to do less lobbying and more threatening. David O’Sullivan, the European Union ambassador to the United States, said that the bloc was “happy to explain why European exports are not the problem.” He added, “But we are not open to or willing to entertain links to unrelated issues.” On Friday, the European Union published a 10-page list of American products that would be targets for retaliation if the steel and aluminum tariffs go through, including peanut butter, grains, motorcycles and steel.

The less-extreme amber alert — different from the United States warning about a missing child — was in place for possible disruption of services other parts of Scotland and England, with warnings of more than 19.6 inches of snow in parts of southwestern England. As a new wave of snowfall and freezing cold arrived Wednesday afternoon, Londoners rallied to provide warm food and blankets for homeless people, with volunteers scrambling to refer them to local services for temporary overnight accommodation. “For many, the snow is all fun and games,” said Alex Harper, a volunteer for the homeless charity Shelter. “But there are thousands of homeless people at real risk who could freeze to death in the night.” He added that on Tuesday night a record number of people had been referred to services in any 24-hour period, and that the numbers were expected to go up by Wednesday night. At least nine people have died across Europe this week because of the freezing weather conditions, prompting a Belgian mayor to detain people who refused shelter overnight, The Guardian reported. “These are the kinds of precautions we should be taking,” Mr. Harper added. “There’s all this panic and chaos over canceled flights and trains and changes to plans, but the homeless are at real risk — and during every cold spell they are overlooked.” Even so, some Britons and tourists said the authorities were spreading “disproportionate hype and panic” over the weather. Richard Ball, a teacher who commuted an hour into central London from a town in southern England, said, “Reading the news and official statements, you would think it was doomsday.” He pointed to a newspaper picture of a dark cloud with a headline that read, “Moment monster weather snow bomb from the East hits the capital.” “The amount of snow we’ve seen in London is laughable,” he said. “They wouldn’t even call this snow in some parts of the world.” Not the world's biggest snowman - but someone's built a very happy chappy on the @HouseofCommons terrace. pic.twitter.com/liIuLLEaks — Nigel Huddleston MP (@HuddlestonNigel) Feb. 28, 2018 Tourists visiting Hyde Park agreed, with one boy complaining that there wasn’t even enough snow to make the first layer of a snowman. “These Brits are so dramatic,” said Nichole Lemercier, who was visiting from France. “Our hotel told us not to travel today unless it was an emergency,” she said, laughing. “Maybe people here are afraid of the snow,” she added. “Look, even here in the main park, there are not that many people having fun in it.” But the Met Office said more snow was expected in northern England through Thursday and Friday, with fewer showers expected in the south. “Brace yourself for stronger winds and treacherous icy conditions,” it warned in a tweet.

JOHN SCHWARTZ,"Photo Braving the elements in West Stockbridge, Mass., last week. The Northeast found itself dealing with another winter storm on Wednesday. Credit Ben Garver/The Berkshire Eagle, via Associated Press John Schwartz, a New York Times reporter who covers climate change and the environment, is answering reader questions about the winter storm in the Northeast United States, the second to hit the region in less than a week. Ask your questions by emailing storms@nytimes.com. If it’s cold, how can there be climate change? That’s a common question — one asked, in various ways, by the president of the United States. But it’s based on a fallacy. Weather is not climate. Weather refers to day-to-day conditions; climate is about long-term trends. And the long-term trends show a planet that is warming, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. Even with occasional Arctic blasts of bitter cold, which we’ve seen in much of the United States in recent years, 2017 had the second-highest surface temperatures ever recorded, surpassed only by 2016 — which was the third “hottest year” in a row. The trends are clear, even if you can make a snowball in March in Central Park. Really, though — is there some connection between climate change and this cold weather? Scientists have been looking at phenomena like cold spells, which occur when air from the Arctic dips south. After all, the Arctic is warming as a result of climate change, and that appears to be weakening the jet stream, which tends to hold that cold air up toward the top of the world. As Marlene Kretschmer, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, told The Times in January, the connection is not yet fully established. “There’s a lot of agreement that the Arctic plays a role, it’s just not known exactly how much,” she said. “It’s a very complex system.” The weather report shows temperatures in the mid-30s or higher in some regions. How can it snow if the temperature is above freezing? The temperature near the ground is above freezing, but up in the clouds, where the snow forms, it’s well below freezing. Falling through the warmer air, however, can have an effect on the snowflakes, which may partially melt and clump together on the way down. Newscasters keep calling this storm “Quinn.” Is naming winter storms new? Relatively speaking, yes. The Weather Channel began naming storms in 2012. Not everyone approves, including my colleague Henry Fountain, who had this to say in January about the winter storm that was given the unfortunate name “Grayson.” My regular tweet to ignore the Weather Channel's name for this storm. It serves no useful purpose and is simply a marketing ploy. Plus this particular name is especially god-awful. — Henry Fountain (@henryfountain) Jan. 4, 2018 What’s the deal with buying toilet paper and milk? Good Seinfeld impression! The question is why do people slam the grocery stores before a storm for supplies like toilet paper and milk? At least if you get eggs, too, you can make French toast. But how much milk do you expect to drink? ( About 65 percent of people become lactose intolerant after infancy anyway — which, come to think of it, might explain the toilet paper.) Seriously, though, you’d be better off preparing for storms by stocking up on good, bright LED flashlights and spare chargers for your cellphone in case the power goes out.

A.A. Newton,"Natural disaster responses increasingly rely on electronic devices for communication. In the aftermath of a destructive storm, your phone or tablet can be a literal lifeline—so it needs to actually work. Losing the ability to communicate with the outside world makes it harder to coordinate relief efforts and downright impossible to let friends and family know you’re safe. Personal safety should always take top priority, but if your family disaster plan relies on smartphones or laptops in any way, it’s crucial that you take steps to prevent them from being damaged. Here are some ways to do just that. Waterproof Your Devices Obviously, keeping your electronics dry is crucial in a hurricane, and the easiest way to do this is to pack all of your tech in airtight, watertight plastic containers. If you have a vacuum sealer, perfect; seal your backup batteries, chargers, adapters, and cords in bags before packing them. If you don’t, Ziploc bags work well. In either case, silica gel packets provide extra dryness insurance, so long as they’re not already saturated with moisture. You can recharge saturated silica in a pinch by drying it out in a 200-250ºF oven for a few hours, but if you’re unsure how dry it is, buying fresh stuff from the hardware store is your best bet. Diversify Your Charger Portfolio A phone or laptop with a dead battery is completely useless, so be sure to pack lots of different battery-replenishing options in your go bag. Fully-charged external batteries are a must, and USB-compatible car chargers let you charge devices from any car with a working battery—just be sure to unplug the adapter when you’re done. Throw in a power strip or two to make the most of any functional power outlets you encounter, plus some extra connecting cables, and you should be fully covered. Get the Most Out of Your Smartphone The pocket-sized supercomputers we all carry around are lifesavers in an emergency situation, even when cell service or wifi is unavailable. Your smartphone can handle everything from first-aid apps to downloaded maps to quick-access document storage; figure out what information you need access to and download it to your phone. While you’re at it, take necessary precautions to maximize your phone’s battery life, which could make your life much easier in an extended power outage. Generally speaking you don't want to rely on technology at all in your disaster toolkit, but… Read more Read If you haven’t already, be sure to activate your phone’s emergency contact functions. Android users can add emergency contacts to their lock screen, and the Medical ID function of Apple’s Health app allows you to make relevant medical and contact information lock screen-accessible. Opt in to emergency notifications, too: Android settings are under the “Cell Broadcast” header, and iOs settings are in the “Government Alerts” section of the Notifications menu. Back Up Absolutely Everything If you rely on a physical hard drive for important file backups—or worse, don’t back anything up at all—get a cloud backup running ASAP. I use Backblaze, which is perfectly fine, but there are a ton of options out there. If you’re not sure where to start, Lifehacker has a few guides to online backup services that will help. Don’t forget to take photos and/or video of your house, yard, and any other property you have insured in case you need to file claims—and back those up, too. Use Social Media to Your Advantage A physical meeting place is crucial to an IRL emergency plan, but you should have a social media “meeting” plan too—especially if you have out-of-towners worrying about you. Consumer Reports recommends choosing one platform for check-ins and ensuring that every family member has the relevant app installed on their phone. As for far-flung family and friends, designate one person who lives out of the disaster zone as your liaison. Ask this person to be available for check-ins and do the work of updating other concerned parties so you can focus on more important things.","Natural disaster responses increasingly rely on electronic devices for communication.

"Natasha Lomas,Ingrid Lunden","UK digital minister Matt Hancock, who’s currently busy with legislative updates to the national data protection framework, including to bring it in line with the EU’s strict new privacy regime, nonetheless found time to launch an own-brand social networking app this week. The eponymously titled: Matt Hancock MP App. To cut a long story short, the Matt app quickly ran into a storm of criticism for displaying an unfortunately lax attitude to privacy and data protection. Such as pasting in what appeared to be a very commercially minded privacy policy — which iOS users couldn’t even see prior to agreeing to it in order to download the app… [Insert facepalm emoji of choice] In the words of one privacy consultant, who quickly raised concerns via Twitter: “You’d think the Digital Minister and one responsible for data protection package would get privacy right.” Well — news just in! — the UK’s data protection watchdog isn’t entirely sure about that latter point, because it’s now looking into the app’s operation after privacy concerns were raised. “We are checking reports about the operation of this app and have seen other similar examples of such concerns in apps as they are developed. So to help developers, we produced specific guidance on privacy in mobile apps,” an ICO spokesperson told TechCrunch in response to questions about the Matt app. “The Data Protection Act exists to protect individuals’ privacy. Anyone developing an app needs to comply with data protection laws, ensuring privacy is at the forefront of their design,” the spokesperson added, pointing to the agency’s contact page as a handy resource for “anybody with concerns about how their personal data has been handled”. (For the full lowdown on the Matt Hancock privacy snafu, I suggest reading The Register ‘s gloriously titled report: What a Hancock-up: MP’s social network app is a privacy disaster. This forensic Twitter thread, by the aforementioned consultant, @PrivacyMatters, is also a great exploration of the myriad areas where Matt Hancock’s app appears to be messing up in data protection T&amp;C terms.) Here’s a few screenshots of the app for the curious… Of course the minister didn’t intend to generate his own personal privacy snafu. He intended the Matt Hancock App to be a place for people in his West Suffolk constituency to keep up on news about Matt Hancock, MP. Among the touted “Core benefits for Constituents” are: Never miss out on local matters via private networks A safe, trusted, environment where abuse is not tolerated and user data is not exploited But Hancock outsourced the app’s development to a UK company called Disciple Media, which builds so called “mobile-first community platforms” for third parties — including musicians and social media influencers. And whose privacy policy is replete with circumspect words like “may” and “including” — making it about as clear as mud what exactly the company (and indeed what Matt Hancock MP) will be doing with Matt Hancock App users’ personal data. Here’s a sample problematic para from the app’s privacy policy (emphasis ours): when you sign up [to?] the App you provide consent so that we may disclose your personal information to the Publisher, the Publisher’s management company, agent, rights image company, the Publisher’s record label or publisher (as applicable) and any other third parties, for use in conjunction with additional user promotions or offers they may run from time to time or in relation to the sale of other goods and services. You may unsubscribe from such promotions or offers or communications at any time by following the instructions set out in such promotion or offer or communication; If you’re wondering whether Hancock has also started his own rock band or record label; spoiler — as far as we’re aware he hasn’t. Rather, as we understand it, the policy issued with the app was originally created for musician clients which Disciple more often works with (one example on that front: The Rolling Stones ). We also understand the privacy policy was uploaded in error to the Matt app, according to sources familiar with the matter, and it is in the process of being reviewed for possible amendments. Tapping around in the app itself, other aspects also point to it having been rushed out — for example, expanding comments didn’t seem to work for some of the posts we tried. And three dots in the upper corner of photos occasionally does nothing; occasionally asks if you want to ‘turn off notifications’; and occasionally offers both choices; plus a third option of asking if you want to report a post. Meanwhile, as others have pointed out, by calling the app after the man himself users get the unfortunate notification that “Matt Hancock would like to access your photos” if they choose to upload an image. Awkward to say the least. Although it’s less clear whether reports that the app might also be breaching iOS rules by accessing users’ photos even if they’ve denied cameraroll access stand up to scrutiny as iOS 11 does let users grant one-time access to a photo. Hancock’s parliamentary office is deferring all awkward questions about the Matt Hancock App to Disciple. We know because we rang and they redirected us to company’s contact details. We wanted to ask Hancock’s people what user data his office is harvesting, via his own-brand app, and what the data will be used for. And why Hancock decided to build the app with Disciple (which the app’s press release specifies hasn’t been paid; the company is seemingly providing the service as a donation in kind — presumably for the hopes of associated publicity, so, er, careful what you wish for). We also wanted to know what Hancock thought he could achieve by launching an own-brand app which isn’t already possible to do with pre-existing communication tools (and via constituency surgeries). And whether the app was vetted by any government agencies prior to launch — given Hancock’s position as a sitting minister, and the potential for some wider reputational damage on account of the unfortunate juxtaposition with his ministerial portfolio. Eventually a different Hancock staffer send us this statement: “This app is ICO registered and GDPR compliant. It is consistent with measures in the Data Protection Bill currently before Parliament. And is App Store certified by Apple, using standard Apple technology.” Re: GDPR, we suggest the minister reads our primer because we’re rather less confident than he apparently is that his app, as is, under this current privacy policy and structure, would pass muster under the new EU-wide standard (which comes into force in May). As regards the why of the Matt app, the staffer sent us a line from Matt’s weekly newsletter — where he writes: “Working with a brilliant British startup called Disciple Media, I’ve launched this app to build a safe, moderated, digital community where my West Suffolk constituents and I can discuss the issues that matter to them.” Hancock’s office did not respond to our questions about the exact data they are collecting and for what specific purposes (pro tip: That’s basically a GDPR requirement guys!). But we’ll update this post if the minister delivers any further insights on the digital activity being done under (and in) his name. (As an aside, an email we sent to his constituency email address also bounced back with a fatal delivery error. Digital credibility score at his point: Distressingly low.) Meanwhile, Disciple Media has so far declined to provide a public response to our questions — though they have promised a statement. Which we’ll drop in here when/if it lands. The company is in the process of pivoting its business model from a revenue share arrangement to a SaaS monthly subscription — which a spokesman describes as “more ‘easy Squarespace for mobile/mobile web communities’ than ‘social media'”. So — in theory at least — the business should be heading away from the need to lean on the data slurping of app users’ personal information to power marketing-generated revenues to keep the money rolling in. At least if it gets enough paying monthly customers (Hancock not being one of them). We’re told it has relied on private investment thus far but is also actively seeking to raise VC.","The Matt Hancock app, which launched this week and quickly ran into a storm of criticism for displaying an unfortunately lax attitude to privacy, has caught the attention of the UK’s data watchdog.

"Kelly Murray, CNN","(CNN)As if one winter storm around the holidays wasn't enough, a new one is taking shape for New Year's Eve, bringing more heavy rain and a renewed flood threat.
It comes on the heels of the deadly storm system that plagued much of the Midwest, South and East over Christmas. 
The worst is over as that storm pushes offshore into the Atlantic. But it killed at least six people in the Midwest and South and brought blizzard conditions, a foot of snow, and winds exceeding 55 mph to the Great Plains and Upper Midwest on Thursday. It then ripped across the East with heavy rainfall and winds.
On Friday, more than 50 million people were under the threat of floods, with flood watches and warnings stretching from the Gulf Coast to New Jersey. 
Flash flooding affected Southern Mississippi and Alabama, triggering dangerous situations and high-water rescues. Up to a foot of rain fell in less than a day.
The rough weather made holiday travel even more of a headache. There were nearly 9,000 flight delays into, within or out of the country Friday, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware.
As of Saturday, flood watches have been largely discontinued, but there are still warnings for some rivers in the South, particularly across southern Mississippi and Alabama, according to CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera.
""I'm not expecting the foot of rain some areas in the Southern US received,"" Cabrera said. ""An additional 1 to 3 inches may renew flooding concerns due to saturated soils. Some areas in the South will in fact make a run for wettest year on record with the last few storms filling rain gauges to record levels.""
Forecast radar images for Saturday show rain persisting in coastal areas of the Southeast, but it should clear out for inland cities, including Atlanta and Charlotte.
The letup won't last long, however. On Sunday, moisture emanating from the Gulf of Mexico will bring a band of showers to southeastern Texas and then stretch across southern Louisiana, all the way up through the Carolinas.
Then, on the last day of 2018, another storm will bring rain, although less heavy, to the North and East, Cabrera said.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright ESA/NASA Image caption The ISS provides a unqiue perspective on Earth's weather Thunderstorms are some of the most spectacular events in nature, yet what we can see from the surface of our planet is only the beginning. There are bizarre goings on in Earth's upper atmosphere, and a new mission aims to learn more about them. Launched to the International Space Station on Monday, the Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM) will observe the strange electrical phenomena that occur above thunderstorms. Sky lab Orbiting at an altitude of just over 400km, the ISS provides the perfect view of Earth's turbulent weather systems. ASIM will be deployed aboard the station later this month. Media caption A series of thunderstorms as seen from the ISS The electrifying effects of storms are frequently observed from the space station. Yet when lightning strikes downward, something very different is happening above the cloud tops. Known as Transient Luminous Events (TLEs), these unusual features were first spotted by accident in 1989. Minnesota professor John R Winckler was testing a television camera in advance of an upcoming rocket launch, when he realised that two frames showed bright columns of light above a distant storm cloud. Image copyright OTD/LIS, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center Image caption Lightning strikes tend to concentrate over land masses The discovery came as a shock to scientists at the time, according to Dr Torsten Neubert, ASIM's lead scientist. ""That really surprised all of us. How come this exists and we didn't know it? Airline pilots must have known about it - there are some anecdotal descriptions,"" the Technical University of Denmark physicist said. For the better part of a century before TLEs were caught on camera, people who spotted them had been reporting ""rocket lightning"" or ""upward lightning"". Now in need of names, the phenomena were christened sprites and elves because of their fleeting, mysterious nature. Yet despite their diminutive monikers, these features are anything but small, and extend tens of kilometres into the atmosphere. Sprites, elves and jets So, what's causing these events? ""They are slightly different to lightning,"" Dr Neubert told BBC News. ""It's a pulse of the electric field that travels up. For the sprite - when the atmosphere gets thin, the field can get a discharge."" Sprites appear milliseconds after a powerful cloud-to-ground lightning strike. Elves, on the other hand, are caused by the electromagnetic pulse the strike produces. A brief, aurora-like expanding halo in the ionosphere, they occur too quickly to be spotted by the human eye and last less than a millisecond. Although they are more elusive, ""elves are incredibly well understood,"" says Dr Martin Fullekrug from the University of Bath. They are the most common TLE, thought to occur twice as often as sprites. Image copyright Jason Ahrns Image caption Sprites can last several milliseconds Blue jets - upward electrical discharges from cloud tops - are the least well known. ""The jets are not very well studied because they're very faint. They're mainly blue. Also they're not necessarily associated with lightning. They pop up now and again and they're very mysterious,"" Dr Fullekrug added. While elves are mainly spotted over warm ocean waters, sprites tend to occur over land. North America, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Africa are all good places to see them. Media caption ESA astronaut Andreas Mogensen captured footage of rare blue jets from the ISS But it is possible to spot sprites elsewhere. A normal summer thunderstorm in the UK is about 10km wide. Sprites appear above mesoscale convective systems - storm complexes about 10 times larger. ""In Britain we also have [these storms] from time to time,"" explained Dr Fullekrug. ""We're conducting research on one that happened in May last year. It produced a wonderful sequence of sprites [over Cornwall]."" The sprites were spotted by meteor observers, who had cameras trained on the sky to follow the trails of shooting stars. Stormchasing from space ASIM's main goals are to study the physics of TLEs, and the characteristics of thunderstorms that produce them. The payload includes two cameras, which can capture 12 frames per second, plus X-ray and gamma ray detectors. This will allow the international team of researchers, for many of whom this is the culmination of decades of work, to determine where in the cloud sprites or jets originate. Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Sprites occur well above the cloud tops With the aid of the European Space Agency, ASIM's minimum mission length is two years. During this period, it is expected to observe a minimum of one TLE per day, although it is thought that they occur at least every minute, somewhere in the world. For Dr Neubert, this will be an incredibly exciting time. ""We don't really know what's inside lighting. It happens so fast and it's so dangerous... it's hard to get to the real inside physics,"" he said. In the thin upper atmosphere, TLEs are larger and easier to measure. ""To me,"" he added, ""they represent a window to the inside of lightning.""",A new mission aboard the International Space Station is taking storm chasing to new heights.,2018-04-06T23:18:45Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Hunting mysterious giant lightning from space,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-43585113,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3194/production/_100729621_thunderstorm_seen_from_space_station.png,bbc-news,BBC News,storm,0
BINYAMIN APPELBAUM,"The Trump administration said its economic policies would deliver a lasting boost to growth, and Mr. Trump specifically highlighted the auto industry, and G.M., as beneficiaries of those policies. So far, however, those policies have delivered a short-term increase in spending. The tax cuts passed in 2017 were designed to encourage investment: New factories, new equipment, new products. Tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, and on Chinese goods, were supposed to serve the same purpose. But G.M. has said the cost of the tariffs exceeds the benefits from the tax cuts and instead of building new factories, G.M. is moving to shutter domestic plants. Mr. Kudlow defended the administrations policies on Tuesday, and said that revisions to the North American Free Trade Agreement would help the auto industry. Theres a lot of disappointment, even anger, about the companys decision, he said. The administration also said it was considering ways of punishing G.M. by ending other federal subsidies, which seemed unlikely to help the economy. Some analysts say the focus on what might go wrong is obscuring the reality that the economy remains strong. The primary engine of growth is consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity. The pace of wage gains has increased, consumer confidence remains close to the post-recession high set earlier this year, and retailers are anticipating a strong holiday season. Consumers havent run out of money and confidence yet, which means economic growth remains on track, said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG. Mr. Rupkey noted that 46.6 percent of consumers said in the November survey of consumer confidence that good jobs were plentiful, the best figure during the current recovery.

Anticipated to make landfall on Monday, Alberto is the first storm ahead of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, which formally starts on 1 June. It will bring heavy rain and winds of 100kmh (65mph) across southern states, the US National Hurricane Center said. It was centred about 185km (115 miles) south-west of Florida's Panama City, at 01:00 CET (6:00GMT). Alberto had picked up strength as it headed north through the Gulf of Mexico, bringing with it the warning of life-threatening inundation, said the Miami-based hurricane centre. It is forecast to drop as much as 30cm (12in) of rain across Mississippi to western Georgia and to bring storm swells of about 60-120cm (2-4ft) to low-lying areas. Alberto comes during the Memorial Day weekend, and is expected to affect travel on Monday, when many people will return from their holidays.

AZI PAYBARAH,"Dec. 27-28, 2010 Mayor Michael Bloomberg, fresh off his unpopular push to extend term limits, was coldly dismissive of complaints from residents who said they were buried under a storm. The city is going fine. Broadway shows were full last night, Mr. Bloomberg told reporters, playing into critics caricature of him as a Manhattan-centric mayor unaware of life in the less-gilded quarters of the city. Later, it was reported that Mr. Bloombergs private plane and presumably its owner were in Bermuda. The same storm was, apparently, not enough of a concern to curtail Mr. Christies plans. He had planned, paid for and executed a vacation to Disneyworld while the people whod just elected him, were, as The Daily News put it, buried in an epic snowstorm. Feb. 9, 1969 The storm that lives in infamy. A sudden dump of 15 inches of snow eventually led to the death of 42 people and injured 288 others. It permanently scarred Mayor John Lindsays reputation, and, some said, gave cover to his successors: Anything short of Mr. Lindsays disastrous response was bound to appear favorable. The Timess J. David Goodman, Al Baker and James Glanz interviewed more than 100 people, and analyzed housing authority records. They write : For at least two decades, almost every time a child in its apartments tested positive for high lead levels, Nycha launched a counteroffensive, city records show. From 2010 through July of this year, the agency challenged 95 percent of the orders it received from the Health Department to remove lead detected in Nycha apartments. Private landlords almost never contest a finding of lead; they did so in only 4 percent of the 5,000 orders they received over the same period, records show. Nychas strategy often worked. The Health Department backed down in 158 of 211 cases in public housing after the authority challenged its finding, the data shows.

BARRY FRIEDMAN,"Historically, when big collisions between public opinion and the Supreme Court have occurred, the justices lose and the public gets its way. That is because, as Abraham Lincoln put it a few years after the justices decided the infamous Dred Scott decision, which deprived Congress of authority over slavery in the territories, If the policy of the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by the decisions of the Supreme Court, then the people will have ceased to be their own rulers. During the Civil War and Reconstruction, Republicans in Congress addressed their concerns about a bench that might be hostile to Union interests by changing the size of the court three times to try to secure a favorable majority. Once, they even stripped the justices of jurisdiction over a case that threatened Reconstruction itself. You may be waiting impatiently to point out that Roosevelts plan to pack the court ultimately failed. In the heat of the battle, Roosevelts key ally, the Senate majority leader, Joe Robinson, dropped dead, and at that point, Congress and country apparently had enough of the struggle and Roosevelt dropped it. But that misses what really happened. Before the fight in Congress ended, the justices already had rolled over. Entirely. In decisions in the spring of 1937 they made clear they would stop blocking economic measures. Headlines screamed in bold type about the courts flip-flop, which became known as the switch in time that saved nine. Right-wing justices, chastened, began leaving the court. By 1941, Roosevelt had filled seven of the nine seats on the court. He may have lost his battle to pack the court, but he won the war. Of course, the justices have learned this lesson over time, and so we have since avoided any really serious crises involving the court. Chief Justice John Roberts clearly understands the political implications of a court out of step with the populace. Though his views are profoundly conservative, the chief justice nonetheless has done an admirable job of moderating the impact of his colleagues on the right, even voting left himself at critical moments, as he did to uphold President Obamas health care plan and to limit law enforcement searches of cellphone records. Still, its hard to know if he can continue to pull this off as the court drifts ever farther right just as it is hard to see him denying conservatives the votes to overturn Roe v. Wade. The more the justices are perceived as partisan and ideological, the more the public will treat them in precisely that way. Which includes bringing them to heel when they get seriously out of line.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Its the perfect science-fiction device: a hurricane of dark matter. Recent, real-life research has demonstrated that our Sun is currently engulfed in a so-called a stellar stream. Some publications have seized on this ominous-sounding idea, reporting that Earth is about to be walloped by a dark matter stormbut in fact, if it exists, were already inside the storm. The reality of the situation isnt quite so dire, but its interesting nonetheless. Stellar streams are populations of related stars that could have once been pieces of a dwarf galaxy or globular cluster, but have now been shredded apart by gravitational forces and pass through parts of our galaxy. Since astronomers are pretty sure that stuff called dark matter serves as the gravitational scaffolding for dwarf galaxies, then presumably a stellar stream should also contain some percentage of dark matter. Maybe a dark matter experiment could detect dark matter particles from the recently discovered stream running through our cosmic neighborhood. Theres supposed to be a stream that were inside of right now, Ciaran OHare, postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Theoretical Physics at the University of Zaragoza, told Gizmodo. It immediately made me think about the consequences for dark matter. The most successful models to describe the universe are based on experiments showing that that the cosmos is made up of 4 percent regular matter, perhaps 70 percent dark energy that is driving the universe apart, and the rest, around 25 percent, dark matter. Scientists have reason to believe that dark matter consists of particles, the same way that everything we can see is made of particles, and that its the scaffolding for the universes large-scale structure. But this dark matter has only ever been observed based on its gravitational effects. Scientists are in the midst of hunting for a dark matter particle. But meanwhile, surveys such as the European Space Agencys Gaia telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey have created enormous maps of the sky, complete with positions, velocity, and other data points for our region of the Milky Way galaxy. The data revealed substantial structures, such as this stream and accompanying dark matter hurricane, called S1, hitting the Solar System head-on. Perhaps this dark matter hurricane could be detectable by todays existing dark matter detection experiments, and would have a distinguishable signal from the Milky Ways background dark matter. It would move much fastera hurricane, compared to the background dark matter wind, according to the paper published last week in Physical Review D. The researchers then analyzed whether theyd be able to spot the stream with upcoming dark matter detectors. If dark matter comprised of a weakly interacting massive particle or WIMP, a particle with a mass similar to the other particles but that interacts weakly (imagine a light breeze interacting with a skyscraper), then the hurricane would only be detectable if the particles had a specific mass range, according to the paper. Experiments like the XENON NT detector in Italy wouldnt be able to pick out the direction of a potential dark matter particle, explained Laura Baudis, physics professor at the University of Zürich who was not involved in the new paper. Doing so would take a much larger detector, given the kinds of WIMPs that have already been ruled out. And if dark matter is instead comprised of much lighter particles called axions, the hurricanes effects would perhaps be more noticeable, according to the papers calculations. I think its quite an interesting idea, Sownak Bose, postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told Gizmodo. All these experiments trying to detect dark matter have a possibility to have their signals boosted by this extra flux.

Julia Alexander,"Blizzard’s beautiful cinematics have long caught people’s attention when they debut at BlizzCon, the publisher’s annual convention, and this year’s shorts stole the show once again. World of Warcraft, Heroes of the Storm, and Overwatch all received their own cinematic shorts, teasing new players, worlds, and experiences for fans of the franchises. Overwatch’ s latest short focused on McCree, the game’s popular, roughneck cowboy character. (It’s an appropriate choice considering Rockstar Games’ Red Dead Redemption 2, arguably the biggest game of 2018, came out last week.) Blizzard also debuted the trailer and cinematic short for its first full-fledged mobile Diablo game called Diablo: Immortal. Overwatch’ s short was by far Blizzard’s most interesting, introducing a new playable hero named Ashe. But don’t discount the others just yet: World of Warcraft’ s short set up the next chapter in the Alliance and Horde’s continuing battle, while Heroes of the Storm’ s short introduced a new playable hero named Orphea. Ashe, the leader of the Deadlock gang, also received her own standalone trailer as Overwatch’ s new hero, showing off her unique skills in action.

Shannon Connellan,"'Alberto,' the first named storm of the 2018 hurricane season, has essentially demonstrated its version of a storm in a teacup. The subtropical storm made landfall in Florida on Monday afternoon, and saw strong winds creating a mini-waterspout in a hotel swimming pool in Panama City Beach. Justin Ray Parker, a guest at Shores of Panama captured the little rampaging waterspout on their smartphone, even the moment when a pool float is tossed into the air. The storm, while projected to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to areas in Florida and some Gulf Coast states through Wednesday, will not become a hurricane, according to NOAA — in fact, it has already been downgraded to a subtropical depression. Alberto has, sadly, already killed two people, WYFF-TV anchor Mike McCormick and photojournalist Aaron Smeltzer, who were covering the storm.

 The storm had earlier caused destruction in Mozambique
A tropical storm has swept away bridges and homes in eastern Zimbabwe, killing at least 24 people, officials say.
Cyclone Idai cut off power and communications in parts of Manicaland province on the border with Mozambique. Some 40 people are missing.
People fled from their homes to the slopes of mountain and were waiting to be rescued, but strong winds have hampered helicopter flights.
In Mozambique, where Idai made landfall on Thursday, at least 19 people died.
Flooding across the rest of the country had already killed nearly 70 people before the storm's arrival.
Zimbabwe's information ministry said the town of Chimanimani had been cut from the rest of Manicaland province. The country's national army was leading the rescue efforts, it added.
The death toll was expected to rise as authorities continued to assess the situation.
Jacob Mafume, a spokesman for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, said a ""serious humanitarian crisis [was] unfolding"" in the east of the country.
The cyclone hit Mozambique with winds of up to 177km/h (106 mph). It cut off more than 500,000 residents in the port city of Beira, one the country's largest cities. Roads were flooded and the airport was shut down.
Mozambique has been struck by severe cyclones in the past, including Eline in 2000, when 350 people died and 650,000 were displaced across the wider region.

New York City’s largest snowstorm after the vernal equinox was on April 3, 1915, when 10 inches fell. For those lamenting spring’s slow arrival, note that things could be worse. The latest in the season that New York had substantial snowfall was on April 25 (in 1875), when three inches fell on Central Park. And a trace fell on May 29, in 1995.

 Steve Irwin on stage with a crocodile at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2002
Animal rights organisation Peta has caused a row by claiming Steve Irwin was killed while ""harassing"" a stingray. 
Wild animals should be ""left alone in their natural habitats"", the group wrote in response to a doodle by Google celebrating the TV conservationist's life. 
The Australian wildlife advocate was killed by a stingray in 2006.
There's a wildlife reserve in his name in Queensland. 
Steve Irwin, who would have turned 57 on Friday, was probably best-known for his Crocodile Hunter series. 
He described his ""mission"" on earth as being to ""save wildlife"". 
But Peta angered his many fans by describing his method of conservation as ""harassment"". 
In his shows, Steve Irwin would approach animals in the wild - often grappling with crocodiles or holding snakes up in front of the camera. 
He believed that teaching people about wildlife was the way to save the creatures, and that the passion he showed on screen helped ""push an educational message"".
And while Peta accuses Steve Irwin's shows of trying to excite audiences ""at the expense of animals"", wildlife conservationist Anneka Svenska says that what he did ""has inspired the next generation of conservationists"".
""Probably now it wouldn't be looked at as so good to touch the animals like he used to,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. 
""But at the time he was doing it, it inspired loads and loads of children to go on and work with animals.""
People reading Peta's criticism online felt similarly to Anneka. 
At the time of his death, the Guardian published an opinion piece by author Germaine Greer claiming the animal's had ""got their revenge"". 
""What Irwin never seemed to understand was that animals need space,"" she wrote. 
""There was no habitat, no matter how fragile or finely balanced, that Irwin hesitated to barge into.
""There was not an animal he was not prepared to manhandle. Every creature he brandished at the camera was in distress.""
Lots of the animals Steve Irwin was filmed with lived in Australia Zoo, which his family still owns today. 
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 Steve Irwin took live animals like this alligator on prime time TV shows
Anneka, who's a wildlife TV presenter, disagrees with keeping animals in captivity, but says what Steve Irwin did has to be put ""into balance"". 
Anneka says that she wouldn't choose to touch wild animals because ""they need to be left to be as they are"".
She's recorded programmes with lots of rescued wolves, but says approaching them in the wild would put them in danger. 
""If I was to go out into the wild and start feeding or interacting with wolves then you end up with a lot of dead animals because they become too tame,"" she says. 
""Touching animals in parks that are used to being touched"" is fine, Anneka says. ""I think the criticism comes when he's in the wild and chasing down animals in the wild.""
Steve Irwin was accused of breaking wildlife laws while filming in the Antarctic in 2004. 
Promotional material for his documentary Ice Breaker claimed he ""slides down hillsides with penguins, almost rubs noses with the notoriously dangerous leopard seals and spends the most inspiring time with two friendly humpback whales"".
He was cleared of breaching the rules after an investigation. 
But his biggest controversy came when he walked into a crocodile enclosure with a dead chicken in one hand, and his one-month-old son in the other. 
Headlines following the incident branded him as reckless and irresponsible, and led to an investigation about whether he'd breached workplace regulations. 
But Anneka says she's a big fan of Steve Irwin, like seemingly most people on the internet. 
He's remembered fondly as someone who helped teach people about animals that might otherwise have been seen as scary. 
""I still really like Steve Irwin, I was a fan of him, I think he did a lot of good,"" she says.
""The powerful influence he's had on children and how they love animals and how they engage with animals has been extremely valuable. 
""I think if you have to weigh up the good and the bad, he did more good than bad.""

People living in one of Mozambique's largest cities have been warned to expect the ""worst-case scenario"" as a major cyclone makes landfall.
Cyclone Idai, which is carrying winds of up to 165km/h (103mph), is making landfall near the port of Beira.
A storm surge of at least six metres (20 feet) is expected near low-lying Beira, a city of 500,000 people, Météo France said.
Heavy rains have already killed about 100 people in Mozambique and Malawi.
Beira is the fourth largest city in Mozambique and its major port sits on the mouth of the Pungwe river, that runs to Zimbabwe.
Météo France, which monitors French territories in the Indian Ocean, said Idai was ""an extremely dangerous tropical cyclone"" packing a ""life-threatening"" storm surge of at least four metres along the coast, and six metres near the mouth of the Pungwe river near Beira.
The surge could be even higher because of high tide, Météo France warned.
The cyclone's late change of course meant that ""the worst case scenario is very likely"", it added.
Images posted on social media showed significant damage to Beira as the storm approached, with large trees uprooted. 
Mozambique has been struck by severe cyclones in the past, including Eline in 2000, when 350 people died and 650,000 were displaced across the wider region.
Beira has often seen the brunt of the storms and has worked to limit the effects of rising waters brought about by climate change through a series of infrastructure projects.

JACEY FORTIN,"In New York, state officials said 182,000 people remained without power as of Sunday afternoon, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency in Dutchess, Putnam, Sullivan and Westchester Counties in the Hudson Valley. “This is an all-hands-on-deck situation and the people of the Hudson Valley should know that New York State is doing everything we can to restore power and help them recover as quickly as possible,” he said in the statement. Photo Winds from a powerful nor’easter knocked a tree onto power lines on Friday in Takoma Park, Md. Hundreds of thousands of people were still without electricity on Sunday. Credit Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Con Edison, which serves New York City and Westchester County, said in a statement on Sunday morning that the pace of power restoration was picking up. Crews restored power to about half of the 124,000 customers affected on Friday by the storm, which “packed the biggest wallop since Superstorm Sandy,” the utility said, referring to the hurricane that pummeled New York City and the East Coast in 2012. When her neighborhood in Stafford, Va., went dark on Friday, Trisha Christian made the most of it. She and her boyfriend cooked some of their frozen and refrigerated food — spinach, beef, risotto and shrimp — before it could spoil. “It was a nice evening. You light the fire, every single candle that you own,” Ms. Christian, 53, said in a phone interview on Sunday. “Definitely put the layers on.” Things got trickier on Saturday when they began rationing — and then boiling — water for the shower. Ms. Christian said she thought power might be restored on Monday, but was unsure because she could not access internet data on her phone — that service was down, too. Power restoration schedules varied by utility company and the extent of damage. Some areas were expected to be restored by Monday, while others may have to wait until as late as Saturday. Richard Rodriguez, 53, of Stillwater, N.J., lost electricity on Friday. “You go outside and you hear this symphony of generators,” he said in a phone interview on Sunday. Mr. Rodriguez has one, too, but the line to buy gas was long. He, his wife and his children were doing their best to conserve energy: no microwave, no dishwasher and no washing machine. While Mr. Rodriguez had seen a lot of anger toward the local utility companies, he said he understood that these things can take time. “You’ve got to be thankful for the people going out there to fix this,” he said. “They’re going to be working around the clock and risking their lives and safety.” Jan Ransom and Matt Stevens contributed reporting.

The rain storms hitting California this week have been called many things, but two related terms keep popping up to describe this weather system: “atmospheric river” and “Pineapple Express.” So which one is it? “Pineapple Express was a term for many years used to identify storms that came from Hawaii and hit the West Coast,” said Marty Ralph, a research meteorologist affiliated with U.C. San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “About 15 years ago we recognized that there’s a broader definition called an atmospheric river, and those happen all over the planet.” For non-scientists, atmospheric rivers can be conceptualized visually. “If you look from space from a satellite, it does look like a sinuous river,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at U.C.L.A. “It’s a colorful term, and it’s actually the official meteorological term to describe this process.” But while all Pineapple Express storms are atmospheric rivers, not all atmospheric rivers are classified as Pineapple Express storms. The source for the particular atmospheric river hitting California this week is near the Hawaiian Islands, hence the playful “Pineapple Express.” Not everyone agrees, though, that this storm falls under that category. “I wouldn’t call this one a Pineapple Express. The storm is coming from the West, but the tail of this atmospheric river didn’t come from Hawaii, it came from east of Hawaii,” Mr. Ralph said. “But I’m not sure about arguing the jargon too much on this. The modern term is atmospheric river.” Nomenclature aside, Mr. Swain urged residents in burn areas not to ignore the orders because of storm fatigue. Though the storm may not hit Los Angeles too hard, it could wallop those in Santa Barbara County. The forecast is severe, and if water falls too quickly it could lead to substantial flooding and mudslides. “The forecast is for a really, really big rain,” he said. “Maybe half a foot or more of water is going to fall in a lot of places that have had intense fire activity. Whether all those inches of rain fall over three days or in a six hours is hard to predict.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"A winter weather advisory is in effect until 2 p.m., which means roads could be slippery and visibility may be reduced. But whatever you do, don’t call this storm a nor’easter. While we may have just celebrated a rare “four’easter,” with four nor’easters pummeling our region within a month, today’s storm will not be the fifth. “The magnitude of this storm is not quite up to par,” said John Murray, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. For a storm to qualify as a nor’easter, he explained, it must meet a few conditions, including sustained winds of 34 knots, or around 39 miles per hour. Wind gusts today are expected to reach only 25 miles per hour, leaving the storm with the less-sexy label of “quick-moving low pressure system.” Which is a mixed blessing. The storm is not strong enough to postpone the Yankees home opener against the Tampa Bay Rays, but it’s also not dumping enough snow to upset alternate side parking, which is in effect today.

PATRICK McGEEHAN,"Each of the airport’s 43 airlines has customers to serve and a schedule to keep, but there is no doubt who has the ultimate authority. Ed Freni, the director of aviation for Massport, leads the meetings. Each of the four terminals at Logan has its own manager who reports to Mr. Freni. “Ask anyone at the airport who’s in charge, they’ll say Ed Freni,” said Thomas P. Glynn, the chief executive of Massport. The daily meetings also foster a spirit of cooperation among airlines that are typically the fiercest of rivals, said Norbert P. Strissel, director of airport operations at Logan for JetBlue Airways. An airline will make one of its gates available to a competitor in a pinch, especially if it is in danger of violating the time limit for keeping passengers in a plane on the ground, Mr. Strissel said at a recent meeting. “We’ve been in that situation in years past, as well as other carriers here at Logan,” he said. “Ninety-nine percent of the time, we’re saying go ahead and get that plane to a gate and at least get the customers off of it.” Photo Every morning, dozens of Logan airport officials meet with representatives of airlines and state and federal agencies to share information that might affect operations. Credit M. Scott Brauer for The New York Times That is not what happened at Kennedy on the first weekend in January. Some passengers on a flight from France that landed late on Jan. 5 said they were still aboard when dawn broke the next morning, more than a full day after the storm had swept through the New York area. It was one of several international flights that landed and could not find a gate for hours. The storm, which had been described as a bomb cyclone, dropped several inches of snow at Kennedy, but the runways had been cleared by Friday morning. Removing the snow was the Port Authority’s business. But sorting out the growing chaos in Terminal 1 was not. Under Kennedy’s operating model, management of just about everything that happens inside the six terminals is left to the tenants, either airlines that have their own terminals or companies that manage terminals occupied by several airlines. Terminal 1 at Kennedy handles 21 foreign airlines but is operated by a consortium consisting of four of them: Air France, Japan Airlines, Korean Air and Lufthansa. After the airport reopened on that Friday, the airlines, eager to deliver their delayed and detoured passengers to New York, started sending flights to Kennedy. It was up to the terminal’s managers to schedule access to its 11 gates, but they were quickly overwhelmed by the influx of jets. The experience of Aeroflot, the Russian airline and a tenant at Terminal 1, illustrates how dysfunctional the situation became. At about 5:30 p.m. on Friday, an Aeroflot flight from Moscow arrived at Kennedy. But passengers said they were held on the plane for nearly three hours, and then had to wait an additional three hours to retrieve their luggage. Photo Crews at Logan keep about 300 tons of salt on hand throughout the winter. Credit M. Scott Brauer for The New York Times That Saturday afternoon, officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey took the unusual step of ordering the terminal closed to inbound flights. That move forced Aeroflot to have a plane that was headed there from Moscow turn back. The problem had not been solved by the next day, so the Port Authority barred arrivals at Terminal 1 again on Sunday. Aeroflot had to cancel two flights that day from Moscow and one from Kennedy to Moscow. Aeroflot blamed the cancellations on “the complicated infrastructure situation at the J.F.K. Airport and the lack of parking lots for aircraft,” according to Tass, the Russian news agency. Adding misfortune to misery, on Sunday afternoon, a frozen pipe burst in the ceiling of the arrivals section of Kennedy’s Terminal 4, flooding an area that had been crowded with stranded travelers and their baggage. That mess, too, was not the Port Authority’s responsibility, but quickly became its problem. The agency sent workers to help out the operator of Terminal 4, a company known as JFKIAT, and had to bar it from accepting international flights for several hours that evening. What became of the passengers whose flights were blocked from landing at Kennedy that weekend? Six planeloads of them wound up at Logan, Mr. Freni said. Without gates for all of them, airport officials had to close off the end of one of Logan’s runways and park them there, said Todd Smith, Massport’s director of aviation operations. Passengers were then taken by shuttle buses to the international terminal. Photo Passengers waited in Kennedy Airport’s Terminal 4 after a weekend of delays and cancellations caused by the snowstorm. Kennedy’s terminals are run by the airlines, not the Port Authority. Credit Richard Drew/Associated Press The six planes that were diverted to Logan from Kennedy on Saturday and Sunday, Mr. Smith said, included an Air Europa flight from Madrid and a Japan Airlines flight from Tokyo. Boston was the second of two unscheduled stops the Japanese plane made. It had nearly reached Kennedy when it was diverted to Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport. After leaving O’Hare for Kennedy, it was rerouted to Boston, where it stayed overnight while some of the passengers made it to New York by bus. By the weekend, while thousands of suitcases were piling up at Kennedy, all was calm at Logan. Massport’s fleet of snow-removal equipment, which includes 14 plows with 27-foot blades and a rubber-tracked snow-groomer designed for a ski resort, had quickly cleared the airport’s six runways. “Top-down management is sort of out of fashion these days,” Mr. Glynn said. But, he added, “top-down management works here and it works because people have respect for those at the top.” Logan, of course, is smaller than Kennedy, and handles only a fraction of the international passengers that Kennedy does. But the responses from officials of the Port Authority in the last several weeks imply that the different management structures of the two airports explain much of the gap in performance. Rick Cotton, the executive director of the Port Authority, has repeatedly apologized and vowed that there would not be a repeat. The agency appointed the former transportation secretary Ray H. LaHood to investigate what happened at Kennedy and said it would immediately make several changes in procedures. Among those changes would be to require airlines to notify the Port Authority whenever an arriving plane is not assigned to a gate within 90 minutes of the time it lands. Speaking to an air-travel industry group in Manhattan recently, the Port Authority’s director of aviation, Huntley Lawrence, admitted that the agency had paid too little attention to passengers. Reflecting back to the 1960s, when the Port Authority first turned management of terminals over to private companies, he said: “No one ever dreamed that meant we would abdicate control of the customer experience at our airports. But we did.” Now, Mr. Lawrence added, according to the text of his speech, “those days are over.” Mr. Cotton said that Port Authority officials would await Mr. LaHood’s report, which is expected this spring. But, he added, “if his recommendation is that the Port Authority needs to take a more aggressive role, the Port Authority will take a more aggressive role.” Continue reading the main story","Snow plows in waiting at Boston Logan International Airport.

"Holly Yan, CNN","(CNN) This nightmare called Tropical Storm Florence is far from over. ""Many people who think that the storm has missed them have yet to see its threat,"" North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said. ""This system is unloading epic amounts of rainfall -- in some places measured in feet, not inches,"" Here are the startling numbers behind Florence's wrath -- so far: That's just the number of customers without power in the Carolinas. The number of people who lost electricity is far greater since a single customer can represent an entire home. About 809,000 of those customers are North Carolina, and about 155,000 are in South Carolina. South Carolina has reported its first death from Florence. A 61-year-old woman died Friday night when her car struck a tree that fell during the storm, state emergency officials said. In North Carolina, at least five deaths are related to the storm -- but ""several others are under investigation,"" Cooper said. ""Remember: Most storm deaths occur from drowning in fresh water, often in cars,"" he said. ""Don't drive across standing or moving water."" That's how hard the wind gusted in North Carolina's New River inlet. Both Wilmington International Airport and Fort Macon suffered gusts of 105 mph, the National Weather Service said. More than 20,000 people are staying in 157 emergency shelters in North Carolina, Cooper said. He said ""if those shelters fill up, we will establish more shelters."" Even if you live 150 miles out from the center of Florence, you could still feel tropical-storm-force winds -- which are 39 mph or greater. 30.58 inches (and counting) That's the new North Carolina record for most rainfall from a single tropical system. It happened in the coastal town of Swansboro. The number of service members deployed include 7,500 from the US Coast Guard and 6,500 from the National Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said. Another 2,900 active duty members are also standing by.

FRANCES ROBLES,"FEMA did provide huge generators to power water-pumping stations on the island, and has been spending $20 million a month on generators for two electric power plants. In all, the report says, the agency has provided one million nights’ lodging in hotels and 130 million meals after the 2017 storms, a level of aid it considers “unprecedented.” The agency spent nearly $4 billion on aid and recovery efforts related to Puerto Rico. But many in Puerto Rico fault the agency’s efforts. “I don’t think anything provided by FEMA was a ‘meal,’” said Carlos J. Torres, 46, a resident of Guayanilla in the southern part of the island, referring to the military rations and boxes of candies and snacks that the agency often distributed. “You cannot call that food,” he said. Mr. Torres said he received a $500 emergency grant from FEMA, but has not been able to return to his apartment because the building was badly damaged and the landlord, his father, did not qualify for disaster assistance. His father was referred to the Small Business Administration to take out a low-interest loan for repairs, but “what I am expecting to see is a lot of people losing their property,” Mr. Torres said. “They are not going to be able to pay that off.” Thousands of Puerto Ricans left homeless by the storm took refuge on the mainland with FEMA’s help, but have still not been able to return home. Bethzaida Crespo, 36, moved her family to a hotel room in Orlando when her home in Dorado flooded. She received $3,000 for her losses and FEMA has paid for the hotel room. But that assistance is set to run out on July 23, and like many evacuees, she is looking to the agency for help finding a longer-term solution.","When a killer storm came to Puerto Rico, FEMA’s warehouse on the island was nearly empty, with not a single tarpaulin or cot left in stock.",2018-07-12T22:23:24Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","FEMA Was Sorely Unprepared for Puerto Rico Hurricane, Report Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/us/fema-puerto-rico-maria.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/us/13fema-01/13fema-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,storm,0
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption The aftermath of Storm Tembin on Mindanao island Rescuers are searching for victims of a tropical storm in the southern Philippines, where nearly 200 people have died in mudslides and flash floods. Rescue teams have yet to reach some of the affected areas on Mindanao island. Many people are missing after Storm Tembin, with winds up to 80km/h (50mph), swept through the area. The towns of Tubod and Piagapo were badly hit, while the remote Dalama village was wiped out by flash floods. The storm is now moving west. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was saddened by the loss of life, adding that the UN was ready to help. There are fears the death toll will rise further. Tembin, known as Vinta in the Philippines, started lashing Mindanao on Friday, with a state of emergency declared in some areas including the Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur regions. Regional officials quoted by the Rappler website said there were 127 fatalities in Lanao del Norte, up to 50 in the Zamboanga peninsula and at least 18 in Lanao del Sur. Tubod police officer Gerry Parami told the AFP news agency that there had been at least 19 deaths in the town, which is in Lanao del Norte. Another official told AFP that at least 10 people had died in the town of Piagapo, 10km east of Tubod. A number of homes in the two towns were buried by boulders. Speaking about Dalama, he said ""the river rose and most of the homes were swept away. The village is no longer there"". Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The loss of communications is hampering rescue efforts The official added that volunteers were digging through mud to try to recover bodies in the village. ""We've sent rescuers but they're making little progress,"" Saripada Pacasum said. More deaths were reported in Bukidnon, Iligan and Misamis Occidental. Power cuts and the loss of communications have hampered rescue efforts. Andrew Morris, from the UN children's agency Unicef in Mindanao, said in some areas there were big risks of disease, particularly for children, and restoring clean water supplies would be a priority. ""Lanao del Sur province is the poorest in the Philippines, and in the past seven months there have been around 350,000 people displaced in that province because of fighting,"" he told the BBC, referring to battles between government forces and Islamist militants in Marawi. Meanwhile, Richard Gordon, of the Philippines Red Cross, told the BBC: ""We have already provided water and hot food. ""And we're going to be distributing non-food items - certainly blankets, mosquito nets and certainly hygiene kits for those who are in evacuation centres so that we can alleviate the suffering of many of the folks there."" Storm Tembin made a second landfall on Balabac island in the Palawan archipelago and is forecast to travel west, south of the Spratly Islands, reaching southern Vietnam in about three days. A week ago, Tropical Storm Kai-Tak hit the central Philippines, killing dozens.

MATT STEVENS,"Forecasters said they expect the Florida Panhandle as well as parts of eastern and central Alabama and western Georgia to get between four and eight inches of rain through Tuesday, with some isolated areas getting as much as a foot; they warned that flash flooding was possible in Florida, much of Alabama, and western Georgia. Storm surge in Florida could cause water to rise as high as three feet from the Aucilla River to Mexico Beach, they said. Isolated tornadoes were also possible over parts of Georgia and southeast Alabama. After the exceptionally destructive season last year, forecasters said last week that the possibility of a weak El Niño, along with near-average sea surface temperatures, suggest that this year’s hurricane season will be normal or only slightly more active than average. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s forecasters predicted a 70 percent likelihood of 10 to 16 named storms this year with winds of 39 miles per hour or higher. Hurricane season runs from June 1 until Nov. 1 and peaks from mid-August through late October. Last year, there were 17 named storms, 10 of which became hurricanes ; the first named storm was Arlene — a rare preseason tropical storm that arrived in April. “We’re not expecting the season to be one of the most active on record,” said Gerry Bell, lead hurricane season forecaster with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. But, he added, “It’s time to start getting prepared.”","The storm struck Laguna Beach, Fla., just before 5 p.m. with wind speeds of about 45 m.p.h.

JENNIFER FINNEY BOYLAN,"At first, our family embraced the spectacle with some excitement — school was closed, and the four of us realized we had to depend on ourselves to make it through the storm. We fired up our stoves, chopped wood, moved perishables from the dead refrigerator to the front porch. It was like camping, with furniture. In those days our young sons had a well-established routine for the final couple of hours of the day — after dinner and a bath, they’d watch “Rugrats” on television or a few other shows, including National Geographic’s “Geo Kids,” an educational program featuring a talking galago and a grumpy old chameleon named Uncle Balzac. Now, however, the television was dark, along with the rest of the freezing house. Instead, we read books by candlelight. We played cards. We wore union suits and woolen sweaters and squirrel-fur hats. At one point I invented something called “Human TV,” which involved me sitting in front of the screen as my sons pointed a flashlight at the television, illuminating me. I mounted a live-action version of their evening programs. I was no Uncle Balzac, but I have to admit that there were some moments in “Human TV” that were highly entertaining, not the least of which was my rendition of the chameleon’s song about its changing colors. My sons thought this was more entertaining than the Ringling Bros. circus. In short order they insisted on climbing off the sofa and joining me, leaving my spouse sitting on the couch shining a flashlight on the three of us with a look of fear and wonder. As our second week in the dark began, I saw a line of National Guard trucks rolling into town, and something about it filled me with such an overwhelming sense of our vulnerability, and the fragility of human life, that tears spilled over my eyelashes and ran down my face. On another day, I took Zach to a nearby golf course to go sledding. Just to get to the big hill at the course we had to walk through a frozen archway of trees, and as we did, limbs snapped and fell upon the ice all around us. My son looked at me and said, “Are you sure this is safe?” I didn’t know what to tell him. I wasn’t sure of anything. We climbed to the top of the hill, and we piled into the toboggan. Then we pushed off. I’ll never forget that ride, my arms around my child, the two of us rushing down the hill at a speed that, all these years later, I am willing to admit was probably way too fast. It seemed to last forever, the two of us just gliding. Blinding sunlight reflected off the ice. The frozen air rushed against our cheeks. Whenever I think of my son, now grown and several years out of college, I think of us on that sled. In the wake of the bomb cyclone this week, I fear there will be other families trapped, as we were, in the dark and the cold. I pray that we all make it to the other side of this new storm safe and sound. But I also hope that some people are able, fleetingly, to find what our family found 20 years ago, which was that being cut off from civilization — for a little while, anyway — brought us closer together. When our lights finally came back on, on Day 11, we looked around our house at the almost inconceivable mess it had become during our time in the dark. Dishes were piled high in the sink; the floor was littered with wood chips and dirt. But my son’s first reaction to the restoration of civilization was a look of disappointment. “What?” I said. “Aren’t you glad we have power again?” “Yeah,” Zach said. “But I’m going to miss ‘Human TV.’” That night, we turned off the lamps in the den again, and my sons and I imitated the voices of a galago and a chameleon. My spouse looked on in wonder, shining a light upon us in the dark.

Miriam Kramer,"Day has turned to night for NASA's Opportunity rover on Mars. A huge dust storm that's now 14-million square miles wide, covering a full quarter of the red planet, has blotted out the sun above Perseverance Valley, Opportunity's home. And there's a good chance the hardest-working rover on Mars won't make it through the storm. If you were standing next to the 5-foot-tall rover and looked up into the sky, you wouldn't be able to see the sun. Dust would be whipping around as Opportunity sits on the rusty ground, with all but its mission clock turned off, waiting for the storm to end. SEE ALSO: NASA's Opportunity rover braves huge dust storm on Mars as scientists keep watch Opportunity — which has been exploring the Martian surface for about 15 years — charges itself through solar panels that feed its batteries. Because of the storm, those panels aren't receiving enough sunlight to fully charge up the rover, meaning that it's now trying to save what little power it does have before getting in touch with Earth again. Simulated views of what Opportunity sees during the dust storm. Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/TAMU ""Due to an extreme amount of dust over Perseverance Valley, mission engineers believe it is unlikely the rover has enough sunlight to charge back up for at least the next several days,"" NASA said in a mission update posted last Tuesday night. ""NASA engineers attempted to contact the Opportunity rover today but did not hear back from the nearly 15-year-old rover. The team is now operating under the assumption that the charge in Opportunity's batteries has dipped below 24 volts and the rover has entered low power fault mode, a condition where all subsystems, except a mission clock, are turned off."" The mission clock will trigger the computer to turn back on to check power levels sporadically, NASA said. If the computer finds that power levels are good, it will command the rover to get in touch with engineers back on Earth, but if not, it'll put the rover back to sleep again to wait out the storm. Opportunity has lived an amazing life on Mars. The rover touched down on the red planet with its twin Spirit in January 2004, and the robotic emissaries got to work right away in different parts of the world. Opportunity and Spirit have totally overhauled our understanding of Martian geology, revealing never-before-seen rocky features on Mars. The rovers found evidence of past volcanic activity, water flows, and meteor impacts. Both rovers were only designed to function on Mars for about 90 days, but both outlived that estimate by leaps and bounds. Spirit operational life on Mars ended in 2010, but hopefully its twin will make it through the storm and keep on trucking for years to come.

MARY HUI,"(From 2004 to 2013, Singapore flew the route with the less efficient A340. Rising fuel prices ultimately made that operation uneconomical.) While it may be the longest flight now, 19 hours is nothing compared with some of its predecessors. In 1936, Pan American Airways started the first passenger service between San Francisco and Manila via Honolulu, Midway, Wake Island and Guam. The first leg of that trip alone was originally more than 21 hours. Just eight days after mail service began on that route a year earlier, The Times ran a headline exclaiming, CLIPPER TRIMMED SCHEDULED TIME ; Reached Manila From Alameda in 59 Hours 47 Mins., Instead of 60 Set, Musick Says. Even then, airlines wanted to provide as fast a trip as possible. Their passengers probably would have loved seat-back TVs with video on demand, too. The ability of airlines to deliver fast, direct trips was and is constrained by fuel. As one analyst told The Times when Singapore retired its previous Newark-Singapore flights, ultralong-haul flights like this are essentially flying jet fuel tankers.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","Forget Bad Winter, a season of Boring Winter is upon us. At least, if you live in the Northeast U.S. Head on over to the North Pacific, and its a different story. 
There, a massive winter storm is churning thats been perfectly captured by not one but two satellites. Despite its prodigious size, it has no name. It is just storm. (An unnamed Gizmodo editor said it should be called Oscar.)
Himawari-8, the Japanese satellite centered over the western Pacific, caught the storm as it ramped up while GOES-17, the spiffy new American satellite over the eastern Pacific caught it as it swirled toward North America. From both sides, the storm is absolutely gorgeous. You can see the Himawari-8 image up top, and heres the GOES-17 iteration as it wraps toward Alaskas Aleutian Islands.
Big boys like this bomb out in the North Pacific with some regularity each winter, thanks to sharp gradient of cold air in the Arctic and warm air in the tropics coupled with a potent jet stream. But this sucker is impressive even by North Pacific standards. On Thursday, the storms central pressure bottomed out at 937 millibars, pressure commonly associated with powerful hurricanes (Hurricane Florence hit 939 millibars for comparison). It runs from Alaska to California tip to tail.
The National Weather Service Ocean Prediction Center, which remains in operation despite the shutdown, tweeted that the storm was churning up waves up to 56.7 feet in height in the North Pacific. As it continued its march toward the West Coast, the storm kept its comma-shaped structure that makes it look like a classic noreaster. The storm is one of aparade of low pressure systems is expected to continue into next week, bringing rain and snow to the West Coast as well as the possibility of more meteorological eye candy.","Forget Bad Winter, a season of Boring Winter is upon us.

BEN DOOLEY,"On Friday, Takashi Takano, a member of the new legal team that won Mr. Ghosns release, tried to staunch the media churn.
I was the one who planned and executed the masquerade, he said in a blog post.
Mr. Takano wrote that he sought to shield Mr. Ghosn and his family from media scrutiny. But as a result of my juvenile plan, the reputation he built up over a lifetime was smeared with mud.
Mr. Ghosn, who is credited with rejuvenating Nissan and Renault and forging a cost-sharing partnership, faces charges of misreporting his compensation to regulators. He had been in detention for 108 days.
The legal team had ruled out a news conference after leaving the detention center. Mr. Takano wrote that Mr. Ghosn whose family members have flown to Japan needed privacy. As a term of bail, he is under camera surveillance among other restrictions.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"Without international pressure, a long-term solution is unlikely, and the threat of nuclear war remains.
China is a major ally and lender to Pakistan, and if it stopped blocking moves in the United Nations Security Council to add Mr. Azhar to the United Nations terrorist list, it would signal to Pakistan that it has to curb the militant groups.
While the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations aggressively worked to ensure that India-Pakistan confrontations in 1999, 2002 and 2008 did not spiral put of control, the Trump administration has done little but issue a few statements urging restraint. Its hard to see a role as a mediator for Mr. Trump, who has shifted the United States more firmly against Pakistan and toward India, where he has pursued business interests.
But the United States needs to get involved. It could help India strengthen its counterterrorism capabilities to prevent future attacks, and it could encourage India to modify its approach to those opposing its rule in Kashmir, which the United Nations and other groups say involves widespread human rights abuses that simply spawn more militants. And while its good when India and Pakistan decide to walk back from the brink, as they seem to be doing now, the United States should be ready to assist if they cannot.
A solution to a conflict that touches so many religious and nationalist nerves must ultimately come from within, through talks among India, Pakistan and the people of Kashmir. Its a long shot, and the protagonists have shown no serious interest, but thats the reality nonetheless.
The two countries have crossed into dangerous territory, with India attacking Pakistan and engaging in aerial duels. The next confrontation, or the one after that, could be far more unthinkable.","Tensions have cooled after a terrorist attack, but their nuclear arsenals mean unthinkable consequences are always possible.",2019-03-07T16:00:00Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","With India and Pakistan, a Storm Always Threatens",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/opinion/kashmir-india-pakistan-nuclear.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/07/opinion/07india-edt_sub/07india-edt_sub-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,storm,0

Authorities issued a public health alert for Sydney on Thursday as the 500km-wide (310 miles) dust band began to reach the city. Many regions elsewhere in New South Wales (NSW) have had poor visibility. Authorities said the storm has been driven by strong winds picking dry soil. The problem has been exacerbated by a drought that has affected the entire state of NSW since August, according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.

One resident in Broken Hill, a town 1,100km west of Sydney, said the dust had lingered for hours on Wednesday. ""You walked outside and it was in your eyes and it was just a gritty feeling,"" Matt Whitlum told the BBC. ""The winds were also so strong that you had to hold the car door open or it would just slam back into your face."" Forecasters say it is not yet clear how severely the dust storm will affect Sydney.

 The storm is the second deadliest to hit the Philippines in 2018
More than 60 people have died after a powerful storm struck the Philippines, with locals reportedly taken by surprise by its strength.
Storm Usman hit the Bicol region southeast of capital Manila on Saturday.
At least 17 people are missing and the death toll is expected to rise.
One official told AFP news agency that people did not take precautions as it was not classed as a typhoon under the government's alert system.
""People were overconfident because they were on vacation mode and there was no tropical cyclone warning,"" Bicol civil defence director Claudio Yucot said.
Although the storm did not have strong winds, it brought heavy rains which triggered deadly landslides.
The tropical depression has destroyed infrastructure and displaced more than 40,000 people nationwide.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE and JONATHAN WOLFE,"The snowman was a serious symbol in the Middle Ages, Mr. Eckstein discovered, an early form of pornography or political commentary at a time when most people could not read or write. During the Miracle of 1511, an enormous storm in Brussels, “it snowed, and it was like art supplies dropped on everyone’s doorstep,” he said. Locals sculpted provocative scenes dealing with sex and political angst with the government and the church. These elaborate snow scenes evolved into fine art during the medieval era and later, with the help of Michelangelo (who in 1494 sculpted a snowman for the courtyard of the Medici Palace in Florence), Larkin Meade (who in 1856 created a world-famous snow angel in Vermont) and other artists. (Mr. Eckstein, though, is no fan of Frosty, whom he cites as one reason the art of making snowmen is, in modern times, “not really considered with much respect.”) Now he fears that rising temperatures are putting the very pastime in danger. “The snowman is like the duck-billed platypus of global warming,” he said. He wondered: Will Times Square panhandlers dressed as characters from “Frozen” be among the last snowmen we’ll see in New York City?

During yesterday’s storm, we asked readers for some of their favorite snow day rituals. “A snow day is an excuse for carbs, so put me down as baking. (Hey, shivering burns calories, right?) On the menu: buttermilk pancakes for my husband and later a super fudgy chocolate cake.” — Jean Goldsmith, 65, Westchester, N.Y. “We lived in Pasadena, Calif., before moving to New York City with our small boys. Due to their lack of experience with blizzards, my 4-year-old convinced my 2-year-old to look out the window for falling lizards. After two winters of this ritual, they still haven’t found any.” — Tara Hayward, 34, Park Slope, Brooklyn “My favorite one is sneaking my dog, a 9-year-old Airedale, into the co-op playground so she can jump around and play in the snow. Dog snow angels are the best.” — Pamela Detrow, 65, Washington Heights “Anytime we have gotten a snow day where we can work from home, my roommate and I blast the song “Work From Home” by Fifth Harmony and kick off the day with a 7:30 a.m. dance party. It brings back the type of snow day excitement you had as a kid.” — Emily Roy, 26, Alphabet City, Manhattan “If it’s an overnight storm (because cloud coverage is necessary) I’ll take a 2 or 3 a.m. stroll. The world is quiet, but aglow. The snow on the ground combined with the milky sky produce an eerie night-but-bright feeling that is otherworldly.” — Mark A.

CARLOTTA GALL,"The main reason that Ankara supports a withdrawal of United States forces, said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States, is that it would end support for the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units, or Y.P.G., which Turkey regards as a terrorist group, and would also put paid to the idea of Rojava, a Kurdish-run autonomous territory across northern Syria.
The Y.P.G. is widely seen as the Syrian franchise of the Kurdistan Workers Party, the P.K.K., which has been fighting an insurgency against Turkey since the 1980s and is recognized as a terrorist organization by that country, the United States and the European Union.
If it means an end to American support for the Kurds in Syria, Mr. Unluhisarcikli said, Turkey is even prepared to accept an end to United States air space in eastern Syrian and to lose NATO air and logistical support.
If the alternative is continued cooperation with the Y.P.G., they would want them to leave, he said, describing Turkeys view of the American presence in Syria.
Turkish officials would be likely to disabuse Washington of some of its expectations in the meetings, he added.
America will request Turkeys further cooperation against Daesh, he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. I am not sure Turkey will deliver.
Turkish forces have been mustering for an operation into northeastern Syria, but the Turkish military is intent on dealing with the Kurdish militant threat and does not want to extend more than 15 to 20 kilometers, roughly 10 miles, into Syria, Mr. Unluhisarcikli said.",The storm around the U.S. national security adviser’s visit to Turkey showed how far apart the countries are on how to handle an American withdrawal from Syria.,2019-01-08T14:15:22Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Erdogan Snubs Bolton Over Comments That Turkey Must Protect Kurds,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/world/middleeast/erdogan-bolton-turkey-syria-kurds.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/08/world/08TUrkey-Bolton1/08TUrkey-Bolton1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,storm,0
MITCH SMITH,"CHICAGO Severe floods closed highways, caused evacuations and forced a series of tense water rescues across the Midwest on Thursday as melting snow and heavy rain created dangerous conditions.
If you choose to stay where youre at, youre on your own, said Shane Weidner, the public safety director in Norfolk, Neb., where a levee system was nearing capacity and police officers had told about one-third of the citys 24,000 residents to evacuate.
Mr. Weidner said one person was reported missing in Norfolk and a family of 10 was stranded in a home surrounded by rising waters. City officials were asking residents with airboats for their help in rescuing the family. Elsewhere in Nebraska, state officials said at least one person had died. Search and rescue teams were trying to reach others who were trapped.
Across parts of Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa, rising water was threatening homes and covering farm fields, and the authorities warned people to stay off swamped roadways. In Minnehaha County, S.D., which includes Sioux Falls, the sheriffs office posted a photo of a car washed off the road. In Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, near Sioux City, residents were asked to conserve their water use because all the draining water is inundating our sewer system.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP/getty Image caption Power has been now been restored at the site, and rescue hoists have begun A rescue operation is underway to release 955 workers from a gold mine in South Africa after a power cut left them trapped. A spokesman for the mine's operating company said on Friday morning that power had been restored to a lift to release them. The miners have been trapped underground since Wednesday night. South Africa is a leading gold producer, but safety in the industry is often questioned. The Beatrix mine is in Welkom town, about 290km (180 miles) south-west of Johannesburg. It is owned by Sibanye-Stillwater mining firm. It has 23 levels, going down to 1,000 metres (3,280 ft) below ground. Rescued workmen are expected to get taken for food and showers upon their release, before having medical health checks. A reporter for the AFP news agency said several ambulances arrived overnight at the site. Company spokesman James Wellsted said there was ""no indication so far that anyone has been in distress"", but that counselling has been made available to the workers and their families. On Thursday he said water and food supplies had been able to reach the miners, but engineers were struggling to get emergency generators operating. The power outage is believed to have been caused after a storm knocked over an electricity pylon close to the site. Trade union officials had said they feared that the lives of the miners were at risk.

MITCH SMITH and JOHN ELIGON,"If there is ever a weekend to stay in and binge-watch something, this may be it, said Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey, who declared a state of emergency starting at noon Saturday.
Some people were able to find a silver lining amid the storm.
As Jennifer Hartwell was in mid-flight from Austin to Detroit on Friday evening, she saw that her connecting flight to Indianapolis had been delayed to 6 a.m. Saturday. She texted her husband from the plane to book a rental car, and then asked a flight attendant to see if there were other passengers who wanted to take the four-hour road trip with her.
Three other passengers took her up. One of them had been racing to get home because of a death in the family, and would have missed a memorial service if she had waited for the 6 a.m. flight, said Dr. Hartwell, a trauma surgeon.

Jessica Conditt,"Today, he's the narrative director at Deck Nine, the house behind Life is Strange: Before the Storm, and he carries lessons from 38 with him. ""I remember meeting all the guys and gals at 38 Studios and just really seeing a synchrony there, and recognizing that these guys absolutely love making games,"" Garriss said. ""That's beautiful, that's so cool, we're gonna kill it. And what we learned was, that's not the totality of how the sausage gets made."" Garriss has fond memories of 38 Studios. The team there was special -- they were engaged, communicative and passionate. Still, despite successfully shipping a rich fantasy game and producing plans for two other titles, they all lost their jobs just months after launch. Though the business aspect of 38 Studios was ill-managed, Garriss said its daily development routine was solid. Innovative, even. ""That's not the totality of how the sausage gets made."" ""I think what I learned there built a foundation for who I am as a game developer,"" Garriss said. ""I got to work with some extraordinarily talented people. And part of the ethos, I think, that was particularly unique was this kind of self-production design approach where we, as writers and designers, we really sought to understand our full production pipeline and write with an eye toward the scope."" This isn't how it always works at AAA studios. With hundreds of developers contributing to a single game, teams are often segmented, focusing on individual slices of the project without keeping the bigger picture in mind. It's easier at independent studios, where just a handful of developers are responsible for the entire game and it's easier for everyone to be aware of the complete pipeline. However, plenty of indie developers are still wary of the business side of game development, Garriss said. He attended a roundtable at GDC last week about shoestring indie development, and he noticed a trend among some developers. ""What I saw a lot of was this ideological imposition of a binary that I don't think is actually true,"" he said. ""Which is, you love the thing you're working on, or you can sell out and make money working in a studio or just working for the man."" Indie developers often view creating a game as a noble, pure undertaking, just like producing any other form of art. Meanwhile, marketing and business dealings are seen as evil tools of soulless corporations. This simply isn't true, according to Garriss. ""For Before the Storm particularly, it really became clear to me that marketing and PR serves a really positive role if you believe in the game you're making,"" he said. ""Marketing is about getting people to play it. Introducing it to people. That experience -- everything you just put your heart and soul into, marketing is about actually trying to earn a chance for someone to give it a shot."" ""Marketing and PR serves a really positive role if you believe in the game you're making."" Garriss saw the full effect of major-studio marketing plans with Before the Storm. It was published by Square Enix, a powerhouse in the video game industry, and it benefited from a multitude of advertisements, social media campaigns and special-edition bonuses. It helped that Before the Storm was a quality slice of video game goodness, telling a powerful coming-of-age story in a newly established, beloved franchise. Under Garriss' narrative leadership, the Deck Nine team kept its eye on the end goal, constantly considering the game's complete development pipeline with every word they wrote. On top of that, they listened to everyone's ideas and didn't hesitate to challenge each other's creative decisions. They weren't afraid to fight -- respectfully. ""I've worked in a lot of different writers' rooms where this sort of mentality wasn't necessarily embraced,"" Garriss said. ""When I was recruiting and building the room for Before the Storm, I think I found myself really drawn to these individuals who had a lot of awesome humility about them. Just as much passion as writers as anybody I've met, but a willingness to sort of be proven wrong, or advocate for their ideas at the same time."" The results of this approach -- honed by years of business and creative experience in the video game industry -- speak for themselves. Before the Storm was a hit and it's set Deck Nine up nicely for the future. Garriss won't talk about the studio's next plans, but he's enthusiastic about what's to come. ""I'm super excited,"" he said. "" Before the Storm has done wonderfully well. Everyone at Deck Nine is just very excited about next steps, and we're all super excited to see what Deck Nine is going to do next.""","Passion doesn't equate success. It's a hard lesson to learn in any industry -- no matter how dedicated your team is, regardless of how invested they are financially or emotionally, the entire business could burst into flames at any moment.

 Pabuk was the region's worst storm in 30 years
Thousands of people in southern Thailand are emerging from shelter after the region's worst storm in 30 years passed into the Andaman Sea.
Storm Pabuk left Thailand at about midnight GMT on Friday after causing widespread flooding and blackouts. One fisherman died and one is missing.
The main tourist islands such as Koh Samui were spared the worst.
Flights and ferries are now resuming but tourists face delays due to a backlog of services.
The latest information on Tropical Storm Pabuk puts its peak wind speed at about 65km/h (40mph).
It passed over the coast of eastern Thailand near the island of Ko Phra Thong at 07:00 local time on Saturday (00:00 GMT), heading towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
It left behind a swathe of downed power cables and forced some 30,000 people into evacuation shelters.
Warnings of flash floods are still in force.
The fisherman died when his boat capsized early on Friday in southern Pattani province, with another crew member still missing.
There are unconfirmed reports a man also died when a tree hit his home in Nakhon Si Thammarat.
The main tourist islands of Koh Samui, Koh Phangan and Koh Tao were spared the full force of the winds and rain.
Koh Samui district chief Kittipop Roddon said: ""There were no casualties, there is some sunshine today and I'm confident some tourists will be able to leave.""
Koh Phangan district chief Krikkrai Songthanee said: ""It's all over. All 10,000 tourists are safe... I am relieved.""
Thousands of tourists had left before the storm it.
Media captionPabuk is the worst storm in decades to hit during the peak holiday season
Airports and ferry services, closed during the storm, are reopening although some ""red flag"" bans on swimming were still in force.
Koh Samui, Nakhon Si Thammarat and Surat Thani airports were resuming operations, with some extra flights allocated but travellers could still face delays.
Pabuk made landfall on Friday afternoon in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, leaving about 200,000 people without electricity. Some 30,000 had not been reconnected by Saturday.
One resident of Talum Puk, Boonchuay Chuaysri, told Agence France-Presse: ""The roofs on some rooms in my house are gone. The house is filled with mud.""

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Roads turned to rivers across Houston as Harvey hit Scientists have weighed the water that fell on Texas during the record-breaking Hurricane Harvey in August. They calculate, by measuring how much the Earth was compressed, that the Category 4 storm dropped 127 billion tonnes, or 34 trillion gallons. ""One person asked me how many stadia is that. It's 26,000 New Orleans Superdomes,"" said Adrian Borsa from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. His numbers were released as other scientists stated that the summer's big hurricanes had a clear human influence. Harvey, Irma and Maria ripped through the US Gulf states and the Caribbean, leading to widespread flooding and wind damage. Researchers told the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union here in New Orleans that the heavy rainfall seen in Harvey was very likely exacerbated by the extra warming associated with increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Sea surface temperatures were particularly high in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico this hurricane season. Warm ocean water acts as a fuel for the storms. Media caption The BBC's James Cook found a scene of devastation in Rockport Harvey devastated parts of the Texas coastline because it stalled, concentrating its deluge in a very narrow region. It was one of the heaviest precipitation events in recorded hurricane history. Standard rain gauges recorded upwards of 1,270mm (50 inches) of precipitation in places. But these were point measurements and Dr Borsa attempted to get a much broader view by measuring how much the Earth moved in response to the weight of overlying water. This was detected by a network of high-precision GPS stations. ""It's like you sitting down on a mattress - it depresses; you stand up and it rebounds. The Earth behaves very similarly, like a rubber block. So the Earth is recording the effects of the loads acting on its surface."" The GPS network is dense enough that a broad picture of activity can be discerned. ""It gives us a holistic view, not just point measurements,” Dr Borsa told BBC News. What is smart is that the system can see the immediate change as water runs off the land through rivers, but also captures the much slower effect of water removal through evaporation, driven by the warmth of the Sun. This takes several weeks. ""One of the big deficiencies in our models is that evapotranspiration - that's the Sun and plants doing their things - is not currently directly observed, and it's half of the total water budget. I think this GPS is going to be able to provide very useful information about this."" At the same annual scientific gathering, the American Meteorological Association revealed that its annual report on extreme weather events had identified three that would “not have been not possible” without the influence of human-induced climate change. These were: the record-breaking global temperatures in 2016; the 2016 heat wave across Asia and the high ocean temperatures measured off the coast of Alaska. These were events that happened because “we have created a new climate,” said National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) climate scientist Stephanie Herring. The report also concluded that other heat waves around the world were made more intense by climate change and that Arctic warming was “most likely” not possible without it. The coral bleaching event in the Great Barrier Reef and other marine ecosystems in the Pacific Ocean were also amplified by “human-caused warming of the ocean”. The research is primarily based on comparing models, or simulations, of our climate. “We run a model that shows what the world looks like today and we can validate those models against what is actually happening,” explained Dr Herring. “Then we compare it to a model of an ‘alternative world’ in which - theoretically - climate change never happened. As if humans didn’t emit greenhouse gases since the industrial revolution. “So we can look at a world with climate change and a world without it.”",Scientists established how much rain fell by measuring how much the Earth compressed during the storm.,2017-12-14T00:57:26Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Hurricane Harvey rainfall 'weighed 127bn tonnes',http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-42347510,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p05dh54p.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,storm,1

The storm smashed into the state's north-west coast near the community of Mexico Beach on Wednesday afternoon packing 155mph (250km/h) winds. Over 1.4m homes had no power in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia and the Carolinas on Friday morning. One of the most powerful hurricanes in US history, Michael has now killed at least 11 people. Rescuers are still searching for survivors. The storm, which fell just 2mph short of a top-level category five, ripped apart entire neighbourhoods, reducing properties to kindling and rubble. Michael's shrieking winds and surging seas knocked row after row of Mexico Beach beachfront homes from their foundations. Image copyright AFP Image caption US Coast Guard photo of Mexico Beach, Florida Gone with the wind By Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Mexico Beach, Florida One of the first things you notice as you walk into Mexico Beach is the stillness. No wind, almost no-one on the street, just the beating hot sun and the debris: debris everywhere, tossed and scattered - the calling card of a monstrous storm. And then you hear faint bleeping sounds coming from all directions - a dissonant symphony of high-pitched notes that turn out to be myriad small alarms, still transmitting their warnings from the batteries which power them. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Much of the damage in Mexico Beach, Florida was caused by the over-100mph winds. On the left, as we walk, there's a mattress slumped at the roadside, on the right a Dean Koontz novel lies in the dirt. Picking our way through a mass of rubble and detritus that was once a house, we spot an American flag on the ground; in amongst it all there is also a toy car and a cracked glass plate from a microwave. A little further on, and a woman, accompanied by a friend, is sifting through the remains of her home, loading what she can salvage into the boot of a car. This was her dream retirement place she tells me - the last four years spent doing it up. ""I'll never step back in there,"" she says through her tears. The sheer force of Hurricane Michael has been well analysed, but it's only when you see the everyday stuff of people's lives crushed, broken, smashed to pieces, that you realise they will be living with this long after we have gone. One weeping resident on CNN struggled to even find her street, let alone her home. Tom Bailey, the town's former mayor, told the New York Times: ""The mother of all bombs doesn't do any more damage than this."" The storm was so powerful that it snapped boats in two and knocked over 30-ton freight rail cars like toys. Some 285 people in Mexico Beach - population 1,000 - defied a mandatory evacuation order and stayed behind to ride out the storm. Linda Marquardt, 67, who hunkered down with her husband, told AP news agency: ""All of my furniture was floating. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A man in Mexico Beach, Florida walks past a home that was knocked from its foundation ""A river just started coming down the road.

By early Friday morning, the storm was about 65 miles (105km) northeast of Norfolk, Virginia, with winds of 60mph, said the US National Hurricane Center. Motorists had to be rescued on Thursday from cars trapped by high water in North Carolina, a state still reeling from last month's Hurricane Florence.

""We prepare for the worst and hope for the best. This is obviously the worst,"" Stephanie Palmer, a Fema firefighter, told Reuters news agency.

Mayor Bo Patterson said: ""We had houses that were on one side of the street and now they're on the other."" Image copyright Getty Images The number of people in emergency shelters was expected to reach 20,000 across five states by Friday, said the American Red Cross. The 11 known dead so far are one in North Carolina, one in Georgia, four in Florida and five in Virginia. A 38-year-old motorist in North Carolina was killed when a tree fell on his car on a highway east of Statesville. Eleven-year-old Sarah Radney, who was visiting her grandparents in Seminole County, Georgia, died when a metal carport near their home was lifted by powerful winds and then slammed through their roof. Four people were killed in Florida's Gadsden County in storm-related deaths. One of the dead there was identified by local officials as Steven Sweet, 44, who was killed when a tree fell on his home. On Friday, police in Virginia confirmed five deaths related to the storm. Among the dead in that state was James King,45, killed after his vehicle was caught in flash flood water in Pittsylvania County. The waters were too deep and swift for rescuers to reach him, officials say. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.

 A researcher from the Center for Severe Weather Research monitors a thunderstorm in Texas
For a few brief seconds, the rain stopped pummelling the front windscreen of the storm chasers' truck.
Not that the weather was clearing - Kelley Gene Williamson and Randall Yarnall were heading northbound directly towards the storm. At the time, on 28 March 2017, they were covering the event for the Weather Channel programme Storm Wranglers.
As they neared a junction a few miles outside Spur, Texas, a bright red Stop sign came into view on the right-hand side of the road.
Yarnall was driving his Chevrolet truck at about 70mph (113km/h) at the time, according to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday. A video the friends were live-streaming for the Weather Channel's Facebook page showed they made no attempt to stop at the junction.
The footage cut out a split second before a Jeep driven by Corbin Jaeger drove westbound into the junction. Jaeger, who had the right of way, was driving away from the storm.
Williamson, Yarnall and Jaeger - a respected storm chaser working for the National Weather Service - were all killed on the spot.
The lawsuit, filed by Jaeger's mother, seeks up to $125m (£95m) in damages. It puts the blame firmly at the door of Williamson and Yarnall, whom it calls ""habitually reckless and dangerous"", as well as the Weather Channel.
The lawsuit also alleges that the network's ""concept of presenting storm chasing as an adventurous, thrilling sporting event and to make its two stars 'heroes'"" caused her son's death.
The official history of tornado forecasting began in Oklahoma City in a rather informal fashion.
When a tornado ploughed through Tinker Air Force Base on 20 March 1948, it was the costliest in Oklahoma's history. It destroyed 32 military planes, tossing them across the runway with recorded wind speeds of 78mph (126km/h).
An investigation was launched, and Major Ernest Fawbush and Captain Robert Miller began compiling weather data from before and after the storm - only to realise just five days later that conditions were worryingly similar to those of 20 March.
The base issued the first ever official tornado forecast. Men found cover and aircraft were put away into hangars, before another storm of similar intensity passed through.

Within just a few years, the Severe Local Storm Warning Center was created to predict storms, based in part on Fawbush and Miller's indicators.
But even then, predictions remained unreliable. Forecasters were often wary to announce storms for fear of causing panic or making people complacent if the storms did not appear. It was only through adopting computers in the 1960s that forecasters' work became more reliable, and as the science of storm prediction became more accurate, storm chasing soon developed into a phenomenon.
David Hoadley is credited as being the father of the pursuit. After a thunderstorm tore through his hometown of Bismarck, North Dakota, in 1956, he began studying and tracking extreme weather across the US.
In a magazine interview, Hoadley described setting off alone to see his first major tornado, driving against a wave of fleeing traffic near Dodge City, Kansas, in 1965.
""It was a moment I'll always remember - the police radio; the patrolman describing some unreal, hypnotic event; the ghostly sirens moaning in the wind; and that classic cone tornado, so close and deceptively graceful as it descended to create a moment of history in the life of a small town.""
In the 1970s, the National Weather Service (NWS) created the Skywarn programme to train storm spotters. After a two-hour training course, volunteers around the country provide reports on dangerous weather and their main responsibility is to inform the service about severe local storms. 
The NWS says there are now about 400,000 trained weather spotters across the US, and while not all chase tornadoes, there has been an anecdotal rise over the past 25 years in the number of people turning out to follow storms. Storm chasers tend to put this down to one event: the release of the film Twister in 1996.
The film, starring Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt, profiles a team of principled but poorly-funded tornado chasers competing against richer rivals. One meteorologist reported that applications to study meteorology jumped 47% in the years after the film was released. 
During the peak tornado season, typically from April to June, hundreds of storm chasers can gather in parts of the Great Plains in the US, especially in states like Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas.
There are now even tour operators who take groups out to chase storms throughout Tornado Alley - a vertical belt across the US where the storms usually form.
But despite the risks of tailing a violent and unpredictable weather system, the first deaths of storm chasers directly attributed to a tornado itself were in 2013.
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 Oklahoma is one of the states most prone to deadly tornadoes, like this one in 2011
Early in the evening of 31 May that year, a violent weather system produced eight tornadoes near Oklahoma City in a little more than two hours. One proved much more damaging than the others.
The tornado that struck near the town of El Reno was the largest ever recorded - stretching across 2.6 miles (4.2 km) and carrying winds of up to 302mph. The tornado and associated flooding killed 22 people, including four storm chasers.
Three of those were experienced, and known to be responsible, but were caught out when the tornado accelerated and suddenly changed direction. The fourth victim was a local inexperienced storm chaser who drove directly into the tornado's path.
They weren't the only ones around that day. An animation produced by one weather watcher showed how many registered storm chasers were in the path of the tornado as it struck.
Most storm chaser deaths - seven - have been in car accidents, and all but one of those have occurred since 2005.
Even before the fatal collision in Texas in 2017, one meteorologist and storm spotter of 45 years, Charles Doswell, had warned of the risks some chasers were taking while driving after he witnessed the aftermath of one collision.
In a follow-up blog post written after Williamson, Yarnall and Jaeger's deaths, Doswell said he was increasingly concerned about ""chaser hordes"" who were obsessed with getting as close as possible to tornadoes, rather than observing from a safe distance.
""The so-called 'chase community' (which really isn't a 'community' at all, but rather a group of people with a shared hobby) needs to take a long look at their behaviour during their chase activities,"" he wrote. ""If someone has done some irresponsible driving in the past, this might be a good time to resolve to discontinue such practices for good...
""The time is long overdue to get serious about ceasing illegal and unsafe driving during a storm chase [or any other time, for that matter!]. No one gets a free pass on the roads, and this includes people chasing for TV.""
The Weather Channel is not alone in broadcasting thrilling documentaries chronicling the lives of storm chasers: the Discovery Channel, National Geographic and the BBC, among many others, have done so too.
But the lawsuit against the Weather Channel alleges that the network had been warned by other storm chasers about Williamson and Yarnall's ""history of reckless driving"". It also says that their failure to stop at the junction where the collision occurred was their fourth traffic violation that day.
""Instead of using meteorologists experienced in the tracking of tornadoes,"" the lawsuit says, the Weather Channel ""knowingly chose two chicken farmers and cattle ranchers from Missouri without any emergency/first responder or meteorological training to star in their show.
""TWC then instructed them to barrel into dangerous weather conditions to obtain footage, needlessly endangering local residents fleeing impending catastrophe.""
The channel told the BBC it could not comment on pending litigation.

Meteorologists and storm chasers appear split over whether televised storm chasing is increasing risks to people on the ground, and whether those live-streaming tornadoes for television are providing a valuable service or not.
Jeff Frame, of the University of Illinois' Department of Atmospheric Sciences, says forecasters often watch live streams to understand a storm's changes in real time. Images distributed from the scene on social media are often ""extremely helpful"" for those who need to issue warnings, he adds.
But meteorologist Ryan Maue says he could see ""no net benefit to live storm chasing on TV"" and that ""the risk to chase the storms may outweigh the arguably minimal extra information provided"" to forecasters.
Tour operators say they warn groups about the dangers of what Kim George at Tempest Tours calls ""citizen chasers"", which she says is ""a greater issue every year"".
""When you have too many people going down the same roads it can be difficult to stop and move off the road,"" she says. ""We have a radar that shows where most of the chasers are converging and we avoid those areas.""
A spokesperson for Cloud 9 Tours agrees, advising people ""to look both ways before crossing the road - even if it's a one-way road"". 
""Other chasers may be focused on the storm and not watching the road ahead of them.""
For Dr Frame, who will take a group of students to the Great Plains in May and June, the number of people storm chasing is not the problem - this has remained fairly constant since the mid-2000s, he says.
The bigger problem, according to Dr Frame, is bad driving from chasers who are either distracted by the storm, do not park far enough off the road to keep it clear, or who do not rest sufficiently before chasing.
""I would say it is a few bad apples,"" he says. ""Most storm chasers are safe.""
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 The aftermath of a 2013 tornado in Moore, Oklahoma, where 24 people were killed
Captain Paul Timmons agrees. He has worked for the Oklahoma Highway patrol for three decades and he says chasers typically don't cause problems on the roads.
""It kind of depends on the season,"" he says. ""There are some people who go out storm chasing just to get a closer view of a tornado or a hail storm, and they end up having to ride it out.""
""Leave it to the professionals,"" he advises. 
Dr Frame also says that problems are likely to occur among inexperienced chasers who are more likely to panic when they find themselves trapped by a storm that changes direction suddenly. Inexperienced chasers should look to buddy up with someone who better understands storm systems, he says. 
Controlling crowds of enthusiasts is not the answer, Ryan Maue says: simple good, sensible behaviour is.
""Special laws are not required in the US to regulate storm chasing,"" he says. ""The activity is entirely legal as long as one adheres to appropriate traffic laws, stays in a safe position with respect to the storm, and does not waste the time of emergency responders by blocking roads. 
""Common sense goes a long way and this tragedy in Texas could have easily been prevented.""",A lawsuit claims reckless behaviour by storm chasers before a fatal crash.

 Bollywood actress Esha Gupta says she too has been the victim of discrimination
Up until Monday, Esha Gupta was just a Bollywood actress with a passion for Arsenal football club.
That changed after she decided to share a screengrab of a WhatsApp conversation in which a friend mocked the team's Nigerian star, Alex Iwobi, as a ""gorilla"" and ""Neanderthal"" who ""evolution had stopped for"".
""Hahaha,"" she wrote, as she shared the screengrab with her 3.4m Instagram followers.
The racist slurs - and the fact she thought it was funny - horrified many, and the backlash was unsurprisingly swift. How dare she call herself an Arsenal supporter, her fellow fans demanded.
Gupta apologised quickly, but the post hints at a long-known - but little acknowledged - problem of racism towards people of African descent in Indian society.
Victims or perpetrators?
""Of course I'm not surprised by the post,"" Ezeugo Nnamdi told the BBC from Delhi, his home of five years. 
In fact, the secretary-general of the Association of African Students in India (AASI) added that, as racial slurs go, her words were no worse than what fellow African students experienced on a daily basis - to their faces.
""Racism is not something which is very hidden here. It is something very open,"" he said. ""People just look at you. 
""They call you 'habshi' [a derogatory term], and a lot of other words and racial slurs.
""Here, you are regarded as a cannibal.""
Image copyrightReutersImage caption
 Alex Iwobi, an Arsenal player, was called a ""gorilla"" in the messages
You don't have to look far to see examples of prejudice towards people of African descent in India: just look at how Bollywood treats its black characters.
Take, for example, the award-winning 2008 film Fashion, which told the tale of an aspiring model - played by Quantico actress Priyanka Chopra - who is caught in a downward spiral of drink and drugs. 
But the moment she realises she has truly hit rock bottom is when she wakes up beside a black man. According to Dhruva Balram, the racial undertones of her realisation were clear.
""For Bollywood, as an aspiring model, the worst thing you can do is position yourself sexually next to a black person,"" she argued in an article for Media Diversified.
The article immediately resonated with Kadisha Phillips, an African-American New Yorker who spent a month in Bollywood during her degree. The racism she experienced left its mark - whether being ignored in a restaurant, or blocked from entering the school's campus by one of the guards.
Read more:
""I could tell it was because of the colour of our skin,"" she recalled. ""It was just easy to notice.""
So were Gupta's messages just another example of the everyday racism experienced by black people in India?
It is fair to say the furore which surrounded the Instagram post failed to make as big a splash in India as it did in other parts of the world.
But why? That could be down to the fact it takes a more shocking incident to become a talking point.
It was one such incident back in 2016 - when a young Tanzanian woman was beaten and stripped by an angry mob - which inspired photographer Mahesh Shantaram to take a fresh look at his own country.
Image copyrightGetty ImagesImage caption
 Endurance Amalawa was attacked by an angry mob in 2017
What he found, after spending months travelling around his own city, and then the country, meeting, speaking with and photographing black Africans, left him shocked. 
""I was hearing things for the first time,"" he said. ""Imagine someone telling you stories about your country that you think you know very well, but they tell you a very different story.""
In many cases, he found, just having black skin meant you were already ""deemed guilty"" in the eyes of your neighbours.
The result? Innocent Africans like Endurance Amalawa, who was beaten by a mob as he made his way through a mall near Delhi in March 2017. The attack followed the fatal drug overdose of an Indian teenager. At the time, the teen's death was blamed on ""Nigerian drug dealers"".
""We like to think of ourselves as the victims of racism, but there is not an understanding that we are also perpetrators of racism,"" Shantaram told the BBC.
But it is not just black people who find themselves being judged for the colour of their skin in India. Darker skinned Indians also find themselves struggling against prejudice.
Perhaps ironically, Gupta had experience of this herself. The actress opened up about the discrimination she felt back in 2017. 
""I am proud of the way I look,"" she told the Times of India. ""In Europe, brown skin is celebrated. In India, I have to face discrimination for my complexion. 
""It's sheer hypocrisy. I am made to feel bad about the way I look when 90% girls in India look like me.""
Image copyrightTwitter/@sheagupta2811
This colourism - where people with darker skin are discriminated against by those within their own race - has not gone unnoticed by the black people who live or travel in India.
""It is just the way the system is - it is institutional,"" says Nnamdi, who is originally from Nigeria, but who now thinks of himself as pan-African.
But attempts to get Indians to join in with a social media campaign against skin colour discrimination back in 2017 were largely unsuccessful, prompting Nnamdi and his colleagues in the AASI to try a different tact.
""We decided that we would not play victims to the system - we are going to change the narrative,"" he explained. ""We want to project more positivity and engage more with the community.""
It is starting to pay off, Nnamdi believes. But what he would really like to see are laws that would mean people were punished for spreading racial hatred. Gupta's apology, he argues, probably isn't enough.
""For such statements, there should be punishments - it should cost you something so you can learn from it.""
Even without laws though, Shantaram believes change is happening, albeit slowly. Meanwhile, he has received funding to create a book of his photographs, where he will be able to share the stories he has heard from Africans living in India.
However, he stresses, ""it is not about the plight of Africans in India"". Instead, the book will shine a light on a part of India too often brushed under the rug.",Bollywood actress Esha Gupta found herself at the centre of a storm over racism after posting a Whatsapp chat.,2019-02-01T00:07:00Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Esha Gupta: Has Instagram exposed everyday racism in India?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-47042681,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/26D4/production/_105404990_35545efb-0c09-47c4-8953-f767d5e4a435.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,storm,0

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by AJ Dellinger to Gizmodo","Just an extremely normal radar loop of a tropical cyclone over Indiana. GIF: National Weather Service The early start to hurricane season continues with what could be the first landfalling tropical cyclone to make it to Lake Michigan on record. Tropical Depression Alberto has been the weird storm that could, improbably moving from the Gulf of Mexico to Indiana. The last advisory the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued for the storm, which came at 4 p.m. Central Time, noted that flash flood watches associated with the storm extend across the Appalachians from Georgia to Virginia. The storm already triggered flooding in North Carolina earlier on Wednesday. But the real weird part is where Alberto is centered, 70 miles south of South Bend, Indiana where the outer bands are already bringing rain to the city. South Bend itself is about 25 miles southeast of Lake Michigan, and the storm’s current track could clip or even make it all the way to the lake. That would make Alberto the first tropical system to ever hit Lake Michigan’s shores (h/t hurricane expert Brian McNoldy ). Beyond Lake Michigan, only seven tropical systems have ever made it to the Great Lakes according to data on historical hurricane tracks maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. All have struck Lakes Huron, Erie or Ontario, the three easternmost lakes. Of the tropical systems that have made it that far north, three even managed to hit the lakes as full blown hurricanes. In comparison, Alberto is quite a bit weaker. It’s currently a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph. But its present status just adds to Alberto’s strange tale. The storm has been a meteorological oddity since its inception in the Gulf of Mexico. It spun up there as a subtropical storm, borrowing elements from tropical weather like hurricanes and extratropical weather like nor’easters. The storm made landfall along the Gulf Coast over the weekend in its subtropical form. But rather than petering out or going full extratropical, the storm made a bizarre transition to a tropical system over land. On Tuesday, the NHC began calling the storm Tropical Depression Alberto. Since then, it has chugged through the Midwest with heavy rain bands swirling around its center. The storm could be maintaining its tropical nature through “brown ocean effect,” a gross-sounding meteorological phenomenon where waterlogged soil can mimic the ocean and provide fuel to storms (Marshall Shepherd, the atmospheric scientist who helped coin the term, has a great primer on it if you want to geek out). Regardless of whether it makes landfall ( or is it waterfall ?) on the shores of Lake Michigan, Alberto has been a whacky kickoff to hurricane season.",The early start to hurricane season continues with what could be the first landfalling tropical cyclone to make it to Lake Michigan on record.

Andrew Freedman,"A major developing storm is taking shape along the Mid-Atlantic coast, and it's proving to be quite the illusionist. Residents of New York City woke up to a mixture of light rain and snow, and questioned whether the storm forecast was a ""bust."" But computer model guidance has been consistent in showing extremely heavy snowfall moving into the Philadelphia metro area, northern New Jersey, New York City, and then up into Connecticut and Massachusetts beginning Wednesday afternoon. This will occur as the storm ""bombs out,"" or undergoes the process of rapid intensification known as bombogenesis. SEE ALSO: What is bombogenesis? In other words, the storm's effects as of Wednesday morning are not WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), to use an old school internet term. Instead, it's trying to lure folks into a false sense of complacency, draw them into work or school, and then make the evening commute impossible. Model projections, for example, show an unusually strong signal for thundersnow across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast associated with this storm. In meteorologist-speak, this storm has strong dynamics associated with it. In normal person vernacular, that means this storm means business, and will bring surprisingly heavy rates of snowfall once it gets going in earnest by early to mid-afternoon in the big cities. The snowfall forecast has been a major challenge, particularly in New York and Boston, where relatively mild air from the ocean could keep snow from sticking or turn precipitation over to rain for a time. However, dynamical cooling from strong lifting of the air aloft and heavy precipitation dragging down cooler air from above should overcome milder temperatures in most areas. That happened in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday night, when rain suddenly switched over to big, fat flakes of snow and stinging sleet accompanied by thunder. Consider, though, the snowfall forecast for New York, where media outlets and the Weather Service are expecting a big difference in accumulations between JFK International Airport in Queens, which is right on the ocean, and Central Park. The Weather Channel, for example, has been predicting 12 to 18 inches will fall in Central Park, while just about 6 inches will fall at JFK, which is located only about 15 miles. Finally, here is a huge warning sign for later. This morning we are seeing significant CAPE values and convective lifting in the mid levels. If this translates this afternoon in precipitation rates, you have 3""+ snowfalls over these regions. pic.twitter.com/EdbhA9KDdw — NY NJ PA Weather (@nynjpaweather) March 7, 2018 The fact that forecasters can now zero in on transition zones with such precision is an example of how far meteorology, aided by powerful computing technology, has come in recent years. However, poor communication of large forecast ranges has led to some media headlines that ruffled feathers in the meteorology community, since large ranges in forecast accumulations is not the same as saying ""we just don't know."" The storm presents a major communications challenge for weather forecasters to make clear that the evening commute in major cities could be downright impossible due to heavy snowfall rates. During past storms, New York City has ground to a sudden halt once snowfall rates reached 2 to 3 inches per hour for even just a couple of hours, putting lives in danger and complicating commutes of all kinds. Similar events in Washington, D.C. have proven that storms involving a benign morning commute followed by a harrowing evening commute can result in stuck cars and commuters overnight. New York City's public schools remained open on Wednesday, for example, suggesting that the authorities may have underestimated the storm's potential to cause havoc. ⚠️ NYC Public Schools will be open tomorrow, Wednesday, March 7, 2018. Afterschool programs will continue as planned. Field trips using yellow bus service will be cancelled. https://t.co/6IAR8fbZYB — NYC Public Schools (@NYCSchools) March 6, 2018 This storm is striking New England right on the heels of an even stronger and slower-moving storm that battered the region beginning on March 1. Coastal flooding from that storm caused serious damage in eastern Massachusetts, including breaching seawalls, weakening coastal homes, and flooding numerous homes and businesses. While this storm won't be as bad, coastal flood warnings are in effect for eastern Massachusetts, as strong onshore winds will ensure that a remarkably prolonged period of flooding continues. In addition, thousands of people still don't have their power back after the previous storm, either, and this event will bring even more wet snow that could take out trees and power lines. This could extend power outages — particularly in inland areas that pick up the most snow — from days to more than a week. This is a developing storm and story.

Mark Kaufman,"Hurricane Lane, which is currently bearing down on Hawaii, is ""not a well behaved storm,"" according to the state's governor David Ige. Spinning in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the hurricane has grown into a monstrous Category 5 storm, the most powerful type of hurricane with winds now reaching 160 mph. Tuesday evening, the National Hurricane Center called the cyclone ""an impressive hurricane,"" and forecast that the storm will ""move dangerously close to the main Hawaiian Islands as a hurricane Thursday through Saturday."" SEE ALSO: Why Trump's EPA wants to kill the nation's most ambitious climate change plan Hawaii's residents should ""prepare for a significant impact"" from Hurricane Lane, Ige said. National hurricane scientists emphasize that even if the center of the storm — where winds are strongest — doesn't pass directly over the islands, the state could still face serious problems from the storm. A storm this sprawling and powerful can bring threatening downpours and winds ""well away from the center of the hurricane, and impacts could be felt on any of the islands,"" the National Hurricane Center said. It's rare for powerful storms to veer near these well-populated tropical islands, in large part because hurricanes feed on warmer waters, and the oceans around Hawaii are often relatively cool for tropical seas. Yet, the National Hurricane Center notes that ocean waters along the storm's predicted track are currently ""warm enough to support a major hurricane."" Hurricane Lane is only the sixth Category 5 hurricane ever recorded in the central Pacific, Federal Emergency Management Agency atmospheric scientist Michael Lowry tweeted. But, Lane is the closest Category 5 storm to Hawaii that scientists have ever observed, he added. Although any year can bring warmer waters to a marine region, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and university scientists published research last year arguing that the tropical Pacific will likely see more ""extremely active"" hurricane seasons as human-caused global warming boosts ocean temperatures. As the planet continues an accelerated rate of warming due to human-caused climate change, around 95 percent of accumulated heat gets absorbed by the oceans, increasing the background levels of ocean warming and making warmer-than-normal temperatures more likely. ""Global warming is really ocean warming,"" Josh Willis, an oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, recently said in an interview. A classic hurricane killer is wind shear — winds that hit hurricanes on their sides and can tilt them or blow off their top. But as of Tuesday night, government forecasters didn't expect increasing wind shear around Hawaii until Thursday evening, after some major effects are likely already felt in the state. As the storm skims the islands, or perhaps even makes landfall, severe and potentially historic flooding is expected. According to the National Hurricane Center, there will certainly be battering waves on the coast and potentially ""life-threatening flash flooding from heavy rainfall"" as water pours down the famously mountainous Hawaiian terrain.","Hurricane Lane, which is currently bearing down on Hawaii, is ""not a well behaved storm,"" according to the state's governor David Ige.

Andrew Freedman,"Just a few days after a powerful storm caused widespread damage across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, another potent nor'easter is tracking toward the region. This one won't be quite as strong as the last event, which was so massive that it caused damage as far away as the Bahamas and Puerto Rico, but it will have more cold air to work with, making a foot or more of snow more likely, especially across interior portions of New England. The storm will exacerbate the coastal flooding that never completely dissipated in the wake of the last intense storm and astronomical high tides that hit beginning on March 1. In coastal Massachusetts, the first nor'easter severely weakened or destroyed shoreline infrastructure in many communities, making the high waves and coastal flooding from this upcoming storm even more of a threat. SEE ALSO: This one picture sums up climate change's growing role in coastal flooding In general, as sea levels rise in response to global warming, weather ""bombs"" like the two storms in the last week will be capable of causing more severe coastal flooding, since their storm surge will ride on top of a higher baseline of water. And anytime that a major storm coincides with astronomical high tides, as the March 1-4 event did, look out for records to fall along with seawalls. National Weather Service snowfall forecast for New York City. Image: nws. Coastal storms, including weather systems that undergo the process known as bombogenesis, in which the minimum central air pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, are not unusual at this time of year along the East Coast. However, it is rare to see two back-to-back intense storms, both of which would qualify as ""bomb cyclones"" or ""weather bombs,"" occur within a few days of each other. [Coastal Flooding] Watch issued for Northeast MA (Cape Ann) for the Thursday AM high tide (3a - 5a); potential 2.5 - 3.0 foot storm surge along w/ tides yielding minor to moderate coastal flooding considering now vulnerable shoreline per recent storm (winds below in knots) pic.twitter.com/dD7zYQdIcC — NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) March 6, 2018 The back-to-back nature of these weather systems is largely due to a favorable weather pattern across the North Atlantic, with a blocking area of high pressure over Greenland preventing storms from moving quickly out to sea, and a see-saw pattern of atmospheric pressure, known as the North Atlantic Oscillation, in a phase that favors East Coast storms. The snowfall forecast for major cities in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast is an extremely difficult one, given multiple factors that could cut down on totals, or conversely, drastically raise them. So far, the consensus forecasts call for about 6 to 8 inches to fall in the Philadelphia area, with much more snow to the northwest of the city, and similar amounts in New York City. Quite a gradient in snowfall across RI and MA for Wednesday's storm. Nothing in Boston but almost a foot in Bedford, MA (near I-195/128). 2-4"" for Providence but over a foot in NW RI.

Miriam Kramer,"Perhaps you've heard; a solar storm is on the way. If much of the news coverage is to be believed, the coming solar storm is "" massive "" and could "" cause power outages "" because of ""equinox cracks"" that have appeared in Earth's magnetic field, leaving us vulnerable. But that's not the full story. SEE ALSO: 9 Stunning Images of the Aurora Borealis Over the U.S. In fact, at best, it's a serious misunderstanding of the facts, and at worse, it's a purposeful sensationalization of a pretty average solar event. ""This is just garbage, quite frankly,"" Robert Rutledge, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), said of the coverage around this solar storm, in an interview. Rutledge went on to say that he's unsure what ""equinox cracks"" are, and that the SWPC doesn't use that term. A solar storm is actually expected to impact the Earth from March 14 to March 15, but it certainly isn't massive. The storm, known as a ""G1"" geomagnetic storm, is actually the most minor of these types of solar storms, and it likely won't create any of the serious issues mentioned in many news articles published over the course of the past couple days. The sun is actually pretty quiet at the moment. According to the SWPC, it's possible that the solar storm — which will occur when charged particles from the sun interacting with Earth's magnetic field — will cause ""weak power grid fluctuations"" and may have a ""minor impact on satellite operations."" That's a far cry from the serious power outages touted by some. G1 is the lowest-severity geomagnetic storm on a scale of five. Moderate storms, known as G2 storms, are somewhat more intense than G1 events, though still not a huge cause for concern. Severe G4 and extreme G5 storms are the really concerning geomagnetic events that could cause major power problems on Earth and on satellites in space. ""Widespread voltage control problems and protective system problems can occur, some grid systems may experience complete collapse or blackouts,"" the SWPC said in an explanation of a G5 storm. ""Transformers may experience damage."" That said, one potentially cool effect from the coming G1 solar storm may be in the form of charged up auroras. The SWPC says that the northern lights could be seen as far south as Maine and Michigan thanks to the stream of charged particles heading our way. Those particles can be dragged down into Earth's upper atmosphere, where they interact with neutral particles, making them glow and look like dancing ribbons of light in the sky. Just because this storm isn't up to the hype doesn't mean that solar storms in general should be ignored. A truly massive solar storm, which would likely be caused by charged particles from a solar eruption sent out toward Earth, could, in fact, knock out parts of the electrical grid for months at a time. One major solar storm, now called the Carrington Event, struck the planet in 1859 and reportedly knocked out telegraph systems all around the world.","Perhaps you've heard; a solar storm is on the way.

Her family told BBC Tamil that she was trapped in the hut on 16 November when the cyclone made landfall. Some villagers said this was a ""wake up call"" as it was common practice to segregate menstruating girls. Cyclone Gaja is known to have killed at least 46 people in the coastal state. Menstruation is taboo in large parts of rural India. Women are traditionally believed to be impure during their periods. The family of the girl, S Vijayalakshmi, lives in a house next to the hut but they survived the storm. Her grandmother, S Visalakshi, said they couldn't rescue her as a coconut tree had fallen on the hut, which made it impossible to reach her. Image copyright Reuters Image caption The storm has uprooted thousands of trees She said Vijayalakshmi's parents had known that the storm was approaching but they couldn't keep her anywhere else since they lived in a coconut grove, far from the rest of the village, known as Anaikudi. ""I told them to take her to a different place. But within hours, the cyclone had struck and we couldn't move anywhere,"" she said. ""We are shattered,"" she told BBC Tamil's Pramila Krishnan. ""When we saw the tree, we lost hope. We waited for villagers to help us remove the tree and pull her out of the hut."" She added that they had rushed her to the hospital but doctors said that she had died hours ago and declared her dead on arrival.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by AJ Dellinger to Gizmodo","Weather watchers may be more preoccupied of late with storms popping off in the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern Pacific, but a very unusual cyclone also spun up over the Arctic this week—and it could spell more bad news for the region’s ailing sea ice. The Arctic is no stranger to cyclones, but the latest no-name storm, which emerged in the Kara sea north of Siberia, has garnered attention both for its size and timing. The storm’s central pressure (a measure of its strength) bottomed out Thursday at about 966 millibars, placing it par with the Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012, one of the most extreme summertime storms in recent memory. That storm reached a minimum central pressure 963-966 millibars, depending on which analysis you trust. The new storm’s occurrence in June is also noteworthy. Big cyclones like this don’t normally start hitting the Arctic until late summer. The Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012 spun up in August as did a major storm in 2016. “Preliminarily, this storm could rank in the Top 10 for Arctic Cyclones in June as well as for the summer (June through August) in strength,” Steven Cavallo, a meteorologist at the University of Oklahoma, told Earther via email. Xiangdong Zhang, a scientist at the International Arctic Research Center who specializes in Arctic cyclones, cited a few factors responsible for the storm’s formation, including low sea ice cover in the North Atlantic which has increased the amount of heat in the atmosphere, a strong temperature gradient between land and sea, and the stratospheric polar vortex, an area of low pressure just above the storm. “The downward intrusion of this polar vortex intensified [the] storm,” Zhang told Earther via email. The no-name storm reached peak photogenicity yesterday, with the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration capturing a stunning high-resolution image. While your typical late-season Arctic cyclones are notorious for chewing up sea ice, what this early season beast will mean for ice remains to be seen. “This storm is very quick-moving and occurring earlier in the season,” University of California, Irvine Ph.D. candidate Zack Labe told Earther via Twitter direct message. “Its impacts to sea ice are likely not comparable to these other strong cyclones that have occurred later in the summer.” Labe noted that early summer storms can favor cooler, cloudier conditions, slowing down the loss of sea ice, which typically bottoms out in September. However, he added that a storm of this strength “may precondition the ice for easier melt later in the season.” Zhang said that due to the storm’s location, it can transport more sea ice out of the Arctic through the passage between Greenland and Svalbard known as the Fram Straight. “This will contribute to Arctic sea ice decrease, in particular thick ice,” he said. Storm or no, it’s been a weird, bad year for Arctic sea ice so far. After limping along all winter, Bering sea ice was basically gone by May, months ahead of schedule. Even before this storm, sea ice around Svalbard was looking more like it should in September. Overall, Arctic sea ice extent for May was at its second-lowest on record, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center’s latest monthly sea ice report released on June 6. The role of rising temperatures in driving down sea ice is well established. But there’s also growing evidence that climate change could fuel more ice-shredding cyclones. Research going back to the early 2000s suggests Arctic cyclone activity is on the rise. And a study published in April concluded that these storms will become more frequent and intense in the future as the contrast between land and sea temperatures continues to rise.","Weather watchers may be more preoccupied of late with storms popping off in the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern Pacific, but a very unusual cyclone also spun up over the Arctic this week—and it could spell more bad news for the region’s ailing sea ice.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Hurricane Michael is on track to make landfall in Floridas Panhandle Wednesday as one of the fiercest storms the region has ever seen. While Florence drenched the Carolinas with record rainfall and other hurricanes attack with wind, Michaels main threat will be surge. The National Hurricane Center is forecasting Michael could send up to 13 feet of storm surge roaring ashore. Thats a lot of water, and there are a handful of interwoven factors explaining why the surge could be so high. First, theres the storm itself. Michael is a pretty big. Hurricane-force winds extend 35 miles out from the now Category 3 storms core, but tropical storm-force winds extend a whopping 185 miles outward. As the storm rotates, its long, windy arms scoop up water and push it along. The underwater and shoreline topography of the Gulf Coast will lend a hand. The area Michael is headed has a shallow continental shelf that extends up to 90 miles offshore. That water is a lot easier to stir up than the deep ocean. Apalachee Bay very efficiently generates storm surge because of its concave shape and shallow bathymetry, or water depth, Hal Needham, a storm surge expert and founder of Marine Weather and Climate, told Earther. Apalachee Bay sits smack between Cedar Key and Indian Pass, right at the epicenter of the highest surge forecasts. Needham also warned of a terrifying-sounding shelf wave as Michael pushes north. Because the storms movement mirrors the Florida coastline, it basically traps a wave that travels along the coast in the same direction as the storm according to Needham. This happened during Hurricane Dennis, the last major hurricane to hit the Panhandle in 2005, and contributed to higher surge. The pile on doesnt stop there, though. Michaels arrival coincides with the king tides, an annual tradition of the highest tides of the year in Florida which occur when the moon is full or new and the Earth is closest to the Sun. The storm is expected to make landfall sometime in the late morning or early afternoon. Thankfully the high tide isnt until around 10 p.m., but Michael will still strike when the tide is rising. And complete the whole shit show scenario, theres sea level rise. Carbon pollution has contributed to melting land ice and warming and expanding the ocean. Floridas Gulf Coast has seen sea level rise 8-9 inches over the past century. Sea level rise has ushered in a sunny day flooding crisis across the U.S., and its giving storms like Michael a boost they dont really need. Update 5:07 p.m. ET: This post has been updated to reflect the 5 p.m. update from the National Hurricane Center, which upgraded Michael to Category 3 storm with 13 feet of surge potential.","Hurricane Michael is on track to make landfall in Florida’s Panhandle Wednesday as one of the fiercest storms the region has ever seen.

We received the indictment and anticipate that a not-guilty plea will soon be entered and are working with court and counsel for a self surrender and bond hearing, Mr. Hobbs said. The July 19 accident was one of the deadliest involving a duck boat modeled after the amphibious trucks used in World War II to move along land and water in United States history. When the duck boat entered the lake, the waters were calm, but there had been numerous warnings of an approaching storm. Wind speeds picked up suddenly, increasing to more than 70 miles an hour. Fierce waves buffeted the boat, which took on water. Within minutes, the vessel had sunk. Fourteen people survived, including Mr. McKee. The vehicles have had several fatal accidents on both water and land, including in May 1999, when 13 people were killed when a duck boat sank in Hot Springs, Ark.

Weather officials say 10 inches of snow — or perhaps more — could blanket parts of New York; some areas of New England could get three to four inches of rain; and some coastal towns are expected to be hit with winds of 50 miles per hour or more. Alerts have been issued up and down the coast, but experts are warning that some of the most severe flooding could occur in places like Cape Cod, Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts where the Weather Service said roads, basements and other structures could become inundated by three feet of water or more. In those areas, officials said, the most severe coastal flooding was likely to occur during the high tides Friday night and Saturday afternoon. “Some neighborhoods may be cut off for an extended time,” the Weather Service said in a written warning. “This is a dangerous storm, and evacuation of some neighborhoods may be necessary.” Winter Storm #Riley will become an intense #noreaster with locally major, long-lived coastal #flooding, high winds, and heavy, wet #snow that could lead to widespread power outages. https://t.co/XjELnjHJis pic.twitter.com/KAAcpib2cC — The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) March 1, 2018 The dire messages prompted Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York to activate the State Emergency Operations Center on Thursday. Also Thursday, Gov.

Mark Kaufman,"Hurricane Michael has matured, developed an eye, and is gathering strength as it churns on a direct path towards the Florida Panhandle. National Hurricane Center scientists expect the storm to strike land on Wednesday as a major storm, with winds greater than 110 mph, making it at least a Category 3 hurricane. There's now almost nothing holding back the storm from further intensification as it approaches land, bringing not just destructive winds but perilous surges of ocean water into the Florida and Alabama coasts. ""Hurricane Michael is primed for additional strengthening prior to landfall because the key players in the atmosphere and ocean are all conducive for it,"" Brian McNoldy, a storm researcher at University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said over email. One of these key players is wind shear, which are winds that hit hurricanes at their sides and weaken, or sometimes kill, the tempests. Without these winds, there's little threatening Michael's stable, cyclone-like form. ""That helps the storm remain intact, upright, and symmetric,"" said McNoldy. By fall, these hurricane-threatening winds often pick up in the Gulf, Falko Judt, a research meteorologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said in an interview. But not this year. ""This is unusual,"" noted Judt. SEE ALSO: An appreciation of the persistently grim tweets from the Norway Ice Service A second influential factor is the warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes feed off of the bath-like temperatures of sea surface waters. Without these warm waters, they couldn't even form, nor sustain themselves. And in the Gulf right now, even as the waters begin to gradually cool as fall sets in, they're still plenty warm. ""It's always warm there,"" said Judt. Lastly, there are no masses of dry air in the lower or middle portions of the atmosphere where Hurricane Michael is headed, said McNoldy. A hurricane's thunderstorms need moisture to fuel their activity, but when storms suck up dry air, they threaten to ""wrap into the circulation and choke off the thunderstorm activity,"" said McNoldy. But Michael has mostly moist air ahead. Water levels will rise well in advance of the arrival of #Michael. It's essential that residents within the storm surge warning area finish preparations to protect life and property today. pic.twitter.com/0Xz3nNkAnr NHC_Surge (@NHC_Surge) October 9, 2018 The storm poses a particularly severe threat to the Florida coast places like Panama City and Apalachicola as well as inland Tallahassee, because the storm is not expected to weaken much as it approaches land. ""Usually they weaken before they hit land,"" said Judt. ""The models are predicting this will not weaken before landfall, which would be very unusual."" The question of why storms typically weaken as they approach land ""is still an open science question,"" noted Judt. Some scientists have proposed drier air from nearby land can temper the storms. But as of Tuesday, any such weakening isn't in the cards for Michael. If Michael follows its expected course, it will become just the fourth major hurricane to hit the Florida panhandle since 1950.","Hurricane Michael has matured, developed an eye, and is gathering strength as it churns on a direct path towards the Florida Panhandle.

Mark Kaufman,"Hurricane Michael the fourth Category 4 storm to pummel the United States in 14 months snapped pine trees like toothpicks, washed neighborhoods into the sea, and shredded the hangars off an Air Force base. Before the storm's 155 mph winds struck the Florida Panhandle on Oct. 10, storm scientists predicted Michael would be an extremely intense storm, in large part because it passed through ocean waters that were 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit above normal and hurricanes thrive on warm water. The devastation, seen by satellites orbiting hundreds of miles above, is ghastly. A one-mile swath of Mexico City is now a wasteland, wrecked by surges of sea water that Hurricane Michael propelled into the coast. Other neighborhoods were ravaged by the storm's wind.

Here’s what you need to know for your morning commute: • Subways and Long Island Rail Road are running with normal service. • Metro-North Railroad is running on a reduced schedule. The last Hudson Line train from the city will leave Grand Central at 7:59 p.m. • New Jersey Transit has implemented a limited weekday rail schedule and is cross-honoring tickets for rail, buses and private carriers, but not for PATH or NY Waterway ferries. Bus service in North and Central New Jersey may be suspended this afternoon. • Bridges and tunnels are open, and Seastreak and NYC Ferry are operating normally, but may experience delays. • A travel advisory is in effect for all areas east of Interstate 81, essentially, the entire eastern half of New York State. • Amtrak is operating on a modified schedule in the Northeast Corridor. • Check your flight at La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark before you head to the airport. Around 500 flights have been canceled at the three airports so far. The storm should blanket the city unevenly, said Patrick Maloit, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. Northern Manhattan and the Bronx are expecting seven to 11 inches; Northern Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island should get seven to nine inches; and Southern Queens is looking at four to seven. “The other wrinkle is that there’s a slight chance of thunder this afternoon,” Mr. Maloit said. “If we get it, anyone who’s underneath the thunder snow could get a rate of two to four inches of snow an hour.” Generally, the snow is going to be heavy, wet and mixed with rain in some areas, Mr. Maloit added. (So pull on your winter boots and pack an extra pair of socks.) Wind gusts are expected to reach 45 miles an hour, well below the destructive gusts seen in Friday’s storm, when eight people were killed and more than two million were left without power.

Rayne Ellis,"Well folks, we officially have our first major Atlantic hurricane of the 2018 season. Early Wednesday afternoon the National Hurricane Center announced that Hurricane Florence, a storm brewing 2,205 miles off the coast of Bermuda, has intensified into a major storm. A hurricane is considered “major” or intense when wind speeds exceed 111 mph, which means it's at least a Category 3 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). SEE ALSO: Hurricane Maria is the deadliest storm of the 21st century “This is almost exactly on target,"" NOAA representative Dennis Feltgen said in an interview. ""The typical day to see the first major hurricane is September 4. It’s September 5."" “Tropical Storm Gordon just hit the south, so we’ve seen seven storms already. On average, we see seven storms by September 16, so we are actually above the average,” Feltgen said. There's also a lot of uncertainty about what track Florence will take or if it will impact land at all. But there's no reason to panic, at least not yet. Models predicting the storm's path vary by 1,000 miles and meteorologists aren’t even sure if the hurricane will go north, south, turn out to the east or keep barrelling toward the west. Careful proclaiming #Florence will go west. Lots to figure out here, as short-term motion may ultimately determine long-term track. Red dot below shows where Florence crossed 45W this morning relative to 0Z EPS (from @Weathernerds ). It's way on north side of guidance for now. pic.twitter.com/7RGLMhjpjM — Levi Cowan (@TropicalTidbits) September 5, 2018 “This is certainly a storm to watch, but it’s too early to know if we’re in danger if it’s just a fish storm,” meteorologist Philip Klotzbach said in an interview. “If every model that predicted that a hurricane would hit the U.S., actually hit the U.S., the east coast would be uninhabitable.” Any prediction made this far in advance is made with uncertainty, Klotzbach explained. “If the National Hurricane Center could do 10 day forecasts with skill, they would,"" Klotzbach said. ""In 50 years, with even better models, you still won’t have certainty nine days out."" But no one should turn a blind eye to the storm. Florence has been fairly difficult to forecast already. Klotzbach said himself that earlier this week he thought Florence wouldn’t amount to more than a medium level tropical storm, but by this morning it was a major hurricane. “Hurricane Florence is certainly an overachiever. It’s been stronger than what most of the forecasters thought,” he said. “But It’s important to dial down the hype and check again in a few days.” The tropical Atlantic is now quite active. Tropical Depression Gordon is moving across Mississippi. Hurricane Florence in the central Atlantic is now a Cat 3 storm with 125 mph max winds. A tropical wave behind Florence could become a tropical depression by the end of the week. pic.twitter.com/QivVGnCjQ9 — NWS Eastern Region (@NWSEastern) September 5, 2018 This weekend, tracking models will be substantially more accurate as the number of factors determining the path of the storm will be made clear. Both Feltgen and Klotzbach said Hurricane Florence is an important reminder that we're approaching the peak of the hurricane season, and it's time to start planning. “Be ready, but don’t get too amped up over a nine-day forecast,” Klotzbach said.","Well folks, we officially have our first major Atlantic hurricane of the 2018 season.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Hurricane Michael, an unprecedented storm that slammed into the Florida Panhandle at Category 4 strength, may well be an arbiter of things to come in a world where climate change is poised to make such devastating hurricanes all the more likely. But it also gave us a look at the past in the form of destroyed vessels from 119 years ago that Michaels terrifying storm surge unearthed. According to a report this weekend in the Tallahassee Democrat, Michaels waters dredged up shipwrecks on Dog Island in Franklin County that are believed to be vessels beached during the 1899 Carrabelle hurricane. Photos posted to Facebook by the Carrabelle Boat Club and to Twitter by the Democrat show heavily damaged, but clearly recognizable, hulls completely exposed to the elements. The paper reported that the specific identities of the unearthed vessels has not yet been determined, since state officials are busy dealing with the immediate aftermath of the recent storm: They are well-documented wrecks, according to the Florida Department of State. Because state resources are being allocated to more urgent hurricane recovery efforts, there are no plans for state archaeologists to visit the site. Theyve been mostly stationary since 1899 when they were wrecked in a hurricane, wrote DOS spokeswoman Sarah Revell. From time to time, some parts of the site have become exposed. The 1899 Carrabelle Hurricane is so named, according to the Florida Historical Society, because after it was done dealing destruction in the Dominican Republic it barreled into the city of Carrabelle in Floridas Panhandle region at Category 2 strength, destroying an estimated 57 ships and wiping the town almost entirely off the map. That hurricane resulted in at least seven reported deaths and hundreds of injuries, the Florida Historical Society wrote, as well as did significant damage to other nearby coastal communities in Florida. Michael was far stronger, reaching the Panhandle at Category 4 strength and doing massive damage well beyond the coast. CNN reported Saturday that officials had raised the death toll to at least 36, with 26 deaths in Florida alone and others reported in Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia. (According to the Tampa Bay Times, the Florida death count was still being tallied in part due to damaged infrastructure and bad communication in Bay and Gulf counties as of Friday.) The city of Mexico Beach was so badly damaged, with a reported 85 percent destruction rate among homes subjected to 14-foot storm surge, that it is unclear whether the community can rebuild on its own or whether it will be taken over by developers that have long had eyes on its waterfront properties, the Palm Beach Post wrote. In Franklin County, storm surge wrecked homes and tore up roads close to the shore. As the nearly century-and-a-half old shipwrecks show, the damage done by massive storms like Michael can leave its mark for an incredible length of time. In Florida, many of the worst-hit regions were among the poorest in the state ; as the New York Times wrote on Sunday, locals are worried that they may be left without the support they need to rebuild their communities in the long run, not just now. We came here because we know people are going to start forgetting, 49-year-old volunteer Norma Ward of Plant City, who was helping distribute supplies in the city of Marianna, told the Times.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations for the National Weather Service, called the storm a “mid-latitude cyclone” — as opposed to a hurricane, which is a tropical cyclone. “If it comes close enough to the coast, you can get a walloping snowfall,” Mr. Carbin said Tuesday afternoon. Tuesday was already cold, with high temperatures ranging from 0 degrees in the Northeast to the low 40s in parts of North Florida. It was in the 20s and 30s in parts of Texas, where much of the state was under a freeze warning. A shot of Arctic air will reinforce that cold and feed the storm, according to Mr. Carbin, who noted that a stretch from Louisiana to Georgia had already seen snow a few weeks ago. “We are,” he said, “in the depths of winter.” Southern governors encourage residents to stay aware. Mr. Deal was among the Georgia politicians who received criticism after a winter storm paralyzed Atlanta in 2014. In a statement on Tuesday evening, he noted that the state Department of Transportation had sent all of its brine trucks, as well as 75 plows, to southeast Georgia. “I encourage all Georgians in the potentially impacted areas to stay informed, get prepared and be safe,” he said. In North Carolina on Tuesday afternoon, Gov. Roy Cooper warned that the forecast for his state — up to five inches of snow in eastern counties — could change quickly. “A small change in a storm’s track can make a big difference in how much snow falls and where,” Mr. Cooper said. The state’s emergency management director, Mike Sprayberry, said counties were preparing to open warming centers if they were needed, and state officials said workers were already dumping brine onto roadways, overpasses and bridges from Raleigh eastward. The conditions also led to the shutdown, or planned closure, of ports in Savannah, Ga., and Charleston. Officials at other major ports said Wednesday morning that they were monitoring conditions and could close them later in the week. Reporting was contributed by Patricia Mazzei and Jonah Engel Bromwich from New York, and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.

Andrew Freedman,"The ""bomb cyclone"" that slammed the East Coast on Wednesday and Thursday exceeded weather forecasters' expectations in nearly every way. It dumped more than a foot of snow on the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, including 16 inches in Islip, Long Island, and flooded parts of downtown Boston with a storm surge that sent water rising to historic levels. The storm got its name for the process known as bombogenesis, which describes a storm whose minimum central air pressure plummets by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. SEE ALSO: A 'bomb cyclone,' explained On Thursday, the bomb cyclone intensified by 59 millibars in 24 hours, which is the fastest rate ever observed in any other winter storm along the East Coast since at least 1976, according to data from David Roth, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center, and Andrea Lang, an assistant professor at the University of Albany. Lang said that research by her and Hannah Attard, a doctoral student in her research group, found 1,218 cyclones that originated north of 30 degrees North latitude and met the bombogenesis criteria in the Northern Hemisphere between 1980 and 2015. This indicates that meteorological bombs, so to speak, aren't that rare. ""What is uncommon is the rate of deepening for the 4 January cyclone,"" Lang said in an email. ""If you filter all 1218 cyclones that meet the 'bomb' criteria for those that occurred in a box just off the East Coast (60-80˚W and 30-55˚N) we find 23 'bomb' cyclones in the 1980-2015 reanalysis data."" ""This storm would be the new number 1 in terms of 24 hr mean sea level pressure fall... for storms on our list,"" she added. The intensification rate isn't just a bit of trivia for weather geeks, either. It had implications for the storm's impacts, primarily by accelerating the storm's winds. Winds gusted to hurricane force, or 75 miles per hour, across Cape Cod and the Islands, and high winds raked everywhere from the Carolinas to Nova Scotia. This occurred because air was rushing in toward the center of the storm in response to the rapid drop in air pressure. Such winds helped drive the storm surge flooding that created so many problems in New England, too. The satellite imagery taken of the storm clearly shows how intense it became, as it even sported an eye-like feature near its center. Meteorologist Jeff Frame annotated an image to show all the meteorological features it revealed. There are many reasons why this storm intensified so quickly and significantly, with a minimum pressure eventually dropping to levels more typically seen in Category 2 or 3 hurricanes. For one, there were tremendous contrasts in air masses between cold, dry Arctic air pouring in from the northwest, and moisture-rich subtropical air streaming north over the Atlantic. ""There are several factors that contribute to the intensification of all cyclones, all of these factors were on the extreme side for this event,"" Lang said. ""All extratropical cyclones, which includes storms like nor'easters, form on boundaries between cold and warm air. However, not all nor'easters form when there is record-breaking cold air already in place along the east coast,"" she said. ""In general terms, the magnitude and scale of the temperature contrast is an indicator of energy available for cyclone intensification."" Zoomed-in satellite image of the eye-like feature in the 'bomb cyclone' on Jan. 4, 2018. Image: noaa Lang said that the southern location of the initial storm, which spun up near the coast of Florida, added more energy to the mix. ""The fact that the cyclone formed as far south as it did allowed the cyclone [to maintain] a link to the subtropics (nicely shown in the satellite imagery),"" she said. ""The subtropical link provided the cyclone with a source of fuel, in the form of water vapor, that fed the large field of precipitation and enhanced the storm strength."" While many of the East Coast's most memorable snowstorms also underwent bombogenesis, there was nothing typical about this particular weather bomb. And that's why satellite images of it have been saved to weather geek's hard drives, (and set as my new desktop background.)

Andrew Freedman,"An unusually powerful storm is threatening the East Coast of the U.S. this week with heavy snow, high winds, and record-shattering cold not seen in some places since the early 20th Century — if at all. The storm will be the result of a combination of three strong pieces of atmospheric energy, known to meteorologists as shortwaves. Think of these shortwaves as protein bars for storm formation. This particular storm, which is already beginning to form off the coast of Florida, will devour enough of them to allow it to become so powerful that it will contain hurricane force winds by the time it moves off the Mid-Atlantic coast late Wednesday night. SEE ALSO: Niagara Falls is a frigid, beautiful wonderland right now Because of the cold air in place ahead of the storm, winter storm watches and advisories for this event have been issued as far south as Florida, all the way northward to Massachusetts, which is nearly unheard of. In fact, some computer model runs show that the storm could intensify far faster than what would be required for the tempest to be known as a weather 'bomb,' for a process called ""bombogenesis."" This term refers to a low pressure area whose minimum central air pressure plummets by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. By feasting off of intense atmospheric disturbances as well as differences in air masses and ocean temperatures, including the moisture rich Gulf Stream waters, the upcoming tempest is projected to exceed that intensification rate by several more millibars in 24 hours. This intensification rate, if it comes to pass, would be astonishing. Some computer models are projecting a minimum central air pressure of below 950 millibars at its peak, which would be nearly unheard of for this part of the world outside of a hurricane. For comparison, Hurricane Sandy had a minimum central pressure of about 946 millibars when it made its left hook into New Jersey in 2012. In general, the lower the air pressure, the stronger the storm. Computer model projections show that this storm is likely to reach a peak intensity that is rarely seen off the East Coast, with a minimum central air pressure of about 950 millibars. This is comparable to the air pressure measured in a Category 3 hurricane. Storm track is key The big question concerns the storm's track. As of Tuesday morning, most computer model projections and human-made forecasts showed it heading just far enough out to sea to spare all but Cape Cod and the Canadian Maritimes from a punishing blow of heavy precipitation, damaging winds, and coastal flooding. Animation of projected satellite imagery, showing the explosive storm development along the East Coast. This is NAM 3KM model data. Image: tropicaltidbits However, even a 50-mile shift westward in the storm track, which is entirely plausible at this point in the game, would put Boston in the crosshairs for potential blizzard conditions, and a 100-mile shift — which is also within the realm of possibility, would put New York City in play. The forecast trend through midday Tuesday has been to move the track slightly to the west, given forecasters in New York, Philadelphia, and Connecticut heartburn. As of Tuesday morning, the National Weather Service was forecasting 2 to 4 inches of snow in New York City from this storm on Wednesday night through Thursday, but such amounts may have to be raised dramatically if the storm shifts west, and conversely if there's an eastward shift. The track of the storm depends on the subtle interactions between the two pieces of energy diving southeastward from the Pacific Northwest, as well as energy from the southern branch of the jet stream. Even with supercomputers and other modern assets at their disposal, forecasting storms such as this one still tests meteorologists' ability to anticipate what the capricious atmosphere will do. Nova Scotia is likely to take a direct hit from this storm on Friday, with widespread power outages from hurricane force winds, along with heavy snow, heavy rain, and battering waves. This could be a storm for the record books there, as well as Downeast Maine, again depending on the exact track of the low pressure area. Stupid-level cold follows this storm Even if the storm leaves a fluffy 3 to 4 inches of snow in New York and Philadelphia, rather than a crippling blizzard with snow measured in feet, it is still going to have one dangerous impact that is quite certain to occur in those locations. The heart of cold air over North America and parts of the Arctic is currently parked over Hudson Bay, Canada. Temperature departures from average projection from the Euro model for Saturday morning, Jan. 6, 2018. Image: weatherbell The enormous circulation around this storm is likely to drag this cold air down behind it, as if the low pressure area itself is reaching around and slapping New Yorkers, Bostonians, and Washington, D.C. residents right in the face. How rude. The cold weather that will result is going to be more frigid than anything that residents of the Midwest and East Coast have experienced so far during what has been an unusually intense and long-lasting cold snap. Instead of breaking daily temperature records, as dozens of cities have been, all-time cold temperature records will be threatened on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. For example, the high temperature in New York City may not get above the single digits on Saturday, with overnight lows in the metro area plunging below zero. Forecast record cold high temperatures on Friday, Jan. 5, 2018. Broken records indicated by circles. Image: nws/weatherbell Record low temperatures that have stood for decades or longer could fall, and infrastructure from home water pipes to city water mains and fire hydrants could fail in such cold. As former Weather Service meteorologist Gary Szatkowski explained via Twitter on Tuesday morning, areas that don't get much snow from this storm, but that do get into the heart of the cold air mass, could have more infrastructure problems since snow cover acts as an effective insulator to the ground below it. For people venturing out into the cold this weekend, frostbite will be a risk on any exposed skin within minutes of being outside, particularly on Friday night, as gusty winds whip across the Northeast behind the storm. The good news, however, is that there are signs of a ""warm up"" toward more average temperatures in the Midwest and East by early to midweek next week.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Henri Le Masne went missing after skiing in a storm near the Matterhorn in March 1954 A French skier who disappeared in Italy more than 60 years ago has been identified after his story was shared on social media, Italian police say. Human remains, ski equipment and glasses had been found in 2005, high in a valley in Italy's Aosta region. But investigators were unable to identify the victim, and, last month, shared their findings on Facebook. A French family then matched the glasses to a relative, Henri Le Masne, which sparked a forensic investigation. The belongings were discovered 3,000 metres (10,000 ft) high in the Alps, near the Swiss border. There were some clues about the man's identity - such as clothing embroidered with initials and wooden skies, which at the time of use would have been expensive - but the investigators remained puzzled. They established that the remains belonged to a man who would have been about 1.75 metres tall and aged about 30, with his death likely to have occurred in the spring, said Marinella Laporta, an investigator with the forensic police unit in Turin. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Forensic investigators analyse a tooth found in July 2005 In June, the Aosta valley prosecutor's findings were shared on social media with an appeal for readers to spread the information, especially in France and Switzerland. The story was then picked up by French media. Emma Nassem heard the report broadcast on her local radio station and questioned whether the missing man could be her uncle, Mr Le Masne, who went missing after skiing in a storm near the Matterhorn by the Swiss border in 1954. Mr Le Masne's younger brother, Roger, now 94, also came forward with an email describing his sibling. ""I am the brother of Henri Le Masne... who is likely the skier who disappeared 64 years ago. He was a bachelor and quite independent. He worked in the finance ministry in Paris,"" he wrote in an email, which was shared with the police. The police said a photograph provided by the family showed glasses matching those found by the investigators.

CHRIS DIXON and CAMPBELL ROBERTSON,"In a bad wind, a pile can quickly become an arsenal or at least clog storm drains. So far, though, the brunt of the storm has missed the areas with the most flood debris. Still, recovery efforts will be slow, officials said, as some flood-prone areas that had begun to rebuild now have to wait for waters to recede again. Theres people who had their homes damaged during Florence and now theres going to be some winds that could further damage their homes and property, said Mike Sprayberry, the director of the North Carolina Emergency Management agency, describing how a 50-mile-an-hour gust could rip the tarp off a house that was in the midst of repairs, sending rain pouring back inside. Federal disaster recovery centers set up in the Carolinas after Florence were closed on Thursday because of Michael. Schools in many parts of North Carolina have yet to reopen after Florence close to 90,000 students have been out of school for weeks. As Michael came into the state, there were more than 575 people still in shelters from the last storm and many others who would have likely needed them but are living in hotel rooms paid for with temporary disaster aid. In an era of climate change, the reality of the last few disasters just means a head start on this one. It almost just feels like another day at the office now, said Harrison Cahill, the spokesman for Lexington County, S.C., talking of a neighborhood with flooded homes in the county.

JOHN SCHWARTZ,"Low barometric pressure increases a storms intensity, and the barometric pressure within Hurricane Michael early Wednesday was just 925 millibars. There have only been a half dozen storms that struck the United States with lower barometric pressure, the most recent being Katrina, Andrew and Camille and all six were devastating storms, Dr. Klotzbach said. The rapid intensification of the storm, which means growing in wind speed by 35 miles per hour over a 24-hour period, was unexpected. Theres still stuff we dont know about hurricanes, Dr. Klotzbach added. While prediction of a storms path has grown increasingly accurate, the ability to predict rapid intensification has lagged somewhat, said Dr. Jiang. The strengthening occurred despite pronounced wind shear in the region that might have been expected to weaken the storm, she added.","Hurricane Michael left much of Panama City, Fla., in ruins on Wednesday.

"RICHARD FAUSSET, ALAN BLINDER and JOHN SCHWARTZ","With bread in hand, Mr. Perryman and Ms. Long, 32, were headed back to their home in Panama City, about a 30-minute drive south. They lived near a bayou, he said, which they feared would overflow with the storm surge. But they were still on the fence about leaving. The plan was to keep waiting and watching the news. If by Wednesday morning Michael still looked like it was going to slam straight into Panama City, then maybe they, too, would head to Dothan to bunk with relatives. As he waited to buy a 20-pound bag of ice, Mike Sanville, 64, puffed on a cigarette and said that he was also going to try to ride the storm out in Fountain, in the small house he shares with two other men. He was expecting the town to get punched hard. Its coming right at us, he said. Were dead center. Mr. Sanville, a retired construction worker, said he worried that the roof would blow off his house as the winds picked up Tuesday night. If that happened, he said, he might ride out the rest of the storm in an outhouse he had built out back. He said that it had survived a blow from a falling tree a few years ago. But would all three residents fit in an outhouse? Maybe, he said. No question it would be a tight fit.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Mars before (left) and during (right) the dust storm GIF: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS Nearly all of Mars has been under the assault of a planet-wide dust storm since June. The nerve-wracking question: Is the Opportunity rover okay? The 15-year-old rover has been incommunicado since June 10, according to a NASA release, as the dust storm cut it off from solar power. NASA scientists are confident that the rover will weather the storm, so they’re just waiting for the wakeup call. First, here’s the background. A small dust storm appeared on Mars at the end of May. It soon spiraled into a planet-wide event. Storms like this occur once or twice a decade. The nuclear-powered Curiosity rover is fine, but the solar-powered Opportunity rover went into hibernation in early June. Scientists worry about what the lack of power and low temperatures will do to the rover but are optimistic it will survive. So, how will researchers know when it’s back? The NASA press release explains that dust storms are measured with a number called “tau,” with higher tau indicating a more opaque atmosphere. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a satellite that circles the planet, can estimate the tau by observing the surface. The rover needs a tau no higher than 2 in order to charge its batteries. Normally its environment’s tau is 0.5, and during the storm, it was as high as 10.8. At present, the tau is somewhere between 2.1 and 2.5, according to the Opportunity team —so they don’t expect to hear from the rover just yet. Meanwhile, NASA engineers are pinging Opportunity, hoping to hear a response back. After that first response, it will take a few weeks to gather information about the rover’s current state and determine what kinds of damage it might have suffered. To protect itself in the event of an error, the Opportunity has automatic safe-mode type behaviors, called fault conditions. NASA scientists expect that the rover has gone through low-power, mission clock, and possibly uploss fault conditions, according to the newest Opportunity update. Low-power faults make the rover hibernate, clock faults tell the rover to rely on things other than its internal clock to make decisions, and uploss faults tell it that its normal communication systems aren’t properly functioning. NASA has put together a playlist of songs it has used to try to rouse the rover. It’s a boring playlist without any hip-hop or dance music that I, too, would try to sleep through. Maybe I’d wake up for Queen or Bowie. Hope to hear from you soon, Oppy! [ NASA JPL ]",Nearly all of Mars has been under the assault of a planet-wide dust storm since June.

MIHIR ZAVERI,"Tropical Storm Lane drenched parts of Hawaii with about four feet of rain as it crept past the state on Saturday, causing flash floods and prompting evacuations even as it dissipated over the islands’ rugged slopes. The storm had weakened over several days from a Category 5 storm, with maximum winds now reaching up to 60 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service. But its plodding pace — just 3 m.p.h. — prolonged the rains. Some 46 inches fell on the eastern side of the Island of Hawaii, where landslides shut down roads and search-and-rescue efforts were underway. Flash flood warnings were still in effect on Saturday morning. Kelly Wooten, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii County Civil Defense, which has been coordinating the emergency response in hard-hit areas on Hawaii Island, said the agency had not yet been able to assess the damage from the storm. She said police, fire and other departments were working to keep people off the roads, as some areas were still under water. Ms. Wooten said no injuries or deaths had been reported so far.

Shannon Stirone,"This week, NASA had to say farewell to the Opportunity rover, which had been exploring Mars for the past 15 years. Its final months are a tale of grit, literal and figurative: Late last spring, a dust storm engulfed the entire Martian planetthe worst, most severe storm ever observed there.
Blasts of wind kicked fine grains of dust and sand off the surface; because of the planets lower gravity, the particles hung in the atmosphere for months. The storm was so powerful and the clouds so thick that they prevented sunlight from reaching the rovers solar panels. NASA last heard from Oppy in June 2018, and after 7 months of trying to wake it up, scientists finally declared they had done all they could. The mission was over.
Opportunity and its twin, Spirit, were only expected to last some 90 days on Mars. When the two rovers landed in January 2004, NASA thought the planets dust eventually would accumulate on the solar panels and keep their batteries from recharging. What scientists didnt fully grasp, however, is that Mars has seasons just like Earth. Yes, the dust would build up, but in time a breeze would come and blow it off the solar panels. The simple fact of seasonal reoccurrence was, in large part, what kept the rovers going for so many years. (The Spirit mission officially ended in 2011.)
Were staying on Mars a bit longer this week. Not only do we have to pay our respects to the intrepid Opportunity, but InSight, NASAs latest Martian lander, is busy getting settled on the surface to do some science. This mission is the first in history that will study the interior of the red planet. After 40 years of exploration, we are still learning new things about our neighbor.
The best way to remember Opportunity and cheer on InSight is by diving into WIREDs full collection of space photos, here.

SANDRA E. GARCIA,"Tropical Storm Isaac was strengthening and the National Hurricane Center expected it to be upgraded to a hurricane by Sunday night. It was headed toward the Caribbean, but no warnings had been posted. In the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Helene was close to the Cabo Verde Islands off the coast of Africa and was expected to go out to sea after it passes the islands. In the Pacific, Tropical Storm Paul was southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. Forecasters expected it to remain a tropical storm and head out into the open water. A second tropical storm in the Pacific, Olivia, could threaten Hawaii in a couple of days, but it was too early to tell, Mr. Feltgen said. Having five systems in the Western Hemisphere is fairly common for this time of year. Sept. 10 is considered the statistical peak of the hurricane season, Mr. Feltgen, said, adding, “This is right on target.” Last year at this time, Hurricanes Irma, Jose and Katia were billowing in the Atlantic basin. “This is not unusual,” Mr. Feltgen said. “But there is no such a thing as just a storm.” Separately, parts of Ohio saw close to nine inches of rain over the weekend brought by the remnants of Tropical Storm Gordon.

There was no respite on Boxing Day, with meteorologists registering a grand total of 60in over the two-day period.

MATT STEVENS,"“It’s a main highway for that area so it’s important to keep it open,” Mr. Abbott said, adding that officials had “no concerns” about the road. State transportation officials said they now expect the part of Highway 176 where the accident occurred to remain closed until at least Tuesday afternoon. The North Carolina Highway Patrol was investigating the deadly accident, officials said. There is a longstanding tradition of television crews standing in the middle of dangerous storms, in part to exhibit their unflinching desire to be on the scene for a significant event. But the news value of dangerous stand-ups — in which a correspondent is seen in the field talking to the camera — is increasingly being questioned, and came under extra scrutiny last year when videos of reporters being lashed by hurricane-strength winds were shared widely on social media.

 Of the 270 containers that fell off the MSC Zoe well over 200 were still unaccounted for on Thursday
Extensive debris has washed up on islands off the Dutch north coast after some 270 containers including chemicals fell off a cargo ship in a storm.
As the extent of pollution became clear on five islands including Terschelling, coastguards searched the North Sea for missing containers.
The cargo fell off the MSC Zoe near the German island of Borkum, but the tide carried many of them to the south-west.
Initial images showed children's toys and TVs on Dutch beaches.
But officials said three missing containers carried a toxic powder of organic peroxide, and Dutch and German coastguards warned local people to steer clear of them.
What happened to the MSC Zoe?
The Panama-registered ship is described as the biggest in Europe, with a potential cargo of 19,000 containers. 
As Storm Zeetje buffeted northern Germany with gale force winds late on Tuesday night, 270 containers of Zoe's cargo fell off the ship and into the Wadden Sea.

 An aerial view of the ship showed the disarray on board the MSC Zoe
By Wednesday morning, strong tides had already swept some of the containers on to beaches on Terschelling, Vlieland and Ameland and coastguards were scouring the sea for the others.
There were fears that other shipping could be damaged by the cargo. The Geneva-based MSC company which owns the ship has asked a salvage company to use sonar equipment to help retrieve the missing containers.
Overnight into Thursday, the MSC Zoe docked at Bremerhaven. Several containers were spotted in German waters and a further 11 were seen by the Dutch coastguard floating between the islands of Ameland and Schiermonnikoog.
How bad is the pollution?
By Thursday five Dutch islands in the Wadden Sea had seen debris from the MSC Zoe wash up on its beaches. 
On Texel, Vlieland, Terschelling, Ameland and Schiermonnikoog volunteers were helping on Thursday to clear up the mess spilt the previous day.
Among the rubbish found on Terschelling's long, sandy beaches were shoes, bags, cushions, chairs and plastic cups. Children found pink toys among the rubbish.
Volunteers had to scoop polystyrene packaging from the dunes.
Further to the east, on Schiermonnikoog, a trail of plastic rubbish, shoes and light bulbs was found on the beaches. ""This is truly a disaster. How are we going to clean this up?"" said local environmentalist Cynthia Borras. ""We were prepared for an oil disaster but not this.""
Terschelling mayor Bert Wassink feared the clean-up could take a long time. 
""We've never seen this before. It's becoming more common to see containers falling in the water but never before on this scale,"" he told public broadcaster NOS.
When the MSC Napoli ran aground off the south-west coast of England in 2007, 80 containers washed ashore. Police had to shut a local beach as people scoured the debris for motorbikes and other merchandise.
Police had to use old laws on scavenging that require people to return goods from the stricken ship.
Although some flat screen TVs were found in the debris on Wednesday, most concerns on the Dutch islands focused on the environmental damage to the area.",A big clean-up starts on five Dutch islands after a storm sweeps cargo into the sea.,2019-01-03T12:31:12Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",MSC Zoe: Islands hit as 270 containers fall off ship,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46746312,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B972/production/_105047474_051413288-1.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,storm,0

 Tens of thousands have been asked to evacuate from seaside towns and villages
Tropical storm Pabuk has begun pelting southern Thailand with rain and wind, in what is expected to be the worst storm to hit the region in 30 years.
The storm made landfall at 12:45 local time (05:45 GMT) in the province of Nakhon Si Thammarat, the Meteorological department said.
It is expected to move across southern Thailand hitting several popular tourist spots.
Thousands of people have left Koh Samui, Koh Tao and Koh Phangan islands.
While storms are common in the Gulf of Thailand at this time of year, Pabuk is the first in decades to strike during the peak holiday season.
Thailand's meteorological department said the storm will over the next days affect the south of the country ""with widespread rainfalls, and torrential downpours are possible much of the area"".
""People should beware of the severe conditions that cause forest runoffs and flash floods,"" the officials warned.

Stan Schroeder,"When you take a cool photo and share it online, do you care if it disappears tomorrow? If you don't, I'd say there's a good chance you're younger then 30. I know this because Snapchat, the popular photo-sharing app which (typically) makes your photos disappear after a while, has a predominantly young user base : 60% of its users are below 24, and 84% are under 34. Folks that are over 35 or so (me included) have a tough time understanding the appeal of Snapchat. What good is taking a nice photo if it's going to disappear? Why bother in the first place? I tried to love Snapchat but I ended up going back to Instagram, where the last couple of years of my life are neatly recorded in a long list of horribly over-processed photos. SEE ALSO: Bitcoin is a bubble waiting to burst It's unfair to describe millennials (which are loosely defined, anyways) with such a broad stroke, but I do feel this detail captures the clash of generations well. Either you get Snapchat or you don't. Either you care about yesterday's photos or you don't. As I tried to make sense of Bitcoin's price explosion, I've realized that our youth's carelessness about the past, their desire to only live in the now, might be one of the culprits. Someone that doesn't care about what happened yesterday is probably less willing to spend long hours looking at graphs comparing Bitcoin to previous bubbles. For me, investing in an asset whose price has risen 1,500 percent in less than a year is incredibly risky, no matter how optimistic you are about Bitcoin's underlying technology and what it does to financial markets. But for the Snapchat generation, risk assessment might be secondary to the desire to just ride out the hype, man. It's not just Bitcoin. In the past months, I've invested in ICOs and traded digital tokens created by companies that were little more than a few LinkedIn profiles and a fancy PowerPoint presentation. I've bought and sold digital kitties for real money. I've mingled with like-minded investors in Slack and Telegram rooms, and the one thing that most of these people — many of them young males, from what I've gathered — value more than all is hype. A startup is nothing without the hype: You can have the best engineers in the world and a working product and still lose to a company that has none of that, but it does have 5,000 members in its Slack channel. And hype wears down quickly. I've invested in the stock market a decade ago, and I know how frenzied traders can be, but this is nothing compared to this new breed of investors. Something that was huge yesterday is dead tomorrow. Sometimes, literally one hour can turn the hottest digital asset in the world, one that can earn you a tenfold profit, into a useless array of ones and zeros stored on some distributed database. The main forces that drive the price of these digital assets are FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) and FOMO (fear of missing out). The main forces that drive the price of these digital assets are FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) and FOMO (fear of missing out). Either something is hyped up and you want to catch the bandwagon before it's too late, or the tide has turned and everyone wants to get rid of it. And both FOMO and FUD can be artificially inflated. Sometimes all it takes is a couple of good-sounding statements about a crypto-startup on Reddit or 4chan's biz section, and a group of people to back it up, for an asset to skyrocket in value. Just like rare traits on those hugely popular cryptokitties, the reasons don't make much sense. Sometimes, a company is good because it comes from China. Sometimes the opposite is true. The anonymity and decentralized nature of most cryptocurrencies and their derivatives have given power to a whole new group of young investors. Not only they can help fund a startup without even knowing what venture capitalists do or what an IPO is — they can make millions disappear and reappear with social media posts. The very nature of Bitcoin plays perfectly into this sort of mindset. Bitcoin is an odd asset; part money, part store of value, part platform, it has no clear fundamentals upon which investors can base their decisions on. And with no fundamentals, you're free to do whatever you want. Think the price of $15,000 for one bitcoin is high? I've heard that when it was $15, $150 and $1,500. Who's to say it won't hit $150,000? With seemingly everyone jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon these days, including institutional investors, it's hard to chalk up Bitcoin's meteoric rise solely to the behavior patterns of millennials. But I bet it has something to do with it; I've been there from the very beginning, and I've seen how these kids invest. Yes, there have been bubbles before, but this one is a little bigger, and a little weirder, than most of them. There will be a reckoning down the line. This is real money we're talking about, and the bubble does not go on forever — it never, ever does. It's going to hurt, especially if you came to the party late. But try explaining that to someone who doesn't care whether their photo is gone tomorrow.","When you take a cool photo and share it online, do you care if it disappears tomorrow?

JONATHAN WOLFE,"As we continue to slide into fall, our days are getting shorter. Today in New York, well get only 11 hours and 18 minutes of sunlight, down from more than 15 hours in June. And depending on where you live, you may experience even less. To help New Yorkers understand just how much sun a potential building gets during the day, Localize.city, a website that uses public data to provide insight about city addresses, created a shade analysis of every building in the city. The analysis calculated the azimuth (or arc) of the sun across every facade in the city. It used 3-D building models and calculated how much sun exposure existed, factoring in the shadows cast by neighboring buildings. The analysis even differentiates although generally between lower- and higher-level apartments. The results, in the case of a building like the Port Authority Bus Terminal near Times Square, were tidbits like: If no surrounding buildings were in its path, this buildings southwest facade would get at least nine hours and five minutes of direct sunlight in the winter. But 81 percent of the sunlight is blocked from other buildings, making it fairly shaded, even relative to Manhattan. The western facade of the Whitney Museum of American Art in Lower Manhattan, on the other hand, offers great views of the sunset, according to Localize, especially in the summer, when theres plenty of golden light during the early hours of the evening.

MICHAEL WILSON and PATRICK McGEEHAN,"But interviews with experts familiar with Kennedy’s operations this weekend, as well as with scores of passengers both inside that jampacked airport and others far away, hint at the complicated story to someday come, and offer a view from within the chaotic scene. The arrival of a severe winter storm on Thursday was not a surprise. With a snowstorm ominously described as a bomb cyclone bearing down on the New York area, the Port Authority started warning about airport disruption and flight cancellations on Wednesday afternoon. On Thursday, as the snow piled up and winds strengthened, the Port Authority announced that Kennedy would temporarily shut down. At 1 p.m., it was telling travelers that it intended to resume flight activity later that day. Around the world, airlines were reading that forecast as a green light to take off for long hauls to New York City. As late as 6:20 p.m., the Port Authority was still sending out tweets that it expected to reopen Kennedy that night. But an hour later, close to 7:30 p.m., the Port Authority decided to keep Kennedy closed until Friday morning. That meant that all of the flights bound for Kennedy had to divert to other airports or turn around. The sudden, unplanned detouring of all of those planes set off a chain reaction that stretched to various continents and left Kennedy tied in knots for the next few days, with passengers stranded in overcrowded terminals and on planes. “Virtually no foreign airline canceled any flights into J.F.K.” on Thursday, said Jason Rabinowitz, a freelance aviation blogger who tracked the cascading pileup as it played out. “They all launched their aircraft, but by the time they got halfway over the Atlantic, they found out they couldn’t land at J.F.K.” As an example, Mr. Rabinowitz cited Iberia Flight 6253, which got halfway to New York from Madrid before making a U-turn and going back to Spain: an eight-hour fight to nowhere. Norwegian Air Flight 7019 made a similar journey Thursday night en route to New York from France. “That was kind of weird,” said Mona Bismuth, 27, a passenger. “We turned around at the southern tip of Greenland.” A passenger on a different flight was sent back to Moscow — twice — because of what was happening in New York. When Kennedy gradually reopened on Friday, the airlines started sending their diverted planes on to Kennedy. The airport’s runways could handle the traffic, but some of its terminals were quickly overwhelmed with planes arriving faster than gates could be cleared for them. That mismatch continued into Saturday, as the airlines played catch-up on the flights they had sent elsewhere or had canceled.

Kennedy Airport in New York City faced more misery on Sunday afternoon when a water main break disrupted flight schedules and closed bathrooms. A water main break in Terminal 4 sent people fleeing in a partial evacuation and left bags and suitcases in water. Entire areas of the terminal, including the heavily used bathrooms at both ends of the ground floor waiting area, were cordoned off. Outside, the taxi stand was shut down while the traffic lanes closest to the terminal were cleared.

Mr. Rossiter said he and his family “just want to get home — and now this.” The continuing chaos at the airport drew harsh condemnation from Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat of New York, who called Sunday for “a thorough review” of the airport and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to find out what went wrong, especially since Thursday’s storm had not come as a surprise. “They should have been way better prepared, plain and simple,” he said. “JFK has to follow the Boy Scouts’ motto: ‘Be prepared.’ They weren’t.” Mr. Schumer said he wanted to know what would be done to prevent this from happening again with more cold weather on the horizon.

SIMON ROMERO,"Mr. Jeys said he gave his debit card to a radio reporter who recently made it through the roadblocks to survey Paradise. The reporter returned with several packs of Pall Malls, his preferred brand of cigarettes, and some mouthwash. For sustenance, Mr. Jeys said that members of work crews in Paradise had given him sandwiches and bottles of water. Theyve also doled out other essentials, like batteries and bags of cat food. He repeatedly praised the generosity of those going house to house in the town looking for the remains of missing people who may have died in the fire. Since the fire hit, Mr. Jeys said he found himself grappling with feelings of guilt and bewilderment. He said he had listened to radio reports on the staggering number of people who died in the fire, now at 83, as well the hundreds listed as missing.

The agency warned residents in Florida and Alabama of the risk of storm surges, damaging winds and flash flooding. Gov Scott warned in a news conference that Hurricane Michael is a ""massive storm that could bring total devastation to parts of our state, especially in the panhandle"". He added that its predicted to be ""the most destructive storm to hit the Florida panhandle in decades"". Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged. Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h Houses suffer damage, severe flooding Storm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h Some roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses. Storm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+ Serious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland.

ZACHARY WOOLFE,"That blossoming has happened largely on her own. Ms. Rachvelishvilis last teacher built her technique but always wanted more, more, more voice.
But I wanted more nuances, she said. I wanted more pianos soft dynamics. I wanted to learn how to do piano. And he would go, No, no, no, piano is dangerous, dont do piano. But I was like, I need to do piano. I cant sing everything loud.
Breaking with him, she embraced the letter of the score. A role like Azucena, often bludgeoned to death with sheer volume, became in her performance a kaleidoscope of colors and textures, revealing a more varied and affecting character than the single-mindedly grim standard portrayal.
If you do it like its written, its beautiful, she said. And then people go, Oh, she does something different. No! I just do what is written.
She shares that scrupulous attention to detail with Mr. Muti. She understood me immediately, he said of their first collaboration, on Verdis Requiem last year, pinpointing a single technical element in that work as key to her magic. In the Lux Eterna, the voice goes to the F sharp, and its a passaggio note for the mezzo-soprano a note between vocal registers. And she went in such a smooth way, such a wonderful way, without changing color. That was the thing that impressed me. She followed all the intention that I had, that we had rehearsed, with such dedication.
In addition to Aida, the two plan to revisit Verdis Requiem next summer at the Salzburg Festival and to record Mascagnis Cavalleria Rusticana. Ms. Rachvelishvili is also working on more French roles, including Didon in Berliozs Les Troyens and Charlotte in Massenets Werther. At the Met, she will sing Amneris in a coming new production of Aida directed by Michael Mayer.

Well, turns out this is a very real risk and youll likely have to reconsider your rainy day activities. Why, exactly? Well, if lightning were to strike an electrical pole, it would unleash a surge of power that would fry everything in its path.
As CNET mentions, anything plugged into a wall in North America is designed to use 129 volts, and at their maximum, up to 169 volts. A surge would mean millions of voltsso its safe to say your flat screen or fridge will never see the light of day again.
But this begs another important question: Just how often does this actually happen? Theres not a ton of research as to the number of power surges caused by storms (though in 2014, a thunderstorm erupted in a widespread power surge in an area of Chicago, affecting some 244 residents and permanently damaging furnaces, air conditioning outlets, and furnaces in its wakeit happened again to the same neighborhood in 2018).
 Meanwhile, we do know thunderstorms are very frequent. There are some 100,000 thunderstorms a year in the U.S., and at any given moment, there are 2,000 thunderstorms taking place in the world, according to the The National Severe Storms Laboratory. And even the Department of Homeland Security recommends that you unplug unnecessary electronics when a storm comes in.

So what should you do when you hear about a thunderstorm rearing its ugly head on the weather forecast? For one, unplug electronics before a thunderstorm, not during one (otherwise, you might experience a power surge firsthand). The National Weather Service even recommends avoiding taking a bath or shower during a storm, likely so you dont risk a surge coming into contact with the water. 
You dont have to unplug all electronics, however. You can and should keep any electronics on that help you obtain weather information (of course, an unplugged laptop would be fine, too). Stay away from any plugged-in cables or wires, though. 
And as for surge protectors, these arent meant to withstand the voltage of a storm, as CNET notedso unplugging your Xbox is still your best bet so that you can play Fortnite another day.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"Dear Diary: I was on an M86 bus heading west toward Central Park. As usual, the riders were insulating themselves against the world around them in one way or another. At Third Avenue, there was a noise. “Look, Daddy!” a child said to her father, pointing down. An egg carton had fallen out of a woman’s bag, off her lap and onto the floor. The eggs were rolling around every which way, up and down the aisle and underneath the seats. Yet none of them broke, and the woman seemed strangely unperturbed. Looking around, she realized what we were all thinking. “They’re all hard-boiled!” she said. Then, like a SWAT team, the people on the bus sprang into action. A man who had been dreamily stroking his beard dived for a couple of the eggs as they glided by. “Call you back!” a young woman said into her phone, putting it into her pocket and scooping up an egg as it rolled over her toe. A poodle yipped at a wayward egg meandering toward its owner, who captured it between her high heels and retrieved it daintily between two fingers. Within a few blocks, the bus was transformed into a rolling hub of community action. And before the driver could say “Madison Avenue,” all dozen eggs had been accounted for and returned to their owner, with much laughter and good will.","Monday: What to expect this week from the storm, and a month of subway delays.",2018-09-17T10:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Hurricane Florence Effects,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/nyregion/new-york-today-hurricane-florence-effects.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/nyregion/17nytoday1/merlin_143732445_abce1b3e-a9be-4dd6-ad37-272a12ec0598-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,storm,0

RICHARD FAUSSET,"‘We are bracing for a hard hit’ Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina said that the lanes of two major divided highways — Interstate 26 and U.S. 501 — would be reversed to make them one-way, carrying traffic only away from the coast for the mandatory evacuations starting at noon on Tuesday, and that two other routes might also be reversed if needed. Schools and state offices in the lower half of the state will be closed. “We know that this evacuation order I’m issuing is going to be inconvenient for some people,” the governor said. “We do not want to risk one South Carolina life in this hurricane.” In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper asked President Trump on Monday to declare a federal state of emergency for his state. In coastal Dare County, the local emergency management agency announced a mandatory evacuation for all residents and visitors on Hatteras Island, the long, slender barrier island off the North Carolina coast, with a similar order to go into effect Tuesday for the rest of the county. Schools in 17 counties were expected to be closed on Tuesday. “The forecast places North Carolina in the bull’s-eye of Hurricane Florence, and the storm is rapidly getting stronger,” Governor Cooper said. “When weather forecasters tell us ‘life-threatening,’ we know it’s serious. We are bracing for a hard hit.” A double threat, supercharged by climate change Hurricane Florence presents a double threat to the region, said J. Marshall Shepherd, a meteorologist and professor of geography at the University of Georgia. First, the coast faces high winds and storm surge from a powerful direct hit. But farther inland, he added, the probability of severe flooding is high if the storm stalls for several days once it makes landfall, as predicted. “The models are suggesting something very similar to what we saw with Harvey,” Professor Shepherd said, referring to last year’s catastrophic flooding in Houston and elsewhere. “This is another example of a one-two-punch storm,” he said. And although people generally prepare for coastal damage, they may underestimate the flooding threat. Graphic The storm strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane as it continued on a path toward North Carolina and South Carolina, where it could make landfall by the end of the week. “People have a hard time internalizing, preparing for something that’s outside their realm of experience,” he said. But Florence could bring conditions that people have not seen in their lifetimes. “It’s a dire situation that I believe is setting up,” he said. Climate change is leading to more destructive storms in a number of ways, Professor Shepherd noted. “When we have a storm like Florence, it’s certainly going to be shoving higher sea levels onto the coastline,” he said. Although he said he was wary of linking individual storms to climate change, he added that scientific research laid out in authoritative documents like the National Climate Assessment of 2015 state that a warming climate increases the likelihood of “rainier storms,” with an increased risk of flooding. Other scientific research suggests that Florence is part of the trend of storms affected by climate change. A 2014 study in the journal Nature shows a “poleward migration” of intense storms, and further research links climate change to a “wavier” jet stream, which could contribute to weakened steering currents, a phenomenon that kept Hurricane Harvey over Houston and could stall Florence over the Carolinas, as well. Schools and government offices closing Schools were scheduled to close Tuesday in large swaths of North and South Carolina, with many of them set to serve as shelters for people fleeing the hurricane. In South Carolina, Governor McMaster issued an executive order Monday closing all state offices and public schools, including state colleges, universities and technical colleges, in 26 counties threatened by Hurricane Florence. The closings would affect more than 430,000 students in kindergarten through high school, said Ryan Brown, a spokesman for the state education department. Schools on higher ground that have been designated as shelters will be serving food and staffed by the American Red Cross and other relief workers, he said. Although South Carolina schools are experienced at dealing with hurricanes, this one is expected to be the most challenging the state has seen in a long time, Mr. Brown said. “This is the strongest hurricane we’ve had since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. That was a direct hit to Charleston, Category 4.” In North Carolina, schools in 17 eastern counties were expected to close, said Graham H. Wilson, a spokesman for the state’s department of public instruction. Most of those closures were set to begin Tuesday, but some were scheduled for Wednesday, and the timing of others was still to be announced. “We do anticipate more closings, once the path and severity of the storm is more certain,” Mr. Wilson said. Shelves emptied; homes, pets and iconic cows secured People in the Carolinas shared photos on social media of long lines and empty shelves as they shopped for groceries, propane and other storm supplies.

 The wreckage was brought to the surface and the ship's cargo of copper plates laid out
It is being hailed as a lucky accident, after salvage teams searching for containers that fell off a ship in a storm discovered a 16th Century shipwreck on the North Sea floor.
The ship, dating back to 1540, was filled with a cargo of copper plates and some of them were put on display on Wednesday when the find was revealed.
It was owned by the Fugger family, one of Europe's richest banking families.
The wreck is being described as ""the missing link"" in shipping construction.
""It's the way the ship was built that's very interesting because you have to think 100 years later the Netherlands was in the middle of its Golden Age - and this ship is from a transition period,"" maritime archaeologist Martijn Manders told the BBC.
Although it is still on the seabed, divers intend to revisit the ship during the summer. It is considered to be the oldest seafaring ship ever found in Dutch waters.
How the ship was found
When 345 containers fell from merchant ship MSC Zoe into the North Sea during a storm on 2 January, some spilled on to land in the next days, but many more remained in the sea.
Media captionFootage filmed by the Dutch coastguard shows precariously balanced containers on board the MSC Zoe.
As salvage teams scoured the Dutch North Sea, their sonar equipment found an unknown object on the seabed a few miles to the north of the island of Terschelling in the Wadden Sea.

 Seals from the Fugger family on copper plates brought to the surface
What they discovered
A full underwater expedition is yet to be carried out, but so far the salvage teams have lifted some of the copper cargo along with three wooden planks and 12 wooden ribs from the ship's frame.
Underwater archaeologist Martijn Manders said the early 16th Century ship marked a period of transition in medieval history, when shipbuilders moved away from the traditional clinker-type model of overlapping timber.
This ship too had elements of the old period, but featured the newer carvel system, with a hull made of planks flush at the seams.
Experts believe the 30m by 7m ship could have been carrying as much as 5,000kg (five tonnes) of copper.
Image copyrightCultural Heritage AgencyImage caption
 Timber recovered from the wreck is still in good condition
""It was filled with copper plates, which have the stamp of the Fugger family - one of the richest families in the world,"" said Mr Manders, who traced the cargo's route from the family's copper mines in modern-day Slovakia and up the River Vistula to the Polish port of Gdansk. 
Its ultimate destination was the major port of Antwerp, in Belgium.
""They were financing emperors and kings so they were enormously rich. They pushed away the Hanseatic traders so they hired Dutch ships to avoid working with them.""
A copper expert from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has identified the chemical substance in the cargo as identical to the first copper coins used in the Netherlands.
Copper coins were at the time being developed as a lower-cost alternative to gold and silver, and it now appears that copper from the mines in Slovakia was being used as currency in the Netherlands.
The find was put on display by the Netherlands' Cultural Heritage Agency on Wednesday, and Mr Manders said law enforcement officials had been asked to secure the wreck site.

She's unlikely to feature on many lists of the all-time top British cultural icons. 
But Peppa Pig - the UK-made children's cartoon character - is right up there with the best of them, at least in China.
With the series racking up 18 billion online views since its launch here seven years ago, the story of Peppa and her unfeasibly English middle-class family is, arguably, doing more for Brand Britain than the Beatles, Manchester United and any of the culinary delights for which the UK is rightly so renowned put together.
It is then no surprise that, when a Peppa-shaped opportunity came knocking, the British powers that be seized the moment.
After watching an episode in which the precocious piglet and her friends visit the Queen in Buckingham Palace - and encourage her to join them jumping in muddy puddles - two Chinese twins posted a video message online, addressed to none other than Her Royal Majesty.
They too, like Peppa, wanted to visit her in her palace, they said.

 Dame Barbara Woodward, British ambassador to China, invited the twins to her Beijing residence
The British ambassador to China, Dame Barbara Woodward, posted her own video message in reply.
""Hello Mi Ni and Mi Ai,"" she said. ""I'm the British ambassador, so I'm the Queen's representative in China.
""I'd like you to come and visit me in my house in Beijing,"" she went on, ""and we can perhaps have tea and scones in a British style.""
The post has been viewed more than nine million times in China - a multiple of 10 times more views than anything else Dame Barbara has posted in her entire four years as ambassador.

 The twins might travel to the UK next
And so it was that two slightly bewildered five-year-olds found their way to her residence and munched on scones and chocolate cake, and sat colouring in pictures of Peppa Pig, in front of the assembled media.
""Do you think that the Queen really has muddy puddles in her garden?"" I asked them.
 They nodded. It is a big garden after all.
 The whole experience may not have been quite the same as the real deal, but they have also been promised a trip to the UK where they will, at least, get to see Buckingham Palace.
And the British embassy has launched a competition along with Youku - the online channel with the Chinese rights to Peppa Pig - the young winners of which will also join the twins for the trip.

 Peppa Pig tattoos have become the symbol of a certain counter-culture in China
The whole Peppa phenomenon, it must be said, has a bit of a dark side in China.
A couple of years ago, pictures began to appear online of people sporting Peppa Pig tattoos.
She appeared to have become the chosen symbol for a counter-culture known as ""shehuiren"" - literally ""society people"".
Early last year, one popular Chinese streaming site, Douyin, began removing Peppa videos en masse.
The nationalist, Communist Party-controlled tabloid Global Times described Shehuiren as people who are ""poorly educated with no stable job"" and ""unruly slackers roaming around and the antithesis of the young generation the party tries to cultivate"".
But Peppa has survived this brush with subversion.
A new Peppa Pig movie - made especially for the Chinese market - is due to be launched this coming Chinese New Year.
It is a collaboration between China's Alibaba Pictures and Canada's Entertainment One; although still made in the UK, Peppa Pig is now owned by the Canadian company.
The viral trailer for the film - which artfully grafts the story of Peppa onto seasonal themes of Chinese family and belonging - has received more than 300 million hits to date.
With the need for stronger ties with major economies in a post-Brexit world, I asked the UK ambassador whether she thought that a certain pink pig was proving rather more adept at it than British politicians.
""I wouldn't put it quite as zero sum as that, to be honest,"" Dame Barbara laughs in reply.
There are three components to good UK-China ties, she tells me - a strong government-to-government relationship, a strong business-to-business relationship and a strong people-to-people relationship.
""Peppa Pig is as much a part of the latter as the Royal Family, Wimbledon, the Premier League and all the other things we think of when we think of soft power.""
With cute twins, a great British-made product, and massive Chinese media exposure, she must be wishing all UK-China diplomacy could end so happily.

Victoria Song,"Its 2018. A storm is raging down the Eastern coast of the U.S., my smartphone can do almost anything I ask it, and yet Im still expected to physically haul myself down to the polls. I diddespite what you might believe about millennials. I believe in swiping right on democracy. Still, while slogging through sleepiness and the cold November rain for my I Voted sticker, I couldnt help wonder why the entire voting process is so technologically backward. While my phone can do almost anything I ask it, everything from voter registration to glitchy voting machines and ballot scanners remains dumb and stuck in the early 2000s. At its core, technology is supposed to create modern solutions to age-old problems. Credit where credit is due, the 2018 midterms have a heck of a lot more election-related technology than elections of a decade ago. For example, this election day, I can ask Alexa to tell me where my polling station is, whos running in my local races, or to give me real-time updates to races as they occur. Supposedly, itll even be able to tell me what voting yes or no on specific referendums might mean. And if I want my eyes to bleed, I can tune into ABC for full 360-degree coverage in augmented reality because graphs sure are more compelling when theyre in 3D. The thing is, this isnt the election technology I was hoping for in the 18 years since confusing, janky paper ballots in Florida effectively gave George W. Bush the presidency. I had hoped that, by now, wed be able to vote online. Not because Im lazy, but because online voting would help solve crucial problems like Americas dismal voter turnout, eliminate weather as a consideration, and make it so no one has to choose between getting to their jobs or participating in democracy. My entire life is online. Actually, my entire life can be condensed to the 4.7 inch screen of my iPhone 7. Heck, everything Alexa and ABCs augmented reality graphics can offer, I can just google while waiting in line to vote. I can write an entire post about a candidate, what they stand for, and snap a ballot selfie to plaster over my social media feeds all from my phone. I just... cant vote from my phone unless Im serving overseas in the military and even then the details of the process are dependent by state. (Although, if youre smart, youll vote absentee.) Speaking of state discrepancies, you cant even register online in every state. So far, only 37 states and the District of Columbia let you register online. Of the states that do offer online registration, 10 implemented online registration in just the last two years. And while in-person voting isnt hard, bad experiences caused by outdated tech can call entire elections into question. Glitchy voting machines riddled with outdated software are already casting a cloud over the legitimacy of this years Texas and Georgia races. Its idiotic that we can broadcast election coverage in AR but cant figure out how to build voting machines that work. And its not just paperless voting machines. Error-prone ballot scanners can also throw a wrench into the whole voting experience. While casting my vote, the ballot scanner rejected my perfectly filled out bubbles four times before accepting it. Fellow Gizmodo reporter Jennings Brown had a worse time. At a packed polling station, Brown said, voters kept fidgeting with their ballots, thus bending them, which led to paper jams and massive delays. My ballot wasnt the only one that jammed the machineI saw several other voters also getting jammed. Two poll workers basically dismantled the machine in front of me and ripped out my ballot. I had to get back in three lines to fill out a new ballot and submit it more gingerly, says Brown. Yeesh. So why cant I just skip the lines and vote from my phone? There is a slew of valid reasons. Russian hackers, voter fraud, insecure connections on voting machines, and the annoying fact that all 50 states do things differently just cause this is America. In particular, voter verification is a unique challenge in the U.S. considering our lack of reliable authentication infrastructure. But at the same time, its sad the same paper ballots that caused so much confusion in 2000 are still the best answer we have today when other technology has come so far. Its especially irksome when Australia, Canada, Estonia, Finland, France, Norway, and a few other countries have at least explored the idea of internet voting. In Estonia, where citizens have a digital national ID card, more than 30 percent of voters cast their ballots online, according to the BBC. Crucially, those digital ID cards are key to authenticating votersand if it takes a smart government ID card for me to vote from the comfort of my bed and pajamas, Ill do it. Security and maintaining anonymity are other obstacles facing online votingand Im not discounting the technological challenges of ensuring accurate yet secure ballot counts. But these days, I can pay for my GrubHub order with my face or fingerprint. I can mobile deposit a check on my phone to my bank with nothing more than a poorly lit photo. The political gutters that are my Facebook and Twitter feeds tell me exactly how my friends, family, co-workers, and my exs one racist uncle voted. It doesnt seem like science fiction to think the brainiacs in Silicon Valley can figure out a way to authenticate my ballot using the Apple Watch to measure my unique heartbeat or something. None of these emerging technologies helped me in 2018. I still had to roll out of bed and miserably wait in line like everybody else. Its definitely not going to happen by 2020 or even 2024. But maybe by 2028? By then I will be 40, supposedly have my shit together, and hopefully, election technology will too.","It’s 2018.

MAGGIE ASTOR,"Multiple studies have shown that bad weather on Election Day can decrease turnout, which in turn tends to help Republicans, because the groups most likely to be deterred from voting are those that tend to vote Democratic. But a more recent study, published last November in the journal American Politics Research, found that the political effects of Election Day storms may go beyond turnout. Among voters who do turn out, one of the studys co-author said, slightly more tend to vote Republican when the weather is bad. Not just whether to vote but how to vote can be influenced by the weather, said the co-author, Yusaku Horiuchi, a professor of government at Dartmouth. When the weather is bad, peoples mood is affected. People tend to be more risk-averse. When people become more risk-averse, people are more likely to be more conservative, and therefore theyre likely to vote for the Republicans instead of the Democrats. This effect is small, Professor Horiuchi emphasized. He and his co-author, Woo Chang Kang of Australian National University in Canberra, estimated that about 1 percent of voters were liable to change their mind because of bad weather, which can translate into an increase of approximately three percentage points in a Republican candidates vote share enough, in theory, to tip the balance of a close race. Though it is broadly accepted as true that bad weather can depress turnout, and that lower turnout tends to benefit Republicans, this is not something Republicans tend to publicly acknowledge. At a rally in Toms River, N.J., on Monday, though, Bob Hugin, a Republican challenging the Democratic incumbent, Senator Robert Menendez, openly called the predicted rain Republican weather.","Signs for candidates in Florida, the farthest south a strong cold front could cause rain and wind on Election Day.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Forecasters say the hurricane will certainly hit the US coastline Evacuations have been ordered as the US East Coast braces for Hurricane Florence - in what may be the strongest storm to hit the region in two decades. South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia have declared states of emergency, and residents are stocking up on essential supplies. Officials say Florence is now a category three storm with 115mph (183km/h) winds, and gaining strength. It is expected to strike the Carolinas by Thursday. Florence - which was 1,200 miles (2,000km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina, on Monday morning - could reach category four as its draws strength from the warm Atlantic waters, say forecasters. It would be the first category three storm to hit the region since Fran ravaged North Carolina 1996. It would be the first East Coast hurricane since Jeanne struck Florida in 2004. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) says Florence may bring catastrophic levels of rain and flooding to coastal and inland regions. The National Weather Service warned it may be ""an extremely dangerous major hurricane"" by the time it made landfall. Image copyright Reuters Image caption International Space Station by astronaut Ricky Arnold took this photo of Florence on 6 September The Miami-based NHC said: ""There is an increasing risk of life-threatening impacts from Florence: storm surge at the coast, freshwater flooding from a prolonged and exceptionally heavy rainfall event inland, and damaging hurricane-force winds."" The agency called Florence an ""extremely dangerous"" weather event. ""Somebody is going to suffer devastating damage if this storm continues as it is currently forecast,"" National Weather Service meteorologist Dan Miller told The State newspape r in South Carolina. States of emergency North Carolina officials on Monday ordered residents to evacuate the state's Outer Banks barrier islands.

Red flag warnings are keeping swimmers off beaches, as residents sandbag their homes in the communities of Myrtle Beach in South Carolina, and the Outer Banks in North Carolina. ""Literally, they are filling buggies full of water, shopping carts full of water,"" Ryan Deeck, grocery department manager at a Walmart, told The Sun News in Myrtle Beach. Naval preparations Naval Station Norfolk, the largest naval installation in the world, is preparing to send ships away from bases to weather the storm out at sea. Two other hurricanes are currently churning in the Atlantic Ocean. Hurricanes Isaac and Helene are expected to accelerate over the next several hours, but at this point, are not expected to threaten the US mainland. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged.

Mariella Moon,"Graeme Stephens, director of the Center of Climate Sciences at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, explained: ""We don't have any way of measuring how water and air move in thunderstorms globally. We just don't have any information about that at all, yet it's so essential for predicting severe weather and even how rains will change in a future climate."" While small, the RainCube isn't so tiny that scientists can let loose a bunch inside a raging hurricane à la the sensors in Twister. It works by using radar to see storms in the same way a bat uses sonar to fly around in the dark. RainCube has an umbrella-like component that sends out chirps or radar signals, which then bounce off raindrops to paint a picture of what the inside of a storm looks like. The RainCube team created it as an experiment to see if it's possible to create a weather radar in the form of a tiny low-cost satellite. ""The radar signal penetrates the storm, and then the radar receives back an echo,"" Principal Investigator Eva Peral said. ""As the radar signal goes deeper into the layers of the storm and measures the rain at those layers, we get a snapshot of the activity inside the storm."" In the future, multiple units could work together to monitor hurricanes/typhoons in real time and send back updates every few minutes. Scientists could then use the data they gather to enhance weather models, so we can improve our ability to predict the movement of rain, snow, sleet and hail and make more accurate weather forecasts.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","After a sluggish start to eastern Pacific hurricane season, the basin is making up for lost time. Hurricane Bud is the second of back-to-back major hurricanes to form in less than a week. The Category 3 storm is currently churning toward Baja California, though it’s thankfully forecast to weaken before likely landfall this weekend. As of 3 a.m. local time this morning, Bud was still picking up steam roughly 235 miles south of Manzanillo, Mexico. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) put Bud’s winds at 115 mph, making it a Category 3 storm. That’s the threshold for classifying storms as major hurricanes. Meteorologist Ryan Maue tweeted a more recent satellite image with data indicating Bud had reached Category 4 strength with winds around 132 mph. Either way, it’s quite a difference from how the storm looked yesterday. At 4 a.m. local time on Sunday, Bud had winds of just 50 mph, making it a moderate tropical storm. But just as Aletta before it, Bud underwent rapid intensification thanks to warm waters and low wind shear. Rapid intensification is a term used when a storm’s winds increase 65 mph in less than 24 hours. The outer bands of Bud’s winds could reach Mexico, prompting the NHC to issue tropical storm watches from Manzanillo north to the Puerto Vallarta area. The agency also forecast that up to 10 inches of rain could fall in isolated locations on Tuesday and “cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides.” From there, Bud will continue to lumber northward. While the storm is expected to strengthen a bit more in the next day or two, it will then begin gradually decaying as it moves over cooler waters. It could reach Baja California near Los Cabos by Saturday as a tropical storm where floods and mudslides could again be a concern. From there, Bud or its remnants could push into the Southwest. While it’s too early to forecast what locations could be impacted or when they could get hit, it’s worth remembering that tropical systems can bring major flash flooding to the region, so keep an eye out as the forecast develops. The remnants of Hurricane Newton reached Arizona in September 2016, the last time a tropical system impacted the Southwest. Eastern Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 without much fanfare. But the season has since gotten much more active. Bud follows Hurricane Aletta last week. That storm whipped up into a Category 4 hurricane on Friday, thankfully posing no threat to land. Aletta has since been downgraded to a tropical storm and is meandering westward into the Pacific as it weakens. No other storms appear to be on the horizon, but the next one that forms and attains a name will be Carlotta.","After a sluggish start to eastern Pacific hurricane season, the basin is making up for lost time.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Surely you’re aware of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot. The violent storm is the planet’s most noticeable feature, defining Jupiter in the same way that Saturn is defined by its rings, and Earth is defined by its yapping apes. There’s so much still to learn about this gas giant, and the yapping apes of Earth have the tools to do it. New results from the Juno probe have revealed data about the depth, temperature, and evolution of the spot. And it’s thick. The Great Red spot is a swirling storm with wind speeds between 270 to 425 miles per hour (270-685 km/hr). It’s wider than the Earth’s diameter. But the new Juno results have added that it’s probably 200 miles (320 km) deep, too—10 to 100 times thicker than the Earth’s crust. Scientists announced these new results at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans yesterday. On top of that, the spot is definitely shrinking, according to a NASA press release. The new measurements indicate that the storm has shrunk by a third in width and an eighth in height since 1979. Juno arrived at Jupiter back on July 4, 2016 after leaving Earth in 2011. It first passed over the Great Red Spot this past summer. The probe contains a suite of tools, and the most recent revelations came from its Microwave Radiometer—a device built specifically to peer deep into the planet’s atmosphere. The instrument’s ultimate goal is to understand the mysterious nature of the planet’s atmosphere beneath the clouds. Things haven’t been perfect for the probe—an October malfunction caused a setback that prevented the craft from reducing its orbital period. Scientists have still been able to publish a whole lot of research on the planet though, including nearly 50 papers back in May detailing just how weird the planet is. The science continues to flow today. Researchers at the AGU conference are discussing comparisons between Jupiter’s and Earth’s aurorae, and measurements of the planet’s gravitational field to understand its internal structure, and analysis of its magnetosphere. And if you still need your Jupiter fix after all that science, there’s always JunoCam’s incredible Jovian images, too. [ via NASA ]","Surely you’re aware of Jupiter’s Great Red Spot.

Miriam Kramer,"The hardest working rover on Mars is fighting for its robotic life on the red planet. NASA announced on Friday that the Opportunity rover is currently being hit by the worst dust storm it's ever experienced in the 15 years since it landed on Mars. ""A dark, perpetual night has settled over the rover's location in Mars' Perseverance Valley,"" NASA said in a statement. SEE ALSO: 10-Year-Old Opportunity Rover Is Still Finding Crazy Stuff on Mars Scientists are worried the rover won't survive this storm, but there's still hope. On Sunday, Opportunity phoned home, sending a transmission to engineers back on Earth. This means the rover had enough power to send a message despite the fact that the sun was blotted out by dust, preventing a full charge to its solar panels. The storm is actually 7 million square miles across, meaning that it's larger than North America, according to NASA. Since the storm began bearing down on Opportunity, the rover has started conserving energy by ending science operations and only using minimal power to keep it warm during the tempest. This storm is bad, but Opportunity is made of hardy stuff. The rover was only designed to last 90 days, yet here we are more than a decade later, a still-functioning Opportunity on Mars. Keeping watch over the rover Scientists working with the rover and many others have become attached to the intrepid space robot. They're hoping for the best. Oppy’s ops team has really bonded this week. We’ve cried together, we’ve cheered at beeps together, we’ve made silly memes together, and so much more. I honestly am so proud of this team for coming together.

""The storm's atmospheric opacity — the veil of dust blowing around, which can blot out sunlight — is now much worse than a 2007 storm that Opportunity weathered,"" NASA said. ""The previous storm had an opacity level, or tau, somewhere above 5.5; this new storm had an estimated tau of 10.8 as of Sunday morning."" On MER, we call optical depth tau, since tau is what you solve for in the equation. It’s a measurement essentially of how much solar radiation is hitting our solar panels. The value we measured this morning was 10.8. To give context, average non dust storm values are 0.5-1. — Keri Bean (@PlanetaryKeri) June 11, 2018 This might be bad math, but a tau of 10.8 is 0.002% of sunlight reaching the surface. That's equivalent to a 11.5 magnitude difference, so the brightness of the Sun at midday is about -14. That's about one lux, which is the brightness of rural night sky on a moonless night. https://t.co/eDwR3mGNoP — Justin Cowart (@jccwrt) June 11, 2018 The main concern NASA has with this kind of tempest is that the rover's batteries will get too cold and it won't be able to function once the dust storm ends.

"Judson Jones, CNN","(CNN) A significant winter storm is taking shape Friday over the Southern Plains and Texas and will spread this weekend through the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. How far south freezing air will reach remains an open question, making it difficult to precisely forecast ice and snow accumulation. Where it happens, dangerous travel conditions and power outages are possible. Winter storm watches and advisories already are in place for more than 12 million people in portions of states from New Mexico to North Carolina. As the storm develops, forecast models will more accurately predict the freezing line and thus the type of precipitation places will experience, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. Here is what CNN meteorologists expect, where and when: Timing: Friday morning through Saturday evening Precipitation begins with freezing rain and drizzle in the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma and possibly into central Oklahoma. Main winter weather impacts occur late Friday, with a quick transition from a wintry mix to snow after midnight for the Texas Panhandle and West Texas and several inches of rain through Friday night across much of southeast Texas. If precipitation makes it into eastern Oklahoma, it won't turn to snow until later Saturday. Impacts: Snow, ice and f looding rain Snowfall in Texas will likely be in the 2- to 4-inch range but could reach 6 inches. Southern and eastern Texas can expect a lot of rain impacting major cities, including Dallas, Austin, San Antonio and Houston. Nearly 20 million people are under a flood or flash flood watch or warning in eastern Texas. San Antonio and Houston could see flash flooding, as rainfall total could reach 3 to 6 inches, with as much as 10 inches in isolated spots. Oklahoma City may end up being on the line between dry and wet air. Still, there is a chance for some wintry weather in central Oklahoma, with snow accumulation of 1 to 4 inches and possibly one-10th of an inch of ice from Lubbock, Texas, to Oklahoma City. Tulsa, Oklahoma, will see some ice, as well as snow of 1 to 2 inches. Arkansas and western Tennessee Timing: Friday afternoon through Saturday Most Arkansans won't feel precipitation until later Friday, with winter weather beginning in the overnight hours and moving east Saturday morning toward Tennessee. Impacts: Flooding rains, wintry mix, mountain snow The southern half of Arkansas will get caught up in a similar situation as East Texas, with 4 to 5 inches of rain and flash flooding possible. Central Arkansas looks to only pick up, at most, 1 inch of snow. Meantime the higher elevations of the Ozark Mountains will likely see 2 to 6 inches of snow on top of a glaze of ice up to a quarter of an inch. Snow totals will be lower in northeastern Arkansas and northwestern Tennessee, where a trace to 1 inch of snow is possible. Eastern Tennessee, northern Georgia and the Carolinas Timing: Saturday morning through Monday morning Precipitation creeps in early Saturday, with rain in Georgia and some light, wintry precipitation in the mountains. It picks up Saturday afternoon, when blizzard conditions are possible in the higher Appalachians, with larger accumulations Sunday into early Monday morning across the zone. The storm on Monday probably will move out to sea, but it also could turn and climb up the East Coast, bringing heavy snow to major metro areas. Impacts: Record snow, blizzard conditions, wintry mix Significant snow is expected -- but not certain -- across the mountains of northeast Georgia and North and South Carolina. Estimates range from 1 foot to almost 2 feet in the mountains and foothills west of Interstate 85. Parts of North Carolina could see record snowfall, described by the National Weather Service called a ""once-in-a-generation event."" That includes Winston-Salem and Asheville, which could get a foot of snow; Raleigh, with 1 to 2 inches possible; and Charlotte. Greenville, South Carolina is likely to get 1 inch of snow. While most forecast models keep the winter precipitation tucked into Carolinas, one shows possible freezing rain reaching down the I-85 corridor on Sunday night into Monday to Atlanta, which also could get a dusting of snow Monday afternoon. Snow totals east of I-85 will on depend on a regional weather phenomenon called ""cold-air damming"" or ""the wedge"" -- when cold air pushes in from the northeast against the Appalachians. The mountain range acts as a dam, keeping the cold air pooled like a lake. Warmer air in this scenario would reduce snow accumulation. There's another phenomenon called a ""warm nose"" that would allow warmer air to mix in above the ""'wedge,"" bringing a more wintry mix Saturday evening and overnight into Sunday morning before snow moves in northwest of I-85.

"Holly Yan, CNN","(CNN) Deserts aren't supposed to get much rain, but Tropical Storm Rosa is flipping the script. Rosa is forecast to make landfall early Tuesday with more than 11 million people under a flash flood watch in the Southwest, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said. It'll drench Baja California with 3 to 6 inches of rain, with some spots getting up to 10 inches, the National Hurricane Center said. As it moves northeast, Rosa will also dump 2 to 4 inches of rain on much of Arizona, with up to 6 inches in the mountains. A flash flood watch is in effect for parts of Arizona until Wednesday as the storm's remnants move across the state, the National Weather Service said. ""These rainfall amounts may produce life-threatening flash flooding,"" the National Hurricane Center said. ""Dangerous debris flows and landslides are also possible in mountainous terrain."" Historically, it's unusual for the US Southwest to get pummeled by a hurricane or tropical storm. But ""these events have begun to increase in recent years,"" CNN meteorologist Gene Norman said. Research indicates that global warming contributes to tropical storms getting ""more intense, bigger and longer-lasting, thereby increasing their potential for damage,"" said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. While there might not be a direct link between global warming and the recent increase of severe storms in the US Southwest, ""it is possible that this could be a side effect of climate change,"" Norman said. ""Warmer oceans are allowing eastern Pacific storms to reach higher latitudes,"" he said. ""This was not the case earlier. It was quite rare for an eastern Pacific storm to even reach Baja California, and this is now becoming more common."" Rosa was about 75 miles (125 kilometers) North of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, late Monday night, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h).

Bijan Stephen,"Social media is increasingly the internet: Facebook was founded in 2004, and it ate the web as we knew it then — a collection of microsites and curiosities run by so many individual proprietors, individually. It used to be that personalization was what you did to your site; now it’s found in the ads you’re served. Peach — the microblogging platform— was seemingly designed against those circumscribed possibilities, as an antidote to the weird world-eating dominion of the Twitters and Facebooks and Instagrams of the universe. Its whole purpose was to bring people back to the early days of online, when the only limits were in what you could code. To describe it in a line: Peach is an online diary that you can share with your friends, like LiveJournal and Tumblr before it. Peach went down last week. It took a few days before the developers addressed the situation online, and in that time its users were distraught because it wasn’t clear if the app was ever coming back. (As of this writing, it’s still not back up.) It is a special place: Warm, inviting, and private, a port hidden from the chaotic storm of posts that make up the contemporary internet. I got in touch with some of those people to see what Peach meant to them, and what it felt like to face down the possibility that this safe, beautiful place might disappear. we know that peach is down right now and are working to bring it back up next week — Peach (@peachdotcool) February 8, 2019 “To say I’m bereft would be an understatement,” wrote my friend Alison, who owns an aerial gym and who was a prolific, early blogger. For the past several years, Peach has been my favorite place on the internet. Despite its clunky interface and tendency to crash, I and others have found it to be a place where we could allow ourselves to be vulnerable in a way we couldn’t anywhere else. I’ve used it to talk about my father’s declining health, my travails as a brand new business owner and aging aerialist, and my evolving sexuality. Today I mentioned to a friend that my internet support network had been down for two days and I actually cried. If it’s really and truly gone, I don’t know how I’ll fill the enormous, peach-sized hole in my life. Many people felt the same way. “I’m holding out hope that I’ll wake up tomorrow and check Peach and everything will load like nothing ever happened, but the app has been on borrowed time for so long that anything besides accepting its death feels foolish,” said Peter McCracken. “Peach felt like a refreshing breeze after being jammed into a hot and crowded subway car for two hours.” “When I first joined, Peach felt like a refreshing breeze after being jammed into a hot and crowded subway car for two hours. It was antithetical to the numbers game of accumulating followers and posting nonstop that plagued my Tumblr and Twitter circles at the time. Here was a charmingly simple app that let you curate your own space and peek in on friends.” McCracken went on, saying Peach is more of a web of interconnected diaries than it is a social network. There, he posted about the major shifts that occurred in his life — career shifts, the relationships, and the like. It was, he wrote, decidedly uncool. “I probably won’t be able to unlearn the muscle memory that made me open it in vain to check notifications on posts that are no longer there,” he wrote. “It happened five times while I was writing this.” A person who went by Crow sent me an email, where they said Peach was a place where they went to interact with other people. “I’m autistic and really have no idea to interact with people in real life & it’s a lot easier online especially on Peach,” they said. “Without Peach I wouldn’t have met my ex who is still one of my closest friends today, my art wouldn’t have improved as much, and I think I would be a lot less happy if I’m being honest.” A person named Michael wrote me, saying that they used Peach because it was isolated from the wider internet, which mean it was easier to post without consequence — unlike somewhere larger, like Facebook. “I go on there and clear the drafts for my brain, and I keep up with a few internet friends, and it’s just nice,” they said. “And like it feels trite to call something a safe space, but Peach is a motherfucking safe space!! In all the ways that twitter is not and refuses to be.” For most people, Peach seemed to be a place to mature, in the realest sense: It’s a place where the wider world doesn’t interfere, somewhere away from the seriousness of the internet at large. A woman named Helena wrote: “My time on peach roughly matches up to my first serious adult relationship (I’ve been with peach slightly longer than my partner, which is wild to think about) and I think in both my relationship with them and my relationship with my Peach friends I’ve realised how much real intimacy is based on those two things — being able to be honest about the hard stuff, and being able to be listened to on the things you don’t think are worth mentioning.” “People are (half-)joking a lot about Peach being a therapist but the time I had access to actual therapy I struggled so much with the idea of telling the truth about how I felt to a stranger, whereas I had a handful of friends I made on Peach (we had mutual friends, not total randos) who I immediately felt like there was this bond of trust with because we were both in the same boat, being honest with each other on a dusty abandoned mobile app,” she went on. That was the magic. There aren’t many open spaces left online, and there aren’t too many playgrounds left. Peach is a 1.0 app in a web 2.0 world; its architecture is nostalgic for a time we’ve left behind. Though not irrevocably, at least not yet, because it’s still around.","Peach went down last week.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image caption Mughalsarai is located about 20km from the holy city of Varanasi in northern India Mughalsarai, an iconic British-era railway station, has played an important role in India's transport history since its construction in the 19th Century. But it has been in the news recently for an entirely different reason - its name, writes the BBC's Vikas Pandey. The British built the station in 1866 to help them transport goods from northern India to port cities in the east. They named it after the town Mughalsarai and recruited hundreds of locals. In the following decades, the town and the station became synonymous with travellers and transporters. Veteran journalist Mark Tully, who has written several books about India, said the station was known as a major transportation hub and Asia's largest railway yard. ""In the days of the Raj, Mughalsarai was one of the most important stations on the East Indian Railways trunk route, coming as it did about halfway between Howrah in the east and Delhi in the north,"" he said. But more than 150 years later, the same name has stirred up political controversy. Image caption It is one of the busiest railway stations in India Image caption Several express trains stop at Mughalsarai The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh state has decided to rename the station after its ideologue Deendayal Upadhyaya, whose body was found at the junction in 1968. Authorities said all signboards would be renamed in the coming months. But opposition parties have accused the BJP of ""tinkering with history"" by changing the name of an iconic station. BJP MP Ram Charitra, who is from the region, sees nothing wrong in the decision. ""Upadhyaya is one of the most prominent philosophers of modern India and I don't think we need to defend the decision to name the station after him,"" he said. 'Victory for Hindus' But the motive and the message behind this decision seem very different for ground-level workers of the BJP, and other right-wing organisations that support the party. Pankaj Sharma, a member of the BJP in Mughalsarai, sees the decision as a ""victory for Hindus"". ""Mughalsarai is a Muslim name. Mughals were Muslim rulers and they killed so many people in India - why should any place be named after them? I am glad that the name of the station is changing,"" he said. Golu Sinha, a member of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (Global Council for Hindus), said: ""Anything that resembles Muslim barbarity on Hindus needs to go away"". Others around Mr Sinha gave him a loud cheer as he finished his sentence on an emphatic tone. Image caption Pankaj Sharma supports the decision to change the name of Mughalsarai The issue has also generated a debate, though a more nuanced one, at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) - which is located around 22km (13 miles) from Mughalsarai. Professor Manjeet Chaturvedi, the head of sociology department at the BHU, explained why some BJP workers might have ""a skewed sense of history"". ""The Mughals ruled India in most of 16th and 17th centuries. They travelled far and wide, and built several resting places - known as sarais - on important routes. Mughalsarai was one such place,"" he said. He added that some people still see Mughals as ""Muslim invaders and not rulers"". ""So I am not surprised that the name change has been politicised. In my opinion, the decision is not wrong because Upadhyaya is an icon and he needs to be honoured. But it's awful to make it a Hindu-Muslim issue,"" he said. Battle of ideologies Professor Pradeep Kumar of the BHU's law department said the government knew that it would benefit from the decision. ""I am in no doubt that it's a political decision. The Congress party named several places after the members of the powerful Nehru-Gandhi family whenever it was in power. The BJP is simply following the norm - though with a more astute agenda,"" he said. He added that party is ""killing two birds with one stone"". ""The BJP, which didn't even come close to ruling India until 1996, seems desperate to rewrite history and leave its impression, specially under the leadership of a vocal leader like [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi. Image caption The signboards at the station still say Mughalsarai. Authorities say the change will reflect in the coming months ""And when it changes a Muslim name like Mughalsarai, it definitely stands a chance to gain the votes of Hindus sympathetic to its cause in the upcoming general elections next year."" Mr Tully echoed similar thoughts. ""The only thing the government seems to me to have gained is to indicate that it's not prepared to have a Muslim name for such an important station as Mughalsarai. If the name was to be changed to celebrate a distinguished son of India, it would have been much more appropriate to name Mughalsarai after [former PM] Lal Bahadur Shastri, who was born there and was also a distinguished railway minister. ""On the other hand Deendayal Upadyaya's connection with Mughalsarai is most unfortunate. He fell to his death from a train approaching Mughalsarai Junction. It is believed that robbers pushed him out of the train."" Image caption Local economy in Mughalsarai is largely dependent on the station But Mr Charitra asserted that the BJP was not targeting Muslim names. ""It's unfortunate that some of our ground-level members and opposition parties think like that. We need to train them better. We are simply honouring heroes the Congress ignored for decades. Such decision should not be seen through a political prism,"" he said. What do locals think? The residents of Mughalsarai feel that there are bigger issues than the name of their railway station. Manorama Devi, who works as a cleaner at the station, said the name doesn't matter. ""I want the facilities to improve at the station. The employees should be paid better wages,"" she said. Image caption Manorama Devi feels the government should focus on improving facilities at the station Image caption Amar Nath says local people will continue to call it Mughalsarai Mohamed Akram, who also works as a cleaner, said: ""It's never a good idea to change history"". ""For us, Mughalsarai will always be Mughalsarai. There are other ways to honour great people than changing names of iconic places,"" he said. His colleague Amar Nath agrees. ""Mughalsarai is one of the biggest and busiest stations in India. Just because a political party is in power, it shouldn't be allowed to change the name,"" he said. ""Generations have known the station and have memories from their travels here. For them, the station will always be Mughalsarai. Just the way they changed the name of Bangalore city to Bengaluru, but people still call it Bangalore.""",A decision to rename the iconic Mughalsarai train station has sharply divided opinions.,2018-07-12T00:49:38Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Mughalsarai: Renaming British-era train station causes Indian political storm,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-44721655,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/053C/production/_102404310_eb486fa0-cb2f-442d-b167-0211ac92dedf.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,storm,0
PATRICIA MAZZEI,"“The limitation we had with Maria is we had no cash to burn,” said the governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló. Emergency managers and business leaders also are concerned about the logistics of getting aid into Puerto Rico. Maria created a bottleneck at the Port of San Juan, which slowed everything from food to electrical poles. “What am I most worried about?” Mr. Byrne said. “A ship sinks in the channel in San Juan, and we can’t bring anything.” Manuel Reyes Alfonso, executive vice president of MIDA, the island’s food industry association, said wholesale and retail businesses continued to experience delays in receiving cargo. “We are not where we’d like to be, or where we should be,” he said. He worries about a trucker shortage and about slow fuel delivery for generators. Puerto Rico had fuel after Maria, but no easy way to get it to people, leading to endless lines at gas stations and a black market for diesel sales. FEMA had to bring in a fuel barge for its operations. Food could also be scarce again, Mr. Reyes said, because Puerto Rico continues to impose a tax on inventories. Eliminating the tax could increase food stores to an average of 37 days from 26, according to a survey that the food association conducted of its members in February. A legislative effort to do away with the tax has stalled, Mr. Reyes said, in part because lawmakers have yet to figure out how to make up for the lost revenue. Photo Puerto Rico officials worry that the island remains vulnerable to another storm because repairs to the power grid have been slow in some areas, including Las Piedras. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times Rodrigo Masses, president of the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association, said he had advised businesses to double their fuel storage capacity, keep their generators in shape and designate an emergency contact off the island to relay information in the event cellphone service fails again. “We’re still not out of the crisis. If we’re hit by another hurricane like this one, we’re going to lose power again. We’re going to lose connectivity again,” he warned. “But the private sector is going to be much better prepared.” Once the Corps of Engineers departs, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa, will be tasked with completing unfinished repairs to the power grid. At a hearing last week of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in Washington, lawmakers sounded skeptical that Prepa, which has come under fierce scrutiny over its early response to the storm, is up to the job. Representative González-Colón has asked FEMA to extend the Corps’ stay. “We sure want to know that you really are ready,” Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told Prepa’s new chief, Walter Higgins, at the hearing. “We feel that we are ready,” Mr. Higgins said. But, he added, “I don’t doubt that we will have some growing pains.” In Las Piedras, which sits on the hills south of El Yunque National Forest, people who have electricity say it goes out often. “If a little bit of wind blows through, we will lose power,” said Roberto Rosado, 53, who still has metal shutters on his sliding doors. “We just lost power now. This is an everyday occurrence.” Mayor Miguel López, who is known as Micky, recently blocked two of the three power crews from leaving his town. “There was no other option,” said Mr. López, whose unorthodox strategy succeeded in keeping the linemen at work. His director of emergency management, Xavier Muñoz, said the one upside of Maria was that it had scared residents into taking hurricane plans seriously. “Shelters are going to get full,” he predicted. “I have 220 cots right now, and I think that’s not going to be enough.” Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Super Typhoon Mangkhut (known locally as Ompong) as it approaches the Philippines. GIF: CIMSS While the world watches Florence make a historic landfall in the Carolinas, there’s another storm on the other side of the planet worthy of our attention. Super Typhoon Mangkhut is the biggest, baddest storm on the planet, and it’s bearing down on the Philippines’ most populous island. After ripping apart houses in Guam like tin cans, Mangkhut—known as Ompong in the Philippines, which uses a different typhoon naming system—has continued its westward march across the Pacific. The storm is packing wind gusts up to 200 mph, taking the title from Super Typhoon Jebi for the strongest cyclone to grace our fair planet this year. Tropical storm-force winds radiate roughly 300 miles out from its center. The forecast indicates that the storm will likely make landfall overnight or early Saturday morning in the northeast corner of Luzon, an island that’s home to 43 million. The huge wind field means that even Manila, located 250 miles south, could still feel the impacts of Mangkhut. But those in the direct vicinity of Mangkhut’s landfall will have to contend with much more than that. The storm could produce nearly 20 feet of storm surge according to the Red Cross, creating deadly conditions along the coast. The Philippines meteorological service warned that all evacuations should already have taken place and that the “situation is potentially very destructive.” The group notes that trees could be uprooted, coconut plantations could be destroyed, and that the electrical system and homes and commercial buildings are likely to see “severe” damage. Mangkhut has drawn comparisons to Super Typhoon Haiyan, which is a really ominous sign. That storm tore through the Philippines in 2013, leaving 6,000 dead and obliterating entire communities. Mangkhut, however, isn’t quite as strong and is forecast to take a more northerly path through the island nation, passing over a less densely populated region. While there hasn’t been any work to attribute Mangkhut specifically to climate change, the warmer oceans and higher seas that are both hallmarks of our warming world are clear links. Mangkhut is passing over waters that are up to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above normal, providing the fuel it needs to stay strong. The Philippines is also a sea level rise hot spot, with waters rising five times faster than the global average. The Philippines is also a hot spot for typhoons owing to its tropical location. The nation has been hit by more tropical cyclones than any other country save China since 1970.","While the world watches Florence make a historic landfall in the Carolinas, there’s another storm on the other side of the planet worthy of our attention.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Tropical Storm Mangkhut was on the move Monday as it made its way through Southeast Asia. The former Super Typhoon, which at its peak became the strongest storm to form on Earth this year so far, has been pummeling Hong Kong, Macau, and the Philippines all weekend. Heavy rainfall from has triggered landslides throughout northern regions of the Philippines where Mangkhut struck on Saturday, and the government is blaming the mining industry—namely, small-scale mines that opereate illegally. At least 34 miners who sought refuge in a bunker were discovered dead; another 30 are still missing, reports the Guardian. Now, President Rodrigo Duterte is calling for the halt of all mining activities, per Reuters. In total, at least 64 people are dead in the Philippines, but Hurricane Maria in the U.S. taught us that death tolls can increase dramatically weeks or even months after a storm passes through. Mangkhut’s trail of destruction didn’t stop in the Philippines, however. The storm continued its way north, going on to strike Hong Kong and Macau on Sunday with 100 mph gusts. Australian news station SBS News posted a video to Twitter on Sunday that shows the power of that wind: Construction cranes were falling from high-rise buildings in Hong Kong as entire buildings swayed. For the rest of the week, the China Meteorological Administration is forecasting heavy rains along the storm’s projected path inland from the southeastern coast. Anywhere between four to six inches are expected to pour onto southern Chinese regions as the storm deteriorates. It’s too soon to know the direct role climate change has played in this disaster, but with warmer waters come stronger storms. Mangkhut passed over waters up to a degree and a half Celsius warmer than normal as it intensified. Recognizing that link isn’t rocket science. Workers dig to find those buried in mines in the Philippines.

The 300-mile-wide, 1,000-mile-long atmospheric river that carried all this precipitation is starting to dry up, and the worst of the drench-fest is over. But all the new rainfall records highlight the fact that atmospheric rivers, while long a distinctive feature of weather in the American West, are intensifying in a climate-changed world.
Data from NOAA satellites shows an atmospheric river pummeling the California coast.
If you havent heard the phrase atmospheric river before, dont feel too bad. Its a meteorological term of art that hasnt yet cracked the pop cultural lexicon, unlike some of its flashier cousinsthe polar vortex, bomb cyclone, and fire clouds, to name a few. Even the American Meteorological Society only added a definition for atmospheric river to its glossary last year.
The phenomenon itself isnt a new one: For a long time its been pretty normal for California to receive most of its yearly precipitation in just a few big storms. Most of those multi-day deluges are the product of atmospheric rivers, high-altitude streams of air that originate near the Equator and are packed with water vapor. But its only been in the last decade or so that scientists have learned enough about this type of weather system to tell the difference between the beneficial, run-of-the-mill storms that keep water reserves full and the disastrous ones that overwhelm dams, levees, and reservoirs, like the one that pummeled California this week. As that balancing act gets even tougher for the regions water managers, some scientists are making a push to put a number on those differences, in the same way you would a tornado or a hurricane.
Your typical weather forecast displays a symbola sun for sunny days, a cloud for cloudy days. But the rain cloud symbol doesnt really describe if its going to be a few showers or one of these more unusually substantial storms, says F. Marty Ralph, a research meteorologist at UC San Diegos Scripps Institution of Oceanography and director of its Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes. Hes been spearheading a multi-year effort to develop a five-category scale for diagnosing the strength of atmospheric rivers so that water managers, emergency personnel, and the general public can quickly get a grasp on just how destructive (or beneficial) the next storm will be.
Ralphs team unveiled their AR Cat scale earlier this month, in an article published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. The key feature it uses to assess the severity of such storms is the amount of water vapor flowing horizontally in the air. Called integrated vapor transport, or IVT, this number tells you how much fuel is feeding the system.
Its not an easy number to calculate. To do it well requires taking multiple wind and water vapor measurements across miles of atmosphere. In the same way that terrestrial rivers flow at different rates at different depths, the water vapor molecules in atmospheric rivers travel at different speeds in the air column. Adding them all up vertically gives you the true measure of how strong a storm really is. Ralphs team classifies storms as atmospheric rivers if theyre moving more than 250 kilograms of water per meter per second, ranging up from weak to moderate, strong, extreme, and exceptional.
But strength alone doesnt predict how dangerous a storm will be. Thats why the AR Cat scale combines a storms IVT with how long its expected to linger. Storms that blow through in fewer than 24 hours get downgraded by one category, whereas storms that last longer than 48 hours immediately get bumped up a notch. So an extreme storm could be either a Cat 3 (balance of beneficial and hazardous), Cat 4 (mostly hazardous), or Cat 5 (hazardous) depending on what it does once it makes landfall.
Thats because the longer a storm hovers over land, funneling many Mississippi Rivers worth of moisture into its watersheds, the more strain it puts on those systems. The most destructive hurricanes in recent memoryHarvey in Texas and Florence in North Carolinaproved so catastrophic because they stalled over land, inundating those areas with multiple days of intense rainfall. But the current hurricane scales, which are based on wind speed, dont take time into account. With atmospheric rivers we had the opportunity to bake those numbers in from the very beginning, says Ralph.
The AR Cat scale is, of course, only as reliable as the forecast model its built upon. And accurately predicting atmospheric rivers has long buggered meteorological researchers. Models built on satellite data regularly flub the location of landfall by 250 miles even when the storm is just three days out. Some of that data got a signal boost this week, as GOES-17, NOAAs next-generation satellite, became operational over the western part of the United States.
GOES-17s powerful new camera will fill in important gaps, especially over the Pacific Ocean, where coverage was previously sparse. It was like watching a black-and-white television, and now we have full HD, says Scott Rowe, a meteorologist with the National Weather Services Bay Area station. The new satellite also refreshes data at a much higher ratetaking a new image once every five minutes as opposed to every ten or 15. In special circumstances, NWS forecasters can request to crank it up one notch further. On Thursday, when Rowes office was busy trying to predict where the California storm would go next, GOES-17 was snapping and sending images once every minute.
But according to Ralph, the new satellites not a complete fix for atmospheric river forecasting, because high clouds can mask whats going on inside the storm. More fruitful are the regular reconnaissance missions Ralph has been coordinating for the last three years, sending US Air Force pilots in hurricane hunter airplanes to crisscross incoming streams of hot, wet air. At regular intervals they drop meteorological sensing devices known as dropsondes, which draw a more intimate portrait of eachs storms potential for precipitation.
Its all part of a broader effort to help stewards of the regions freshwater resources make better decisions about whether to keep water and risk a flooding event, or let it out ahead of the storm and risk it being a bust. The AR Cat scale, which Ralph says still needs some tuning to better articulate the risks and benefits of different kinds of storms, is aimed at making those decisions for reservoir operators as easy as one, two, three, four, five.
Knowing that a storm like the one that hit this week is a Cat 4 atmospheric river may not mean much to the average person just yet. Calibrating an arbitrary value to observed reality takes time and experience. But its a sign of the American Wests intensifying weather patterns that its residents need that language at all.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Authorities are warning coastal residents in the path of Hurricane Florence to evacuate now or be at the mercy of the Category 3 storm, which is expected to slow upon hitting the coast of the Carolinas on Thursday and ravage the region with storm surge, rainfall, and flooding. According to CNN, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told reporters that emergency personnel will not be able to intervene during the storm due to the high risk it poses. Florence is currently expected to begin delivering tropical storm-force winds in the region by early Thursday, escalating to hurricane-force winds by late Thursday or early Friday. CNN wrote: “You put your life at risk by staying,” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said. “Don’t plan to leave once the winds and rains start.” Cooper and his South Carolina counterpart, Henry McMaster, told the more than 1 million people who have been told to leave that if they don’t, they are on their own. McMaster told residents in some counties that emergency responders will be pulled from areas expected to be hit hard. “Even the rescuers cannot stay there,” he said. Accuweather reported that its meteorologists “believe that the hurricane will stall and meander near the Carolina coast from Thursday night to Saturday.” That means locals and their property could be punished with severe hurricane conditions for days, not hours. “Total innundation” is expected in eastern and southeastern North Carolina, as well as northern Southern California, and the storm surge could reach in “excess of 10 feet in some areas,” Accuweather added. Isolated tornadoes could also occur along North Carolina’s coast on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service in Wilmington. Only seven major hurricanes have hit on the coast between Savannah, Georgia and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina since 1879, CNN reported, and the last was Hurricane Hugo in 1989. In that time the population has dramatically increased. The Washington Post warned that the heavy rainfall expected is likely to be “catastrophic,” and noted the National Weather Service said Florence will likely be bad even by the standards of prior big storms: “This will likely be the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast,” the National Weather Service in Wilmington, N.C., wrote Tuesday, “and that’s saying a lot given the impacts we’ve seen from hurricanes Diana, Hugo, Fran, Bonnie, Floyd, and Matthew.” As Earther has noted before, the path Florence has taken is incredibly unusual, with none of the 57 named storms that had passed within 200 miles of its position last week coming close to striking the U.S. coast. The expected stalling is equally unusual, according to USA Today : Instead of roaring ashore and quickly heading inland and weakening, as most storms do, Hurricane Florence should instead “stall near the coast and then parallel southwestward toward Georgia,” Weather Channel meteorologist Greg Postel said. “I’ve never seen anything like this.” AccuWeather meteorologist Marshall Moss said Florence’s track is unique. “It was located farther north in the Atlantic than any other storm to ever hit the Carolinas, so what we’re forecasting is unprecedented,” Moss said. In other words, those living in coastal regions subject to evacuation orders in Florence’s path have had their final warning: Please, for your own good, get out of there before it’s too late. That means now.

George Dvorsky,"A new simulation produced by NASA’s Data Visualization Studio packs four months of swirling atmospheric activity into a two minute clip that reminds us how unrelenting this past hurricane season really was. This looks like a timelapse pieced together from images taken by satellites, but it’s not. Rather, it’s a computer simulation based on real data. Specifically, the model is showing the progression of aerosols—wafts of sea salt, dust, and smoke—blowing through the atmosphere from July 31 to November 1, 2017. This visualization was churned out by the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS), a system of math models developed by the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. What’s particularly neat about this video is that the hurricanes kind of appear by accident. Hurricanes aren’t aerosols, but because the NASA scientists were tracking the stuff carried by wind around the atmosphere, they were able to visualize the various storm systems as they moved across the Atlantic. NASA explains : During the 2017 hurricane season, the storms are visible because of the sea salt that is captured by the storms. Strong winds at the surface lift the sea salt into the atmosphere and the particles are incorporated into the storm. Hurricane Irma is the first big storm that spawns off the coast of Africa. As the storm spins up, the Saharan dust is absorbed in cloud droplets and washed out of the storm as rain. This process happens with most of the storms, except for Hurricane Ophelia. Forming more northward than most storms, Ophelia traveled to the east picking up dust from the Sahara and smoke from large fires in Portugal. Retaining its tropical storm state farther northward than any system in the Atlantic, Ophelia carried the smoke and dust into Ireland and the UK. It’s a gorgeous simulation for sure, but scientists can use models like these to understand all the different things that go on in our atmosphere and how they all fit together to produce weather.

IAN AUSTEN,"“It’s a perfect storm for reform,” said Michelle Coffin, a political science professor at Saint Mary’s University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, who worked in provincial politics for more than five years. It’s not only that Canadian women feel emboldened by their American counterparts; they also feel propelled by American politics, she added. “Women are coming forward to ensure that does not happen: that we do not get to that place where we have a prime minister accused of sexual assault, where there’s a tape of him talking about women in a misogynistic way,” Professor Coffin said. Photo Albert Schultz, who recently resigned, in his office at the Soulpepper Theater Company in Toronto last year. Credit Ryan Enn Hughes for The New York Times Anita Vandenbeld, a Liberal member of Parliament who leads the parliamentary women’s caucus, said, “One of the things that I think came out of the MeToo movement is that most people were not aware of how many people are affected.” “What is surprising for many people,” she added, “even those who are survivors, is to see how many of them are their neighbors, their sisters or their friends.” Just over three years ago, a national debate over sexual harassment flared up after the firing and arrest of a prominent musician and radio host, Jian Ghomeshi. That brought the topic of sexual assault out from women’s shelters into coffee shops and daily radio shows, where it has mostly remained. Further back in time — 28 years ago — Quebec went through a significant soul searching after a gunman who said he was “fighting feminism” killed 14 women and injured 14 others at an engineering school in Montreal. Among the more recent episodes, Gilbert Rozon, the president of the Montreal-based Just for Laughs comedy festival, resigned in October after nine women accused him of sexual harassment and assault. Éric Salvail, one of Quebec’s biggest television and radio stars, who is also a producer, was accused of sexual impropriety by several male and female employees. Since October he has been on a self-imposed, indefinite break from television and radio appearances and has not been involved in his production company. About a month ago, Albert Schultz, artistic director of the Soulpepper Theater Company in Toronto, resigned. In a lawsuit that has yet to be heard in court four actresses asserted that he sexually harassed, groped, touched and repeatedly propositioned them over a 13-year period. Then came last week. First to go was Jamie Baillie, the Progressive Conservative Party leader in Nova Scotia. An investigation, which has not been made public, found that he had breached the provincial legislature’s workplace harassment policies and behaved inappropriately. Hours later, Patrick Brown sent Ontario’s political scene into turmoil by stepping down as its Progressive Conservative leader after two women accused him of sexual misconduct when they were teenagers. Photo Kent Hehr, who resigned last week as the minister of sports and persons with disabilities, in the House of Commons in 2016. Credit Chris Wattie/Reuters The same day, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that he had accepted the resignation of Kent Hehr, the minister of sport and persons with disabilities, pending an investigation into possible sexual misconduct. On Friday CTV, the television network that first reported the accusations against Mr. Brown, suspended Paul Bliss, a reporter in its bureau at the Ontario legislature who once regularly reported about the Conservative leader. The Ontario conservatives were buffeted again on Sunday night when Rick Dykstra quit as its president, a voluntary position. Shortly afterward Maclean’s magazine reported that in 2014, when Mr. Dykstra was a Conservative member of federal parliament, a political staff member accused him of sexual assault in a written complaint to Ottawa police. No charges were laid. The network took the step after a woman published a blog post titled “#MeToo in Canadian Broadcasting” in which she accused Mr. Bliss of kissing her in his office and trying to force her into oral sex. While rumors have long circulated in Ottawa about staff members being sexually harassed or assaulted, few complaints have been made public. Traditionally, politics demands loyalty at all costs, and political aides are among the least powerful — often young and easily replaceable, working for powerful politicians and officials in an environment that can include long hours followed by socializing in bars. In 2014, Canada’s Senate, an appointed body, rejected complaints of harassment and abuse of authority against Colin Kenny, a senator, made by a woman who once worked for him. Mr. Kenny is now being investigated on accusations of using his staff to perform personal business. Adam Dodek, the dean of law at the University of Ottawa, said the bill to be debated was significant and an unusual break from Canadian parliamentary tradition. Internal rules, rather than laws, are generally used to police its members’ conduct. Already, Ms. Vandenbeld, the Liberal lawmaker, says she is confident that this round of the national #MeToo debate will lead to significant change. “We had to start talking about it, take it out of the shadows and not have it be a taboo subject,” she said. “Then we can start really addressing it and finding the ways that we can change it.” Follow Ian Austen on Twitter: @ianrausten Catherine Porter contributed reporting from Toronto.

Ron Miller,"4me, a startup that helps companies organize and track their IT outsourcing projects, announced a $1.65 million seed investment led by Storm Ventures. The company, which launched in 2010, would seem to be a bit long in tooth to warrant a seed investment round, but co-founder and CEO Cor Winkler Prins explained that the founders both had successful exits from previous service management startups and were able to self-fund the company all these years. The founders saw the cloud writing on the wall even in 2010 and figured companies would be outsourcing much of their functionality to managed service providers (MSPs). “We realized this was going to explode and we could see this in the growing number of MSPs,” Prins said. They reckoned that over time the IT department would have less technical capabilities and that would require more outsourcing. “They want to outsource as much as possible mainly because of inability to attract and retain talent in-house,” he added. As that outsourcing increased, Prins saw an opportunity in managing the contracts as a service and 4me was born. Over the years, the company developed the product and tested it with MSPs and companies and fine-tuned it. They are taking the seed round to expand their go-to market efforts. Customers today include the like of Dannon and Deloitte. These are the types of companies that want to concentrate on their core business and that doesn’t involve maintaining their databases or other IT tasks. With 4me, the companies can track how well their MSPs are keeping up to their Service Level Agreements (SLA) and work with them or swap them out if they aren’t doing a good job. 4me SLA tracking dashboard. Photo: 4me (cropped) The company takes a couple of approaches. MSPs can buy their service and use it with customers to show them how they are doing, or companies can use the 4me integration tool to integrate with the MSP system, whatever that happens to be, to track the same kinds of information. 4me currently has 16 employees, 92 customers and generates several million in revenue annually.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images A violent storm on the Sun could cripple communications on Earth and cause huge economic damage, scientists have warned. Why are solar storms such a threat? In 1972, dozens of sea mines off the coast of Vietnam mysteriously exploded. It was recently confirmed the cause was solar storms, which can significantly disrupt the Earth's magnetic field. Today, the effects of a similar event could be much more serious - disrupting the technology we rely on for everything from satellites to power grids. The cost to the UK economy alone of an unexpected event has been estimated at £16bn. There are good reasons why we are vulnerable to events taking place millions of miles from Earth. What causes an extreme solar event? The Sun is a star, a seething mass of electrified hydrogen. As this fluid moves around, it builds up energy within its complex magnetic field. This magnetic energy is released through intense flashes of light known as solar flares and through vast eruptions of material and magnetic fields known as coronal mass ejections or solar storms. While flares can disrupt radio communication on Earth, solar storms pose the greatest threat. Each storm contains the energy equivalent to 100,000 times the world's entire nuclear arsenal, although this is spread throughout an enormous volume in space. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The northern lights over Finland The Sun rotates like a vast spinning firework, launching eruptions into space in all directions. If one of these heads towards our planet, with a magnetic field aligned opposite to the Earth's, the two fields can merge together. As the solar storm washes past, some of the Earth's magnetic field is distorted into a long tail. And when this distorted magnetic field eventually snaps back, it accelerates electrified particles towards the Earth. Here, they strike the upper atmosphere, heating it and causing it to glow in a spectacular display known as the northern and southern lights. But this distortion of the Earth's magnetic field has other, more significant effects. It is thought to have triggered the sea mines back in 1972. The mines were designed to detect small variations in the magnetic field caused by the approach of metal-hulled boats. But their engineers hadn't anticipated that solar activity could have the same effect. When will the next extreme weather event happen? Scientists are looking for clues as to what triggers these vast eruptions and, once they have been launched, how to track them through interplanetary space. Our records of the Earth's magnetic field go back as far as the mid-19th Century. They suggest an extreme space weather event is likely to occur once every 100 years, although smaller events will happen more frequently. In 1859, the Carrington Event - most extreme solar storm recorded to date - caused telegraph systems to spark and for the northern lights to be spotted as far south as the Bahamas. The next time it happens, the effects are likely to be far more serious. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Observers at the launch of a satellite With every solar cycle, our global community has become more reliant on technology. In 2018, space satellites are central to global communication and navigation, while aeroplanes connect continents and extensive power grids crisscross the world. All of these could be badly affected by the aftermath of extreme solar events. Electronic systems on spacecraft and aeroplanes could be harmed as their miniaturised electronics are zapped by energetic particles accelerated into our atmosphere, while power networks on the ground can be overwhelmed by excess electrical currents. More like this Planning ahead Enough satellites and power grids have failed during past space weather events to make it clear that the Sun must be closely monitored, to help predict when a solar storm will affect Earth. Forecasters are working on this all over the world, from the UK's Met Office to the Australian Met Bureau and the Noaa Space Weather Prediction Center in the US. All being well, they can detect when a storm is heading towards Earth and predict its arrival time within six hours. That still leaves relatively little time to prepare but forecasting would cut the cost to the UK economy from £16bn to £3bn. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Mauna Kea Observatory summit, in Hawaii Space weather now appears on the UK government's risk register, alongside other, more familiar risks such as a flu pandemic and severe flooding. It has been rated at the equivalent risk as a severe heatwave or the emergence of a new infectious disease. Government agencies are now speaking to power companies, spacecraft and airline operators to ensure they have plans in place to limit the impact of an extreme space weather event. It is vital, for example, to make sure enough power is available to refrigerate supplies of food and medicine as well as to make sure water and fuel can be pumped as needed. If communication with some satellites is lost, familiar technologies such as sat-navs and satellite television could stop working. Spacecraft engineers study extreme events so they can build resilience into spacecraft, protecting vulnerable electronics and installing backup systems. Image copyright Getty Images An accurate space weather forecast would enable operators to further protect their assets by ensuring they were in a safe state as the storm passed. Many planes fly over the north pole en route from Europe to North America. During space weather events, aircraft operators re-route aeroplanes away from the polar skies, where most of the energetic particles enter Earth's atmosphere. This is to limit exposure to enhanced radiation doses and ensure reliable radio communication. We have learned much about space weather since the events of 1972 but as modern technologies evolve, we need to make sure they can withstand the worst the Sun can throw at us.

Jonathan Shieber,"More posts by this contributor We are spending a lot of time discussing what happens to data when you explicitly or implicitly share it. But what about data that you have never ever shared? We all share DNA — after all, it seems we are all descendants of a few tribes. But the more closely related you are, the closer the DNA match. While we all know we share 50% DNA with siblings, and 25% with first cousins — there is still some meaningful match even between distant relatives (depending on the family tree distance). In short, if you have never taken a DNA test but one or more of your blood relatives has, and shared that data — some of your DNA is effectively now available for a match. While this may have seemed like theory a few weeks ago, the cops caught the Golden State Killer by using this method. A similar thing happened when data was mis-used by Cambridge Analytica. Even if you never used the quiz app on Facebook platform but your friends did, they essentially revealed private information about you without your consent or knowlege. The number of users that took the quiz was shockingly small — only 300,000 users participated. And yet, upwards of 50 million ( as many as 87 million ) people eventually had their data collected by Cambridge Analytica. And all of this was done legally and while complying with the platform requirements at that time. The word transitive simply means if A is related to B in a certain way, and B to C — then A is related to C. For example, cousins is a transitive property. If Alice and Bob are cousins, and Bob and Chamath are cousins, then Alice and Chamath are cousins. As private citizens, and corporations, we now have to think about transitive data privacy loss. The simplest version of this is if your boyfriend or girlfriend forwards your private photo or conversation screenshot to someone else. While we have discussed couple of clear negative examples, there are many ways transitive data relationships help us. Every time you ask a friend to connect you to someone on Linkedin for a job or fundraise, you are leveraging the transitive relationship graph. The DNA databases being created are primarily for social good — to help us connect with our roots &amp; family, detect disease early and help medical research. In fact, you could argue that a lot of challenges we face today require more data sharing not less. If your hospital cannot share data with your primary care doctor at the right time, or your clinical trial data cannot be accessed to monitor downstream effects, we cannot take care of our citizens’ health as we should. Organizations like NIH and the VA and CMS (Medicare) are working hard to encourage appropriate easier sharing by healthcare providers. Further, the good news is that there have been significant advances in security in encryption and hashing that enable companies to protect against the unintended side effects. More research is definitely called for. We can anonymize data, we can perturb data, and apply these techniques for protection while still being able to derive value and help customers.",Anshu Sharma Contributor Anshu Sharma is a serial entrepreneur and a former venture partner at Storm Ventures.

Up to two feet of snow could fall in New Mexicos Sangre de Cristo Mountains, accompanied by winds whipping across ridge tops at speeds of up to 75 mph, according to the National Weather Service. That alone would be pretty wild, but its only a precursor to Wednesdays weather mayhem.
As the storm pushes inland, its pressurewhich drops as storms get strongeris expected to dip into the range of 970 millibars. Thats roughly on par with an average Category 2 Atlantic hurricane and could challenge the all-time low pressure record for Kansas. The drop will be driven by the storms winds as they wrap around its core in a counter clockwise direction, bringing moist, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico in contact with cold air from the Upper Midwest and Canada. The movement of the winds is called cyclonic, and pressure is expected to drop more than 24 millibars in 24 hours, which means this storm is shaping up to fulfill the criteria for a rare inland bomb cyclone. It could even take on a hurricane-like appearance.
The fascinating thing about this storm is how quickly it will intensify and the possible record-low pressures it will produce in the Plains, Jason Furtado, a meteorology professor at the University of Oklahoma, told Earther. Another neat thing is that some models are indicating that this storm will strengthen so quickly, it could develop an eye-like feature in the center of the storm. This is a very rare for non-tropical systems and even more so for storms in the central U.S. (Its also rare for noreasters, which tend to be more comma-shaped.)
Weather geekery aside, the storm is going to make a mess of things. The area facing wind gusts up to 60 mphthe equivalent of a mature tropical stormstretches for more than 1,000 miles from Sturgis, South Dakota to the Texas-Mexico border. For comparison, the reach of Sandys tropical storm-force winds was 1,150 miles from edge to edge, although even thats not a perfect comparison, since tropical storm winds start at 39 mph.
So about those winds. The most intense blasts could rip up to 75 mph in the Rockies and Southern Plains. The rotation of the storm will also create what Furtado called a moisture pipeline straight out of the Gulf of Mexico. That means not only will it be windy, but also snowy. The National Weather Service is forecasting up to a foot or more of snow from Colorado to the Dakotas. Blizzard warnings are also in effect for large part of the region, and they could expand as the storm begins its onslaught.
Even after the storm clears out on Wednesday night, its impacts could linger. Aside from the heavy, blowing snow, areas on the Southern Plains could see wind-driven rain that could melt out what snowpack there is, aided by a blast of warm air on Thursday. Ed Vallee, the founder of Empire Weather, told Earther that flooding and melting snowpack is another unique impact could happen after the storm blows out into the Atlantic.","The country’s midsection is about to be hit by a rare, potentially record setting bomb cyclone that will bring everything from rain to snow to hurricane-force winds and could leave severe flooding in its wake from Texas to Minnesota.

George Dvorsky,"Evidence of an unusually strong solar storm that hit Earth in 660 BCE has been detected in Greenland ice coresa finding which shows we still have lots to learn about these disruptive events.
An extreme form of solar storm, known as a solar proton event (SPE), struck our planet 2,679 years ago, according to new research published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. If an event of such magnitude were to happen today, it would likely wreak havoc on our technological infrastructure, including communications and navigation. Lund University geologist Raimund Muscheler and his colleagues presented evidence in the form of elevated levels of beryllium-10 and chlorine-36 isotopes embedded within ancient Greenland ice cores.
Its now the third massive SPE known to scientists, the others occurring 1,245 and 1,025 years ago. This latest discovery means solar storms of this variety are likely happening more frequently than we thoughtperhaps once every 1,000 yearsbut more data is required to create more reliable estimates.
SPEs happen in the wake of a massive solar flare or coronal mass ejection on the Sun. These stellar events send streams of particles, including high-energy protons, toward Earth, where they interact with the Earths atmosphere, triggering reactions that increase the rate of radionuclide production, including carbon-14, beryllium-10, and chlorine-36 (radionuclides are unstable atoms with excess nuclear energy). Traditionally, SPEs have been detected as spikes of carbon-14 in tree rings, but they can also be spotted as spikes of beryllium-10 and chlorine-36 in ancient ice cores. The authors of the new study said scientists tend to overemphasize carbon-14 at the expense of searching for other markers, and that efforts to find [SPEs] based solely on [carbon-14] data likely lead to an underestimated number of such potentially devastating events for our society.
SPEs are capable of temporarily degrading the Earths ozone layer, which allows excessive amounts of ultraviolet radiation to reach the ground. This is (moderately) bad for lifeforms on the surface, but its not the kind of thing that could trigger a mass extinction. As a risk, SPEs are a much bigger problem in terms of how they would affect our technologies; a sufficiently strong SPE poses a threat to modern society in terms of communication and navigation systems, space technologies, and commercial aircraft operations, according to the new study. These extreme space weather events could also be catastrophic for astronauts working in the International Space Station, who arent shielded by Earths atmosphere. 
Importantly, SPEs are not to be confused with geomagnetic storms, which are a related, but distinct, phenomenon. 
SPEs have been detected before, including events in Quebec (1989) and Sweden (2003) but the the newly discovered storm appears to have been stronger than anything seen with our modern instruments over the past 70 years. Indeed, we now have the tools to detect these events as they happen. For the new study, Muscheler and his colleagues analyzed two Greenland ice cores, finding spikes of both beryllium-10 and chlorine-36 in ice dated at 2,679 years oldevidence consistent with an SPE.
We think that we could exclude other suggested hypotheses for such increases, such as supernova explosions or gamma ray bursts, Muscheler told Gizmodo. The team also found increased values of carbon-14 in trees rings that correspond to the 660 BCE event, which is to our knowledge only consistent with the effects of a solar proton event, he said. 
So thats three extreme PCEs in the past 2,700 years (that we know of)an observation consistent with an occurrence rate of one every 1,000 years. But while this inference is a tempting one to make, Muscheler said we need to be careful about jumping to conclusions owing to a dearth of data. 
I think the statistical bases for occurrence rate estimates is very weak, he said. We now have three of such events660 BCE, 775 AD and a slightly weaker one at 993 ADbut to say that these occur on average every 1,000 years would be very speculative. We will need more high-resolution carbon-14, beryllium-10, and chlorine-36 data to get this occurrence rate more robustly. To which he added: We have only a very short window into the Suns behavior by our observations and measurements over the last 70 years, but as the new research makes clear, the Sun can produce much more powerful eventsthis has to be included in todays risk analyses.
No doubt, more examples of similar events in Earths history would be helpful. To that end, Muscheler is in Bern, Switzerland right now trying to acquire new high-resolution samples for this very purpose. Until more is known, however, its best to prepare, creating technologies and systems capable of withstanding these extremeyet disturbingly frequentstellar events.

Natasha Lomas,"It has emerged that Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy firm at the center of a data misuse storm involving Facebook user data, has also been banned from advertising on Twitter’s platform. Facebook suspended the company’s account in March after fresh revelations were published about how user data had been passed to the company by a developer on its platform — although the Guardian newspaper originally linked the firm to Facebook data in a story published in December 2015. A Twitter spokesperson confirmed to us what the company describes as a “policy decision to off-board advertising from all accounts owned and operated by Cambridge Analytica on advertising”, adding the decision was taken “weeks” ago. “This decision is based on our determination that Cambridge Analytica operates using a business model that inherently conflicts with acceptable Twitter Ads business practices. Cambridge Analytica may remain an organic user on our platform, in accordance with the Twitter Rules,” the company spokesperson added. The move is unrelated to reports yesterday that Twitter had sold public user data to Dr Aleksandr Kogan — the Cambridge University academic who sold Facebook data to Cambridge Analytica in 2014, after harvesting it via an app that drew on Facebook’s APIs to pull information on users and their friends. Last month Kogan told a UK parliamentary committee he had subsequently used some of the money Cambridge Analytica had paid him for gathering and processing the Facebook data to buy some Twitter data, though he said he had intended to use that for his own purposes, not for selling to others. On this, Twitter’s spokesperson also told us: “Based on the recent reports, we conducted our own internal review and did not find any access to any private data about people who use Twitter. Unlike many other services, Twitter is public by its nature. People come to Twitter to speak publicly, and public Tweets are viewable and searchable by anyone. In 2015, GSR [Kogan’s comapny] did have one-time API access to a random sample of public Tweets from a five-month period from December 2014 to April 2015.” Cambridge Analytica has also denied undertaking a project with Kogan’s company that used Twitter data. Cambridge Analytica has never received Twitter data from GSR or Aleksandr Kogan, and has never done any work with GSR on Twitter data. GSR was only ever a contractor to Cambridge Analytica and we understand it did work for many other companies. — Cambridge Analytica (@CamAnalytica) April 30, 2018 Although the company has also continued to deny it received Facebook data — despite the existence of a 2014 contract between the company and Kogan to gather data; and despite Kogan’s own insistences that his app harvested Facebook user data. Facebook has also said as many as 87 million users could have had some of their information harvested by Kogan and passed to Cambridge Analytica. In a blog post late last month Twitter reiterated some of the policies it has in place to limit access to public Twitter data — even when a developer is paying for it, as Kogan was. “We prohibit developers from inferring or deriving sensitive information like race or political affiliation, or attempts to match a user’s Twitter information with other personal identifiers in unexpected ways,” it wrote, flagging the Restricted Uses page for more info on types of behaviors it said are not tolerated, and adding: “Developers who are found to be in violation of our policies are subject to enforcement actions, including immediate termination.” Despite barring Cambridge Analytica from running ads on its platform, Twitter has not suspended the company’s verified Twitter account — which the company continues to use to tweet denials related to the Facebook data misuse scandal.","It has emerged that Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy firm at the center of a data misuse storm involving Facebook user data, has also been banned from advertising on Twitter’s platform.

Almost 40 years in the works, the euro was toasted with champagne by finance ministers in the 11 countries where it debuted. Though euro bank notes and coins wouldn’t be released until 2002, European banks were required to use the currency in transactions as soon as markets opened on Monday, Jan. 4. Fears of technical glitches meant banks brought in employees en masse : In Frankfurt, one bank alone had 3,200 people working to reprogram its computers. London had 30,000 workers on trading floors and in back offices, even though Britain wasn’t even adopting the euro. The switch took more than a year of planning, months of rewriting software, and full-scale dress rehearsals. But the reward for the banking world’s tireless efforts was simply a smooth debut when world markets opened for business. Others received something more concrete to mark the launch: For sharing a birthday with the new currency, each baby born in France on New Year’s Day received 100 euros from the Finance Ministry.

Mark Kaufman,"The National Hurricane Center has named the first storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, precisely one week before the season is expected to begin on June 1. Currently spinning off of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, forecasters named the subtropical storm ""Alberto,"" which is the first of 21 names the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has on its list of possible storm names for the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. On Friday, Alberto met the minimum requirements for earning a name, having reached sustained winds of 40 miles per hour. SEE ALSO: 2018's hurricane season will be active, but probably not as bad as last year The storm, while projected to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to areas in Florida and some Gulf Coast states both this weekend and into early next week, will not become a hurricane, according to NOAA. A storm needs to hit sustained wind speeds of at least 74 miles per hour to be considered a Category 1 storm, the least intense hurricane classification. Yesterday, the National Hurricane Center released its 2018 hurricane forecast, and they expect 2018 to be an ""active season,"" with between 10 to 16 named storms, five to nine of which being hurricanes. ""This is a fair amount of activity we’re expecting."" Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said in an interview. Tropical Storm conditions associated with #Alberto are possible across the Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba through Saturday. Tropical Storm conditions could reach the northern Gulf Coast as early as Sunday morning. pic.twitter.com/MImTcKhB2z — NHC Atlantic Ops (@NHC_Atlantic) May 25, 2018 Last hurricane season — which produced the immensely destructive hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria — was exceptionally active, said Bell, who doesn't currently expect this season to produce such intense activity. Hurricane forecasters analyze a combination of short and long-term climate trends, along with sophisticated computer models when making their predictions for a hurricane season. Since 1995, the Atlantic and Caribbean have seen ""very active"" seasons, said Bell, as a decades-long climate trend in the Atlantic Ocean has kept water temperatures warmer, contributing to a higher number of storms. In addition to this effect, NASA says that modern storm research shows hurricanes are getting stronger, lasting longer, and dumping significantly more rain. Rising sea levels, an indisputable result of human-induced climate change, exacerbates the effect of already damaging storms by producing higher surges of water. As for Alberto, the National Hurricane Service recommends that Gulf Coast residents watch for the agency's regular updates, found easily on either their homepage or Twitter account.","The National Hurricane Center has named the first storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, precisely one week before the season is expected to begin on June 1.

"Judson Jones and Madeline Holcombe, CNN","(CNN)A winter storm will unload a messy mix of heavy snow, strong winds and frigid temperatures across parts of the Midwest and Northeast over the weekend. 
About 115 million people are under some form of a winter storm watch, warning or advisory across the United States. 
Forecasters expect a substantial amount of precipitation Saturday evening through Sunday up and down the East Coast. Snow will start Saturday evening in Boston and New York, which will then turn into a wintry mix and freezing rain overnight into Sunday. 
The National Weather Service in New York is forecasting 3 to 6 inches of sleet and snow plus possible ice. New York may warm up enough for rain Sunday morning, but freezing is expected by the evening when temperatures plummet. 
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said a ban on tractor-trailers and buses on most highways in the state will begin Saturday at 3 p.m. ET. Amtrak will operate a modified service Saturday and Sunday due to the weather, it said. 
Thousands of flights canceled
Travel through Sunday will be affected, with nearly 2,000 flights involving domestic airports canceled, according to the flight-tracking site FlightAware.com. Airlines are issuing waivers for travelers in the Midwest and Northeast. 
Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska, closed for several hours after a Southwest Airlines flight went off a runway while taxiing. The airliner slid onto a runway overrun area, Southwest Airlines said. 
None of the 150 passengers and six crew members was injured, the airline said. 
The storm system is associated with the same upper-level energy as one on the West Coast that dumped rain in Los Angeles and elsewhere as well as caused blizzard conditions in the Sierra Nevada.
Blowing and drifting snow
The second storm will exit the Rockies and likely will begin to drop snow across Kansas over the weekend. 
In Missouri, Kansas City and St. Louis -- which received the brunt of a storm last week-- will get less accumulation this time. However, winds could gust up to 35 mph, causing blowing and drifting snow through Saturday night. 
Lake effect snow will enhance the amounts that Milwaukee and Chicago could face through the weekend. Both cities may get more than half a foot of snow if the conditions remain right. 
Indiana and Ohio could see rain to the south, snow to the north and ice and snow across the states' centers. 
Icing is possible in New England
This second storm will be more significant for the Northeast than the first. 
As the low tracks farther east, warm air is likely to mix in from the South. At this time, it's uncertain exactly where the line between rain and snow will form. 
Winter storm watches are already posted for upstate and inland New England. Heavy snow and sleet will pile up at least 6 to 12 inches deep, with some icing for added misery.
The Interstate 95 corridor through New England seems to be where the bulk of the ice will form, with up to an inch of freezing rain possible in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. 
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency beginning Saturday at noon. He told residents to stay off the roads and prepare for possible power outages.
Deep chill across the United States 
Behind this second storm, a deep chill will grip much of the eastern half of the United States.
It may warm up enough for rain across the Midwest and Northeast on Sunday but will quickly dip below freezing. It's expected to happen so fast it would instantly freeze any moisture on the ground or surrounding objects. 
The extreme cold follows the storm and moves into the rest of the Eastern United States on Monday. 
This arctic air will spill out across the country later next week as far south as Florida, leaving most of the continental United States with below-average temperatures.

GINIA BELLAFANTE,"Beyond that, students actually seemed to enjoy Orgo Night in Butler Hall, crowding the room and saving seats for one another.
The band abided the new rule until it didnt. The following December, in 2017, it sneaked instruments into Butler the day before Orgo Night and performed there anyway. As Samantha Rowan, president of the Columbia University Band Alumni Association, put it, the students were tired of dealing with a disrespectful administration that treated them like naughty children. Officials were angry. Which was fair, I guess, Cameron Adam Danesh-Pajou, the bands head manager, remarked to me recently.
But the consequences did not seem so, especially given the legacy of 1968, when student demonstrations that resulted in some of the largest mass arrests in New York Citys history enshrined protest and defiance as essential elements of Columbias identity. Even though the band behaved itself, performing outside the following spring, the administration told band managers this past fall that it was pulling a bulk of the groups funding $15,000 of the $25,000 it received annually to cover the cost of instruments, repairs, travel to football and basketball games and so on at the end of the current academic year.
Mr. Danesh-Pajou explained that one result of the cuts is that it would be harder for all but the most privileged students to participate in the band, because the band has typically covered meals on the road and various other expenses. As it happens, the cuts are unfolding against the backdrop of new data from the National Center for Education Statistics showing that over the past decade, the total cost of attending Columbia as an undergraduate after grants and scholarships has steadily decreased for middle and upper middle class students while it has steadily gone up for lower-income students.
When you commit an act of civil disobedience you should expect a sanction, Dan Carlinsky, who serves on an advisory board in the bands alumni association, told me. But in this case, because of the actions of a few students, the band was getting punished in perpetuity. Mr. Carlinsky, who functions as the bands historian, pointed out that the universitys position also seemed hypocritical, given that it has highlighted Orgo Night in some of its fund-raising and recruitment materials as evidence that, contrary to assumptions, Columbia does in fact posses humor and spirit.","For decades, it was tradition at Columbia University for the marching band to storm the library the night before finals.

JOHN ELIGON,"Pack away the sidewalk tables and flip-flops; break out the boots and shovels.
Nature was showing its fickle side on Wednesday, with blizzard conditions, heavy snow and frigid air expected to pound parts of the Rockies and the Plains, just a day after the weather was sunny and idyllic in some of those same places.
The storm, caused by a low-pressure system moving east from the Pacific Ocean, is expected to bring temperature drops of about 50 degrees to places like Denver, where it was in the mid-70s and sunny on Tuesday but could drop to the mid-20s by Wednesday night, with 55-mile-an-hour wind gusts and up to 10 inches of snow. Whiteout conditions could make driving nearly impossible, forecasters said.
The effects of the low-pressure system will be felt from Colorado through Michigan, with heavy snow and thunderstorms, and even down into Texas, where dry conditions and high winds have led to fire warnings.
While the whiplash from pleasant to grim conditions might draw a collective groan, it should not come as much of a surprise to those familiar with springtime in the Plains.",Up to 10 inches of snow may fall on the city Wednesday as temperatures plunge below freezing from the mid-70s.

As much as 26 feet fell in parts of the Sierra Nevada in California, and people there started calling the month Februburied.
Patti Tritschler, 57, was among the air passengers arriving back in Chicago from warmer climes on Sunday, only to find the temperature dropping again. Honestly, we havent recovered since the polar vortex, Ms. Tritschler said. Its just gone on and on and on.
Faced with having to slog through still more of an already exhausting winter, some tried to wring a wry smile from the weather on social media.
Yay, more snow! Said no one EVER! the Missouri State Highway Patrol posted on Twitter.

Zack Whittaker,"I thought the worst thing about Popsugar’s Twinning tool was that it matched me with James Corden.
Turns out, the hundreds of thousands of selfies uploaded to the tool can be downloaded by anyone who knows where to look.
The popular photo matching tool taking the web by storm is fairly simple. “It analyzes a selfie or uploaded photo, compares it to a massive database of celebrity photos to find matches, and finally gives you a ‘twinning percentage’ for your top five look-alikes,” according to Popsugar, which developed the tool. Then, you share those matched photos on Facebook and Twitter so everyone knows that you don’t look at all like one of the many Kardashians.
All of the uploaded photos are stored in a storage bucket hosted on Amazon Web Services. We know because the web address of the bucket is in the code on the Twinning tool’s website. Open that in your web browser, and you’re looking at a real-time stream of uploaded photos.
We verified the findings by uploading a dummy photo of a certain file size at a specific time. Then, we scraped a list of filenames uploaded during that time period from the bucket’s web address, downloaded them, and found our uploaded image by searching for that photo of a certain file size. (We didn’t download any more than necessary to preserve people’s privacy.)
TechCrunch reached out to Popsugar president Lisa Sugar and vice-president of engineering Mike Patnode, but did not hear back.
As data leaks go, this is definitely on the low-end. You might not care that their selfies were exposed and easily downloadable. (Many photos were already leaking out of Google’s search results even before people shared their selfie matches on Twitter!) It’s not as if the site was leaking your passwords or your Social Security number. Most probably didn’t go in expecting any reasonable level of security or privacy to begin with.
But like any free app, quiz or some viral web tool, it’s worth reminding that you’re still putting your information out there and you can’t always get it back. Worse, you almost never know how secure your data will be, or how it might end up being used and abused in the future.

KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and CHRISTINA CARON,"As of Sunday, the storm did not appear too threatening, but by Monday afternoon, the outlook had shifted. Meteorologists said the storm had intensified, and they predicted more snow, with as much as two feet in Maine and parts of Cape Cod. Rhode Island and parts of New Hampshire were expecting up to 18 inches. The Cape was also expected to be blasted with high winds, with gusts up to 65 miles per hour, said Lenore Correia, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Taunton, Mass. Since early March, the region has been pummeled by storms. Last week, a nor’easter slammed into the East Coast on the heels of an earlier powerful storm that killed at least eight people and knocked out power for 2.7 million. Ms. Correia said the concern with this storm was the same — that the snow would be heavy and wet and could bring down more trees, branches and power lines, plunging New England residents into the cold and dark. Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts said officials were not calling out the National Guard as it had in the earlier storms because the tides would be low and any flooding was likely to be minor. Power failures were his main concern, Mr. Baker said. Crews, assisted by utilities from across the Northeast and Canada, have by now restored power to 750,000 homes and businesses in the state over the last several days, he said. It has been slow going because fallen limbs and trees took out individual lines, meaning crews were restoring power “one neighborhood at a time.” Cities farther south along the East Coast are facing far less precipitation. The National Weather Service predicted between two and five inches of snow in New York City and surrounding areas, where a winter weather advisory was in effect. The eastern end of Long Island could get up to 10 inches of snow. New Jersey, where some residents are still without power from the earlier storms, is expected to get between one and four inches.
