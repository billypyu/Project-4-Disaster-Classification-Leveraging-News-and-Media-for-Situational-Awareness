Laura Mallonee,"Christie Hemm Klok’s 3-year-old son couldn't get enough of firefighters. He had a toy engine truck, a plastic helmet he wore all the time, and a collection of books showing firefighters dousing fires and saving lives. But most of them were men, and the lack of women bugged Hemm Klok. ""There was maybe one female in any of the books,"" she says, ""and she had short hair and maybe a pink shirt on."" Hemm Klok wanted to show her son a more inclusive vision of the world. She began visiting firehouses in San Francisco, where she lives, to photograph female firefighters. Her new book The Women of SFFD features 45 portraits of women who spend their days running into burning buildings. “I want to raise a son who thinks he can be whatever he wants—and so can everybody else,"" she says. More than 270 women serve in the San Francisco Fire Department, which services 1.5 million people across the city's 49 square miles. They make up roughly 16 percent of the force, compared to just half of one percent of the New York City Fire Department. The numbers don’t necessarily speak to the city’s open-mindedness, though. Oh sure, the fire department made a couple women honorary members in the 19th century (including a pretty opera singer who never picked up a hose). But it didn't allow women to apply for a job before 1976—and it didn't hire any until 1987, when a federal judge forced it to. Current chief Joanne Hayes-White became the first female to fill the role in 2004. “Now it’s not crazy for a woman to be a firefighter in San Francisco,” Hemm Klok says. “They’re on, like, every truck.” Hemm Klok started noticing the women on fire trucks after moving to San Francisco in 2015 to work at WIRED. She left the company in 2016, and began the series later that year, showing up at firehouses with her Canon 5D Mark IV and a portable light kit and inviting the women to pose for a portrait. More often than not, they'd get called away to fight a fire before she could snap their photo. “I can’t tell you how many times I was just sitting alone in the garage of a firehouse,” she says. Eventually, she began showing up early in the morning, after the women had finished their 24-hour shifts. And when she didn't have childcare, she brought her son. ""The firefighters spoiled him like crazy,"" she says. ""They even sent a firetruck to our house during his fourth birthday."" Photographing them challenged some of Hemm Klok's own misconceptions about the type of person who becomes a firefighter. Many of the women had worked in food service or education and only wandered into firefighting after hearing about it from a friend or attending a job fair. “When I thought about people becoming firefighters, I assumed it was something they always wanted to do, to save lives, be brave,” Hemm Klok says. “But a lot of times people come into it later in life."" Her portraits depict the women posing in the firehouses' offices, garages and locker rooms, still wearing their black turnout coats and helmets after a hard day on the job. They're refreshing.“We hear that representation matters all the time, and it really does,” Hemm Klok says. “It’s so reassuring to see yourself not left out of things.”",Christie Hemm Klok photographed 45 women who work for the San Francisco Fire Department.,2018-06-04T14:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",The Trailblazing Women Who Fight California’s Fires,https://www.wired.com/story/portraits-san-francisco-female-firefighters/,"https://media.wired.com/photos/5b1177a205b78144fa73f4e1/191:100/pass/(from%20left)%20Cecilia%20Jiang%20(CJ)%20-%20Lieutenant,%2020%20years,%20Laura%20Wardell%20-%20Firefighter,%202%20years,%20Kacy%20Cardinale%20-%20Chief's%20Operator,%2027%20years,%20Mindy%20Talmadge%20-%20Administrative%20Officer,%2022%20years,%20Erin%20Yamamura%20-%20Firefighter,%2022%20years.jpg",wired,Wired,fires,1
"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Like a group of friends at a remote cottage in a campy serial killer film, your consumer protections are being stealthily killed one at a time, as you run around trying to put out other fires. Well, make that two at a time. Yesterday, a federal judge ruled that Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, which created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is unconstitutional “in its entirety.” And the Trump administration’s Department of Labor failed to appeal a court ruling that voided the Fiduciary Rule, thus killing it. But that’s not all the Trump administration has been successful in rolling back. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau The CFPB was created by Dodd Frank in the aftermath of the financial crisis to hold institutions accountable for their bad behavior. The CFPB has gone after predatory student loan and payday lenders, banks like Wells Fargo who have swindled customers and, in the case of the lawsuit referenced above, was suing a company it alleged “deceived 9/11 first responders with cancer and other illnesses as well as NFL football players with brain injuries out of millions of dollars.” In fact, for pretty much any financial infraction now, the advice when you’ve been scammed or believe something illegal has happened—say, your student loan servicer says you haven’t made X number of payments when you know you have, or Wells Fargo opens an extra checking account in your name without your knowledge—is to file a complaint with the CFPB, which can then investigate the claims. And for that reason it’s been a target of the “pro-business” lobby since its inception. It is likely that the ruling will be appealed, but it’s bad news for people who want more methods in place to hold lenders, banks and other financial institutions in check. This week, federal regulators from the Federal Reserve proposed a rollback of the Volcker Rule,… Read more Read Department of Education Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is working overtime to make sure minority students and those who fall victim to predatory for-profit schools and student loan lenders have as little federal (and state) recourse as possible. As I covered previously, so far during her short tenure, DeVos has put rules that would protect students from predatory for-profit schools on hold and rescinded a 60-day grace period for students who fell into default to get their payments in order and avoid a 16 percent fee. Education is also telling states to drop their efforts into regulating student loan servicers, and DeVos has rolled back rules meant to help disabled students as well as guidance on sexual assault cases on college campuses. The Department of Education is fighting states over their efforts to more strictly regulate student … Read more Read Banking Deregulations Last month, federal officials proposed rolling back the Volcker Rule, another aspect of the Dodd-Frank Act that aims to “prevent Wall Street from making risky bets with customers’ money for the bank’s own profit,” as I reported at the time. Kimberly Palmer, NerdWallet’s Banking Expert, told me that consumers aren’t likely to feel the effects of this action until there’s “a problem, like a financial crisis or bank failure.” Which is exactly when you want to find out. President Trump has also rescinded a rule protecting African American and Latino consumers from discrimination from auto lenders, and signed a law that exempts small- and medium-sized (read: most) banks from Dodd-Frank altogether. Fiduciary Rule I’ve written about the Fiduciary Rule before, and it’s one of those things that feels so obvious it’s head-scratching What it would have done: Implemented by the Obama administration, it would have required all retirement advisors to act in their clients’ best interests instead of their own—in other words, to meet the fiduciary standard. That’s something Certified Financial Planners and other types of advisors already have to do, but there’s a whole industry of broker dealers and other types of financial advisors who don’t. The Fiduciary Rule is one step closer to death, and that means it’s once again A-ok for your… Read more Read And that means if you go to one of them for investment advice, they could sell you a product (say, a certain fund) that gives them a kickback while you’re left with potentially lower returns and higher fees than another, similar product would have produced. Obama’s White House’s Council on Economic Advisers found that non-fiduciaries cost us, the average 401(k)/IRA retirement investors, $17 billion per year. This comes in the midst of America’s retirement crisis, making it even more egregious that the government is doing nothing to ensure the average American’s already insufficient retirement savings aren’t reduced further by brokers looking to make a quick buck at our expense. To avoid that fate, you want to make sure anyone you get financial advice on specific investments and plans is a fiduciary. Here’s information on how to find one. Now, Barron’s reports that the SEC is creating its own “best-interest rule,” which also requires brokers to put their clients’ interests before their own. The SEC is hearing public comments until August 7. Taken one by one, the rollback of our basic consumer protections is alarming.

Adam Rogers,"The mudslides earlier this week that killed 17 people—eight more remain missing—came as a terrifying surprise in the early morning to the enclaves of Montecito and Summerland, nestled into the California coastline just southeast of Santa Barbara. But in most respects, they were also entirely predictable—and predicted. The Thomas Fire, the largest wildfire in California history, burned almost 450 square miles of the Santa Ynez mountains in late December, a swath of steep, rocky chaparral as big as San Antonio. Then the rains came, a massive winter storm after almost a year of drought. This is the climatic and geomorphological history of the transverse ranges, the “fire-flood cycle”—as a scientific journal article named it in 1935. The mountains of Southern California burn and then liquefy with terrifying regularity, and, yes, more often than they used to thanks in some measure to climate change and increased human development. Only now, science is starting to catch up to the cycle—to understand how it works and predict when it will be at its worst. And those scientific insights are coming just in time for more and more people to build more and more houses at the feet of those eternally liquefying mountains. In one sense the mudslides—what geologists more properly call “debris flows,” because they contain both water and a diversity of stuff, from ash to houses—have always been predictable. Wildfires are getting more common, and wildfires make mountainsides more likely to give way. With vegetation burned away, roots that held underlying soil together are gone, and the cover that a canopy might have provided against rain vanishes as well. In Southern California’s chaparral biome, that vegetation adds another factor. Those shrubs and low, waxy plants are adapted to fires every few decades. Their drought tolerance comes in part from a resin-like coat on their leaves that helps retain moisture. But fire volatilizes that wax, which then coats the soil and ash left behind. “You develop these hydrophobic soils,” says Francis Rengers, a geomorphologist on the US Geological Survey’s Post-Wildfire Debris Flow Team. “Water that normally would hit the ground and soak in, because soil is porous, now it’s the soil and it’s like you put a raincoat on the landscape.” Dump enough rain onto that coat, though, and it penetrates, and that hydrophobicity can enhance erosion. Even the geology of Southern California’s mostly east-west mountain ranges makes debris flows more likely. The region’s frequent earthquakes—what, you want fires and mudslides to be the only disasters?—are evidence of “active tectonics.” Which is to say, those mountain ranges are growing boys and girls, always getting taller and steeper. More steep equals more likely to slide. The rock itself is, geologically speaking, “shattered”—above Montecito, where the Thomas-related slides were, it’s sedimentary and metasedimentary rock, much more likely to erode than, say, Yosemite granite. “It’s rock that’s loose and available to move,” Rengers says. So these SoCal debris flows are, quite literally, the stuff of literature. The great science journalist John McPhee wrote about them in “Los Angeles Against the Mountains” in 1988, and TC Boyle picked up on the terror of it all in his 2005 short story “La Conchita.” “A vanguard of boulders came sluicing across the freeway, followed by a soupy river of mud. A rock the size of a cannonball thumped into the underside of the U-Haul truck and a fistful of pellets—gravel, I guess—sprayed the side of my car,” Boyle writes. “The mud spread out across the pavement, seething around the tires and underneath the car and beyond, and soon dark tongues of it had pushed across the southbound lanes, too.” It’s good writing because it’s right. “The debris starts out in a loose state and gets agitated as it goes downhill. As it mixes with water, it attains a liquefied state that allows it to flow almost as readily as water, even though it’s charged with boulders and debris,” says Richard Iverson, a hydrologist with the US Geological Survey. “The leading edge is chock-full of the largest debris, and that part has a lot of resistance. So what you get is a more liquefied, fluid part pushing that resistive front forward, but because you have the front it can become much deeper.” In other words, the leading edge of a debris flow is a moving dam, a wave of destruction that accretes yet more ammunition as it oozes forward as fast as 10 miles per hour, like the parade in Satoshi Kon’s Paprika —a “bouldery snout,” as Susan Cannon and Jerry DeGraff wrote in 2009, “followed by a more viscous body that transitions to a very muddy water flow.” The big stuff in the front acts like a bulldozer, the pressure of the muck causes even more damage, and the water can literally float cars off the ground and buildings off their foundations. “Down a steep canyon, the debris flow will be getting bigger and bigger,” Iverson says. “Once it hits flatter terrain or can spread out onto an alluvial fan or into a neighborhood, then it slows down and quits growing.” Fortunately, in recent years geologists have gotten better and better at predicting which slopes are likely to slide after fires, based on computer models using data from previous flows. So for example, Rengers’ team starts with satellite images of burned areas, comparing the green-ness of before images to the blackness of the afters to develop burn severity maps. “That’s called a normalized burn ratio image,” Rengers says. “It’s a quantifiable signal.” To that, they add soil erodibility data from onsite examination and the National Resources Conservation Service, the soil division of the US Department of Agriculture, combined with information on the steepness of the slopes that burned. “Areas with high burn severity, steep slopes, and high erodibility have the highest probabilities for where debris flows will originate,” Rengers says. And in fact, his group’s map of debris flow hazards shows the hills above Montecito and Summerland as having a very high probability of sliding. The area was under evacuation orders before Tuesday. It just needed one more ingredient: Rain. And that happened, too. “For the Santa Barbara County-Ventura area, it takes about a half an inch of rain in one hour for debris flows to occur,” Rengers says. “What we saw in the Montecito area was that there was a half inch of rain in five minutes.” So it was a coincidental catastrophe. Chaparral starts to grow back within months; the rains came just weeks after fire crews got the Thomas Fire under control. I drove through that part of the state two weeks ago, and the hillsides were black. “It was a really low probability rainfall event, like a 0.5 percent chance,” Rengers says. “That kind of explains the big response.” What researchers like Iverson and Rengers don’t yet know how to predict is what kind of damage a debris flow will do and where it’ll go. The flatter land between the mountains and the sea, packed with buildings, is in its way more chaotic terrain than the hillsides and canyons. The question is, how far will a debris flow spread? “Once something comes out of the canyon and gets routed down streets and between houses, it becomes challenging to track the momentum and deceleration of the flow,” Rengers says. “We’re pretty confident we understand the physics, but the parameter values, like how much debris should we estimate? What water ratio? It’s almost impossible.” It’s all under active research; people from Rengers’ group are in Southern California already, flying planes over the area and taking measurements. Iverson’s group is working on models for the potentially city-killing debris flows that could conceivably come off of Mount Rainier in Washington. Fire researchers and geologists know a few things for sure: The 2018 fire season starts in about nine months. The cycle starts again. And what’s true in California is increasingly true everywhere. Fires are more likely to start in the built environment, along the wildland-urban interface where human beings live, and more human beings live there than ever before. Climate change means warmer springs and summers, and possibly increases in precipitation as well. Then the rains will come, and mountainsides will flow like water again.","Scientists are learning how to predict deadly mudslides. (After fires, when enough rain comes.)

Kirsten Korosec,"VW AG has ended its contract with Rupert Stadler, removing the embattled executive as CEO and from the Audi and Volkswagen boards several months after he was arrested for his involvement in the cover-up of diesel emissions cheating at the company. Stadler, who began working at Audi in 1990, is the latest executive at parent company Volkswagen AG, to be ousted in the wake of the diesel emissions cheating scandal that erupted three years ago. The scandal has implicated numerous executives and several brands under VW Group, including Volkswagen, Audi and even Porsche. The diesel emissions scandal broke in 2015 when it was revealed that Volkswagen Groups so-called Clean Diesel vehicles had been fitted with software designed to cheat emissions tests. Volkswagen fired its CEO Martin Winterkorn in 2015 for his connection to the scandal. Winterkorn was later charged with conspiracy and wire fraud in a U.S. court. Three years later, his replacement, Matthias Müller was also removed as Volkswagen CEO and replaced with Herbert Diess. Stadler was suspended as CEO following his arrest by German authorities in June in connection with a criminal investigation into the diesel emissions cheating. Stadler is still in jail. Bram Schot has been acting as temporary CEO since Stadler’s arrest. Here’s VW’s statement: The supervisory boards of Volkswagen AG and AUDI AG have today consented to the conclusion of an agreement with Rupert Stadler on the termination of his offices as a member of the board of management of Volkswagen AG and chairman of the board of management of AUDI AG as well as of his service agreements. Mr. Stadler is leaving the companies with immediate effect and will no longer work for the Volkswagen Group. Mr. Stadler is doing so because, due to his ongoing pretrial detention, he is unable to fulfill his duties as a member of the board of management and wishes to concentrate on his defense. The contractual execution depends on the course and outcome of the criminal proceedings. Stadler joined the company’s board in 2003. He was made chairman of Audi AG four years later. In 2010, Stadler was appointed to Volkswagen AG’s board.","VW AG has ended its contract with Rupert Stadler, removing the embattled executive as CEO and from the Audi and Volkswagen boards several months after he was arrested for his involvement in the cover-up of diesel emissions cheating at the company.

Sarah Jeong,"Early this morning, the president announced via Twitter that Mike Pompeo, the current director of the CIA, would replace Secretary Rex Tillerson at the State Department. Steve Goldstein, a State Department official, told CNN that Tillerson found out via tweet this morning. Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2018 This is not the first time the president has publicly fired a high-ranking member of his administration without letting the individual know ahead of time. Last summer, former FBI director James Comey was made aware of his firing during a speech he was giving at the FBI field office in Los Angeles. TVs in the room ran the news as he was giving his speech. The Secretary did not speak to the President this morning and is unaware of the reason, but he is grateful for the opportunity to serve, and still believes strongly that public service is a noble calling and not to be regretted. We wish Secretary-Designate Pompeo well — Steve Goldstein (@UnderSecPD) March 13, 2018 Before President Trump tapped him to lead the State Department, Rex Tillerson was the CEO and chairman of ExxonMobil for a little over a decade. His appointment was confirmed 53-46, with senators splitting mostly along party lines. His confirmation received the most opposition that any secretary of state has received in 50 years. Prior to becoming the director of the CIA, Tillerson’s replacement Mike Pompeo was a Republican congressman representing Kansas. Pompeo has, in the past, publicly called for ripping up the Iran agreement and removing Kim Jong-un as the leader of North Korea. Gina Haspel, who will be replacing Pompeo as director of the CIA, is a longtime veteran of the agency. She oversaw the torture of two terrorism suspects at a CIA overseas detention site she ran in Thailand and later participated in the destruction of videotapes of that torture. Haspel has been deputy director of the CIA since February.

Matt Simon,"Nestled in the foothills of Californias Sierra Nevada Mountains is the quaint Gold Rush town of Nevada City. Surrounded by unkempt brush, the old, highly flammable city is in danger: with Californias wildfires raging with unprecedented ferocity in recent years, one spark could doom Nevada City to the same fate that neighboring Paradise met in November.
But not if the goats get there first. Realizing its predicament, Nevada City has launched a crowdfunding campaign to pay goats (or, more accurately, their herders) to clear brush at the edges of town. Its called, yes, Goat Fund Me. And its part of an ungulate awakening: All across the state, business is booming for herders as panicked homeowners and towns reckon with the wildfire menace.
There is no single explanation for why Californias wildfire problem has gotten so bad. Climate change is oneless rain in the fall means dryer brush, which in turn coincides with seasonal winds that fan massive blazes. More cities encroaching on wildlands is another.
Yet a third factorthe one most pertinent to the interests of goatsis the fact that California has been really, really bad about clearing the brush that turns into tinder. For comparison, the southeastern US, an area only five times bigger than California, did prescribed burns on 5.5 million acres last year, 100 times more than the Golden State. Prescribed burns are expensive, and a huge chunk of Californias fire money goes to battling ever-larger blazes.
Goats, though? A herd's work is relatively cheap, around $1,000 an acre (200 goats can tear through an acre a day). I realized money was an issue, says Nevada City vice mayor Reinette Senum, who launched Goat Fund Me. We can go out and pursue grants but that takes months, and we don't have months. The best time for the goats to do their thing is in the winter, before new growth blooms during the rains of spring. That and the ranchers already have their goats rented out for the rest of the year.
The first step is to identify the most prone areas with the help of the fire chief, then reach out to residents there to tell them that there might soon be a special scent in the air. You've got to let neighbors know: for a couple days you might get a smell, says Senum. Your dogs might be disturbed because they're smelling goats and may want to go after them.
To be clear, the goats dont work alone. They have human handlers and their own muscle in the form of a big white dog. They're fiercely protective, says Brad Fowler, owner of the vegetation management company The Goat Works, which is working with the city. In California we've got mountain lions and coyotes and recently wolves. The dogs, just by their presence and their bark, discourage predators to go somewhere else.
The operation doesnt simply amount to letting goats loose on a property. Basically we have a mobile ranch, says Fowler. We're taking a ranch essentially with all the infrastructure that's included in that to every place we go. The team sets up solar-powered electric fences to keep the goats penned in a particular area. If possible they hunt down local creeks or ponds, but they may also truck in their own water.
But for the most part, once theyre in place, the goats are self-starters. Theyre highly efficient vegetation managers, since they convert a plants solar energy into protein and poop, which nourishes the ecosystem, whereas human crews have to cart off what they clear. Theyll eat most plants from the shoulder up, so dead grasses and such. (If you want to really clear grass, sheep are your best bet.) Nevada City has a particular problem with out-of-control blackberry bushes, whose thorns are no problem for the goats. They've got really nimble lips, says Fowler. It's funny to watch them. They'll hold the branch with their lips and reach in and bite it off with their back teeth.
Being goats, though, they dont necessarily abide by human notions of containment. A bad day would be, you get a call that all your animals are two miles away from where they're supposed to be, says Fowler. The good news is when that happens, people don't get as upset about it as they would if, say, your bulldozer got loose and ran over a bunch of houses. As long as they stay out of traffic, Im OK.
On their own, goats only do part of the job; theyre more of an advance party. They get in there and strip out the brush enough for human crews to come in with chainsaws to cart away the bigger branches and such. Of particular convenience is the fact that goats will happily eat poison oak. They're cute little things, but it's only one little piece, says Senum. Who doesn't love a goat?
Still, the firefighting ruminant business is booming in California, beyond Nevada City. It seems like everybody kind of woke up with these big fires, says Fowler. And I tell you what, there's a huge opportunity. If somebody wants to get into the business, now would be a good time.

Patrick Lucas Austin,"After the explosion of an iPhone inside an Apple Store, resulting in a few minor injuries, you might be wondering “Oh shit, how do I stop my smartphone/laptop/ robot dog from burning my house down ?” Instead of running for dear life, or dousing your device with spring water, here are the steps you should follow to properly extinguish a battery-related fire (and why you should save that Pellegrino as a last resort). Smartphone Fire? Unplug It First A smartphone battery fire is only made worse if that smartphone is drawing on another power source while it burns. When your battery starts to hiss or bulge, be sure to unplug it from whatever power source it’s connected to before you turn your attention to extinguishing. Start With a Fire Extinguisher Safety first means being prepared for emergencies like fires, caused by your smartphone’s self-immolating battery or otherwise. That means you’ll need a fire extinguisher, so add one to your shopping list. In terms of fire extinguishers, you should have one designed to put out Class B and Class C fires. Class B fires involve flammable liquids and gases, while Class C fires involve electrical equipment like motors and batteries. Your standard fire extinguisher, costing anywhere from $35 to $80, should be able to handle Class A, B, and C fires. There are a variety of extinguishers available, but searching for a Class ABC extinguisher will yield one appropriate for dowsing your new Pixel 2. If you’re on a budget, you can snag smaller fire suppression canisters that are both cheaper (anywhere from $20 to $40) and smaller than a standard fire extinguisher. In late December, Galaxy Note 8 owners started to report a bizarre issue with the phone’s battery.… Read more Read Class D fire extinguishers are also available, but are designed to extinguish fires involving combustible metals. While you can certainly use one to put out your smartphone, a class D fire extinguisher’s high price tag might put it a bit out of your reach, so don’t bother spending the hundreds of dollars required to get one. Water or Sand Works in a Pinch Thanks to the chemical composition of smartphones powered by lithium batteries, there is always the chance that pouring water on a smartphone could cause a chemical reaction between the H2O and lithium metal, turning that hydrogen into fuel for the fire. Fortunately, most smartphone batteries have such little lithium the risk is pretty negligible. Should you find yourself dealing with a smartphone fire armed only with a six-pack of seltzer, feel free to apply it liberally, and drown your smartphone until no more smoke is visible. Needless to say, your phone is toast. You can dispose of your charred battery by searching for a battery disposal location near you. If your iPhone decides to blow up at the beach, you can also cover it in sand or other non-flammable smothering agent like dirt. As with most things that burn, be sure to avoid inhaling the fumes from a smoking battery, as they’re toxic, carcinogenic, and just plain gross.","After the explosion of an iPhone inside an Apple Store, resulting in a few minor injuries, you might be wondering “Oh shit, how do I stop my smartphone/laptop/robot dog from burning my house down?” Instead of running for dear life, or dousing your device with…",2018-01-15T19:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Lifehacker.com'}",How to Extinguish a Battery Fire,https://lifehacker.com/how-to-extinguish-a-battery-fire-1822040010,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--GAb-KedI--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/glkvfwub9nefofh69zoj.jpg",,Lifehacker.com,fires,1

They join the more than 7,500 California wildfires that have this year consumed nearly 1.7-million acres of landmore than any fire season on record. The increasing intensity of California's blazes has many residents of the Golden State wondering: Is the smoke from wildfires also getting worse? That's a complicated question. On one hand, data suggests California's fires are burning hotter and consuming more land than they did in the past. ""If you use intensity as a proxy for pollutionthat is, if you assume stronger fires will produce more emissions like smokethen by stint of that, yes, there ought to be more smoke,"" says atmospheric composition scientist Mark Parrington. A senior researcher at the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, Parrington tracks wildfires around the world to better understand their effect on pollution and public health. Most mornings he's in his office by 8 am, downloading the previous 24 hours' worth of fire data from a supercomputer operated by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The datathermal infrared radiation measurements from NASA's MODIS instrument allow him to estimate the intensity of fires burning around the world; how many emissions (like lung-aggravating aerosols and greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide) they're pumping into the atmosphere; and how those emissions affect global air quality. From his office in Reading, just west of London, he's kept closer tabs on California's current wildfires than most. ""You really don't expect to see emissions of this magnitude, this late in the year,"" Parrington says. ""Even on a global scale, it really stood out."" Parrington also compares each day's emissions data to past measurements, which is how he knows that California's current wildfires have pumped more schmutz into the atmosphere than any November blazes on record. In fact, this year's California wildfires have produced more emissions than all but 13 of the past 16 years. ""It's not just the Camp Fire, but the wildfires from this summer,"" Parrington says. ""The Carr Fire, the Mendocino Complex Firethey've been devastating."" If the state sees any major wildfires in December (the way it did in 2017), 2018 could become the year with the highest emissions ever recorded for California. And yet, the question of whether smoke is getting worse is more complicated than many people realize. That's because smoke itself is pretty complex. For starters, it contains well beyond the 40 different ""pyrogenic species"" Parrington says his analyses account for, which include various forms of carbon, and toxic aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene. The relative and absolute quantities of said species can vary considerably, based on the conditions of the burnlike whether it's wet, dry, or has burned in the past. ""All of these factors contribute to how much of those fire emissions get turned into smoke and how the pollutants interact with each other,"" Parrington says. Determining how much smoke is actually in the atmosphere, let alone entering people's lungs, is also challenging. Parrington says it requires understanding how smoke interacts with large scale weather conditions like wind, ground temperature, air temperature, and cloud cover. In the Bay Area, for instance, high pressure atmospheric systems tend to produce inversion layers that, like a lid on a shallow pan, keep smoky air close to the ground. Determining the region's air quality has to do not just with the absolute quantity of smoke, but how much of it is is trapped at ground level. There's also fuel sources to consider, variations in which produce different kinds of smoke. ""The fact that more fires are happening at the wildland urban interface means that fires are encountering new materials,"" says Jessica McCarty, a geographer at Miami University specializing in fire-related air pollution. When it comes to fuel, McCarty says, fires are agnostic. If it's hot enough, it doesn't care if it's a tree, a house, or your car. But as a rule of thumb, the emissions emanating from a burning shrub are less caustic than those of a burning Subaru. ""Wood is far from clean, but it's nothing compared to something like burning rubber, which is downright toxic,"" McCarty says. Which is why, as people build deeper and deeper into wildland areas, the relevant question isn't just how much pollution these fires producing, but what kind of pollution they're producing. Answers to both questions, Parrington says, could be found in computational systems like the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring service, which is capable of taking many of these variables into account and synthesizing the data across multiples wildfire seasons. CAMs has only been operational for three years, but the data it collects is openly available to scientists around the world who are increasingly interested in nuanced questions about wildland smoke. For residents of California, answers to those questions can't come soon enough. In the meantime, hang on to any extra air masks you have lying aroundthere's no telling when you might need them again.

But measuring air quality is more complex than you might think.",2018-11-14T18:31:23Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Is Smoke From California's Fires Getting Worse? Hard to Tell,https://www.wired.com/story/is-californias-smoke-getting-worse-its-complicated/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5beb43f558337a7335bf68cd/191:100/pass/Camp_Fire.jpg,wired,Wired,fires,1
Matt Simon,"California continues to take stock of its unprecedented conflagrations between the Camp Fire in the north, which on its own is the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, and the Woolsey Fire in the south, 82 lives have been lost so far, with hundreds more still missing. As firefighters keep battling the blazes, a new menace is emerging: debris flows. The rains are coming to California, as soon as Tuesday night, and the fires have primed the soil for another disaster that can claim yet more lives. The coastal town of Montecito, in Southern California, learned this lesson less than a year ago. Last December, the massive Thomas Fire burned through the hills, right up to the edges of town. Thanks to the communitys comprehensive fire preparedness plan, only 7 homes were lost. But a month later, the scorched hills outside of town let loose a storm-driven debris flow that enveloped the town, killing 21. The problem is a fundamental change to the soil itself. When a wildfire burns vegetation, it releases organic compounds. These compounds are heated in the fire, volatilize, and then re-condense on soil particles, says Brian Ebel, a hydrologist with the USGS. This soil normally absorbs water, but the organic compounds turn it hydrophobic, literally meaning fear of water. It is not an understatement: You can pour a bottle of water on this burned soil and itll bead right off, as if the dirt were polished marble. The water will pool up and sit there, and it can take more than an hour for it to penetrate fire-scorched soil, says Ebel. Problem number two: vegetation anchors the soil. When fire burns it away, the soil loosens. You can think of vegetation as a protective blanket, says Jason Kean, a hydrologist at the USGS. Without it, sediment has nothing to hold it in place. Before there's even rain, debris can roll down the hill and accumulate in channels. Now hydrologists and meteorologists are keeping a close eye on communities that butt up against these latest fires, where the conditions are set for catastrophic debris flows when the rain comes. Once it starts raining hard on a burn area, the things can get generated really fast, like five minutes, says Kean. The debris flow can carry boulders and trees along with mud, making it more dangerous than a regular flood or a dry landslide. When you mobilize themkeep them mobile with this muddy matrix in between themthey can go 3 kilometers, says Kean. The video below shows just how easily the flow tosses boulders around. Boulders can also act like a moving dam, retarding the flow. So you get this surging behavior, where these things are holding back a whole bunch of flow behind it, adds Kean. It really makes the flow depth increase several times what you'd get in a water-only flood. The Montecito debris flow got to be 30 feet deep at points, lodging boulders in trees. Humans are powerless to stop itsandbags just become more debris for the flow. But it can be predicted, giving residents a chance to evacuate. The work begins as soon as a wildfires smoke clears enough for satellites to get a good look at how badly areas have burned. This information is relayed to scientists on the ground, who enter those burned regions as soon as its safe. The greatest risk of debris flow is in the zones that burned the most intensely, and scientists spend two or three days wandering the fire perimeter taking soil samples. That involves testing the hydrophobicity of the soil, the water repellency, says Eric Huff, staff chief of Cal Fires Forest Practice Program, and actually getting down on hands and knees and looking at what that surface soil layer is showing, whether or not organic matter has been completely burned off. Kean and his colleagues then compare this data to their understanding of where debris flows have let loose in the area historically, building a map that captures the probability and potential volume of a debris flow. They also identify values at riskhuman life and structures that may be in danger. With all this data in mind, they can calculate how much rain you would need to potentially let loose a debris flow for different regions of the map. Often half an inch of rain in an hour is enough to kick one off, or as little as five minutes of heavy rain. It's kind of a run-of-the-mill storm, says Kean. It's heavy rain, but it's not particularly exceptional. So the National Weather Service carefully watches storms as they head into California. (Unfortunately, with climate change, California may see fewer yet more intense storms going forward.) As the rain approaches the coast, officials can send out wireless alerts, like you would get for an Amber alert, as well as warnings on TV and radio. Which brings us back to the Montecito disaster. Forecasters saw the storm coming, predicting it would drop an inch and a half of rain an hour. What we saw in reality that night was a 30-minute heavy rain that moved through that area, says Eric Boldt, a warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service. It was closer to six and a half inches per hour. And there's no computer models that exist today that can predict that type of rate. Officials had put voluntary evacuation orders in place, but not everyone heeded the advice. This was just after the Thomas Fire, after all. They had just been evacuated for two or three weeks over the holiday season, says Boldt. They were just getting comfortable back in their homes and they didn't want to leave again. If you havent cleared out in time and the flow comes, the recommendation is to shelter in placemoving to the upper story of your house, for instance. Out on the streets is exactly where you don't want to be, as the flow follows those paths. We've even seen people, if they were able to get up on their countertops in their kitchen, the mud came up to about that level, says Boldt. It's a different way of thinking about the impact because it's not the same as a flash flood. With a flash flood, you can see a river swelling and move to higher ground. Flee up a hill just before a debris flow, though, and that ground could kill you. The debris flow risk can persist for up to five years after a wildfire. So residents whose homes narrowly survived a wildfire may not realize theyre in danger of the surrounding hills for longer than a year. But the danger is most certainly there. Its a brutal consideration for those trying to recover from the Camp and Woolsey fires, but its also an extremely important one. A menace begets another menace.

Rachel Becker,"An adorable video that shows how beavers can fight wildfires is making the rounds on Twitter, and it’s everything science communication should be: short, compelling, clear, and about beavers. The stop-motion video is the work of Emily Fairfax, a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder. It shows a beaver building a dam and transforming the forest upstream into a marshy wetland filled with splotches of vegetation in shades of green. When a fire rages through the forest, the ponds of water and healthy plants protect the area above the beaver dam from the flames. That includes the beaver, which holds up a little flag that says “I’m okay!” As a scientist I've had an ""elevator speech"" prepared for a few years now. This year I made an ""elevator video"" & let me tell you: people enjoy seeing my research way more than just hearing about it! So what do #beavers have to do with #wildfire ? Watch (with sound) & find out! pic.twitter.com/axc523sRgq — Emily Fairfax (@EmilyFairfax) February 17, 2019 So far, the video has more than 180,000 views on Twitter, and it’s getting the delighted reactions it deserves. Conservation experts, teachers, and beaver advocates have all asked Fairfax for her permission to share the video. Others want to know how she made it, and, as it turns out, it’s pretty low-tech: Fairfax set up a beaver dam in her kitchen, snapped photos on her iPhone, and used an app to turn them into a stop-motion video. The whole thing started because Fairfax is wrapping up her PhD and is studying the ways that beavers can help their habitat withstand hazards like fire and drought. Now that she’s applying to jobs, she’s spending a lot of time trying to explain her research, and she realized she kept reaching for a visual aid. “I’m trying to talk with my hands, and I want to pull up all these pictures on my phone,” she tells The Verge. So she made a video instead. “People give me beaver stuff for the holidays every year.” She set the scene on a cork board at her kitchen table with construction paper, rocks from her garden, and leftover fake plants from her wedding. She made the stream, beaver dam, pond, wetland, vegetation, and the fire out of felt. The beaver was the easy part. “I already had a bunch of little beaver toys because people give me beaver stuff for the holidays every year,” she says. It took her a few tries to snap about 300 photos on her phone, which she stitched together with the Stop Motion Pro app. Then she added sound effects in iMovie — including a banjo soundtrack. The music is a nod to documentaries about beavers, Fairfax told The Verge. “ There’s always banjo music playing when they’re building, and I don’t know why,” she says. “I can’t break tradition!” “ There’s always banjo music playing when they’re building, and I don’t know why.” She tweeted the video on Sunday, not expecting it to have much reach beyond what Fairfax calls her “beaver people” — a small community of people interested in beaver science. She went on a hike, and when she came back, the tweet had blown up. “I’m getting comments from K-12 educators, I’m getting comments from land managers,” she says. “Ultimately that’s the goal of something like this, to make people interested who wouldn’t otherwise read my papers, or come to my conference presentations.” Fairfax thinks part of the video’s appeal is its brevity. “Scientists have great tendency to ramble on — myself included — when we’re talking about things we really like,” she says. This video, by contrast, is less than a minute long. And the best part is that it doesn’t use any of the jargon that can make science so impenetrable because it doesn’t have any words.

This message comes from the UL Firefighter Safety Research Institute (FSRI), which found over a decade of research that the simple act could have a potentially life-saving impact. The more oxygen a fire has, the faster it spreads, so a closed door can offer protection. (Also, if you ever must exit a fire, close the door behind you to slow down its growth.) Between a room with an open door and one with a closed door, there can be a 900-degree difference. Watch how a fire impacts these two bedrooms, which are located side by side, adjacent to a burning living room. These days, house fires are more dangerous than ever, as the synthetic materials we use allow fire to spread more quickly than it did in previous generations.

Bryan Bishop,"Amazon Studios has formally fired Jeffrey Tambor from Transparent after completing an investigation into sexual harassment claims against the actor. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the actor will not participate whatsoever in the show’s upcoming fifth season. The company began looking into allegations from Tambor’s former assistant Van Barnes last November, less than a month after Amazon Studios head Roy Price resigned in the wake of his own sexual harassment scandal. According to the claims, Tambor had allegedly propositioned and groped Barnes, a transgender woman. At the time, the actor told Deadline that the accusations were “baseless,” though shortly thereafter, transgender actress Trace Lysette accused Tambor of similar behavior. Days later, Tambor acknowledged that it would be difficult for him to return to the show. With today’s announcement, Amazon formally severs its relationship with the actor entirely. “I have great respect and admiration for Van Barnes and Trace Lysette, whose courage in speaking out about their experience on Transparent is an example of the leadership this moment in our culture requires,” series creator Jill Soloway wrote in a statement. “We are grateful to the many trans people who have supported our vision for Transparent since its inception and remain heartbroken about the pain and mistrust their experience has generated in our community. We are taking definitive action to ensure our workplace respects the safety and dignity of every individual, and are taking steps to heal as a family.” Transparent has been a critical darling since its premiere in 2014. In 2015, it won the Golden Globe award for Best Television Series - Comedy or Musical, with Tambor winning both Emmy and Golden Globe awards for his performance in the series. In many ways, Transparent was the show that gave Amazon critical credibility as a producer of original television, much like House of Cards had done for Netflix.

Anthony Ha,"Tinder has fired its vice president of marketing and communications Rosette Pambakian, as well as other employees who sued Tinder’s parent company Match Group and its controlling shareholder IAC earlier this year.
The Verge first broke the news of the firings. A Match Group spokesperson confirmed that a number of Tinder employees have been terminated, though they did not identify them or say how many were involved.
The lawsuit was filed by Tinder co-founders Sean Rad, Justin Mateen and Jonathan Badeen and other executives. Some, like Rad, had already left Tinder, while others like Pambakian and Badeen, were still employed at the time.
In the suit, the group alleged that IAC and Match Group had manipulated financial data in order to lower the company’s valuation.They also alleged that Greg Blatt, who served as CEO of Match and Tinder, groped and sexually harassed Pambakian at the companys 2016 holiday party. (Match and IAC said the allegations were “meritless.”)
In an email sent to Match Group’s current CEO Mandy Ginsberg, Pambakian said that after being placed on leave when the lawsuit was filed, she was subjected to “ongoing intimidation and retaliation clearly designed to pressure me into resigning.” Pambakian also said that after she declined to sign a non-disparagement agreement, “Match snuck an arbitration clause into its employees most recent compliance acknowledgements, causing me, Jonathan, James and Josh to have to withdraw from the lawsuit.”
“I never imagined that Id be pushed out of my company for standing up for what is right,” she wrote. “But if that is the cost of being on the right side of history, Ill pay it. As a woman CEO, I truly hope that you reconsider the safety of your remaining female workforce and allow Tinder and other Match owned companies to follow in the footsteps of Uber, Facebook and Google in eliminating forced arbitration for sexual misconduct claims. We deserve better.”
In response, Ginsberg denied that Pambakian was fired for complaining about sexual harassment: “You couldnt have been, as you never reported Greg for sexual harassment.”
“As explained in the letter we sent you, you were terminated because it was not possible for you to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of your role as Tinders spokesperson for a number of reasons, including your public position against the company over a valuation process,” Ginsberg continued. “We also recently asked you to come to the office for a meeting with the HR department to discuss work-related activities and policies and were told that we can only contact you through your attorneys. Unfortunately, its impossible for you to do your work at Tinder if all communications related to your job have to go through your lawyers.”

Email from Rosette Pambakian to Mandy Ginsberg
Dear Mandy,
Six years ago I wrote the very first press release for Tinder. Since then, Ive poured my heart and soul into this company and helped grow it into a global phenomenon and top-grossing app. I was the youngest and longest-standing female executive at the company. I love Tinder. And I love my colleagues. But you have now fired me from a company I was so proud to build in blatant retaliation for joining a group of colleagues and Tinders original founding members in a lawsuit against Match and IAC, standing up for our rights, calling out the companys CEO Greg for sexual misconduct, and confronting the company about covering up what happened to me.
While I truly hoped that decency and professionalism would prevail and that you would let me return to work, I knew that was probably unlikely when I was placed on leave the very day the lawsuit was filed and you continued to defend the actions of the executive that I spoke out against. Rather than acknowledge the truth and condemn his actions, you chalked it up it to bad judgment. To make matters worse, you told the world that a sham investigation (in which I was never even interviewed) determined the assault was some sort of consensual cuddlingas if there could by anything consensual about a CEO groping his subordinate in front of other employees after making sexually explicit comments throughout the evening of a company holiday party. No company that has faced allegations like this has gone to such lengths to protect one of its own its truly despicable.
Since being placed on leave, Ive been subjected to ongoing intimidation and retaliation clearly designed to pressure me into resigningfrom immediately removing my name from my office and converting it into a conference room, to trying to coerce me into turning over my private and personal data on my phone. Though I can think of no other company that has actually fired the woman who made sexual assault allegations against an executivethe companys actions here, including firing me just one day before my remaining options vest, are totally consistent with the way you have circled the wagons around him from day one.
Was the board aware that the company would publicly blame the victim?
When I refused to sign a non-disparagement agreement presented to me by HR, which would have prevented me from speaking publicly about my experience in exchange for compensation, Match snuck an arbitration clause into its employees most recent compliance acknowledgements, causing me, Jonathan, James and Josh to have to withdraw from the lawsuit. Know that my former Tinder colleagues and I still vigorously support that lawsuit IAC and Match cheated us out of what we were promised and rightfully earned in exchange for building Tinder into Barry Dillers most valuable business. As the lawsuit progresses the evidence will emerge and the world will see how IAC and Match plotted against their employees and rewarded misconduct.
I never imagined that Id be pushed out of my company for standing up for what is right. But if that is the cost of being on the right side of history, Ill pay it. As a woman CEO, I truly hope that you reconsider the safety of your remaining female workforce and allow Tinder and other Match owned companies to follow in the footsteps of Uber, Facebook and Google in eliminating forced arbitration for sexual misconduct claims.

Email from Mandy Ginsberg to Rosette Pambakian
Dear Rosette,
Im glad you reached out to me directly and I would like to take this opportunity to clarify a few points, because there seems to be a very real disconnect here that I truly want to fix.
You were not terminated because you reported Greg for sexual harassment. You couldnt have been, as you never reported Greg for sexual harassment. When Sean Rad brought the subject up nearly five months later, right after the valuation process commenced, it was immediately and thoroughly investigated by the Board, independently without any involvement from Greg, which concluded that no sexual harassment occurred. I was not the CEO at the time, but I know that you were interviewed on at least two separate occasions and you never alleged sexual harassment.
On the topic of sexual harassment at Tinder, you know how seriously reports are taken. You yourself reported two other male colleagues, whom Sean Rad hired, and they were very quickly dismissed. Clearly, it was taken very seriously given the company terminated those individuals. More importantly though, Greg is no longer here. I am. And I promise you, we do not retaliate against anyone who reports sexual harassment. Your position was never at risk due to any sexual harassment complaints. I wanted to find a way to keep you employed at Tinder.
As explained in the letter we sent you, you were terminated because it was not possible for you to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of your role as Tinders spokesperson for a number of reasons, including your public position against the company over a valuation process. We also recently asked you to come to the office for a meeting with the HR department to discuss work-related activities and policies and were told that we can only contact you through your attorneys. Unfortunately, its impossible for you to do your work at Tinder if all communications related to your job have to go through your lawyers. As it relates to your personal information, any suggestion that we have been trying to access it is just not true. Like any company, weve asked for you, and all other employees involved, to return company laptops, phones and other devices to us. And unfortunately, we couldnt retrieve a number of company devices from you and the others since you claimed that they were coincidentally all lost or damaged just before you decided to sue the company.
There are two last points I want to make: on the point about your equity, those options have already been accelerated, and should be exercisable in your account, along with the other equity awards that have vested since August. However, on the arbitration agreements, there is no NDA in them and we never tried to force you to sign a non-disparagement agreement. Youre free to talk about anything publicly that youd like. You have already done so and thats your prerogative. But the arbitration agreement is attached again. As you already know from when you signed it, its clearly labeled Agreement to Arbitrate.
I am a strong female advocate and have said to the women in the organization that as a female CEO in charge, I have zero tolerance for bad behavior and I am very much invested in every single employees success.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption California wildfires continue to rage Strong winds have been fuelling California's deadly fires as search-and-rescue teams begin the grim task of searching for bodies among the ashes. Winds of up to 40mph (64km/h) are expected throughout Tuesday in the state's south, where the Woolsey Fire is threatening some 57,000 homes. Firefighters in the north are still battling the Camp Fire, which has left at least 42 people dead. Meanwhile, two new fires began in the south on Monday. They started within minutes of each other. The smaller of the two has since been put out, news agency Reuters reports. In the north, the Camp Fire, which has destroyed almost 7,200 homes, surpassed the 1933 Griffith Park disaster to become the deadliest in California's history after 13 more bodies were found, bringing the total killed to 42. The earlier tragedy left 31 dead. Many more people are said to be unaccounted for, with coroner-led search teams preparing to comb the largely incinerated town of Paradise on Tuesday. Three portable morgue, as well as specialist dog units, forensic anthropologists and a ""disaster mortuary"" have been requested to help with the operation, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea told reporters on Monday. The Woolsey Fire has so far killed two people as it damaged beach resorts including Malibu, a favourite with the rich and famous. More than 300,000 locals have been forced to flee their homes across California. US President Donald Trump has declared a ""major disaster"" in the state, making federal aid available to affected residents. What's the latest on the Camp Fire? Paradise and its surrounding areas bore the brunt of the Camp Fire - the largest blaze - which started in a nearby forest on Thursday. Some bodies were found in gutted cars that were overrun by the fast-moving fire, as residents scrambled to evacuate overnight. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many of the town's 26,000 residents have had their homes devastated Sorrell Bobrink, a Paradise resident who managed to drive away with her child, told BBC World Service radio she was first woken up and alerted by a phone call from a friend. She described the scene as ""exactly like any apocalyptic movie I have ever seen"" and said she did not know if she was driving towards death or out of harm's way as the sky blackened. ""I had to drive through the fire - it was awful. It was probably the most awful experience I will have in my life,"" she told the Newsday programme. ""It was traumatising, we will be traumatised for a long time. My whole community was traumatised - I can't watch the videos anymore because I actually went through it."" Many of the victims are believed to have been elderly residents or people with mobility issues who would find evacuating more difficult. Media caption Fleeing through flames: ""I'm so scared right now... so terrified"" Forensic experts are stepping up their search in the ruins of Paradise, but officials warn that finding the bodies could take weeks. Dogs are being brought in by local police to try and locate the dead, and two mobile army morgues will be used to help identify them. The fire has burned more than 111,000 acres (45,000 hectares) and is nearly 25% contained, fire officials said. What about further south? The separate Woosley Blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles. It has consumed at least 85,500 acres and destroyed at least 177 buildings, officials said. It is only 10% contained. The smaller Hill Fire, nearby, has scorched 4,530 acres and is 75% contained. Luxury homes in Malibu and other beach communities are among the properties destroyed. The nearby city of Calabasas, home to well-known celebrities, remains under a mandatory evacuation order. Why are the fires so bad? Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn, but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. Media caption With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them The California Public Utilities Commission is investigating what sparked the latest blazes - amid reports electrical companies may have suffered malfunctions near the sources shortly before the fires began. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. The state's 40-million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas. And then there's climate change. Recent years have produced record-breaking temperatures, earlier springs, and less reliable rainfall. Citing the role of a warming climate, California Governor Jerry Brown declared: ""This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal."" Thousands of firefighters, some from across the US, have been brought in to help battle the blazes. Have you been affected by the wildfires? If it is safe to do so please get in touch.

Mike Butcher,"While the cryptocurrency world continues to swirl around in a daze of troughs and highs, startups are continuing to make use of the fundamental underlying strengths of blockchain technology. A new entrant in this race is Tradeshift, a leading players in supply-chain payments and marketplaces, which is today launching its new service which enables supports blockchain-based finance, or writing all transactions to a public ledger in order to create transparency and securing a record. While this doesn’t involve the use of currencies like actual Bitcoin or Ethereum, “having the transactions on a public ledger ensures full transparency and the ability for companies to prove that they have legit transactions,” says CEO and cofounder Christian Lanng. SO what this all means is that Tradeshift’s cloud platform will bring supply chain payments, supply chain finance, and blockchain-based early payments together into one unified end-to-end solution, called “Tradeshift Pay”. They are aiming at a $9 trillion problem, which is the capital trapped in “accounts receivable” as a result of old-fashioned payment practices and the disconnection between large business buyers and their suppliers. In other words, this could be a boon for small suppliers who find it hard to get paid when their invoices aren’t mapped to a ledger as strong as a blockchain. With this single unified wallet, buyers can use several payment options, including virtual card payments of invoices and purchase orders, dynamic discounting, supply chain finance through bank partners, or blockchain-based payments.","While the cryptocurrency world continues to swirl around in a daze of troughs and highs, startups are continuing to make use of the fundamental underlying strengths of blockchain technology.

Beth Skwarecki,"The Camp Fire in northern California has just become the deadliest in the states history; the Woolsey fire in the south is engulfing Malibu; and our president is tweeting obliquely about the logging industry. Welcome to 2018. Everyone from firefighters to the CNN weather guy knows this is wrong, wrong, wrong, so lets break it down: These arent all forest fires The Camp fire did start in a forested area, but the southern California fires did not. As the Pasadena Fire Association replied, these are better described as urban interface firesin other words, ones that start in places where homes are built among flammable vegetation. Wildland fire is a more accurate term, which encompasses brush fires, rangeland fires, and more. So if you imagine nothing but trees burning, youve got the wrong image in your head to start with. There is one big reason for these massive, deadly and costly wildland fires Climate change. We really have to go over this again? Of Californias 10 most destructive fires, nine have been in the last 15 years. Five are from 2017 and 2018. The recipe for these fires requires a few common ingredients : Houses very close to flammable vegetation Dry weather making that vegetation extra flammable High-pressure winds from the jet stream, which occur around this time of year. The hotter California gets, the drier it gets. And the extreme dryness makes the vegetationnot just trees, but also brush and grassesburn more easily. The drier the land, the smaller a spark it takes to catch fire. Then, hot, dry gusts of wind suck up even more moisture, and they push fires forward, throwing embers onto houses and other fuel in their path. Watch this exasperated meteorologist explain it better than I can. President Donald Trump tweeted some incredibly ignorant things over the weekend about the wildfires Read more Read Forest management may be a dog whistle for the logging industry Politicians including Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke have been advocating for fuels reduction management. The thinking seems to be: remove the forest, and you cant have forest fires. In effect, this means opening up lands to logging. But, as Outside explains here, logging isnt effective at removing the kinds of fuel that wildfires thrive on. Loggers want to take the biggest, most commercially valuable trees, and leave the saplings and brush. Guess what catches fire really well? Yeah. Saplings and brush. Funding is necessary for preventing fires and helping affected communities Its not clear what federal funding you could remove from the picture and make fire management better. Much of the area thats burning is federal land anyway. And until 2020, the US Forest Service still has to cannibalize its own fire prevention budget to find the money to put out fires that are already burning. (The practice, called fire borrowing, was finally ended with a bill that Congress passed earlier this year.) Putting out wildfires costs more every year, as fires get worse. Just another exciting aspect of living in 2018.",The Camp Fire in northern California has just become the deadliest in the state’s history; the Woolsey fire in the south is engulfing Malibu; and our president is tweeting obliquely about the logging industry.

MATT STEVENS,"Ms. Contreras-Sweet’s group had pulled ahead of other bidders like Lions Gate Entertainment by promising to keep the studio intact and retaining its employees, including senior managers like Mr. Glasser. Under the deal, Mr. Weinstein’s younger brother, Bob Weinstein, would leave the studio, two people said. Mr. Schneiderman’s lawsuit does not name Mr. Glasser, but it refers to him by his title and says that the sale of the company could result in employees reporting to some of the same managers “who failed to investigate” Mr. Weinstein’s conduct or protect female employees from him. Mr. Glasser, 46, was a longtime top lieutenant at the company, and the Weinsteins have called him their “ third brother.” Efforts to contact Mr. Glasser early Saturday morning were unsuccessful. In October, after the public complaints of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein led to his firing, Mr. Glasser tried to rally his shaken staff members at a meeting. “We are going to be O.K.,” two people who attended the meeting recalled Mr. Glasser saying. He said his door was open to anyone who wanted to talk. Mr. Glasser, who had said he would depart as president of the Weinstein Company in August 2015, announced a month later that he would instead remain under a new three-year contract. At the time, Bob Weinstein — who led the effort to retain Mr. Glasser — attributed Mr. Glasser’s change of heart in part to a personal friendship between Mr. Glasser and the brothers. “Harvey and I sometimes don’t even want to be brothers,” Bob Weinstein said at the time. “I don’t know why anyone would want to be another brother.” But Mr. Glasser, ”should he want it,” Bob Weinstein said, “has become the third brother.” Continue reading the main story",The move to get rid of the man the Weinsteins called their “third brother” comes at an urgent moment for the troubled company.,2018-02-17T05:45:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Weinstein Company Fires David Glasser, Its President",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/arts/weinstein-company-fires-david-glasser.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/18/arts/18xp-Glasser/18xp-Glasser-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fires,1
SARAH MASLIN NIR,"Unlike a pileup or a road closed for construction, the blazes are also a breaking news event, throwing traffic reporters into the same mix as their news anchor counterparts, said Sioux-z Jessup, a freelance traffic anchor. “What’s really challenging is that there are so many fires burning right now, and I am trying to get the most accurate information to the most amount of people,” Ms. Jessup said. Along with street closings and alternate routes, she said, she has spent days posting tips on Twitter, like the safest kind of gas mask to wear. “You want to give them the evacuation centers, and the school closures, and the wind conditions,” she said. “I’m trying to provide anything that they need.” At 3:10 p.m. on Thursday, Ms. Jessup went live on the air. “Folks, we have now six fires burning in Southern California,” she said, facing the camera. She rattled off the closings, followed by a list of evacuation centers and the number of structures and acres threatened by a fire that had erupted that morning. The conditions have introduced tremendous reporting challenges. The buffeting winds of up to 60 mph that have fed the fire have grounded some traffic aircraft. Only the hardiest helicopters (more expensive ones usually operated by television stations) can withstand the current air conditions, said Desmond Shaw, who reports for both radio and TV. It has been too dangerous to fly the Cessna he reports from for KNX 1070 radio since the fires ignited. Like many of his colleagues, he must cover the story from the ground this time. “I definitely feel kind of hamstrung or helpless,” he said. “My city is burning and people are trying to get out of town and I wish I could be up above that helping people out.” Instead, he and other reporters work the phones, monitoring reports from the state Department of Transportation and Cal Fire. The news feeds flickering on viewers’ screens across the state — stark pictures of amber flames licking across mansions, horse farms and highways — belie what the reporters went through to capture them, Mr. Shaw said. “The shot is steady, but you’re not seeing the chopper getting knocked around because of the stability controls the camera has,” Mr. Shaw said. “Meanwhile you’re getting knocked around by turbulence like crazy.” Los Angeles is a city of gridlock. But the fires, which have consumed more than 100,000 acres and are still raging, create an entirely different traffic scenario. “You can Google and look in Hollywood and see these are the closures for the Oscars,” said Ginger Chan, a KTLA traffic anchor. “The difference is it’s fluid, it’s changing, the wind can shift, it can pick up.” Ms. Chan said officials from the Los Angeles Police Department had warned reporters on Wednesday that app-based GPS risked taking drivers into fire-affected areas. “For people who are not familiar, they are kind of trusting this blindly,” said Ms. Chan, who is married to Mr. Kono, the traffic pilot. “You’re running into a situation that will change on a dime, and then it’s putting you in areas that could be danger zones.” On Thursday afternoon, Ms. Chan was picking up her twin 3-year-old children at school after a workday that began at 1:30 a.m., extended hours for round-the-clock fire coverage. Few of the city’s veteran traffic reporters said they had ever dealt with so many simultaneous fires. “It’s indescribable,” said Scott Burt, an airborne traffic reporter for the radio station KNX 1070 News Radio. “I have seen this before, to a certain degree, but not probably this extreme.” The work is taxing, but rewarding, he said. “That’s what I’m here for, to help people,” Mr. Burt added. “And who doesn’t at work like a good challenge?” Continue reading the main story","As fires rage in Southern California, airborne reporters have become guiding lights in the chaos.",2017-12-08T14:00:14Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Where There’s Smoke, There Are the Traffic Reporters of Los Angeles",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/08/us/la-fires-traffic-reporters.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/08/us/09traffic/09traffic-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fires,1

It’s almost a cliché to say they don’t make them like that anymore — well it is a cliché, but so what. They don’t. Mr. Brown held office before California voters adopted term limits, which meant he was able to serve 15 years leading the Assembly. All those years meant that Mr. Brown had the kind of knowledge, connection and experience that helped make him one of the most powerful leaders in California history. And his career kept going after he left Sacramento. He became mayor of San Francisco and today, at 83, he is writing political columns for the San Francisco Chronicle, where, characteristically, he has shown no reluctance in letting you know how he thinks. “Democrats needed the high road, so they ran over Al Franken,” read the headline over Mr. Brown’s weekend offering..

ELIZABETH BRISTOW and EVE LYONS,"One of the most satisfying memes of the last few years celebrates macaroni and cheese. Someone on social media will write I made him mac and cheese or some such and share a revolting photo of a gelatinous dish of gray noodle slop. Then everyone will freak out and pile on. Sometimes the post is a joke, sometimes its real, and also sometimes its wings or meatloaf. In the case of Keisha Lance Bottoms, who also happens to be the mayor of Atlanta, it was just a sincere picture showing off her Christmas mac and cheese, to the extreme scorn and horror of the internet. Sure it did look a little dry, but who among us, you know? 
The first notable mac and cheese posting went wild in October 2017, with an infamously horrid mac and cheese brought to an office potluck. In the rollicking five financial quarters between these two mac and cheese crises, photographs of earnestly made bad food and also trolling imitations (usually using stolen photographs) proliferated and became indistinguishable. It has been this year pleasurably impossible to tell what was a case of Auntie Gladys going fully wrong at the church social and what was someone stealing a grody pic off Facebook to snatch some likes. For us out here mainlining our Instagram and Facebook and Twitter feeds like it was our paid job long days pickaxing for weak LOLs, followed by thin, ill dreams the experience of real and fake was essentially identical.
Its now more impossible than ever to discover what a photograph means or where it came from, whether its of a dreary Christmas side dish, or a selfie on a volcano, or a couple posing holiday-style with their child on their driveway, but then it turns out the driveway is not even theirs and also, who knows about the child? (Yes, this apparently just happened.) How sincere or manipulative is a photo? What garbage dump is just beyond the frame of that beautiful sunset? Whose culture does a photograph represent or betray? (The depths of reasonable interracial fury surrounding mac and cheese are very real.) Which of these beautiful or gross photographs is an advertisement? Was the person being photographed the product, and if so, how were we paying? Similarly, who made the photographable environment, and was it a marketing agency? (Buddy, it was.) And a question that bubbles up again and again: Who else was present, and what person or machine captured the moment?
Which brings us to this collection of our best published photographs of the year, as chosen by our photo editors. To me, a few suffer without context, but perhaps those will be your very favorites. (Besides, in many other cases, the photos were more exceptional than the texts they accompanied.) Thats the joy of living in a time when we are not only all informed consumers of photography but also, with Instagram a billion members strong, nearly all practicing photographers ourselves. We all make the side dishes; we all take the photographs; and also we all stunt on other peoples photographs and side dishes.
Whether you love or hate or are puzzled or upset by them, all these photographs are scrupulous. Most of the subjects have been photographed with their consent or their participation, but none are the authors or directors of the photographs. These people and places and situations were photographed because the photographer was trying to learn about them, or is trying to explain something about them. In their practice, the photographers are playing by the honest rules. The line between me posting pics of my kitty cats on Instagram and Rafael Rios posting pics of Justin Theroux (the biggest cat of all) on The New York Times seems thinner than ever, but its not all that thin really. In all the sunsets of our real world now, there really always is a burning garbage dump nearby. Our best photographers promise to keep the trash fire just in frame. CHOIRE SICHA

CARL ZIMMER,"For early studies of fire refugia, ecologists hiked through forests and grasslands, inspecting islands that withstood surrounding flames. Now researchers are scrutinizing fire refugia from space. With nearly 50 years of satellite data, theyre starting to piece together the recent history of these sanctuaries. After a fire wipes out a forest, fire refugia stand out as green jewels scattered across the blackened land. Depending on the forest, up to 25 percent of it may survive in refugia, Dr. Krawchuk estimated. Sometimes a forest refugium survives a particular blaze thanks to luck. We might have a change of wind, it cools down at night, and the fire might not grab that patch of forest, said Arjan Meddens, a fire ecologist at the University of Idaho and lead author of the BioScience review. But when researchers look at satellite images from other years, they see that some refugia are different. There are some places in the landscape that seem to avoid fire time and time again, said Dr. Krawchuk. The most interesting thing is why, she added. What makes that green spot stay that way? There are probably many factors at work. In the Northern Hemisphere, the north sides of mountains favor refugia. The plants there get less sunlight that their south-facing counterparts. They often hold more water in their trunks and roots, and they grow in moister soil that can tamp down fires. Fire refugia dont have to endure for centuries to be ecologically important. Even a fleeting shelter can be important for local biodiversity.","The Delta Fire burning in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in California last month.

Brian Heater,"Next week, Bernie Sanders will introduce legislation aimed firmly at large companies he believes have taken advantage of “corporate welfare” by underpaying employees. Amazon and Walmart in particular have bore the brunt of the Senator’s criticisms, and the rhetoric has become increasingly heated over the the past few days. Earlier today, Amazon accused Sanders of issuing “inaccurate and misleading” statements as he called the company out of warehouse conditions. The Vermont senator has since responded with a release, calling Amazon fulfillment center wages “absurd.” “Thousands of Amazon employees are forced to rely on food stamps, Medicaid and public housing because their wages are too low,” Sanders says, “including 1 out of 3 of its workers in Arizona and 2,400 in Pennsylvania and Ohio, according to The New Food Economy. Bottom line: the taxpayers of this country should not have to subsidize employees at a company owned by Mr. Bezos who is worth $155 billion. That is absurd.” In an interview yesterday, Sanders told TechCrunch that the company had not been forthcoming with information about employment. The company shot back, noting that the Senator had yet to take it up on its offer of a warehouse tour. “In terms of visiting a fulfillment center, last month I was visiting Wisconsin and requested to visit the fulfillment center in Kenosha,” Sanders says. “Unfortunately, Amazon could not accommodate me then. In September, I look forward to visiting the fulfillment center in Chester, Virginia, and working out the details with Amazon. We have heard from workers there, including Navy veteran Seth King, about unsafe working conditions and at least one person has reportedly died at the warehouse.” Sanders, of course, is far from the first person to raise issue with Amazon fulfillment center conditions. Stories have been floating around from current and former employees for years. CEO Jeff Bezos, who has been front and center in Sanders’ criticism recently told the press, “I am very proud of our working conditions, and I am very proud of the wages that we pay.”","Next week, Bernie Sanders will introduce legislation aimed firmly at large companies he believes have taken advantage of “corporate welfare” by underpaying employees.

Devin Coldewey,"It turns out that in case of a fire in your home, a closed door is the best barrier against spreading smoke, heat, and flames. But who’s going to run around the house shutting doors? LifeDoor is a simple gadget that sits on your doors’ hinges and closes them automatically (and gently) when smoke is detected. It’s kid safe and firefighter approved. I talked with LifeDoor co-founders Ben Docksteader and Joel Sellinger on the show floor at CES, where they’re showing off the latest prototype of their self-designed home safety device. It was inspired by knowledge widespread among firefighters but less known among ordinary folks that deaths from smoke inhalation, toxic and superheated gases, and heat are effectively mitigated just by closing a door. UL has been trying to spread the word over the last few months following some studies showing the effectiveness of this simple countermeasure. (If nothing else, it’s worth taking away from this post that closing the door is a good idea in case of fire.) LifeDoor is quite simple, really: the device, about the size of a paperback (now — future versions will be smaller), is installed in seconds by dropping it into the hinge of any ordinary door and attaching it to the door itself with screws or double-sided tape. The gadget is primed by opening the door, which works as normal, and then waits until it hears the distinctive, standardized 85 decibel tone of a triggered smoke alarm. If that happens, it pushes the door closed. It also lights up the room and sends out its own alarm in case someone didn’t hear the first one. It’s such a practical idea that Docksteader’s brother, himself a firefighter in the Pacific Northwest, thought he could just go out and buy one — but instead found no such product exists, or at least not one that ordinary humans could install easily in their homes. So he and the team decided to make it. They’re totally self-funded, Docksteader said: “We called in every favor we could. Our biggest contributor was actually other firefighters.” They’re hoping to raise more money in the near future to cover manufacturing costs, but the design is nearly finalized and as far as I could tell from the demo, it worked like a charm. The team is well aware of the obvious worries. Could it slam on a kid or hand and hurt them? “We do tests where we put our fingers in the door — makes sense we should be the ones to take the risk,” Docksteader said. It has to be hard enough to close the door but no harder than that. Could a kid get trapped in a room when the door closes on them? The door doesn’t really take any more effort to open than normal, so any kid that can open it in the first place can get out, and any kid that can’t will be safer in an enclosed space. The battery should last 18-24 months if you’re testing your smoke detector regularly (which would of course shut all the doors equipped with the device), and they’re working on improving that. They’re also planning on Z-Wave smart home integration, which could in the future help provide other information, such as whether anyone’s in the room, where the fire started, and so on. The plan is to ship in the fall, and pre-orders will open soon. As always with pre-orders, use your own discretion, but to me a handful of these would be a no-brainer if I owned a house. Sellinger told me firefighters love it, which is about all the recommendation you need. If you’re interested, you can get half off using CES2018 as a promo code — and no, they didn’t pay me to say that. If something as simple as closing a door could save a life and a fortune, I’m behind a gadget that does it for you.","It turns out that in case of a fire in your home, a closed door is the best barrier against spreading smoke, heat, and flames.

Bryan Menegus,"Citing a risk of melting or starting fires due to overheating, Amazon has voluntary issued a recall on six AmazonBasics-branded portable chargers. Those models were sold between late 2014 and mid 2017, the Verge reports, and the emails sent to affected customers claim Amazon is performing the recall “in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.” A recall notice does not appear on the CPSC website. The model numbers are as follows: B00ZQ4JQAA, B00LRK8IV0, B00LRK8EVO, B00LRK8JDC, B00LRK8170, and B00LRK8HJ8 While these six models bear the Amazon’s brand, the AmazonBasics monicker is a result of what’s known in retail as private labeling—where a seller slaps a name on a product sent direct from the manufacturer. In the case of these power banks, product documentation states they were made in China, and an Amazon representative confirmed they’re built by Guoguang Electric Company Ltd. Though one Glassdoor review claims GGEC may be involved with products made for Bose and Harman, it’s unclear at this time what other brands are supplied by GGEC. As with any rechargeable battery product, excessive heat is a sign the device should be unplugged and potentially recalled or safely disposed of. Those in possession of one of the recalled AmazonBasics power banks who did not receive an email are urged to visit Amazon’s recall site here to register for a refund.

LEAH SOTTILE,"Throughout 50 years of making heavy music in Elf, Rainbow, Black Sabbath and Heaven &amp; Hell Dio sang again and again and again about trying to find a home. In Rainbows Stargazer, Dio tells the story of a wizard who tempts commoners with empty promises, persuading them to enslave themselves to build him a tower from which he will fly. The people realize too late that theyve fallen victim to a predator: We build a tower of stone/With our flesh and bone/Just to see him fly/But we dont know why. Dio is the aching voice of an embittered, betrayed public a siren urging them to rise, stand up, take their lives back: I see a rainbow rising/Look there, on the horizon.
My love for Dios music came in a slow drip. During the period in which I regularly came home from work to find red heating-shut-off notices dangling from the doorknob of our rental house, I progressed further into his catalog, taken by all the stories he tells in his music. When he died in the spring of 2010, I thought of all us castaways for whom he must have been singing. The more I listened, the more I felt as if Dio, all along, was talking to people like me and Joe in his songs.
There are precise songs for precise moments: Black Sabbaths Supernaut for Friday nights, Metallicas Creeping Death for morning traffic, Judas Priests Painkiller before a salary negotiation. But Dios music was often about finding victory inside yourself, of recognizing the craven intentions of the powerful and fighting back. When he held the microphone, his voice exploded out of him, a smelling-salts blast under the noses of anyone on the verge of giving up.
Recently, though, Dios music became clearer for me, and it happened around the time I realized that I was remiss in expecting a society set up on the twin values of spending and earning to find a place for a person like me. I was on my way to have lunch with a Pulitzer Prize winner with 23 cents in my bank account and a desperate hope my emergencies only credit card wouldnt be declined. I was on the freeway when, out of the blue, there was Dio: Black Sabbaths Heaven and Hell crashing through a bright afternoon:
They say that lifes a carouselSpinning fast, youve got to ride it wellThe world is full of kings and queensWho blind your eyes and steal your dreamsIts heaven and hell, oh wellAnd theyll tell you black is really whiteThe moon is just the sun at nightAnd when you walk in golden hallsYou get to keep the gold that fallsIts heaven and hell, oh, no. Fool, fool
For once, I was broke and I was laughing. How could I listen to a song so many times and only now really hear it? All along, Dio was saying what a fools game it is to measure your value on the standards of a society that was never meant for you. Gold is never free, and to get it, youve got to bow before a master. God and the devil are inherent in each of us, and its our choice to make, Dio said in one interview, late in life. The optimum way to go is to do the good thing.
I think he wanted to leave this as his legacy: a reminder that home is a place inside your own mind. There will always be new wizards to follow, new rings to kiss. But there, too, will always be rejects and castaways. And theres victory in the realization that there will always be more of us than there are of them. That in our anger, together we are all home.","He was one of the pioneers of heavy metal, forging his music in the unique fires of lapsed faith and a skepticism of those who seek power.",2019-02-12T10:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Letter of Recommendation: Letter of Recommendation: Ronnie James Dio,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-ronnie-james-dio.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/11/magazine/0217Mag-LOR-1/0217Mag-LOR-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fires,1
ADAM NAGOURNEY,"As the fires began, Mr. Garcetti, who has lived through his share of fires and earthquakes, sought to reassure a city watching the fast spread of out-of-control fires, whipped by Santa Ana winds and with the potential to inflict catastrophic damage across wide swaths of the city. “These are days that break your heart,” he said. “These are also days that show the resilience of our city.” By Thursday night, with the smoke cleared and most of the flames gone, Mr. Garcetti appeared visibly relieved over how Los Angeles had been, at least relatively, spared. This was hardly the most severe disaster California has endured — fires in other parts of the state were more challenging to their elected leaders — and if one believes the predictions of geologists, the worst may be yet to come. But it offered some insight into the style of this mayor, something of a test after six years in charge — and at a time when Mr. Garcetti has encouraged a bit of national attention by suggesting he may want to run for president. In Los Angeles, especially at moments like this, there are few jobs as critical as fire chief. And it was Ralph M. Terrazas, whom Mr. Garcetti promoted to fire chief soon after he became mayor, who appeared most at his side, offering technical updates on fire conditions and reports on how he was dispatching his 3,200-member force across this 500-square-mile city, where the speed of a response can determine whether a fire is a passing brusher or a conflagration that forces the evacuation of thousands of homes. At the height of the disaster, 900 members of the Los Angeles Fire Department were spread out across the region, fighting three major fires and battling back scores of other outbursts. They were among an army of 2,000 firefighters, many of whom had come in from across the state to assist in the effort. Six-hundred members of the city’s police department were also assigned to the fires. Raphael J. Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles, said that this episode had spotlighted, at least for now, the strong relationship Mr. Garcetti had with his police commissioner and the fire commissioner. Those relations have frequently been strained with mayors in the past, and that has caused problems when the city had to come together. “When the relationship between mayor and chief is toxic — think Bradley-Gates — it’s not good of either of them when disaster strikes,” Mr. Sonenshein said, referring to Tom Bradley, who was mayor of Los Angeles from 1973 to 1993, and Daryl Gates, his police commissioner. By the time Mr. Garcetti arrived on Thursday morning for a private briefing by fire and police officials at the command center for the Skirball Fire, the blaze — which at one point loomed as a potentially major threat to some of Los Angeles’ most affluent neighborhoods — was considered to be far less of a threat. But danger still loomed. The command post at the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs campus, just off the 405 freeway, was bustling with firefighters and police officers. Mr. Garcetti, wearing a blue City Hall windbreaker emblazoned with his name, mingled with firefighters in front of the command post, comparing photographs of the fire on their phones and trading information on what they had heard in the field. Mr. Garcetti walked over to to a map of the fire taped onto the wall as an assistant chief, Corey Rose, brought him up-to-date. The the mayor dutifully scribbled notes, asking questions that reflected the decidedly technocratic spirit he has brought to City Hall. (Example: “What is the containment in Rye, do you know?” the mayor asked, inquiring about a fire in Santa Clarita.) The role of mayor in Los Angeles is almost vague by design, reflecting a cumbersome government system in Southern California that would seem to confound any attempt to manage a complicated crisis. There are 88 cities in Los Angeles County, with Los Angeles being the largest. The county is controlled by a five-member board of supervisors. That means, more often than not, that it is the mayor who becomes the face of a crisis. But the mayor doesn’t have the overall authority over the response. So when millions of Mr. Garcetti’s constituents were startled Wednesday night by their phones buzzing with an emergency alert warning of “extreme fire danger,” the mayor had nothing to do with it: That alert was sent out by the state. Not that he would have blocked it, Mr. Garcetti said. “I said overcommunicate,” he said. “You saw how many people died up north,” he added, referring to the Northern California fires in October. Mr. Garcetti has never been much of a showman, at least in the tradition of, say, Edward I. Koch or Rudolph W. Giuliani, two New York mayors who regularly became identified with the biggest crises of their cities. But when he turned up Tuesday morning for the first fire, he wore protective gear — the yellow jacket — and an official “mayor” firefighter’s helmet. That was out of necessity, he said later, recalling the embers raining down from the sky. In this mayor’s view, politicians in these kinds of settings should wear civilian clothes, and leave the uniforms to the officers. As he spoke, he picked up his firefighter helmet from the seat, and moved it to the back of the S.U.V.

JAN RANSOM and JOSE A. DELREAL,"“The ice builds up on our tools, our ladders, which becomes a safety problem,” Mr. Fitzgerald said. “And inside the building it can become like an ice-skating rink. It adds a whole bunch of different obstacles for us to fight the fire and to make rescues.” Fire officials said there were also instances when ladders froze and were unable to extend. Emergency responders in other cities have encountered similar issues during frigid winter months. When a three-alarm fire erupted inside a building in East Boston over the weekend, firefighters there encountered a frozen hydrant, which slowed their ability to combat the blaze. Everyone in the building survived, though several firefighters were injured after falling on ice. “The challenges are immense,” said Joseph E. Finn, the Boston fire commissioner. “The potential for frozen hydrants can hamper our ability to get water on the fires quickly.” Mr. Finn said frozen hydrants used to be a common problem in the city, but in recent years efforts were stepped up to check and maintain them. During periods of heavy snowfall, firefighters dig out hydrants to make sure they are available. Similarly, in Toronto, where temperatures are expected to drop into the single digits this week, Chief Matthew Pegg said his firefighters are trained to fight fires in extremely cold conditions. Fire vehicles are also equipped with onboard heating systems and pump heaters, he said. Mr. Pegg said hoses are never turned off, so as to prevent the water from freezing. Mr. Pegg said he also worked closely with the Toronto Transit Commission to make sure there are buses nearby to keep displaced residents warm. But, Mr. Pegg said, in spite of preparation, challenges persist. Last year this time, he said, there were several major fires in mansions, and efforts to battle them were complicated by heavy snowfall. “The road conditions were difficult and more dangerous,” he said. “It takes longer to respond.” When a hydrant is shut off, leakage can occur in the valve and, over a period of months, water can leak into the pipe and freeze, said Glenn Corbett, an associate professor in the department of security, fire, and emergency management at John Jay College. “Time is of the essence in a fire,” he said. “We’re talking about minutes here, not an hour. A frozen hydrant can really mess things up.” But James Long, a spokesman for Fire Department, said the delay in the Bronx was only “momentary.” Firefighter supervisors also have to carefully manage how long a firefighter is working in the cold, said Greg Cade, director of government affairs with the National Fire Protection Association. “You really have to pay attention to the crews and rotate them on a more frequent basis because of potential issues with hypothermia,” he said. “It is a miserable time.” Liz Robbins contributed reporting.

The F.B.I. and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had been involved in the investigation, as well as the Louisiana and Florida state fire marshals, the cybercrime unit of the Louisiana Attorney Generals office, and state and local police.

AJ Dellinger,"According to Lime, it first learned of the issue in August and responded by removing Segway Ninebot scooters from circulation. A total of about 2,000 scooters were recalled from Los Angeles, San Diego and Lake Tahoe, a Lime spokesperson told the Washington Post. The company worked with Segway Ninebot to create a software program that could detect batteries that could be at risk of going up in flames. Scooters with batteries that trigger the tripwire are deactivated and removed. While the issue is ongoing, Lime is preventing its Juicers -- freelancers who are tasked with collecting and charging scooters -- from taking the devices. All charging will be done at Lime facilities, where trained staff will be on hand to deal with the batteries and monitor their health. While Lime has stated ""at no time were riders or members of the public put at risk,"" The Washington Post reported there was an incident at the Lime facility in Lake Tahoe. An employee working at the facility reportedly heard a ""loud bang"" and discovered scooter at the location burst into flames. The local fire department was called to respond. Lime noted there is also a new but unconfirmed report of another Segway Ninebot scooter model that has a similar battery issue. It is investigating those claims. The company also said there is an issue causing the baseboards of Okai scooters to crack when exposed to repeated abuse. The incidents highlight some of the problems that Lime and other scooter rental companies face in deploying their expanding fleets.

I told my daughters we need to start gathering items as it must be spreading. Within minutes I saw the fire crest our hill and it was panic. We literally had minutes to get anything we could grab along with our pets (including our one week old kittens and a nursing Mom) and leave. We headed to Oxnard Shores to my fiancé’s parents’ home.

"Andrew P. Collins on Jalopnik, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","California is weathering the worst fire season many of us have seen out here and responders are still inundated with heavy work. One question I keep seeing, besides “remember Volcano ?”, is “why are the firefighting planes dropping red water?” Well, there is a reason. And that’s not just water. The simple answer is: that red liquid is a fire-retardant chemical that’s color dyed so that it’s easy to see from the ground and from the air. That helps firefighters see where it’s going, and makes it easier to see where it’s been dumped already. Water is an excellent firefighting tool as it is abundantly available, relatively inexpensive and generally effective at cooling fires and rendering fire fuel non-flammable. But when a conflagration spreads to an area as large as the tracts of scrubland currently ablaze in Southern California, you need a harder-hitting delivery system than a hose and you want to mitigate future burning as much as suppress the flames that are already raging. That’s why Cal Fire has a sizable fleet of aircraft capable of carrying and dropping fire retardant over a big area at high speed. Seriously, check out Cal Fire’s plane brochure. The agency has everything from Cobra attack helicopters for watching and reporting on incidents to 747 jets for dumping up to 24,000 gallons of the fire-dousing cocktail you may be wondering about. As Cal Fire’s own literature explains, that red stuff you’ve seen spraying from the bellies of planes and onto burning forests is “a slurry mix consisting of a chemical salt compound, water, clay or a gum- thickening agent, and a coloring agent.” More specifically, that juice is called Phos-Chek or Fire-Trol. And while there are many variants of it optimized for different situations, the stuff is largely a better fire-mitigator than water because it lingers. A firefighting outfit like Cal Fire might dump a strip of the stuff at the edge of a fire, and it would coat unburned “fuel” like trees and houses to render them, ideally, non-flammable. Whereas water would just evaporate. These chemicals are of course just one tool in a wildland firefighter’s arsenal. But in serious cases like California’s current fires, the red “slurry” can be instrumental in containing major burns.","California is weathering the worst fire season many of us have seen out here and responders are still inundated with heavy work.

THOMAS FULLER and CONOR DOUGHERTY,"The progress report released last week is based on a series of housing goals that are decided by a regional body of governments. Over the eight-year period covered by the goals, Beverly Hills was required to build a total of three housing units: One very-low income housing unit, one low-income housing unit, and one moderately priced housing unit. In fairness, the wealthy Los Angeles County city far exceeded its numbers, at least on a percentage basis, by issuing permits for a total of nine low- and moderate-income housing units. The city was not required to build any high-income housing units, since it already has a lot of them. Nevertheless, it blew its goal of zero out of the water, and issued 75 new permits for high-income housing. Scott Wiener, the San Francisco senator who wrote the streamlining bill on which the recent report was based, said in an interview that numbers like those reported by Beverly Hills are why he is working on a new bill that would try to neutralize the role of politics in housing production by tying future state housing goals to economic measures like job growth. It would also carry forward past housing deficits so that cities that don’t build will lose further control over local housing decisions as time goes on. “It’s absurd and we see this around the state where communities that are whiter and more affluent are able to push down their numbers and essentially opt out of new housing,” he said.

The men in the photo above may not conform to the classic image of aid workers in Africa. A more traditional shots would show a nurse caring for a sick child - and the nurse would quite likely be a visiting European. But the vast majority of people who run aid projects on the continent are in fact Africans. And a huge amount of their time is necessarily devoted to confronting the difficulties of delivering assistance in remote places with poor roads or flooded tracks. Fighting fires Team leader Robert Ntitima was nearing the end of a 700km (435 mile) journey from the Zambian capital, Lusaka, to the village of Malumba in the far west of the country. He was taking an eye surgeon to operate on patients facing blindness when his car got stuck in a sand drift. As night began to fall, a fire started by a farmer to clear the bush swept towards the vehicle. You may also be interested in: The flames threatened to ignite the fuel tank and blow up the car. Mr Ntitima and driver Clinton Bakala had no choice but to beat back the fire with sticks before using their bare hands to dig out the two-tonne vehicle. A chain and another four-wheel drive were then used to finally pull the car free. Birthday promise Relieved to be out of the sand, Mr Ntitima nevertheless paused to ring his family before setting off again. It was the birthday of his four-year-old daughter, Sally Mika. He promised they would have her party when he eventually got home. It had been a typical day for the aid workers in western Zambia.

Dr Kandei is a specialist in correcting blinding trachoma, the leading cause of preventable blindness in the world. He is currently working on behalf of international charity Sightsavers. In addition to his surgical skills, he has to be an expert in getting cars out of floods. ""Bruno"" is a nickname. His 1980s boyhood friends borrowed it from their expat British schoolteacher in the western Zambian town of Kalabo. The boy and Bruno the teacher were both keen football players. The name ""Bruno"" stuck with the Zambian. Image copyright Uniting to Combat NTDs Dr Kandei's real first name is ""Kubona"". ""In my language 'Kubona' translates into English as 'the ability to see,'"" Dr Kandei, 53, explained. ""Maybe my name was the Lord's way of showing me I should help cure blindness."" After a two-day journey, team leader Mr Ntitima and Dr Kandei finally reached the small rural clinic where their patients were waiting. The cars carrying the dozen or so patients had also got stuck on rough tracks several times. But now everyone was in the right place for the surgery to take place. 'Scratch, scratch, scratch' Latest figures show that nearly 158 million people worldwide are at risk from blinding trachoma, a disease caused by infection of the eye. Around half of these have been treated with antibiotics, but much work remains to be done. Image copyright Uniting to Combat NTDs Image caption Sibeso Simate (R) says trachoma is like having small spears scratching your eyes all day long Blinding trachoma is one of the so-called neglected tropical diseases, most of which affect very poor communities. Other examples are guinea worm and sleeping sickness. They attract minimal attention because their impact does not generate an immediate medical emergency as is usually the case, for example, with Ebola disease. In many older people blinding trachoma, if untreated, causes in-growing eyelashes. The lashes scratch the eye, causing great pain and, ultimately, blindness. The infection thrives in very poor communities without access to a reliable supply of clean water, or toilets. What is trachoma? Image copyright Getty Images Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide It is caused by infection from bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis Symptoms include blurred vision, eye pain and itchiness in the eye Infection spreads through contact with eye and nose discharge of infected people - via hands, towels, clothes and also flies Treatment includes antibiotics or eye surgery, while prevention is possible with access to water and sanitation to keep the face clean Blindness from trachoma is irreversible Source: WHO, NHS Half the village at risk of blindness Combating trachoma in Sudan ""It's like having small spears scratching your eyes all day long,"" said Sibeso Simate, 72, who was waiting for her operation at the rural clinic in western Zambia. ""They scratch every time you blink,"" the mother of two said. ""Scratch, scratch, scratch, scratch."" The surgery is a relatively simple operation that takes about 20 minutes. It involves rotating the infected eyelid back to its correct position so the eyelashes are no longer scratching the eye. With just a local anaesthetic being used, Ms Simate was happily chatting with her surgeon throughout the procedure.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Supporters have gathered outside Mr Wickramasinghe's residence One person has been killed and two injured after a Sri Lankan MP's bodyguard fired at a mob, officials say, amid a growing political crisis. It happened as protesters tried to stop former petroleum minister Arjuna Ranatunga from entering his office. Earlier, President Maithripala Sirisena replaced Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe with former strongman president Mahinda Rajapaksa and suspended parliament. Critics say it is unconstitutional. Mr Wickramasinghe says he is still prime minister. How did the shooting happen? It occurred as Mr Ranatunga tried to enter his office at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. A 34-year-old man died shortly after being admitted to hospital, health officials said. The bodyguard has been arrested and an investigation is under way, police said. What other signs of tension are there? Sri Lankan parliament Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has urged Mr Sirisena to reconsider his decision to suspend parliament, saying it would have serious and undesirable consequences. Rival groups supporting Mr Rajapaksa and Mr Wickramasingh have been gathering at different locations in Colombo. Mr Rajapaksa's supporters are reported to have forcibly taken over Sri Lankan state media. Mr Jayasuriya said that this would have serious international implications. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Rajapaksa has been accused of massive corruption and atrocities during the country's civil war Trade unions linked to Mr Rajapaksa's party have also been blocking access to ministers who are from Mr Wickramasinghe's party, Reuters reported. Meanwhile hundreds of Wickramasinghe supporters have gathered around the prime minister's Temple Trees residence. Why is there a crisis? President Sirisena fired Mr Wickramasinghe after the president's United People's Freedom Alliance party (UPFA) quit the government. Mr Wickramasinghe helped the president triumph in the 2015 poll, but the pair reportedly clashed in cabinet recently over government plans to lease a port to India. The prime minister and his United National Party (UNP) came to power promising accountability for alleged atrocities committed in Sri Lanka's civil war and during Mr Rajapaksa's period as president. President Sirisena had been an ally of and minister under Mr Rajapaksa before turning against him. Mr Rajapaksa ended the civil war in 2009, but faced criticism for the means by which he achieved victory - many thousands of Tamil civilians are thought to have been killed by government forces in the final months of the fighting. Over the 26-year conflict, between 80,000 and 100,000 people are estimated to have died, with both sides alleged to have perpetrated war crimes. Moreover, the former president is also accused of corruption on an epic scale, along with his inner circle.","An MP's bodyguard fires at a mob, killing one, after the prime minister was sacked by the president.",2018-10-28T13:49:57Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Sri Lanka shooting wounds three amid political crisis,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46010487,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13BCE/production/_104064808_mediaitem104064807.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,fires,1
Tom McKay,"Donald Trump’s administration has moved to have the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration take control of California water management under the official rationale of fighting the state’s rampaging fires, saying that the water “should be prioritized for wildfire response instead of endangered species protections,” ABC News reported on Wednesday. Of course, state officials say that there is more than enough water to fight the fires. The Commerce Directive announced a directive on Wednesday ordering the National Marine Fisheries Service, a sub-agency of NOAA, to “facilitate access to the water needed to fight the ongoing wildfires affecting the State of California.” Per ABC News, said directive would allow federal officials to overrule protections for threatened and endangered wildlife: The change announced Wednesday would allow federal agencies to expedite decisions about water under an emergency provision of the Endangered Species Act. The directive specifically says that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Marine Fisheries Service, will take over management of water during the wildfire emergency in California. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross directed the Service to tell other federal agencies “the protection of life and property takes precedence over any current agreements regarding the use of water in the areas of California affected by wildfires.” That follows on a very ill-informed tweet from the president earlier this week accusing California officials of wasting water needed to fight the fires, namely that it is “being diverted into the Pacific Ocean.” (Actual wildfire experts point to the state’s extreme droughts, which are being worsened by climate change, as well as human encroachment in wildfire-prone areas and arcane funding laws that force the Forest Service to raid its regular forest management funds for emergency firefighting, per the New Republic.) This is probably all as cynical as it sounds, because firefighters who can’t access protected waters are obviously not the cause of the fires raging throughout much of the state. The Trump administration has been hostile to endangered species protections overall, as well as sought to undermine strict California environmental laws on everything from auto pollution to a water-use plan designed to protect salmon. As ABC News noted, there is “concern” what Trump actually intends to accomplish as a result of the order is injecting itself into a fight between the salmon fishing industry, which wants to reduce stress on populations critical to its future, and industrial farmers that want access to protected waterways. Per the Los Angeles Times, wildlife experts say the move is nothing more than a pretext to give the Trump administration the power to bypass laws protecting endangered species and redirect the water to “corporate agribusiness”: “Secretary Ross’s directive is nothing more than a smokescreen designed to weaken these protections that NMFS’s scientists determined are necessary to keep these native fish from going extinct,” Kate Poole of the Natural Resources Defense Council said after the statement was issued. “It’s almost like the extinction of these creatures is their real goal, so that they no longer have to leave any water in rivers, but can divert it all to corporate agribusiness.” “Secretary Ross’s directive is nothing more than a smokescreen designed to weaken these protections that NMFS’s scientists determined are necessary to keep these native fish from going extinct,” Natural Resources Defense Council water division senior director Kate Poole told ABC News. “It’s almost like the extinction of these creatures is their real goal, so that they no longer have to leave any water in rivers, but can divert it all to corporate agribusiness.” “At this point, water supply hasn’t affected any of our operations,” Cal Fire deputy director Mike Mohler told the Times. As the paper noted, firefighters have been drawing water from the Clear Lake reservoir to fight the nearly 300,000-acre Mendocino Complex fire, but the order could be a pretext to undermine California’s regulation of the Shasta Lake reservoir, which feeds recently devastated salmon smolt populations in the Sacramento River. The Times added: As we’ve reported, the Bureau of Reclamation, an Interior Department agency, has proposed changes in both state and federal water projects to “maximize water deliveries” to non-environmental users and consider “modifications to regulatory requirements” established by the biological opinions. ABC News added that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recently wrote an op-ed saying that part of the solution to the fires needs to include a more “aggressive approach to thinning of forests. That approach is less controversial, but much of the necessary funding is tied up in budget fights, according to the New York Times. University of California, Merced management professor LeRoy Westerling told the paper that California “spending millions and millions of dollars on this while the federal government is sitting on its hands... And all that money is being raised because we’re putting a price on carbon.” According to CBS News, firefighting costs in California more than tripled from $242 million in the 2013 fiscal to $773 million in the fiscal year ending in June 30, while smoke from the fires now consuming some 600,000 acres across the state now cover three-quarters of the state.

"Gwen Ihnat on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","I dont consider myself a competitive person, but my friends would likely require your largest bath sheet to wipe away tears of laughter if they heard me say so. Its true there are certain events that raise my blood pressure and get my adrenaline up, like vacation rounds of Celebrity. My husband Brian and I somehow now boast a handful of school- or bar-based trivia championships. Every year, our whole family fires up for my friend Leahs chili cook-off.
It started out as a casual affair, as Leah and I both recall it: in her old apartment, maybe eight or 10 Crock-Pots plugged in, our toddler kids stumbling down her long hallway like Andy Capp after a late night. Then, life expands as your kids expand, leading to pre-school parent friends. Leah went to grad school, drafting more chili contestants from her cohort. She and her family moved, so more neighbor friends joined. This year, at their ninth annual contest, Leah is expecting 30 or so chilis, and as many as 100 attendeesif Evite is to be believed. The chilis are numbered, so no one knows whose dish is whose. Notecards are handed out so that the tasters can take copious notes. Weve never missed one of Leahs chili cook-offs, or a single submission.
Our family has gone through euphoric highs and devastating lows with the chili cook-off. When I was my familys primary cook, I placed second one year with an inspired concoction I called the Holy Molé (fearing my chili didnt taste molé enough, I threw in an extra handful of chocolate chips at the last minute. Second place!) There have been agonizing years when we didnt place at all. But none of us will forget the year Brian won the whole thing, with Bull In A Spice Shop (my title, alluding to his longstanding spice-abuse problem). The only other time Ive seen him that happy is at the birth of our children. That was five or six years ago, and weve been trying to regain the crown ever since.
Nonetheless, its a party I look forward to every year: Leah plans it around National Chili Day, which is February 28, but its also a good end-of-winter/cant-wait-for-spring party. Chili is one of those things that everyone, even people who dont cook that much, thinks they have the perfect recipe for. You just plug in your Crock-Pot and youre set (although one year all those plugs blew the main circuit, another good reason to have Brian, an electrician, on hand).
 We may not place ever year, but I have observed enough of the winners to know what makes a number-one chili, and a number-one chili party. Heed my chili cook-off words of wisdom.
In a large field of competitors, stand out
Theres a friend of Leahs who has won the contest more than a few times, and I believe her secret is that she takes things up a notch. With that many chilis, tasters taste buds are going to cash out after a while, so you need to be creative. This woman has used salty and umami elements like fish sauce to great success. Its why Holy Molé did so well, I think: It was the only molé chili that year, maybe ever. Although I believe I still lost to Leahs friends Not Umamis Chili.
A catchy name is key
If you have a clever/hopefully hilarious name, this will enable voters to easily choose your selection on the ballot. The title Not Umamis Chili was not only memorable, but informative. I still maintain that Bull In A Spice Shop was a big part of that chilis success.
No one loves the white chili
Standing out, yes. White chili, no. Not sure why. Its different enough to set itself apart, but its hard to create a white chili so good that its going to kick the ass of all the other chilis. Theres also something just visually unappealing about it. For whatever reason, white chilis seldom do well in these group ventures. Even vegetarian chilis fare better, says Leah: White chili never wins. Vegetarian chili won once.
Get creative without alienating your tasters
Yes, I just said to stand out. But you can also stand out in the wrong way. I recall a venison chili one year: While some people really love venison, its not a widespread crowd-pleaser like a chocolatey molé. The name Bambis Mom did not help, from what I remember. Brians Root Down had a cool name, but was anyone really jonesing for root vegetables like turnips and parsnips in their chili? Apparently not.
In a blind tasting, you never know who youre talking to
Eww! Who would put chocolate in chili? exclaimed a friend who was obviously unaware she was speaking to the creator/about-to-be-second-place finisher of Holy Molé. Before you trash someones chili (which is poor chili cook-off form, regardless), make extra-sure youre not actually talking to the person that made it.
Have lots of sides for people who are just for the party, not the competition
I have friends who come to this party every year and make guacamole. Others bring chip and dip. With that much chili, youre going to need some palette cleansers, and the party relies on tasters as much as it does on chili preparers. 
Get your voting system in line
Yes, paper ballots are a pain in the ass, allowing for a long tabulation process. They still win out against the year my friends tried to do the ballot on the Survey Monkey app, which everyone then had to download, resulting in a lot of technology snafus. Now I think they just have a computer with the survey on it where you can go and submit your ballot, eliminating the cumbersome tabulation and tech problems. Sometimes it takes a few tries for chili cook-off things to iron out.
Dont underestimate the power of a great, straightforward chili
Some chilis stand out not because of a catchy title or an unusual add, but because the chili itself is straight-up amazing. Case in point: Leahs own classic recipe, which has won this contest twice and she that has graciously agreed to share for readers of The Takeout. Use it to win your own neighborhood chili cook-off. Leah says, This turns out every time.
Well see if she makes this again for this years contest on Saturday. Next week Ill have a full report, along with details about Brians submission and other creative contestants. Wish us luck: Weve got to get that trophy back! (Whos competitive again?)
Leahs 2x Chilifest Winner
Master spice blend
2-3 Tbs. of chili powder (depends on spice-adverse kids)
1 Tbs. cumin
2 tsp. oregano
1-2 tsp. salt
Lots of fresh ground pepper
Main ingredients 
1-2 Tbs. olive oil
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
1 onion chopped
2 lbs. meat (Leah likes 1 1/2 lb. ground beef plus chopped steak or bulk Italian sausage)
2-3 cans kidney beans with liquid
1 can Amys (or Campbells) tomato soup
1 can (28 oz.) diced tomatoes
1 cup water
Dash of red wine vinegar
Heat oil in a heavy bottom 6-quart pot over medium to low heat. Sauté garlic and sprinkle crushed red pepper over the garlic as it heats up (do not let the garlic brown). Add onions, sauté until soft and starting to caramelize.
Add meat and brown. Add master spice blend to the meat. Add can of tomatoes, soup, two cans of beans withliquid, vinegar, and water.
Add 2-3 shakes and dashes each of the following: Cajun seasoning, Lawrys season salt, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, Tabasco sauce, Goya hot sauce, liquid smoke (light touch), and more chili powder.
Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer. Cook uncovered 2-3 hours on low heat. Adjust seasonings to amplify the acid balance and the heat.
Notes: Leah says, I taste in color termsIll add more vinegar, salt, or hot sauce bring out the red/orange (i.e, bright &amp; acidic). Ill add a splash of coffee, liquid smoke, cajun seasoning, sugar, or chocolate to bring out the brown or warm umami flavors. Cayenne is neutral and adds heat without changing the flavor. Pro-tip: I start the night before to allow the flavors to meld. I adjust the heat the day of Chilifest to avoid over-spicing the chili.","I don’t consider myself a competitive person, but my friends would likely require your largest bath sheet to wipe away tears of laughter if they heard me say so.

TIM ARANGO,"Every fire is investigated, and as wildfire seasons have grown worse, California has been more aggressive in holding people accountable — either with criminal charges for arson or negligence, as with Mr. Martinez, or, if there is a deep-pocketed culprit, with a lawsuit to recoup costs from fighting the fires. In the summer of 2013, a wildfire broke out in Riverside County and grew to threaten the desert resort town of Palm Springs. No one was killed, but it took thousands of firefighters, and almost $26 million, to put it out. Investigators found the blaze started with a faulty electrical box on a private property. Lawsuits in both state and federal court against the owner, a wealthy Saudi businessman, are still pending, although the state case may be resolved soon by mediation, according to the Idyllwild Town Crier, a newspaper in the area where the fire occurred. “Our civil cost recovery is definitely something we do on a regular basis,” Ms. Tolmachoff said. “Ninety-five percent of these fires are caused by humans and they could have been prevented somehow.” Last year the state saw what was then its biggest wildfire in recorded history — the Thomas Fire, in Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties — and its most destructive, the Tubbs Fire in Northern California’s wine country. The causes of both fires are still under investigation, but some lawsuits point the finger at the power companies Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison. And in several other Northern California fires last year, Cal Fire determined that faulty power lines were the cause. In the aftermath of those fires, California’s power companies have received close scrutiny from the State Legislature. “They talk about climate change,” said Steve Campora, a Sacramento lawyer who has made a career of suing utility companies on behalf of fire victims. “And climate change makes it more difficult to control the fire. But climate change does not cause ignition.” Edward Struzik, a fellow at the Queen’s Institute for Energy and Environmental Policy in Ontario and the author of “Firestorm: How Wildfire Will Shape Our Future,” said he believes fires will continue to get worse, year by year, through a combination of climate change and human activity. “There is no end in sight for this fire activity,” he said. Referring to the human causes of wildfire, he added that “education is still a really big problem. There are many people who are oblivious to the dangers and volatility of forests.”","Firefighters battled the Mendocino Complex Fire this month.

Logging roads crisscross Finlands forests, slowing down fires while giving firefighters easy access. Aviation clubs are paid to do fire surveillance, looking for fires from the air. Finnish forest managers remove some of the dead trees (not, uh, leaves) to remove a small percentage of the flammable material. Perhaps we could learn from Finlands strategies, but no amount of raking will make California wetter or slow down the Santa Ana winds that fan the flames, nor will it eliminate forest fires in places that are, like Malibu, not actually made of forests.","Photo: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images) Our President, garbling something the Finnish president said about forest management, believes that the snowy country has fewer wildfires than California because they rake up leaves in the wilderness.

A statement from the prime minister's office on Sunday said that the heads of the police force and fire brigade had both been replaced by their deputies. It comes two days after resignation of the civil protection minister. The government has been strongly criticised over its response to the fires, which claimed the lives of at least 90 people. The government has said the fires were started by arsonists and blamed illegal construction for blocking escape routes. However, a catalogue of errors in authorities' handing of the fires emerged earlier this week. According to one senior expert, police set up diversions that sent drivers into the path of the fire, while a separate study found that authorities did not raise an alarm to allow residents and tourists to escape. The families of a couple in their 70s who were killed in the fires are suing police, fire, civil defence and regional leaders over their deaths.

THOMAS FULLER,"Fueled by Santa Ana winds, the intensity of this week’s fires made it very hard for firefighters to do anything to stop them. On Tuesday evening there were seven active fires in Southern California, according to Calfire. The Thomas fire, the largest, burned 35,000 acres in the first 12 hours alone. By Tuesday night it had spread to more than 50,000 acres. The winds are forecast to continue into the weekend and will not peak until Thursday, according to Chief Berlant. Chief Berlant, who is the head of Calfire’s prevention efforts, says it is crucial for the state to consider fire safety when planning roads and housing developments. As one example, building codes were changed a decade ago to make roofs more likely to withstand embers falling on them. “We know we have a changing climate and we have to adapt to it,” Chief Berlant said. “Our homes and our communities need to be more resilient to wildfires.” Were you evacuated because of the fires?

BROOKS BARNES,"“I can’t remember the last time I even smelled a cigarette in this neighborhood,” said Hector Rodriguez, as he ordered a $3.50 taco at a food truck parked near a Mulholland overlook that would normally be swarming with sightseers. Mr. Rodriguez, a gardener who had spent the morning watering agave plants at a nearby estate, cleared his throat and rubbed his eyes. “People are scared,” he said. In some ways, Mulholland is this city’s signature road. Rodeo Drive and Sunset Boulevard hog the spotlight. But it is Mulholland — named after the civil engineer William Mulholland, who built the infrastructure needed to bring water to Los Angeles — that encompasses the breadth of the city. From its position along the ridge line of the Hollywood Hills, Mulholland winds for several miles and straddles the suburban valley to the north and the more urban cityscape to the south. So it was, perhaps, appropriate that a much different reality was unfolding on the road, farther down from where Mr. Alvarez was parked. On this eastern edge, near where Hogwarts Castle rises at the Universal Studios theme park, life was going on as if there were no fires at all. A man in a blue Porsche convertible — top down — waited impatiently at a traffic light. Two men with leaf blowers blew the morning dust off the driveway of a well-to-do home. The air did not smell acrid; it smelled like freshly clipped grass. And a gaggle of tourists, gathered under a blue sky at a scenic lookout, seemed a little disappointed by the normalcy. There were no burning hillsides in sight, no billows of black smoke. This did not look like the apocalypse, at least not to Jane-Marie Treanor, who had arrived from Ireland the night before to alarmed messages from friends who had seen news reports about the fires. “We haven’t seen any trace of fire yet, not even a burning smell,” said Ms. Treanor in her County Monaghan brogue. “It seems like a typical day to me.” From her vantage point, perhaps. As any Angeleno will tell you, however, anything that unites people of this city is atypical. The sprawl is so great that residents stay in their own bubbles, often completely unaware of major happenings in neighborhoods just a few blocks away. On Thursday, everywhere you went, or so it seemed, the conversation was about one topic — fire. In the lobby of the Hotel Bel-Air, a staffer answered a concerned guest’s questions.

KAREN ZRAICK,"A month later, some people remain displaced, and more than 7,500 gas meters are still shut off, leaving residents without heat, hot water or cooking gas. Columbia Gas says it plans to fully restore service by Nov. 19. The report lays out the chronology of an afternoon that looked like Armageddon as the fires burned. Minutes before the explosions, the Columbia Gas monitoring center in Columbus, Ohio, received two high-pressure alarms for the south Lawrence gas pressure system. One was at 4:04 p.m.; the other came a minute later. The monitoring center does not open or close valves on its own, but it can advise field technicians. At 4:06 p.m., it notified the group in Lawrence. Just five minutes later, a resident placed the first of many 911 calls. By the evening, there had been at least 70 reports of explosions, fires and strong gas odors. The three areas are home to more than 100,000 people, and firefighters found themselves putting out one fire, only to find another breaking out nearby. Thousands lost power and traffic jammed the roads out of town. The Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities is hiring an independent evaluator to examine the safety of natural gas distribution throughout the state. After the release of the report, it ordered Columbia Gas to stop work except for emergency repairs and compliance work until at least Dec. 1. The department issued a similar order to National Grid this week, pending a review of its safety practices.","A damaged building in Lawrence, Mass., after a series of explosions and fires there on Sept. 13.

MIRIAM JORDAN,"Thanks to its mild climate and rich soil, Ventura County produces a variety of crops all year. In the plains around Oxnard, Calif., the vast strawberry fields have been spared from the fires. But thousands of immigrants toiling in the fields initially lacked masks to protect them from the thick, acrid smoke that wafted across the county. Volunteers have descended on the fields to hand out masks since last week. “We have been moving mask distributors up and down the coast,” said Lucas Zucker, policy director of the Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy, known as Cause. The California Strawberry Commission has urged workers to wear masks, and some growers have distributed them. One 44-year-old farmworker from Mexico who gave his name as Alfonzo said he worked without a proper mask before Cause gave him one. “My throat was aching, but I have my family to support and the rent to pay,” said Alfonzo, who earns $10.50 an hour in the fields. Ventura County growers are used to Santa Ana winds, and many have lost crops before, mainly to frost. But they said they were surprised to see wildfires so close to the ocean and so late in the year, which highlights the severity of a yearslong drought. “This is a complete game-changer for a lot of us,” said Leslie Leavens, a fourth-generation farmer whose family grows avocados and lemons on 800 acres in Ventura Country. As for Ms. Brokaw, she said she was confident that the majority of her trees would survive, even if there are barely any avocados for her to sell this year. “The orchard can be rejuvenated,” she said. “We are committed to this, long-term.” Continue reading the main story",The largest of the fires has damaged a portion of the harvest in the country’s most productive region for both crops.,2017-12-14T00:10:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",More Victims of the California Wildfires: Avocados and Lemons,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/us/california-fires-avocados.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/14/us/14avocados-promo/14avocados-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fires,1

Mr. Brown said the bill would hurt residents in California while helping those in places that don’t have high state or local taxes — which happen to be Republican states, the governor noted. “You’re taking money from Californians and giving it to people elsewhere,” he said. “It’s unfair and unwise because California is an engine of American growth.” California Online (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"LOS ANGELES — Fires continued to ravage much of Southern California on Friday, as fast-moving flames scorched more than 159,000 acres across four counties, blackening the air and forcing closures of schools and roadways. In San Diego County, where a small grass fire that broke out Thursday morning had grown by night to 4,100 acres, residents near Bonsall and Oceanside scrambled to heed evacuation orders. At least six people were injured, and at least 20 structures destroyed. Brian Jones, a concrete contractor from Bonsall, dropped off his horses at the county fairgrounds after fleeing his home. “I didn’t want to leave,” Mr. Jones said. And then the flames “started coming over the ridge, right at the edge of our development, and it was ‘Oh, boy — time to go.’” Evacuation orders were lifted late Thursday in parts of Los Angeles and Riverside Counties, but the situation remained dire in Ventura County, where 132,000 acres had burned and more than 430 structures were destroyed. That fire, just 10 percent contained, threatened to cross on Friday into Santa Barbara County, where new evacuations had been ordered. Here’s the latest: • A fire near Murrieta, in Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, has burned about 300 acres. Seven buildings were destroyed, officials said, and the fire was 10 percent contained. • The threat was so severe that for the first time, state officials used the highest category in their color-coded fire hazard warning system. They painted much of Southern California purple on Thursday, for extreme danger, and many people received warnings to be ready to flee. Here’s what to do when you’re preparing to evacuate. • Late Thursday, with the fire that began in Ventura threatening scores of homes, Gov. Jerry Brown extended a state of emergency declaration to Santa Barbara County. He also requested an emergency declaration from the president that would make it easier for federal aid to reach Southern California. • Some residents who were forced to evacuate their homes because of the fires in the San Fernando Valley and in Bel-Air were told they could return on Thursday night. • Eric M. Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, said late Thursday that he was not aware of any deaths connected to the Los Angeles fires. (Want to get California Today, our daily newsletter on the state, by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Graphic Wildfires burned near and in Los Angeles and other parts of Southern California, forcing thousands to evacuate. An official warns of a ‘very dangerous’ time in San Diego County. The fire near Bonsall in San Diego County ignited on Thursday and within hours spread to more than 4,000 acres with zero containment. Many parts of the Bonsall area were under evacuation orders, and officials encouraged residents with livestock to take their animals to the county fairgrounds. The area is known for its equestrian facilities. Ron Lane, San Diego County’s deputy chief administrative officer, said a large portion of a mobile home park had been destroyed, along with other houses in the Bonsall area. “This is a very dangerous period of time we’re going through in the County of San Diego over the next 24, 48 hours,” Mr. Lane said. “We have to be resilient.” A couple escapes the flames in Ventura on bicycles. Evacuees have also been talking refuge at the county fairgrounds in Ventura. Among them on Thursday was Patricia Hampton, 48, who lost her home near Ventura’s City Hall on Tuesday night. Ms. Hampton said that she and her boyfriend had gone to bed unaware of the approaching calamity. “I wasn’t feeling well and so I went to lie down,” she said. “We woke up in the dark hearing helicopters and what we thought was rain pelting the roof,” she said. The rain turned out to be embers, ash and debris falling as the fire raged across Ventura. The couple got on bicycles in the black of night, the glow of the fire as their only source of light, and rode toward the fairgrounds. “I got out with clothes on me and the bikes and that’s it,” she said. “I don’t know what we’ll do next,” she added. “I really couldn’t say.” Video In Bel-Air, a chance to return home. By Thursday night, several top local and state officials said they were encouraged by improving conditions in the city and county of Los Angeles. And as a result, officials announced that some Angelenos would be allowed to return home starting Thursday evening. The focus in the Bel-Air hills had turned to digging out burning embers and cooling down any hot spots that could easily ignite. It was easy to see how quickly the neighborhood could go up in flames: sprawling estates on narrow streets were surrounded by towering elms and bitterly dry pine needles. Blackened embers of tree trunks had tumbled down — one had hit a firefighter and burned him around the neck. Many of the towering iron gates that guard the mansions had been broken open by firefighters who needed to get to the slopes burning below. Some driveways were covered with splatters of pink from the fire retardant that had been dumped from aircraft above. Captain Brian Ferreira, a firefighter from Oakland, had helped mop-up on a hillside near a winery owned by the media mogul Rupert Murdoch. While small patches of the hillside and the wine storage had suffered some damage, most of the winery seemed fine, he said. “Rupert will be glad to hear that, he paid a lot of money for that property,” said Hugh Siegman, 71, who lives just above the winery. Mr. Siegman and his wife returned to their undamaged home Thursday morning, before the evacuation had been lifted. “I would rather be here and be vigilant myself and get these guys to help if they need it,” he said. Reporting was contributed by Jennifer Medina and Miriam Jordan from Los Angeles; Thomas Fuller and Mark Storer from Ventura, Calif.; Roxana Popescu from San Diego; Richard Pérez-Peña and Matt Stevens from New York; and Mitch Smith from Chicago.

While grabbing leftover pancakes on the kitchen stove, the dog accidentally hit the ignition, turning the burner to maximum and starting a small fire. Oops.

When the smoke detector when off, it alerted the local police and fire departments, and an officer came to the house and turned off the burners.

Tom McKay,"Spaceflight company SpaceX test-fired the engines of its prototype Starship vehicle on Wednesday at its Boca Chica, Texas, test facility, the Verge reported, in a static fire configuration that saw the spacecraft tethered to the ground.
SpaceX calls the prototype vehicle in question a Starhopper, and it is meant to test various technologies that the company plans to use in a theoretical future spacecraft, called Starship, that will travel to space (according to CEO Elon Musk, the Moon and Mars, specifically). While the Starship itself will carry 100 people and require the use of a first stage Super Heavy rocket, the Starhopper is a smaller version for atmospheric testing of Raptor engines, which run on liquid methane and liquid oxygen, and will fly no higher than 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) in the air, according to documents filed with the Federal Communications Commission. The test occurred at around 8:56pm ET, according to Space.com, with Musk later tweeting that the test was successful.
Based on earlier comments by Musk, Space.com wrote, the test likely used one engine and didnt get very high. The Starhopper is made of stainless steel and is roughly 60 feet tallit was originally more than twice that size, but a nosecone mounted on the craft blew over and suffered extreme damage in January 2019 amid high winds. Musk later said that the nosecone was unnecessary for continued testing of the prototype.
SpaceX distributed fliers to locals before the test warning that special checkpoints would be set up during the test to maintain a safety perimeter. According to Business Insider, some Boca Chica Village residents have complained about the road closures, specifically their frequency, extended hours, and tightening security meant to ward off gawkers. While SpaceX originally said it would use the test site around once per month, a local told the site that Highway 4 has been closed every day for the past week; each closure reportedly lasts about eight hours.
According to the Verge, SpaceX has plans to build both the Starship and Super Heavy at the Boca Chica facility and Cape Canaveral, and Musk has said he is working on regulatory approval for eventual launches. He has floated a date of 2020 for the Starships first test flight, and though that timetable may not be realistic, he has already sold a seat on the Starship to Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa.
This is not the only recent milestone SpaceX has set recently: In March 2019, its Crew Dragon capsule successfully completed a demo for NASAs Commercial Crew Program, spending several days in space and automatically docking with the International Space Station.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"A new satellite image of our planet shows fires raging across the world, from Canada to Australia to South America to Sub-Saharan Africa. But despite its striking appearance, much of this is actually quite ordinary. The map, created by NASA, denotes fires with red dots, based on heat measurements that detect fires. While it may look like the world is alarmingly aflame, fires occur every year. It’s the unusual intensity of fires in certain regions, linked to human-caused climate change, that we need to worry about. Here’s the uncropped image: “Pretty much wherever you have vegetated surface, you have fire. I don’t particularly think this is a crazy, out-of-the-ordinary year for the globe,” said Christine Wiedinmyer, associate director for science at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, a partnership between NOAA and the University of Colorado, Boulder. But it’s a particularly big year for certain parts of the globe, she told Gizmodo. The parts where many of our readers live: “The Western U.S., California, and British Columbia—it’s a super big year.” You’ll notice that many of the data points appear in Sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. These fires appear annually and come mostly from slash-and-burn agricultural practices common in the region. These methods clear fields and replenish the soil nutrients, but can also produce human-harming smoke. Many of the fires in Brazil and Indonesia are also due to these farming methods. NASA has a neat tool showing how fires burn across the globe over time that you can play with here, demonstrating the annual nature of Saharan, Sub-Saharan, and Indonesian fires. But in some years, like 2015, these practices led to forest fires that severely impacted air quality and led to a haze in the region. Studies have suggested that the El Niño weather patterns made 2015 especially bad. This context is crucial to understanding a map like this. The fires are really bad, yes, but you need more than a map to explain why. Take the fires in North America, as well as in many parts of South America—they are wildfires. You’ve likely heard all about the fires on the North American West Coast, many of which have been sparked by people and aggravated by the compounding effects of dry weather, winds, and high heat. A recent study demonstrated that south-central Chile is facing many of the same climate-related concerns, along with intense fires of its own. Another huge wildfire sparked up south of Berlin, Germany just today, causing evacuations. The AP reports that these fires have been complicated by buried ammunition from WWII blowing up. Germany has faced an especially hot and dry summer. You can expect climate change to exacerbate the conditions that cause these fires in the future, especially in places where the human population is expanding. “We know that the climate really drives fire activity severity, particularly in the western U.S.,” Wiedinmyer said. These fires can have global impacts too, sending smoke across the ocean to Europe or up to the poles, she said. So, you shouldn’t be surprised that there are so many fires on Earth. But you should be worried about the increase in wildfires, which we can expect will continue to worsen during our lifetimes. And you should be really worried about people who deny humanity’s very real and often dangerous impact on the environment.

Jonathan Shieber,"As crews across California battle more than a dozen wildfires—including the largest in state history—the blazes are spewing enough carbon into theair to undo some of the good done by the state’s climate policies. What’s even worse: Climate-warming compounds that will be released by the charred forests long after the fires are extinguished may do more to warm up the planet than the immediate harm from smoky air. Scientists say that only about 15 percent of a forest’s store of carbon is expelled during burns. The remainder is released slowly over the coming years and decades, as trees decay.That second hit of carbon, experts say, contains compounds that do more to accelerate climate change than those from the original fire. And future fires over previously burned ground could make climate prospects even more bleak. “The worst possible situation is the fire that comes through and kills everything,” said Nic Enstice, regional science coordinator for the Sierra Nevada Conservancy. “Then, ten or fifteen years later, another fire comes through and releases all the carbon left in the trees on the ground. That’s really bad.” It’s a scenario that could explode at any time. Enstice cited a research paper published this year that laid out a chilling tableau: California has more than a 120 million dead trees strewn around its mountain ranges, with the southern Sierra hardest hit. When fires hit those downed trees, the state will begin to experience “mass fires” spewing plumes of carbon. The resulting conflagrations, according to the researcher, will be almost unimaginable. “The emissions from those fires will be unlike anything we will have ever seen,” Enstice said. “And you won’t be able put it out.” Computing the carbon released from the the fires so far this year will not happen soon. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration flies planes through smoke plumes, gathering data, but air traffic over wildfires is tightly restricted. Scientific research is not a top priority when fires are threatening towns. But some preliminary data is available now. One method uses inventories of existing forests—surveying how many trees and which type. Those records are updated every 10 years. Researchers then overlay infrared images captured from satellites that show what’s burning and at what intensity. From that, predictions can be made about carbon emissions on any given day. Scientists say that emissions from burned forests are one of the most virulent types, called black carbon. According to the most recent accounting from the state Air Resources Board, California’s annual black carbon discharge—excluding wildfires—are equal to emissions from about 8 million passenger vehicles driven for one year. Not a small number. But when the state calculates the same annual average of black carbon coming solely from wildfires, it’s the equivalent of nearly 19 million additional cars on the road. With year-round fire seasons and fire intensity off the charts, state officials admit that wildfires could set backCalifornia’s myriad policies to offset the impacts of climate change. “It’s significant,” Enstice said. “We don’t have a lot of data to measure yet, we’re still using primitive tools. But everyone is gearing up to study this.” This article is republished courtesy of CALMatters.","Julie Cart Contributor Share on Twitter Julie Cart is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who writes for CALmatters, a nonprofit, non-partisan media venture explaining California policies and politics.

Matt Novak,"Did you see the tweets supposedly debunking the huge fires that were burning during the protests in Paris? In reality, the debunkers are bullshit. The photos werent merely taken from different perspectivesthey were taken on completely different days on completely different streets. First take a look at the the bullshit debunkers with sarcastic titles like Paris burns and perspective matters, which have racked up tens of thousands of view online: The suggestion, of course, is that these two photos show the same scene and news photographers are intentionally messing with the perspective to make the fire look bigger than it is. But nothing could be further from the truth. AFP has posted a thread that shows the two photos used to debunk this narrative were taken at different times. As the AFP points out, the photo on the left was taken on December 1, 2018 by Karine Pierre, a news photographer at the Hans Lucas agency in France. But the photo on the right in all these tweets was taken on December 8, 2018, on a different street in Paris, by a photographer at the magazine Le Point. Its not clear who first posted these two photos together, nor is it clear whether they were just dumb or were intentionally deceitful. But the AFP has a great rundown on the two photos and expertly dissects why theyre actually different streets. The two photos seems like they could be from the same street, but in reality theyre not showing the same fire. The so-called yellow vest protests in Paris are indeed intense, and have even led to real reforms already, including a pledge by Emmanuel Macron to raise the minimum wage. But these two photos, when placed together, create a misleading picture of whats happening on the ground. Dont believe everything you see online. Even if it claims to be a debunker.

KATHARINE Q. SEELYE,"Vicente Avila, 42, a handyman, who was tugging at a wooden red wagon loaded with what he estimated was $700 worth of food, rolled his eyes when asked how long he might be away from home. “We’re stuck,” he said. “Everything is just frozen in time.” In South Lawrence, sirens still wailed throughout the day as police and firefighters set up additional roadblocks, trying to keep up with each new report of another gas leak. No new explosions were reported. Marianne Vega, 36, a sales representative, stopped on a bridge to catch her breath, saddened at the state of her home. “Everything spoiled and the fridge smells,” she said. Because of the power failure and gas leaks, businesses are at a standstill, but her husband was working as an Uber driver in Boston. Ms. Vega said her family was supposed to be moving in a few days, but moving trucks would not be able to get to their house, so they will likely be in their new place without any furniture. Others are trying to make the best of a difficult situation. Carmen Gonzalez, 43, who works in a clothing store, said she and most of her extended family and a few neighbors decided to stay in their homes in South Lawrence, regardless of the evacuation orders and the lack of gas and power. They were afraid their houses would be robbed, and they wanted to protect them. The deserted street gave them plenty of room to play basketball. They put batteries in a boom box and cranked up the bachata music. They waited for family and friends on the outside to bring back food, and on Saturday night they fired up the grill and cooked burgers and pork chops. At one point, a truck drove by and handed out bottles of water, toothpaste and travel shampoos. “I was so happy to see them,” Ms. Gonzalez said. “It made me cry.”","From left, Claritza Peguero, Maximo Feliz, Hector Peguero and Emmanuel Peguero retrieved items from their home in Lawrence, Mass., where scores of explosions and fires displaced residents.",2018-09-15T23:30:44Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",‘I’m Just Glad We’re Alive’: Gas Leak Leaves Thousands Displaced and Afraid,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/15/us/massachusetts-gas-explosions-lawrence.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/us/16explosions-print2/16explosions-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fires,0
MATTHEW SEDACCA and HEATHER CASEY,"5. Georgia’s Republican runoff for governor offered several forecasts for the midterm elections, coming in just over three months. The runoff’s winner, Brian Kemp, above left, a white, Trump-anointed populist, will face Stacey Abrams, an African-American Yale Law School graduate who supports an assault rifle ban and says her “soul rests with those seeking asylum.” By itself, that race will be a point of demarcation for that changing Deep South state. But the outcome also shows how the primary system increasingly rewards those who appeal to the fringes. President Trump said he would be stumping for vulnerable Republicans “six or seven days a week.” “The middle has gone, and it has gone to the extremes, unfortunately,” said former Gov. Roy E.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Fires have spread easily in hot, dry weather Forest fires raging across Sweden as far north as the Arctic Circle have prompted authorities to ask for international assistance. On Wednesday afternoon, 44 fires were burning from Lapland in the far north to the southern island of Gotland. Hot weather and persistent drought are the main causes, and the national weather service has issued fire warnings for almost the entire country. Italy and Norway have both despatched firefighting aircraft to help. Sweden said Italy had sent 13 people in two Canadair CL-415 ""waterbombers"", each of which can carry 6,000 litres of water at a time. Norway's national broadcaster NRK, meanwhile, reported that 10 helicopters had been despatched to aid its neighbour - six on Tuesday and another four on Wednesday- despite the risk of similar fire outbreaks in Norway itself. The wildfires have raged in parts for days and without a break in the hot dry weather they have shown little sign of stopping. Many people have been evacuated from their homes in Sweden, while others have been told to shut off all ventilation to keep smoke outside. Fire chief Britta Ramberg told Swedish media the fire in Jämtland was ""the largest and spreading the fastest"". Official advisories said that this blaze grew from 1,600 hectares to 3,000 on Tuesday alone, and that firefighters had been unable to contain it. Many firefighters were being recalled from holiday to join the operation.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The Carr fire has burned through an area larger than the city of San Francisco California's deadliest current wildfire is getting larger, officials warn, despite thousands of firefighters battling it. ""Erratic winds"" and dry conditions have caused the Carr fire to grow early on Sunday, firefighters said. It is one of eight major wildfires currently burning in the state. The fire, in the Shasta County in northern California, has killed six people so far, including two children and their great-grandmother. Melody Bledsoe, 70, Emily Roberts, five, and James Roberts, four, died when they were caught in its path as they were about to evacuate their home in the town of Redding, about 150 miles (240km) north of Sacramento, on Thursday. A fourth body was found on Sunday. Two firefighters also lost their lives on Thursday. A third firefighter died battling the Ferguson fire, near Yosemite, earlier this month. Media caption Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years The Carr fire, which doubled in size overnight on Friday, was only 5% contained by Sunday morning. It has already burnt more than 48,000 acres (194 sq km) of land and destroyed at least 500 structures. It began on Monday. On Thursday it became a firestorm, jumping across the Sacramento River, according to news agency Reuters. California department of forestry and fire protection (CalFire) chief Ken Pimlott told reporters they were ""seeing fire whirls - literally what can be described as a tornado"". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are 12,000 firefighters working to contain blazes across California ""This fire was whipped up into a whirlwind of activity"" by gale-force winds, he said, ""uprooting trees, moving vehicles, moving parts of roadways"". A total of 38,000 people have been evacuated from Shasta County. California's Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in the area, as well as three others. US President Donald Trump has approved federal aid for the counties. The Carr is the largest of eight big fires burning in California, and 90 across the country, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. There are currently 12,000 firefighters battling the flames across the state. Wildfires are a common occurrence in California during the state's long, hot, dry summers. However, experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years - partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation. UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain told the Los Angeles Times much of the state's vegetation had reached ""explosively dry"" levels. In December, Governor Jerry Brown said devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change had become ""the new normal"", and that large fires ""could happen every year or every few years"".

CHARLES McDERMID,"Mr. Witwer was referring to what many are calling the “new normal,” a term now commonly applied to the state’s drastically worsening fire seasons as a result of cyclical drought, climate change and the ceaseless drive to populate fire-prone areas. Last year was the most destructive fire season in California history: more than $10 billion in damage and 44 dead. The ominous question is what comes next. “There is a new normal in California,” Toni Atkins, the State Senate president pro tem, said by email. “Massive wildland fires are now a part of our life — and one of biggest challenges facing the Legislature and governor this year. These fires are every bit the same kind of disaster as earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters that confront states across the country.” Fear has translated into policy: California will spend as much as $1 billion in the coming year to prevent and prepare for wildfires. Mr. McLean said that through Sunday, Cal Fire had this year responded to 1,200 fires that had burned 8,000 acres. Last year at this time, they’d responded to 1,049 fires that burned 2,200 acres.

DAN BILEFSKY,"Their “verbal aggression” would not be tolerated in schools or workplaces, she added. (A former premier of Quebec whose party was widely attacked on the stations commissioned the report.) Daniel Gagnon, 59, a retired electrician in Quebec City and an avid listener of Mr. Fillion, defended talk radio for speaking hard truths. “Unlike politicians, they say what they think and speak for the common man,” he said, quickly adding, “Sometimes they are vulgar and go too far.” Other fans said talk radio’s trenchant humor and satire was misunderstood by smug, politically correct liberal elites. Mr. Fillion, the son of teachers from Saguenay, in northern Quebec, entered Quebec City’s talk-radio landscape in the 1990s. Memorable one-liners, he said, had become even more crucial in the Twitter age. To get a break from his obsessive trawling of social media, he plays hockey and golf. “Trash radio is a term used by the Left to attack anyone who doesn’t agree with them,” he said. A figure so polarizing that even my meeting with him spurred a backlash, Mr. Fillion has become a folk hero for defenders of freedom of expression. When the federal broadcasting authority tried to close CHOI-FM in 2004, citing abusive content, nearly 50,000 people took to the street in Quebec City, saying that the authorities were breaching freedom of speech. (The authority revoked the station’s license, but it never went off air and was bought by another company.)

Sarah Perez,"Hulu outbid major players in cable and streaming to obtain the rights to develop “Little Fires Everywhere,” a new limited series produced by Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine, producer of the Emmy-winning “Big Little Lies” on HBO. The show is based on Celeste Ng’s 2017 bestselling book by the same name, and will star both Witherspoon and Kerry Washington. The series recently hit the marketplace, and was soon the subject of a bidding war between major players industry-wide, according to reports. The Hollywood Reporter also said several outlets attempted to take the package off the table, but Witherspoon and others involved in the project insisted on letting everyone hear the pitch before deciding on the right home for the project. It’s notable, then, that Witherspoon opted for Hulu, given Hello Sunshine’s recent projects have sold to Apple. That list includes a comedy series starring Kristen Wiig; a Jennifer Aniston and Witherspoon drama, focused on a fictional version of the morning TV show world, and a thriller starring Octavia Spencer called “Are You Sleeping.” The new project will be produced by Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine, Washington’s Simpson Street and ABC Signature Studios. Liz Tigelaar (“Casual”) will write and serve as showrunner and exec producer. This is Hello Sunshine’s first venture as a studio. It will serve as studio co-production partners with ABC Signature, the cable and streaming division of ABC Studios, on the project. Hello Sunshine will also lead creative. ABC Signature is already working with Hulu on “Marvel’s Runaways,” and had worked with Washington on the HBO film “Confirmation.” Its credits also include Showtime’s “SMILF,” Freeform’s Marvel series “Cloak and Dagger,” and others. The New York Times Best Seller which the new Hulu series is based on will tell the story of the intertwined fates of the picture-perfect Richardson family and an enigmatic mother and daughter who upend their lives over the course of eight episodes. The story, explains Hulu, “explores the weight of secrets, the nature of art and identity, the ferocious pull of motherhood – and the danger in believing that following the rules can avert disaster.” These themes – of motherhood, women’s lives, and identity – are similar to those explored in the Hello Sunshine-backed Emmy winner, “Big Little Lies,” indicating the potential for “Little Fires Everywhere” to follow in its footsteps as the next critically acclaimed success. “Celeste wove a beautiful, riveting story that spoke to all of us, and when we heard the vision Reese, Kerry and Liz have for the series, we knew immediately that we had to bring it to Hulu,” said Hulu Chief Content Officer Joel Stillerman, in a statement. “We’re honored to bring this powerful story to the screen with Hello Sunshine, in their first studio project. This is exactly the type of compelling and culturally relevant content that embodies our Hulu Originals brand.” “At Hello Sunshine, we strive to shine a light on female-driven stories that are rooted in inspiration, emotion and truth – all of which form the bedrock of Celeste Ng’s ingenious work,” added Witherspoon. “Hulu has a rich history of transforming groundbreaking literature into groundbreaking television, and we are confident that their talented team will use this story to spur a long-overdue dialogue around race, class, and what it means to be a mother.” Hulu made a name for itself in streaming with its Emmy and Golden Globe Award-winning series “The Handmaid’s Tale,” but is still looking for its next big hit. “Little Fires Everywhere” will join the slate of Hulu originals that includes the George Clooney limited series “Catch-22,” “The Looming Tower,” “Castle Rock,” “The First,” “Marvel’s Runaways,” and others.","Hulu outbid major players in cable and streaming to obtain the rights to develop “Little Fires Everywhere,” a new limited series produced by Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine, producer of the Emmy-winning “Big Little Lies” on HBO.

RORY SMITH,"MOSCOW — Just two days before its World Cup campaign starts, Spain, one of the favorites to win the competition, was thrown into chaos on Wednesday after the country’s soccer federation fired the team’s coach, Julen Lopetegui. The president of the governing body for soccer in Spain, Luis Rubiales, said at a news conference at the team’s training facility in Krasnodar, Russia, that Lopetegui had been dismissed. The decision came after reports emerged on Tuesday that Lopetegui had agreed to become coach of Real Madrid, the reigning European club champions and one of the world’s biggest teams, after the World Cup is over. Rubiales, who was in Moscow for the vote to determine the host of the 2026 tournament, was informed of Lopetegui’s post-World Cup plans only a few minutes before the coach’s appointment by Real Madrid was formally announced.","Julen Lopetegui during a training session this month.

TED LOOS,"But there was a hitch in terms of achieving wider renown. “Once you started to make it in Washington, they didn’t want you to show in New York,” Mr. Gilliam said of the “covetous” dealers to the north. Asked whether it hindered his career, he said no. “You need a place to think, you need a place to work, and New York is much more political and combative,” Mr. Gilliam said. “In Washington, you have the trees and Rock Creek Park. Make your paintings, and be your own critic.” That strategy worked, insofar as it led to his draping breakthrough. “That was radical,” said the San Francisco collector Pamela Joyner, who specializes in the work of African-American abstract artists and owns more than a dozen of Mr. Gilliam’s works. “When we think of people in the canon and how to judge that, innovation has to be part of that,” Ms. Joyner said. “And he did it.” Around the same time, he created his beveled-edge paintings, which also had a great reception in the art world. He has gone on to employ many different painting modes, including hard-edge, single-color works, some of which were in the studio last month.

Adam Rogers,"Tuesday afternoon, the New York Times announced it was hiring an opinion writer named Quinn Norton to write about “the power, culture, and consequences of technology.” Late Tuesday night, the Times fired her. Norton, a writer-activist who covered, among other things, the Occupy and Anonymous movements for WIRED in the 2000s, has been an outspoken voice for hackers, the open-source and free-speech communities, and for people working on digital security and privacy. She has been a chronicler and target of harassment online and in the physical world, and she was the romantic partner and friend of Aaron Swartz, the renowned coder and activist who committed suicide in the face of a federal investigation of his activities. Norton knows the field, in other words. But even as congratulations-twitter spun up for Norton, detective-twitter did a double-take. People resurfaced old Tweets where Norton employed derogatory terms for African Americans and gay people—words I find difficult to even type, frankly, about which more in a moment—and writing where she evinced friendships with well-known neo-Nazis. This took all of a couple hours, and I’ve been on enough HR-related conference calls to imagine what kinds of meetings people at the Times were having: How did we miss this, does it matter, is she racist or is she just using racist words, we hired her because she’s connected and complicated…. Arguably one of the world’s experts on the ebb and flow of online communities, Norton didn’t exactly try to defend herself. The use of—oy, find me a better way to say this than “the N-word,” but OK—was part of an ill-conceived retweet of John Perry Barlow, who was trying to make a point about racists. Those similarly foreclosed-upon words referring to gay people were sometimes, Norton said, because she herself has been active in the queer community and were covered by in-group privilege, and sometimes because she was code-switching to the language of 4chan and other online groups that use vile epithets like cooks use salt. Complicated. And as Norton is a journalist covering free-speech and privacy issues online, maybe this kind of language isn’t just allowed but appropriate. She’s speaking the language of the people she writes about. But what about the friends-with-Nazis thing? In particular, Norton had defended Andrew Auernheimer, a hacker (who wrote an opinion piece for WIRED in 2012) and went to prison in 2013. Upon his release about a year later, Auernheimer said that he was also a white supremacist and anti-semite. Everyone is redeemable, Norton explained, and silence or disengagement make racism worse. She pointed to an article she posted on Medium about talking to racists as part of fighting the good fight against them, but also keeping open the lines of communication—as opposed to just, you know, punching Nazis. Anyway, the Times compounded its apparent lack of due diligence with surrender to the mob, and fired her. Here’s the official statement from James Bennet, the editor of the editorial page: “Despite our review of Quinn Norton’s work and our conversations with her previous employers, this was new information to us. Based on it, we’ve decided to go our separate ways.” A few journalists, including a crowd of current and former WIRED staffers whom I greatly respect, criticized the decision. As my colleague Steven Levy wrote, “she’s no racist or Nazi sympathizer. She’s a smart edgy writer whose tweets are too easily taken out of context.” They described her as a complicated, forceful voice for the underrepresented—for women, for people of color, for the poor and the technologically disenfranchised. Those he-saids got she-saided by anti-Nazi hardliners (a phrase I did not know I would need, because, come on) and especially women of color. In Norton’s writing they saw a bad-faith ally. I don’t remember working with Norton when she was at WIRED, though our tenures overlapped. Her writing, then and now, is as personal as it is political, often coming from a place of empathy rather than sympathy, if you see what I mean. (I reached out to Norton, and I'll update this post if she gets back to me.) Responding to the situation on Twitter as it unfolded, Norton said that she was no longer in touch with the Neo-Nazi she’d described as a friend, but that if he did reach out, she’d talk about his dumb racism, as she always did. It’s tough to know whether Norton had described him as a friend because he was, or to be edgy or open-minded. Maybe what she was actually talking about was a cordial relationship with a source. Have I ever become friends with a source for a story? Of course. Have I ever spoken with sources whose views I found odious? Sure. But I’ve never become friends with one of those. Norton became a part of the communities she reported on; Norton reported on communities of which she was a part. That can be a strength. Sympathy can mean distance, and in the online world, there’s little difference between understanding the technology, the sociology, and the actual feelings of it all. The hacktivists of Anonymous don’t reveal themselves fully to just anyone. Maybe you have to have a touch like Norton’s, or they’ll remain, well, anonymous. We reporters argue about this kind of thing all the time, mostly in private. Do you have to be of a subculture to report on it? We sometimes affect an intellectual openness and approachability that we might not feel; part of our job is to assure people we’ll represent their views and statements in good faith. But does that mean we have to agree with them? Or seem to agree? Even if that argument has an answer, it wouldn't necessarily have been relevant. In the old days, whenever those were, Norton’s social life wouldn’t have been public. She wouldn’t have typed those words. Her writing would be separate. But now, like all of us, Norton’s social persona is integral to her body of work. The internet remembered that she was comfortable enough with the language of 4chan and of Neo-Nazis to not only write about it but deploy it. In Norton’s construction, this was a case of “context collapse,” and a display of what a mob can do when empowered by the internet. On the other hand—complicated!—every journalist reads the demur “I was taken out of context” to mean “you quoted something I wish I hadn’t said.” It's clearer now, though, how much those words matter. Gamergate, the far right’s attempt to take over science fiction’s Hugo Awards, and the general awfulness of social media for women and people of color have all been signals of a cultural problem that nominally mainstream reporters like me didn’t pay enough attention to. The rise of Neo-Nazism and hard-right politics online has played out in the physical world to deadly effect. The media saw it happen. And it doesn’t want it to happen again. So this time, the mainstreamiest of mainstream media outlets drew a bright line around Nazis. Who, frankly, could blame them? So now the Times editorial board won't get the benefit of Norton's diverse background and expertise—and won't be as well-positioned to reach the people Norton covers. She’ll no doubt continue to write, but the Acela corridor still prefers the Times and the Post to Medium. Those people need to understand what’s happening on the internet, from brightest open spaces to darkest corners. They should find someone who can explain it to them.","Quinn Norton was hired by the paper of record to write about “the power, culture and consequences of technology.” Then those consequences kicked in.",2018-02-15T01:19:53Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}","The NY Times Fires Tech Writer Quinn Norton, and It’s Complicated",https://www.wired.com/story/the-ny-times-fires-tech-writer-quinn-norton-and-its-complicated/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a84d3984430bd3783b46618/191:100/pass/QuinnNorton-803544702.jpg,wired,Wired,fires,1
LISA FRIEDMAN and JOSE A. DEL REAL,"“To dismiss the role of climate change on these fires is simply incorrect,” said Mr. Wehner, who was a lead author on a chapter of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, a series of federal summaries of climate change data. He made the point, as most climate scientists do, that the cause of the wildfires is multifold, like in any complex event. And this trend promises to continue: According to the National Climate Assessment science report released last year, the number of large forest fires in the Western United States and Alaska is projected to rise as the climate continues to warm. So did the president capture the causes of the California wildfires accurately? Lisa: The president’s tweet said that the California wildfires were worsened by “bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized.” Virtually every scientist and forest management expert agreed that Mr. Trump’s tweet was scientifically and factually inaccurate. Mr. Trump’s other admonition that California “must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!” raised fewer objections. But, state officials pointed out, California devoted more than $250 million in state funds this year alone on efforts to reduce the risk of wildfires. How about the president’s point about water policy? How is that related to wildfire management and firefighting? Is there any connection, as the president suggested?","Wednesday: Hazardous air quality in the San Joaquin Valley, accusations of slogan-stealing in the 10th district, and LeBron James excites bike activists.",2018-08-08T13:13:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Your Questions About Fires and Climate,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/us/california-today-fires-and-climate.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/07/us/07CALTODAY-01/merlin_142056570_ff8f2de5-3943-43a0-894e-84c0995be321-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fires,1
JENNIFER MEDINA and SARAH MERVOSH,"The fires are fueled by extreme heat and parched vegetation from years of drought. And firefighters have repeatedly been vexed by the soaring temperatures and rugged terrain of the current fires. Scientists say climate change is a central factor in creating the atmospheric ingredients that make wildfires like California’s more extreme. Warmer global temperatures, driven by the greenhouse gases emitted from man-made activity like burning coal and driving cars, has led to droughts as well as more intense heat waves that last longer. The result: increasingly intense fire seasons that start earlier and last longer. “You combine drought and heat, you get record wildfires. It’s not rocket science,” said Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University. Michael Wehner, a senior staff scientist at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said it is still not possible to quantify the role that climate change plays versus other factors from more housing developments to the way forests are managed. But, Mr. Wehner said, “It’s fair to say that there is a human influence, and it’s not small.” The Mendocino Complex Fire is a combination of two fires that ignited a few miles apart, Ms. Tolmachoff said. In instances where multiple blazes are close enough together and affect the same area, she said, officials consider them one fire, called a complex. Officials are investigating the cause of the fire, which started on July 27 and was 34 percent contained as of early Tuesday. It has so far destroyed 143 structures, including 75 residences. Despite its size, no one has died in the Mendocino Complex Fire, Ms. Tolmachoff said. Of the top 20 largest wildfires in California, about half have come in the last decade, according to Cal Fire. “That says a lot about the way things are changing in California,” Ms. Tolmachoff said.","Two fires have combined in Northern California to form the largest wildfire in state history.

JONAH ENGEL BROMWICH,"A horse was left behind during the fire in Sylmar, Calif., on Tuesday. Credit Gene Blevins/Reuters The fires sweeping through Southern California, destroying property and threatening human lives, have also killed at least 54 horses, according to the authorities. The California Horse Racing Board said Thursday that at least 25 horses were killed and at least three people were injured when a fire burned through about eight barns at the San Luis Rey training center in Bonsall, in San Diego County. The area, near the county’s northern border, is known for its equestrian facilities. Rescuers Work Frantically to Free Horses From Burning Barn in Bonsall Credit Video by Storyful Rights Management Mike Marten, a spokesman for the racing board, said in an interview on Friday that the death toll was likely to rise. “The area hardest hit is still smoldering, so no one is allowed in,” he said. Two days earlier, 29 horses were killed by the Creek Fire at a ranch in Sylmar in the San Fernando Valley, according to a statement from the Department of Animal Care and Control in Los Angeles County. The department said that it arrived at the ranch on Tuesday morning and found a barn burning, its roof collapsing. Its officers immediately retrieved two horses and a puppy, then returned to the barn to rescue four more horses. Flames blocked their entry to the barn. Additional officers arrived and were eventually able to rescue more horses, breaking padlocks on stalls in order to get them out. The department transported three horses to Pierce College nearby, where one was euthanized because its injuries were so severe. Southern California is one of the nation’s largest horse-racing centers, thanks to an inviting climate where horses can be run year-round. San Luis Rey serves as a hub to trainers and others shuttling back and forth between the courses of the region’s racing circuit, Del Mar, Santa Anita Park and Los Alamitos Race Course. Video from the San Luis Rey fire showed pandemonium as horses scrambled free, kicking dust into the air as flames began to encroach on the property. One trainer, Cliff Sise, told a local CBS station that he had been unable to rescue his horse from a burning barn. “It was dark, everything was hot and she wouldn’t come out,” Mr. Sise said. “I opened the pen and tried to get behind her and get her out, and she wouldn’t get out. She burned to death that quick.” A horse was evacuated from a ranch in La Canada Flintridge, Calif., on Tuesday. Credit David Crane/Los Angeles Daily News, via Associated Press Nearly 500 horses were at the training center when the fire hit and Mr. Marten said that at least three people were injured while trying to rescue them: two trainers, Joe Herrick and Martine Bellocq, and a rider whose name he did not yet know. Ms. Bellocq was in a medically induced coma at a hospital while being treated for the second- and third-degree burns covering more than 50 percent of her body, said her brother-in-law, Remi Bellocq, who runs a jockey school in Kentucky. He said that she was burned while trying to save the six horses she had at San Luis Rey, at least three of which died in the fire. He explained that horses facing a dangerous situation were liable to panic and flee to where they feel the most secure. “Whenever there’s a situation like a barn fire, just cutting them loose out of their stall to get away might not work because they’re so fearful that they might go back to where they’re comfortable, which is the barn,” he said. “The trick is to get away from there and secure them in another corral or paddock where they can’t come back.” The Stronach Group, a track operator, is working with the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club to raise money to help those affected, as is the California Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Foundation. Horses rescued from the fire at the San Luis Rey training center were taken to Del Mar racetrack, where between 800 and 850 horses have taken refuge from the fire. The racetrack started receiving horses at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, and the animals continued to come in throughout the night, a spokeswoman, Annie Pierce, said in a phone interview. Ms. Pierce said the people dropping them off ran the gamut from individual owners to farmers and ranchers. “It’s been really heartwarming to see as a lot of them come in because they’re just so appreciative to have a place to bring their animals,” she said. “As you can imagine, anxiety levels are really high. Some owners are dropping their horses off, then going back to get more animals.” She said that the racetrack’s new guests were not limited solely to horses. Goats, cows and chickens were also sheltering there, along with a potbelly pig that was found running by the side of the road.",The horses died in two fires this week — and at least three people were injured — even as trainers and rescuers tried to save as many as they could.,2017-12-09T03:02:47Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Dozens of Horses Killed as Fires Tear Through California,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/08/us/horses-california-fires.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/09/us/09xp-horses-1sub/merlin_130927635_36e04a0e-b533-4001-9a09-7553cb891098-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fires,1

Many were headed to the Ojai Valley, where health officials said the fire had created hazardous air quality levels that were “off the charts.” Photo The Thomas Fire left behind burned palm trees after sweeping through Faria Beach on Thursday. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times Fire trucks assembled here tell of a statewide effort and beyond — rigs from the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego and Nevada idle in a chorus of clanging diesel engines. There are 3,000 firefighters assembled in Ventura County alone; when they finish their shifts digging firebreaks and hosing down vulnerable terrain, many sleep in tents at the fairgrounds. The crews fighting the fire in Ventura include seasonal and permanent personnel from across the state; teams from the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management; and crews made up of prison inmates, who work for a base salary of $2 a day. They use shovels, chain saws and heavy duty rakes called McLeods to cut through vegetation. One firefighter standing on a blustery hilltop Thursday night had a repetitive task worthy of Sisyphus: monitoring a patch of already scorched hillside and using a garden hose to put out small fires that reignited with each gust of wind. The Ventura County Fire Department said on Twitter that crews were working “long hours in extremely steep, dry, rugged terrain full of drought-stressed fuels.” California has a long history of fire catastrophes. San Francisco burned to the ground at least four times in the years immediately after the gold rush of the 1800s. The state’s Mediterranean climate with its long, arid summers has made it an attractive destination for sun-seeking migrants from wetter and colder parts of the nation. It is also one of the reasons the state is so vulnerable to fire. In recent years the size and intensity of fires has increased. Of the state’s 20 largest wildfires over the past century, 13 have occurred since 2002, according to Cal Fire. With fires now regularly igniting late into fall and winter, a time that was previously considered the off-season, the department says it needs more trucks and more money. Cal Fire has spent $500 million since July and is on track to spend the most in the agency’s history. “We staff to meet the conditions,” said Chief Upton. “But it costs money.” Chief Upton calls California an “anomaly” compared with other states because of the vast resources that the state puts into fighting fires. There are 11,000 fire departments statewide. Photo Firefighters at the Rancho Monserate Country Club, a mobile home park in Fallbrook, Calif. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times Los Angeles alone spends $650 million annually on firefighting, around 7 percent of the city budget. Already, the current fire in Ventura County has cost $17 million, officials said late Friday. On a per-capita basis, California has the sixth largest firefighting budget among states, according to the Urban Institute. Rhode Island, Alaska, Nevada, Florida and Washington spend more per capita, according to the institute’s calculation. But experts warn that calculating total fire expenditure is difficult because so many agencies are involved. As the climate changes and as more homes are built in areas close to nature — and thus more vulnerable to wildfires — there seems no end to the skyrocketing costs of firefighting in California. Some experts believe that the emphasis should be to make communities more resilient to fire, rather than buying more firefighting equipment. The furious winds that helped the initial spread of both the wine country fires in October and the current round of fires in Southern California have highlighted the difficulty — and at the peak of the winds, the seeming futility — of trying to stop the fires. “Of course you need fire protection, but just responding by getting more engines and aircraft doesn’t work,” said Stephen J. Pyne, a fire historian at Arizona State University. “Under the extreme conditions the system fails.” Mr. Pyne recommended “hardening communities” in ways that allow the fires to “blow over and around them without incinerating everything.” “Unless you do that you’re in this endless cycle,” he said. Chris Mehl, policy director with Headwaters Economics, a Montana research group that specializes in land use policies including fire prevention, said California would be forced into building more resilient communities. “This trend is impossible — we can’t keep this up,” he said of the increasingly frequent fires. “But how we build and where we build and the extent and the density — these are all things that are in our control,” he said. Will the firefighters make it home for Christmas? That depends, said David Clark, a Cal Fire spokesman. “I’ll get home when the fire is done,” he said. Mitch Smith contributed reporting from Chicago.

Sidney Fussell,"Seven people received medical attention on Tuesday after an iPhone battery overheated in a Swiss Apple store. Police in Zurich, Switzerland evacuated around 50 customers and staff from the store after an iPhone 6S battery overheated and started spewing smoke. The small fire happened as an employee tried to repair the device. The man was treated for minor burns to his hand. Zurich police say no one was hospitalized as a result of the battery fire. Employees used quartz sand to stop the flames and vented the store to suck out the smoke. The results aren’t pretty: 1 / 2 Smartphone fires are very rare, but not completely unheard of. Samsung’s infamous Galaxy Note 7 started a minor panic in 2016, with reports spreading that it sparked fires everywhere from Florida to Australia to 3000 feet in the air. iPhone fires have been less common, but just last year a woman in Wisconsin filed a lawsuit against Apple alleging a “defective” iPhone 4 battery started a house fire.

Sasha Lekach,"E-scooter company Lime is cautioning riders and contract workers about malfunctioning batteries and other issues with some of its scooters. Lime uses Segway Ninebot scooters in many of its cities, but after an August report about battery issues in ""several"" units, faulty scooters are being pulled from the fleet. What Lime calls a manufacturing defect sometimes led to smoldering batteries, which would then catch fire. Lime called these ""isolated instances."" Back in August, Lime worked with Segway Ninebot to digitally monitor batteries for faulty units, which would then prompt a scooter deactivation. Lime says this affected scooters in Los Angeles, San Diego, and Lake Tahoe. Now, Lime says the company's received an ""unconfirmed report"" about another Segway Ninebot scooter model that may have similar battery issues. Understandably, it's prompted some immediate fixes. SEE ALSO: Lime's new e-scooter will tell you where you can't park Lime recently unveiled its Gen 3 scooter, which utilizes gear from other manufacturers. But since there are still Segway Ninebots out there, Lime is only allowing charging of those models in its own storage facilities, instead of having contract workers charge them. In a blog post this week, Lime said the battery problem affects.01 percent of its scooter fleet, but it's still concerned about its riders' safety and its network of chargers, called Juicers. An email went out to Juicers on Wednesday summarizing the blog post and reiterating that all Segway Ninebot scooter home charging is temporarily suspended. The email went on to assure contract workers that the company is ""grateful"" for their support and ""cares deeply"" about their safety. Lime says it has a new daily diagnostic testing program in place for all its scooters' batteries, no matter the manufacturer. At Lime storage facilities where scooters are being charged, 24-hour on-duty teams will keep an eye on the batteries. A separate issue with Lime's Okai-manufactured scooters was also revealed this week. When ridden off a curb at high speeds, the baseboard can crack or break. Lime said it's ""studying the issue,"" which happens only when scooters are used improperly. It called the type of riding that leads to broken boards ""repeated abuse."" Bird's newest scooter also uses Okai. We reached out to Bird to see if its Okai scooters had experienced any issues. Another scooter manufacturer, Xiaomi, reportedly has asked Lyft to stop using its scooters. In a letter obtained by TechCrunch, the Chinese scooter maker says Lyft never asked to use, modify, or reference the brand. The letter states ""We also do not condone Lyft's unauthorized modification or retrofitting of our electric scooters for general public use.""

"Anna Merlan on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","This month, California has been gripped by three devastating wildfires: Northern Californias Camp Fire, which recently became the deadliest in the states history, and, in Southern California, the Woolsey and Hill Fires. An emerging, deeply weird conspiracy theory holds that those fires arent caused by wind patterns, brutally dry conditions, the worsening effects of climate change, or possible downed power lines, but by a sinister scheme directed by nefarious elements within the government. The claim, being taken up by an increasing number of people in QAnon circles, is that the fires are caused by directed energy weaponsthat is, government-directed lasers bent on destroying homes, property, and lives. And if recent history is any judge, theres a chance the countrys biggest conspiracy-peddlers, up to and including the one who lives in the White House, will take up the cause. Directed energy weapons, or DEWs, have an interesting place in conspiratorial circles. DEWs are, to begin with, a real technology, but one still in its infancy: a report produced for Congress describes that term as an umbrella to refer to technologies that produce concentrated electromagnetic energy and atomic or subatomic particles. The consensus is that there are a number of logistical issues to work out before that the U.S. government will be able to build a laser system that would actually be workable on a battlefield, but that the Department of Defense and private contractors are eager to leverage laser power towards killing people and/or destroying enemy missiles, aircrafts, or satellites. If you ask people in the deep end of the conspiracy theory pool, though, DEWs are here already. Theres a small body of people who believe themselves to be targeted individualsstalked, harassed, and attacked by the government or other shadowy groupsand at least some of them believe those attacks are being carried out by DEWs. Now, through a strange confluence of forces, the paranoia over DEWs is making its way into the discussion about natural disasters. What were seeing is a convergence of longstanding American fears about government mind control and manipulation of the weather merging with climate change skepticism, as climate science becomes ever-more-politicized. Like many conspiracy theories, its not entirely possible to trace where the DEW theories came from. As best I can tell, one of the earliest promoters of that claim was a flat-earth YouTuber going by the name ODD Reality (real name Matt Procella), who started talking about DEWs during the devastating wildfires that raged across California in October 2017. Youll notice here that stores and restaurants are wiped out, while other things are still in perfect shape, Procella intones, over still images of fire damage, some of them sourced, he says, from a Serbian conspiracy site (and some of which appear to be computer-generated). Other buildings are fine, trees are untouched, but specific structures are just devastated. You gotta ask yourself, whats up with that... Is this the result of direct energy weapons? Ranged weapons that inflict damage on a target by emitting highly-focused energy? The answer is most likely yes. Theres actually a fair amount of research to explain why some structures are destroyed and some are spared during a wildfire that has nothing to do with laser weapons. But the broader point Procella is trying to make is about intent: Someone is deliberately destroying certain buildings. That point, though, gets a little mushy. He speculates that all these things are a distraction from the Vegas incident, by which he means the mass shooting in Las Vegas that month that killed 58 people. Elsewhere, the question of why the government would spend its time pointing lasers at peoples houses and Burger Kings has been made somewhat clearer. The left-leaning March Against Monsanto site, which often engages in conspiracy theorizing about GMOs, ran a speculative article about DEW s, reasoning that they could be just another form of government manipulation. People who believe in chemtrails are also concerned about DEWs, and have a more fully fleshed-out explanation for what theyre meant to do. (Chemtrails are harmless condensation trails left by aircrafts, but since the late 1990s, a conspiratorial community has been raising concerns that theyre actually toxic, potentially mind-controlling chemicals.) On one chemtrail-oriented site, Chemtrail Planet, an unnamed author speculates that last years fires were part of a joint plan by FEMA and the United Nations to institute more centralized global control, what they called Agenda 30. The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is actually a resolution passed in 2015 by the General Assembly, promising to do a host of things to make the world better by 2030, including taking urgent action on climate change. Like every UN action, conspiracy theorists claim its mean to institute a centralized one-world government, and like always, that is not true. Theres also evidence that DEWs are becoming part of the cosmology of the QAnon crowd, a remarkably pliant group who have proven that theyre able to incorporate just about anything into their belief system. (QAnon, for the uninitiated, is the conspiracy theory that Donald Trump is secretly doing a really good job, and is this close to uncovering and disarming various evil forces working against him within the government.) The hashtag #DEW has begun to show up in QAnon-oriented Twitter conversations, with several much-retweeted Tweets imploring Trump to take action. Yet another version of the DEWs story claims that the wildfires were directed in such a way to destroy structures in order to make way for a high-speed rail system, part of a Democrat plot. Thats right: the government is destroying vast swaths of trees, houses and infrastructure to force people to ride the train. That tweeted idea is also tagged with several QAnon-related hashtags. Inevitably, the conspiracy theory is migrating to bigger and bigger accounts. On Thursday, a far-right internet personality and QAnon booster named Mike Tokes, who has 170,000 Twitter followers, aggressively took up the cause, using the same line of argument: some homes burned, others didnt, thus lasers must be at work. The DEW theory is inextricably tied to skepticism about the very idea of climate change, a sense that global warming is just the cover explanation for the various sinister plots at work against us. Its also, of course, tied to longstanding conspiracy theories about the government controlling the weather, such as the idea that the government already has a weather control tool called HAARP, which it also uses for electromagnetic warfare. (HAARP is actually a much less exciting research program that studies the uppermost levels of our atmosphere and was years run by the Air Force and University of Alaska Fairbanks. Since 2015, UAF has run it alone, albeit on Air Force land, and has produced a very patient FAQ explaining that HAARP does not exert mind control over people.) Weather and climate conspiracists are, though, not a big group of people, says John Cook, a research assistant professor at the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University who also runs a site called Skeptical Science that outlines the shoddy science and arguments behind global warming skepticism. Climate change conspiracy theories may seem more popular but theyre still very marginal, Cook told Earther. The proportion of the US public who are dismissive about climate change is about nine percent. You dont want to overstate their importance because that can have a negative effect. That said, there may well be a broader swath of the public that is open to conspiracy theories and denialism, if not hardcore about them. For instance, a survey on chemtrails from last year that found up to 30 percent of people polled thought they may be somewhat real. And recent polls show most U.S. Republicans still believe global warming concerns are exaggerated, and that the partisan divide on the issue is growing. Climate change skepticism and other, more out-there forms of conspiracy theorizing about the weather have a few things in common, Cook said. There is a similarity in that its trying to make sense of disturbing events by imaging these patterns. But theres also an important distinction. Climate conspiracy theories tend to be an attempt to explain why theres a scientific consensus on climate change, usually by invoking a vast conspiracy among the worlds climate scientists. Whereas space laser wildfires arekind of Cook paused for a moment, politely. Theyre an isolated single event thing, he finished. As opposed to a more systematic, holistic explanation of the whole climate. Social media, particularly Twitter, has inarguably helped the spread of conspiracy theories about the climate, Cook said. He and his colleagues have studied how to inoculate people against misinformation (and even made a handy video about it), but he admits its an uphill battle. Its difficult, he said. Conspiracy theories are the hardest thing to counter. Theyre so nihilistic, and any attempt to rebut them is seen as more evidence of the conspiracy theory. But the general rule is the way to counter the myth is to replace it with a stickier fact. One issue, Cook said, is that conspiracy theories can cause people to shut down and stop looking for whats true: Theres a danger that theyll disengage and just stop believing in facts. And the facts are plenty terrifying on their own: These fires have already been hellaciously destructive, the deadliest in a century or more, with at least 63 people dead in the Camp Fire alone, three more killed in the Woolsey fire, more than 600 missing, thousands of acres burned, homes destroyed and lives devastated. The president is already engaged in smears and misinformation, bizarrely claiming that forest management was to blame for fires that didnt even originate in forests. Though the causes of the fires are still under investigation, theres evidence that a downed PG&amp;E power line could have potentially sparked the Camp Fire. Theres evidence that public policy and regulation simply arent working, given that PG&amp;E electrical equipment was found responsible for 17 of 21 wildfires in Northern California last fall, and that climate change is only making the situation worse. And theres deep inequality at work, given that working-class communities like Paradise are all but destroyed, while wealthier areas are able to hire their own firefighters to battle the blazes.

Mayor Catherine Pugh said that Darryl De Sousa, a 30-year veteran of the department who was most recently a deputy police commissioner, would replace Kevin Davis, who became commissioner in 2015. Mr. De Sousa will be Baltimore’s ninth police commissioner since 1994. Baltimore experienced a record murder rate last year and had by far the highest rate of the largest 30 cities in the United States. There have been more than 300 homicides in the city in each of the past three years, including 343 recorded in 2017.

BENJAMIN HOFFMAN,"Rich Rodriguez during an Arizona Wildcats game in November. He had coached there for six years before being fired on Tuesday after an investigation into misconduct allegations. Credit Rick Scuteri/Associated Press Arizona fired Rich Rodriguez as its football coach on Tuesday after conducting an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment against him, citing “several factors, including the direction and climate of our football program” for the move. Rodriguez, 54, was the subject of a $7.5 million notice of claim filed last week with the state attorney general’s office accusing him of running a hostile workplace. The Arizona Daily Star first reported the notice of claim, which indicates a lawsuit is imminent, after a public records request. Robert C. Robbins, the university’s president, and Dave Heeke, its athletic director, issued a joint statement on Tuesday evening announcing Rodriguez’s dismissal. In the statement, Robbins and Heeke said the university had retained a law firm in October to investigate harassment allegations made against Rodriguez by a former employee of the athletic department. During the investigation, the statement said, the accuser declined to participate or turn over communications that she had said would support her allegations, so the university determined the claim could not be substantiated. “However, Arizona Athletics did become aware of information, both before and during the investigation, which caused it to be concerned with the direction and climate of the football program,” the statement said. Rodriguez posted a statement of his own on Twitter late Tuesday, saying he was “deeply disappointed” to learn of his firing. He also referred to the university “buying out his contract.” He said in the statement that the complaints had been made by his former administrative assistant and that during the investigation he had voluntarily taken a polygraph test, which he said he passed. While he said the claims by the accuser were “baseless and false,” he said the claim “included a single truth” — that he had had an extramarital affair with a woman who was not affiliated with the university. Rodriguez’s dismissal comes amid a wave of sexual assault and harassment allegations that exploded in the aftermath of The New York Times’s investigation into the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. The accused have included politicians, the Hollywood elite and, in growing numbers, the sporting world. “We are confident that we will find a new leader of our program,” the university’s statement said, “who will take us to great heights with men and women of character and talent, on and off the field.” The claims against Rodriguez were not explicitly laid out by the university, but The Daily Star reported that the notice of claim asserted that Rodriguez and his associates prided themselves on secrecy, that they claimed Title IX “doesn’t exist in our office,” and that the former employee who accused Rodriguez claimed she “had to walk on eggshells at work, because of his volatility and sheer power over the department.” He reportedly has a $6.3 million buyout in his contract, which was extended to 2020, if he is terminated without cause. Despite the university’s investigation, it remains unclear how much the performance of the Wildcats played into the decision. Arizona, which was 3-9 in 2016, had a strong 6-2 start to the 2017 season, but lost four of its final five games, including a 38-35 loss to Purdue in the Foster Farms Bowl. Rodriguez had previously coached Michigan and West Virginia and recorded a record of 118-83 at those schools and Arizona. It is also unclear whether the 16 high school seniors who pledged to play for Arizona last month during the inaugural early signing period will be able to get out of their commitments.","The university said it could not substantiate claims of harassment made against Rodriguez, but that it had uncovered other information during the investigation that led to the firing.",2018-01-03T05:04:21Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Arizona Fires Rich Rodriguez After Investigation Into Misconduct,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/sports/rich-rodriguez-fired.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/sports/03rodriguezweb-1/03rodriguezweb-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fires,1

Mr Massey, who was returning a call from his mother, explained that he was a guest at the Oregon hotel.
""Not any more,"" the guard replied.
The security guard, named in US media as Earl Meyers, told Mr Massey that he was a threat to security and would be asked to leave if he could not provide a room number.
Mr Massey's lawyer, Greg Kafoury, said his client had showed the security guard his key card. He said Mr Massey's only crime had been ""calling his mother while black"".
The lawyer said a manager at the hotel, also captured on video, had called the police.
Mr Massey was led to his room to collect his possessions and escorted off the premises by officers. He was reportedly told he could file a complaint with the hotel later.
Mr Massey posted phone footage showing parts of the 22 December encounter on social media. ""I was racially profiled and discriminated against for taking a phone call in the lobby,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Several social media users criticised the slowness of the hotel's response, which came a week after the incident, and accused it of apologising for PR purposes.
Mr Massey's lawyers have asked the hotel to ""explain in detail in what manner [he] was a threat to safety or security"", and said they were ""investigating similar reports from other Hilton hotels"".

THOMAS FULLER and MATT STEVENS,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The huge wildfires across California in recent weeks have underlined what fire experts describe as the new normal for the state. But firefighters say it’s more than just the scale and the timing of the fires that is different. Chris Anthony, a division chief at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, says fire behavior appears to be changing on a more micro level. One example: In mountainous terrain, fires typically run much faster uphill as the fire heats the fuels above it, making them more readily combustible. But Mr. Anthony says his firefighters are seeing more examples of fires running fast downhill, too. Another example: Firefighters for decades were accustomed to seeing fires slow down considerably at night, said Scott L. Stephens, a professor of fire science at the University of California, Berkeley. But a number of recent fires have continued to advance rapidly through the night. “Many times now in the evening fires are burning at night almost as active as they are in the day,” Professor Stephens said. “Things are happening here in California that 10 years ago I never heard about.”","Friday: Changes in fire behavior and what they mean for us, “Game of Thrones” gets 22 Emmy nods, and Boltman is up for auction on eBay.",2018-07-13T12:34:11Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Here’s What’s Been Different About Fires This Year,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/us/california-today-wildfires-emmys.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/13/world/13caltoday1/13caltoday1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fires,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Wildfires cause devastation in Greece The search for survivors is continuing in Greece, where at least 74 people have died in wildfires near the capital Athens. High winds spread the fire, trapping many in homes and vehicles and forcing others into the sea as they tried to escape the flames. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has declared three days of mourning. On Tuesday, the bodies of 26 adults and children who apparently died embracing each other were found on a cliff top. ""They had tried to find an escape route but unfortunately these people and their kids didn't make it in time. Instinctively, seeing the end nearing, they embraced, "" Nikos Economopoulos, head of Greece's Red Cross, said. On Monday night, hundreds of firefighters battled the flames, which were fanned by winds of up to 100km/h (60mph). Coastal patrol boats and private vessels picked up hundreds of those who managed to reach harbours or beaches. Rescuers are now searching houses, cars and the coastline for survivors and victims of the fires, amid fears the death toll will rise. Image copyright EPA Image caption Rescuers continue their search of the area Relatives of those reported missing have been posting photographs on a website in the hope of tracing their whereabouts. Prime Minister Tsipras has declared a state of emergency in Attica, saying all emergency services have been mobilised. Italy, Germany, Poland and France have all sent help in the form of planes, vehicles and firefighters, while Spain and Cyprus have also offered assistance. 'Biblical catastrophe' The seaside resort of Mati, in Attica, is popular with local tourists, especially pensioners and children attending holiday camps. Survivor Kostas Laganos said: ""It burned our backs and we dived into the water... I said: 'My God, we must run to save ourselves.'"" George Vokas, whose family also escaped by sea, told BBC News that two women he had tried to help had died. ""We're talking about a biblical catastrophe in this wonderful area of Mati,"" he said. Charred bodies lay just 15m (50ft) from the sea, photographer Pantelis Saitas told the Athens-Macedonian News Agency. At least 150 people were injured in the area. What caused the fires? Fires are a recurring problem during the hot, dry summer months in Attica. Officials have suggested the current blazes may have been started by arsonists looking to loot abandoned homes. ""Fifteen fires had started simultaneously on three different fronts in Athens,"" said government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos. Greece, he added, had requested drones from the US to ""detect any suspicious activity"". Greece's last major fire disaster was in 2007, when dozens of people were killed in the southern Peloponnese peninsula.

TIM ARANGO,"The National Weather Service had an extreme heat warning in place in Southern California until Saturday night, and officials urged residents to cool off in libraries and city pools. The heat was especially hard on the homeless in Los Angeles, who number in the tens of thousands. Destiny Galbreath was already sweating when she woke up on Saturday in her tent in downtown Pomona, in the eastern part of the county, where temperatures reached 105. Ms. Galbreath, 23, said the heat was much harder to take than the cold. “When you’re outside in the cold, it’s easier because everyone comes together,” she said. “Everyone tries to huddle up.” Ms. Galbreath was waiting for the library to open — for the sweet relief of air conditioning. She held a foam cup that a local restaurant would later fill with ice for her. The temperature spike broke with historical weather patterns. While much of the Northern Hemisphere suffers through its hottest days in the summer months — June, July, August — Southern California’s hottest days are often in September or October. Records were shattered in some places on Friday. The temperature at the University of California, Los Angeles, reached 111 on Friday, the hottest it has ever been there. Other record highs, according to the National Weather Service, were 114 at the Hollywood Burbank Airport, 117 at the Van Nuys Airport, 117 in Ramona and 114 in Santa Ana. In Riverside, a high temperature of 118 matched a record set in 1925. Many sidewalks and plazas in the region were ghost towns, and the hum of air-conditioners filled the heavy, ovenlike air.",A home leveled by a wildfire in Santa Barbara County on Saturday.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Paradise resident Sorrell Bobrink describes 'apocalyptic' scenes California's latest catastrophic wildfire, the Camp Fire, was impossible to outrun when it first began burning. Officials say winds caused the blaze to burn through 80 miles (128km) of Northern California's hillside in just one hour. So how can you escape such a blaze, and why is the western US state so susceptible to these deadly fires? What's the best way to escape a wildfire? Once evacuation orders are issued by local law enforcement, residents generally have hours to leave, Kathleen Schori, information officer for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) told the BBC. ""But in those initial stages of a fire, you may have minutes,"" she added. Fleeing in a vehicle is ideal as most wildfires cannot be outrun. But the Camp Fire's especially rapid spread, fuelled by high winds, made the situation even more dangerous. ""This fire moved so fast - I don't think anybody did anything wrong,"" Ms Schori says when asked whether those forced to abandon vehicles and escape on foot could have acted differently. ""During the initial phases, it was burning 80 miles in an hour."" She stressed the importance of following evacuation orders immediately, especially with fast-moving blazes. ""If you don't evacuate and it becomes a rescue situation, then our firefighters are taken away from the firefight and moved to the rescue."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Environmental conditions in California in recent years have made wildfires deadlier How do you fight a wildfire? Sometimes, you do fight fire with fire. In addition to old-fashioned water and flame retardant (delivered from ground-level and above the flames by aircraft), sometimes firefighters have to burn more to quell the flames. Intentionally burning areas around a wildfire can help starve the blaze and control its direction. Clearing out brush and flammable material from an area to create ""firebreaks"" is another way to achieve the same. ""Ninety-eight percent of fires are small and/or suppressed quickly,"" Prof David Peterson of the University of Washington, a former senior researcher with the US Forest Service told the BBC. ""The other 2% are very challenging when they get large, and are almost impossible to put out, at least until it rains."" Ms Schori of Cal Fire said that with wind-driven blazes like the Camp Fire, officials often have no choice but to wait for conditions to improve. ""There are never enough firefighters to combat a fire that's moving as fast as this was moving,"" she says. ""You have to deploy your resources on each side [of the fire] and continue to construct lines. And when that wind stops, then you can safely get in front it."" H ow do wildfires start? Officials define wildfires, or wildland fires, as any fire occurring on undeveloped land. Forest fires are uncontrolled wildfires burning in lands covered at least in part by timber or flammable vegetation. In nature, two things can spark wildfires: lava and lightning. According to the National Park Service, 90% of wildfires in the US are caused by humans - whether by unattended campfires, burning debris, cigarettes, or arson. About 2% of California's 2,816 wildfires in 2016 were caused by lightning, according to data from Cal Fire. The majority could be attributed to humans, though only 8% were caused by arson. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cal Fire firefighters have been fighting the Camp Fire for days Why are California fires so devastating? According to Prof Peterson, fires in the region have not necessarily increased in frequency in the last 100 years - but the area affected has. ""The area burned annually has been higher during the past 30 years or so,"" he told the BBC. ""It should be noted that 2% of fires burn 98% of the area."" In California, recent years have seen a combination of extremely high temperatures, strong winds, a long drought, and population growth causing lethal, fast-moving blazes. Last year, the state had over 9,500 wildfires that burned over a million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, and had the highest number of homes and buildings lost in one state. And straying away from natural burning cycles has also contributed to the lethality of recent fires, Prof Peterson says. Keeping fires from starting in Western forests has caused fuel to accumulate ""far beyond"" historical levels. ""Therefore, when fires occur they can burn hotter,"" he says. ""These high-intensity fires can cause rapid and in some cases long-term changes in vegetation, making it more difficult for the ecosystem to recover."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Many Californians have had to abandon vehicles and escape the flames on foot What about climate change? Prof Peterson says there is no hard evidence that climate change has affected US wildfires - yet. ""We expect that there will be significant effects in future decades as the climate continues to warm,"" he told the BBC. A warming climate, Prof Peterson explained, would increase the duration of the fire season, and more droughts would in turn create more wildfire fuel. Globally, the length of the wildfire season has already increased by nearly 19% between 1978 and 2013. ""By around 2050, fires may burn two to three times more area than they have historically."" How do homeowners pay for the damage? According to 2017 data from Verisk Analytics, 4.5 million US homes were in areas of high or extreme wildfire risk - and over 2 million of those homes were in California. Damage caused by wildfires has cost $5.1bn in the last decade, Verisk found. In California, homeowners who do not qualify for private insurance coverage can opt into a statewide pool, called the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plan. FAIR is comprised of all property and casualty insurers in California and is not run by a state agency.",Fires have claimed dozens of lives in California.

Robin Seemangal,"The long-awaited Falcon Heavy rocket roared to life on Wednesday at 12:30 pm Eastern, as SpaceX fired up the 27 Merlin engines that power the triple-booster rocket at Kennedy Space Center. Perched atop what CEO Elon Musk claims will be the most powerful lift vehicle in the world is the billionaire’s Tesla Roadster, which will launch toward a Mars elliptical orbit on the Falcon Heavy’s upcoming maiden flight. The firing lasted a whopping 12 seconds, creating a mountain range of exhaust plumes that surrounded the facility and rattled the space coast with over 5 million pounds of thrust power. A loud rumbling lasted most of the firing, capped by a giant boom. SpaceX rolled out the Falcon Heavy to Launch Complex 39A earlier this month in advance of the test fire, amidst reports that SpaceX’s previous satellite delivery, Zuma, may have not made it to orbit. (The Air Force has since confirmed that the company is not responsible.) The Falcon Heavy remained at 39A over the last two weeks, as SpaceX planned and then pushed back the test, day by day. First, sensors picked up an issue with ground equipment during a dress rehearsal. Then further delays pushed the static fire to January 19, but SpaceX competitor ULA first had to launch a mission for the Air Force from a nearby pad at Cape Canaveral. When that launch was scrubbed, SpaceX was pushed and then delayed again due to the government shutdown. No launch providers can operate at the Cape without personnel and assistance from the Air Force’s 45th Space Wing—who finally returned to work after after President Trump signed a bill on Monday ending the government shutdown. Soon after, sources confirmed that SpaceX would run a full wet dress rehearsal on Wednesday at pad 39A followed by a static fire of the Falcon Heavy. Launch Complex 39A has a legacy of hosting the world’s most powerful rockets—at least the most powerful of their eras. The Saturn V was launched from the pad with the crew of Apollo 11 and later, would host flights of the Space Shuttle program. But because previous vehicles were primarily test-fired elsewhere, Cape Canaveral has never seen a hold-down fire as powerful as the one conducted with Falcon Heavy. The engine test was contained to pad 39A’s flame trench, built to withstand the acoustics, heat, and vibration produced by the rocket. (SpaceX compared the Falcon Heavy’s power to that of 18 Boeing 747s taking off at the same time.) Musk claims that the world’s next-most powerful rocket, the United Launch Alliance Delta-4 Heavy, is dwarfed by the Falcon Heavy’s capability by a “factor of two,” and SpaceX advertises as much on their website. According to ULA, the Delta-4 Heavy can generate up to 2.13 million pounds of thrust at liftoff. Musk has been publicizing the Falcon Heavy since 2011, when he unveiled plans for the rocket at a press conference in Washington, DC, floating the idea that SpaceX could launch as soon as 2013. But development delays, a failure of the Falcon 9 during a NASA launch in 2015, and the disaster at Pad 40 in September 2016 set the company’s plans back. After leasing what Musk calls the “Times Square” of launch pads, SpaceX built a large hangar at the base of Launch Complex 39A to house its boosters and began manufacturing a new strongback—the device that transports, erects, and launches rockets—that could manage the 230-foot-tall Falcon Heavy. The facility also required upgrades to electrical systems and the water-based sound suppression system to accommodate the enormous vibration created by a heavy-lift vehicle. Last summer, at the ISS R&amp;D conference in Washington, Musk attempted to manage expectations for the Falcon Heavy’s maiden flight, which is planned before the end of the month. Simply not destroying Pad 39A would be a “win” for SpaceX, he said, let alone making it to orbit. Even just firing the Falcon Heavy’s 27 engines was going to be complex despite its makeup of proven hardware. “It actually ended up being way harder to do Falcon Heavy than we thought,” Musk said. “At first it sounds real easy. You just stick two first stages on as strap-on boosters. How hard can that be? But then everything changes.” The Falcon Heavy demo vehicle is comprised of a brand-new central core booster and two previously flown Falcon 9 boosters. About eight minutes after the rocket’s anticipated liftoff from pad 39A, if all goes according to plan, SpaceX hopes to fly back the core booster to Of Course I Still Love You, a robotic landing ship parked in the Atlantic ocean. The two side boosters will be flown back almost simultaneously to Cape Canaveral for touchdowns at Landing Zone 1 and the newly completed Landing Zone 2. The event will be a reminder of the Space Shuttle era when loud back-to-back sonic booms jolted Cape Canaveral during both launch and landing. Following what SpaceX hopes will be a successful demonstration of the Falcon Heavy, the company has four listed missions flying atop the rocket on its manifest. Three are relatively routine satellite deliveries that could have been launched on the ESA’s Ariane-5 and the ULA Delta Heavy. And one the Air Force notably decided to take a risk on by purchasing a still-untested Falcon Heavy for their STP-2 satellite bundle launch. The Planetary Society, founded by Carl Sagan and now headed by Bill Nye, will fly its Lightsail 2 spacecraft as a secondary payload on the Air Force’s mission. How will a Falcon Heavy mission differ from one flown on a Falcon 9? Far heavier payloads going to geostationary orbit––over 22,000 miles above Earth’s surface—and beyond. The Falcon Heavy can lift 50,000 pounds to that destination, 37,000 to Mars, and a little under 8,000 to Pluto according to SpaceX. “While Falcon 9 can accomplish the vast majority of space industry missions, Falcon Heavy will round out all the possibilities for launching spacecraft into LEO, GTO, and beyond—including planetary exploration like Europa or Mars,” explains Phil Larson, a former White House and SpaceX communications official. “It will give NASA and the Pentagon more options for accomplishing their missions for less, and will open up the possibilities for missions that previously were thought unachievable.” That is, if it can launch at all.",Elon Musk’s personal Tesla Roadster was perched on top the triple-booster rocket as its 27 Merlin engines roared to life.,2018-01-24T18:02:14Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",SpaceX Test Fires Its Falcon Heavy Rocket for the First Time,https://www.wired.com/story/spacex-test-fires-its-falcon-heavy-rocket-for-the-first-time/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a4fde6644fdf947740157ae/191:100/pass/SpaceXFalconHeavy-FeatureImage.jpg,wired,Wired,fires,0
RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA,"Photo With fires raging out of control and extremely high winds forecast, California officials on Wednesday night sent out an alert to seven counties and at least eight million cellphones. Credit Kyle Grillot/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images For the latest news on the wildfires, read our Thursday live updates here. From the desert along the Mexican border to the central California coast, a distance of more than 300 miles, cellphones squawked and shook all at once on Wednesday night, and displayed a simple, serious message. “Strong winds overnight creating extreme fire danger,” it said. “Stay alert. Listen to authorities.” The alert went to most smartphones across seven counties that are home to more than 22 million people — by far California’s largest use of a disaster warning system created by Congress and activated in 2012. “It is, for us, an unprecedented move,” said Kelly B. Huston, the deputy director of the state Office of Emergency Services. The same alert system was not used in October, when fires swept through Napa and Sonoma Counties near San Francisco, destroying thousands of homes and killing dozens of people. Many survivors of those fires complained that they had little or no warning of the disaster. That experience was uppermost in the minds of state officials who decided to send the message at 8 p.m. Pacific time on Wednesday, Mr. Huston said, though he would not second-guess the decisions made two months earlier. Photo Smoke from the wine country fires hung in the air over Sonoma, Calif., in October. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times “We looked at the conditions that were present” in Southern California, he said, “and saw that they were eerily similar to the conditions just before the fires really blew up in Sonoma County. We had extraordinarily high winds, we had fire, and it was nighttime.” For generations, emergency alerts have been sent over television and radio broadcasts, but anyone who was not watching or listening at that time was left out. Many cities and counties now have systems that can ring every landline telephone with a recorded message, but people who are away from the phone may not hear the message right away, and landline use is declining. Local governments also send alerts through text messages or email — and they have made aggressive use of the systems during this year’s fire season — but they are sent only to people who sign up for the notices. The kind of warning that California officials sent on Wednesday, called a wireless emergency alert, is like a text message but uses a different system. The alert makes the phone vibrate with much more force than it ordinarily would, and makes it squawk loudly, alerting the user that the message is no ordinary one. All smartphones are automatically set by default to receive the messages, which are limited to 90 characters, though a user can alter the phone’s settings to turn them off. The alerts are most commonly used to send Amber Alerts about child abductions, but they are also sent to warn of disasters. Usually, the emergency alerts are sent by counties or cities, and Ventura County used the system this week before the state did. But the Office of Emergency Services, in consultation with Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency, and the National Weather Service, decided that with fires raging out of control and extremely high winds forecast, a consistent message was needed across a much wider region. The alert went to smartphones in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties. Mr. Huston estimated that it was received on at least eight million phones. “I don’t think it’s possible to over-alert people,” under such serious conditions, he said. “It’s really simply ringing the bell to get people’s attention.” Continue reading the main story","With fires raging out of control and extremely high winds forecast, California officials on Wednesday night sent out an alert to seven counties and at least eight million cellphones.",2017-12-07T22:16:33Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Fire Alert Sent to Millions of Cellphones Was California’s Largest Warning Yet,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/us/cellphone-alerts-california-fires.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/08/us/08ALERTS/08ALERTS-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fires,0
MICHAEL D. SHEAR and SYDNEY EMBER,"With his immigration proposals, Mr. Castro, who has also served as mayor of San Antonio, is trying to position himself in the race for his partys nomination as the candidate who can best combat Mr. Trumps contentious border policies.
Supporters of Mr. Castro say his background, including his deep ties to this border state his mother, Rosie Castro, is a civil rights activist who was among the leaders of the La Raza Unida political party position him to address immigration issues. Some Democratic strategists also view his presence in the race, along with that of the former Texas congressman Beto ORourke, as instrumental not just in pushing immigration to the fore but also in mobilizing Latino voters in Texas and elsewhere.
Texas is a Latino state, and we have two Texans on the ballot who are going to be turning out and galvanizing people from Texas, said Mayra Macias, vice president of the Latino Victory Project. But its also helping galvanize people, Latinos in particular, across the country because they are seeing these candidates talk about issues that affect us.
The dual candidacies of Mr. Castro and Mr. ORourke are almost certain to place Texas squarely at the center of the increasingly heated immigration debate. But if immigration is at once a key campaign issue in Texas, and other states including California and Arizona, Republicans are betting that Mr. Trumps anti-immigrant message will also resonate far from the southern border.
It was only two months ago that Mr. ORourke provided his own counterpoint to Mr. Trumps border exhortations, with a rally in the border city of El Paso that coincided with one held by the president. We are not safe because of walls but in spite of walls, Mr. ORourke told supporters even as Mr. Trump was pressing to finish the wall.","President Trump believes that no issue better fires up his core supporters, meaning that immigration is certain to be at the center of the president’s case for a second term.",2019-04-10T13:46:47Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Trump Returns to Texas to Hone 2020 Immigration Message,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/us/politics/trump-texas-crosby.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/10/us/10DC-trump/10DC-trump-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fires,0

Jack Stewart,"The largest and most destructive fire burning in California continues to grow, consuming dry brush as it races not just through but across the canyons north of Los Angeles. Strong winds and dry conditions mean flames can leap large distances, prompting thousands to evacuate their homes. The Thomas Fire has now spread from Ventura County into Santa Barbara County, burning up 230,000 acres—an area larger than New York City and Boston combined. The out of control blaze is on track to become one of the largest in California history. So firefighters are using the largest tools they have to tackle it, including one that’s more than 200 feet long, and does its work from just 200 feet above the ground. “We avoid flying through smoke at all costs, but you can smell the fire 200 miles out, even at 20,000 feet,” says Marcos Valdez, one of the pilots of the Global Supertanker, a Boeing 747 modified to fight the fiercest of fires. The jumbo jet can drop 19,200 gallons of fire retardant liquid per trip, nearly double the capacity of the next largest air tanker, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10. Fully stocked, the plane weighs in at 660,000 pounds, comfortably under its 870,000-pound max takeoff weight. Step inside (which you can do in the interactive 3-D model below) and you’ll see that the upper floor looks pretty normal, with the cockpit and a few seats. Head down the stairs to the main floor, though, and you’ll see the key changes its owner, Global Supertanker LLC, made when it converted the Japan Airlines passenger plane to a firefighter in 2016: In what looks like the interior of a submarine, you’ll find eight cylindrical white tanks in two rows. Holding the fire suppressant liquid in separate tanks means the 747, aka The Spirit of John Muir, can make up to eight segmented drops on multiple small fires, or put down a solid two miles of fire line, to try to protect property or contain a fire. The liquid drops through a big hose, through a series of manhole-cover-sized circular nozzles under the plane, near the back. (If you use the “Dollhouse” view on the 3-D model, you can see some of that detail on the very lower deck.) The plane is based in Colorado Springs, but its owner contracts it out to fire agencies in need. This week it’s flying out of Sacramento, in the northern part of the state. That’s because it can carry so much flame retardant that picking it up in Southern California wouldn’t leave enough for the smaller aerial firefighters. Plus, with a 600-mph cruise speed, it can reach the perimeter of the Thomas fire in just 38 minutes. The 747 and other fixed wing aircraft sat out the early days of the fight against these fires, because high wind speeds would have blown their liquid retardant unpredictably off course. Though the pink stuff won’t damage people or property ( good news for this guy ), pilots make an effort to avoid dumping it on firefighters on the ground. The 747 can actually lay such a long line of retardant that it can be used to draw a line to safety for people trapped in a “burn-over” situation, where flames threaten to engulf them. When the Supertanker reaches a fire, it doesn’t just drop down and fire away. The whole operation is a carefully orchestrated affair. Valdez, the pilot, starts by flying at 1,000 feet up, watching a “show me” flight by a lead plane, usually a Rockwell OV-10 Bronco or Beechcraft King Air. That has likely been in the air for hours, and directs each tanker aircraft exactly where to make its drops, pointing out hazards like power lines or tall rocks over the radio. “They’re using signals like ‘Start at this tree that’s split,’ ‘Fly on the right flank of the fire,’ and ‘I want to you stop at this rock that looks like a bear,’” Valdez says. Then Valdez pushes the yoke forward until he and his crew are flying 200 to 300 feet above the ground—in a jet whose wingspan is just over 200 feet. Valdez plays down the terror, comparing it to driving next to a concrete barrier down the center of a highway. You know it’s there, and that one wrong move could kill you, but you just keep your heading and your cool. The whole drop is over in 10 minutes, and then it’s time to head back to Sacramento, making for a two-hour roundtrip. On Friday, the Supertanker performed three drops on the Thomas fire—each gratefully received by the firefighters trying to stop the flames reaching more property, and people.

SCOTT CACCIOLA,"Curling Gold Medal Match: Top Story Lines • Sweden is really good. Niklas Edin, the team’s 32-year-old skip (which is the designation that goes to the player who maps out the team’s strategy and throws the most important shots), led the Swedes to bronze at the 2014 Winter Olympics. But it is gold or bust here in Pyeongchang. In round robin play, Sweden defeated the United States, 10-4. But the Swedes have not been infallible. They lost matches to Switzerland and Norway before advancing to the medal round. • About that remarkable run by the Americans. At one point in robin round play, they were 2-4 and on the brink of elimination. But they won three straight matches, including one against Canada, to slip into the medal round, and they upset the Canadians (again) in Thursday’s semifinal. Afterward, the American curler Matt Hamilton said he would celebrate with a McFlurry. • You may have heard that this has been a semi-disastrous Olympics for the Canadians. Entering the Games here, the Canadian men’s and women’s had never gone without a medal in any single Olympic curling event: 10 for 10, including the last three gold medals in the men’s curling competition. But the rest of the world has been chipping away at Canada’s dominance. The women failed to advance out of pool play, and the men lost to Switzerland on Friday in the match to award the bronze.

Brian Stelter,"He is targeting ABC and its parent company Disney, whose chief executive is Bob Iger. He is expressing resentment that ABC took swift action when Barr attacked former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett, but didn't take equivalent action when other ABC stars assailed Trump. Every case is different, of course. But Trump is tapping into a potent strain of grievance politics. It's the same thing that drives countless segments on his favorite Fox News talk shows: the notion of a double standard that hurts conservatives. So far Disney and Iger have ignored Trump's jabs. Iger's spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. Iger, where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2018 Trump's first comment on Barr came on Wednesday when he noted that Iger called Jarrett about the Barr controversy, but ""never called"" him ""to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC."" Trump stayed on this theme on Thursday morning. ""Iger, where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response,"" Trump tweeted. Then he added: ""How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!"" Let's unpack this. As many commentators observed, Trump turned the debate about Barr and racism into a discussion about how he is treated by the news and entertainment media. Thursday's tweet broadened out to include ""millions of people,"" presumably meaning his supporters who feel offended by anti-Trump rhetoric on television. The White House previously criticized Jemele Hill, a columnist for Disney's ESPN, when Hill called Trump a ""white supremacist"" last year. Press secretary Sarah Sanders even suggested that Hill should be fired. Hill remains at ESPN. Sanders brought up Hill, Joy Behar, Kathy Griffin and Keith Olbermann by name from the White House podium on Wednesday. People say ""the most horrible things about this president -- and nobody addresses it,"" Sanders said. She asked why Iger didn't apologize for criticism of Trump, conservatives and Christians on ABC-owned properties. Trump kept this going in Thursday's tweet. Accusations of media bias are a fallback position for the Trump administration, which demeans the press in unprecedented ways. Trump also brought up Brian Ross, the ABC News correspondent who made a serious reporting error on the day that former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI. Ross was suspended and later reassigned. Trump tweeted: ""He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!"" ABC may not have apologized directly to Trump, but the network did issue a full apology for the faulty reporting. ""We deeply regret and apologize for the serious error we made,"" ABC News said the next day. As for the claim that Ross ""tanked the market,"" the ABC report was cited as a reason for a sudden drop in the Dow that day, but stocks largely recovered by the time the market closed. Trump has repeatedly blamed Ross for the market decline in spite of the quick recovery. Trump's reaction to the Barr episode has renewed conversation about his embrace of victimhood politics. Conservative commentator S.E. Cupp said on HLN Wednesday night, ""Valerie Jarrett is taking the high road with Roseanne. As for the president? He's taking the only road he knows: Victim in Chief."" Liberal columnist Kirsten Powers brought it up on CNN's ""AC360,"" as well. ""That's what he does and that's what a lot of his voters like -- to be in a state of perpetual grievance,"" she said.

JENNIFER STEINHAUER,"It took decades and decades for the U.S. government to acknowledge that Agent Orange created devastating health effects for soldiers, Ms. Klobuchar said.

Lawmakers and some doctors say that the Pentagon has also been doubtful of claims.
It thought it was telling that last hearing, D.O.D. refused to send a representative, said Representative Tulsi Gabbard, Democrat of Hawaii, referring to the Defense Department. She has helped sponsor legislation to evaluate the exposure of service members to toxic chemicals.
There is no question a large number of individuals were exposed to high levels of toxic waste, said David A. Savitz, who served as the chairman of a committee that studied the issue for the veterans department. But when you go to the level of show me the increased risk of the health conditions, thats where the evidence breaks down pretty quickly.
Some doctors and many patients and their families are more certain.
I started seeing young people with similar types of presentations of uncharacteristic malignancies at young ages, said Dr. Warren L. Alexander, an oncologist who has worked extensively with veterans at the William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso. There were about 10 percent of unexplained malignancies, where the patient had no history of drinking or smoking. When you have very aggressive cancers that do not respond to standard therapy, thats what makes you think it was due to exposure.
In 2004, Dr. Robert F. Miller of Vanderbilt University studied soldiers who returned from Iraq with unexplained shortness of breath. He performed surgical biopsies on about 60 veterans lungs, which in most cases revealed evidence of constrictive bronchiolitis, an incurable disease stemming from tiny particles lodged in the airways.
Many believe that the small number of Americans serving in the military less than 1 percent of the population has kept the issue from public view.
The burn pit issue has not gained traction in terms of research money or public policy, said Dr. Anthony M. Szema, an allergist-immunologist and the former chief of allergy medicine at the Veterans Affairs Department who has researched the relationship between particles and respiratory illnesses.

Sadly, none of this is new. In Bangladesh, fire and safety disasters come one after the other.
In 2010, more than 120 people died in a Dhaka fire that started when an electrical transformer exploded and ignited chemicals that were being illegally stored in shops on the ground floor of a residential building a strikingly similar situation to Wednesday nights.
In the inferno nine years ago, as in the most recent one, fire engines trying to reach the area were slowed by impenetrable traffic.
After the 2010 fire, government officials vowed to take strong action against building violations. Dhaka has clear zoning rules: for instance, it is illegal to store dangerous materials, such as the chemical compounds used to make plastics, in a residential building.
But these rules are often ignored because of lax enforcement or, sometimes, corruption. Analysts said that wealthy business owners routinely paid off government officials or simply lied about where their businesses were really located.","The inferno, which was set off when a car’s gas cylinder exploded, ravaged one of the most historic neighborhoods in Bangladesh, a country with a horrible record of deadly fires.",2019-02-21T16:41:29Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","110 Dead in Bangladesh Fire: ‘This Isn’t About Poverty, It’s About Greed’",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/world/asia/bangladesh-fire.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/22/world/22Bangladesh2/22Bangladesh2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fires,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People across northern California are snapping up masks to try to handle the smoke Northern California's air quality has become the worst in the world, according to monitoring groups, as the state battles devastating fires. Air quality network Purple Air said on Thursday the air is now worse than smoggy cities in India and China. Schools have cancelled classes, flights have been delayed, and internet searches for smoke masks are soaring. At least 63 people have died in the Camp Fire - the state's deadliest and most destructive blaze. The number of missing people has jumped to more than 600, local authorities said, doubling the size of the list in a day. Three more people have also died in the Woolsey Fire, further south. President Donald Trump will travel to California on Saturday to survey the damage and meet those affected. The Camp Fire - which broke out eight days ago - swept through a swathe of the north at high speed, leaving residents little time to escape. How bad is the air? The AirNow website ranks the air around San Francisco and Oakland as ""very unhealthy"", meaning everyone in the area could experience more serious health effects. Around Elk Grove and Sacramento, it is classed as ""hazardous"" - the whole population is likely to be affected, their website states. A San Francisco Chronicle reporter tweeted that breathing in San Francisco was equivalent to smoking nearly a dozen cigarettes. In Paradise, which was destroyed by the wildfire, it is closer to smoking 22 cigarettes. Internet searches for smoke masks have reportedly skyrocketed, while schools and universities have cancelled classes and held recesses for students inside. Flights have also been affected. Health officials warned people to stay indoors rather than risk the smoke. ""Wearing a mask may encourage outdoor activity when staying indoors is the best way to minimize exposure to smoke,"" the Sacramento County Public Health Office said Butte County released advice for residents about how to handle the poor air quality. What's the latest on the firefighting operation? The California Fire Department says it has now contained about 45% of the Camp Fire blaze. Officials say they do not expect to fully contain the blaze - which has razed 145,000 acres (56,600 ha) - until the end of the month. Media caption California wildfires survivor's tearful account of escape with son They are also battling several other fires, including the Morgan Fire in Contra Costa County, near San Francisco, the Woolsey Fire in Ventura County near Los Angeles and the smaller Hill Fire, also in Ventura County. The worst-hit area is the town of Paradise, with officials saying it will need a ""total rebuild"" job that will take several years. Brock Long, administrator of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), said the damage to Paradise was ""one of the worst disasters"" he had ever seen. Military troops are assisting forensics teams and cadaver dogs as they continue to search for human remains. Officials have warned the search operation could take weeks. Why are the fires burning? Officials have not yet confirmed what started any of the blazes, as investigations are continuing. Several people have already filed a lawsuit against a local power company, alleging that the Camp Fire started when a high-voltage transmission line failed. Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn - but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. Low humidity, warm winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. What about climate change? Prof David Peterson of the University of Washington, a former senior researcher with the US Forest Service, told the BBC there is no hard evidence that climate change has affected US wildfires - yet. ""We expect that there will be significant effects in future decades as the climate continues to warm,"" he said. A warming climate, Prof Peterson explained, would increase the duration of the fire season, and more droughts would in turn create more wildfire fuel. Globally, the length of the wildfire season has already increased by nearly 19% between 1978 and 2013. ""By around 2050, fires may burn two to three times more area than they have historically."" As fire seasons worsen worldwide, all the carbon released as smoke into the atmosphere could have a serious impact on climate change, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

JULIE TURKEWITZ,"But the involvement of Mr. Lucas demonstrates how Mr. Trump appears to be mostly bypassing the traditional process of taking clemency recommendations from the Justice Department and is instead blessing the wishes of the well-connected. About 10,000 applications for clemency sit with the Justice Department. While other presidents have also gone ahead of Justice officials to pardon apparent allies, they have often waited until their final days in office to do so. Mr. Trump, by comparison, has issued high-profile pardons early and comparatively often — seemingly unconcerned by the appearance of leaning his ears toward those at the top. Mr. Lucas, 76, founded Protect the Harvest, the activist group, to support ranchers, farmers and animal owners who oppose “radical groups” that seek to “pass laws or enact regulations that would restrict our rights, limit our freedoms, and hinder our access to safe, affordable food.” The way Mr. Duquette tells it, Mr. Lucas got involved with the Hammond case around 2015.

Rhett Jones,"The DOJ and FBI have been in a bit of a cold war with Apple and the tech community ever since the controversy in 2015 over unlocking the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone. This week, the war heated up again with the FBI and Apple exchanging words about encryption, and on Thursday, the Deputy Attorney General of the United States stepped into the fray. The Federal Bureau of Investigation apparently missed a key window in which they could have sought… Read more Read The FBI is currently investigating the circumstances surrounding the shooting of 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. The shooter, Devin Kelley, is dead, so law enforcement has had to work with what evidence he’s left behind. On Tuesday, FBI special agent Christopher Combs gave a press conference in which he lamented the fact that the FBI has, so far, been unable to unlock Kelley’s phone. On Wednesday, Apple let the world know that it may have been able to help, but the FBI waited more than 48 hours to inform Apple or the public that it was trying to unlock an iPhone. At a minimum, Apple said that it could’ve suggested trying the Touch ID feature in that 48 hours, but it’s too late now. That could have been the end of the story. Until today, neither the FBI nor Apple has seemed to want to jump back into the heated debate on encryption that occurred in 2015. People from the FBI and DOJ have continued to make comments that they need a backdoor into encryption, but without a major case like San Bernardino to win over public sentiment, they haven’t made a huge public deal out of it. And Apple has been happy to walk away from that incident without being forced to create future backdoors for the US government. It would appear that Apple’s statement on Wednesday was an effort to nip a new uproar in the bud. But on Thursday, Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein brought the subject up once again. Rosenstein (conveniently) did not mention that Apple publicly shamed the FBI for not even attempting to approach the company for help. At a breakfast for business leaders in Maryland, Rosenstein gave a wide-ranging speech that touched on the importance of law before politics, the increasing problem of cybercrime, and once again, how much he’d love to be able to get into anyone’s phone whenever he has an investigation. Rosenstein is clearly being either willfully ignorant or he’s gassing the public when he makes statements like, “nobody has a legitimate expectation of privacy in that phone,” referring to the shooter’s phone. “The suspect is deceased, and even if he were alive, it would be legal for police and prosecutors to find out what is [on] the phone,” he explained. The FBI, and other government agencies around the world, tend to make their case for a backdoor into encryption based on either the need to protect the public or some sort of fine legal argument about warrants. Rosenstein went with both. “When you shoot dozens of American citizens, we want law enforcement to investigate you,” he told the attendees. “There are things we need to know.” As always in this argument, the issue is that no one’s talking about the privacy of a dead man, or the constitutionality of a search warrant for the phone, or even anyone’s physical safety. Opponents of governmental backdoors are talking about the privacy and safety of everyone who uses technology and the internet. Good encryption means no one can have a backdoor. If there’s a backdoor, someone will end up being able to open it. Rosenstein, in a matter of a few sentences, was able to jump from rattling off dire warnings and statistics about cybercrime to suggesting a great way to make cybercrime a lot worse. Even when Apple said most recently that it “offered assistance and said we would expedite our response to any legal process they send us,” it was only referring to offering training and technical assistance. It wasn’t saying that it could crack the phone’s encryption. Apple’s official position is that it builds products so that the user is the only one with the key. The fact that the FBI was able to pay some hackers $900,000 to unlock the San Bernardino shooter’s phone means that Apple has not done a bulletproof job at building that encryption. But still, as far as we know, the goal is real—to build a phone without backdoors because that’s the safest way to do it. Rosenstein and his colleagues act as if companies like Apple are protecting criminals, and dodging legal warrants. In fact, companies like Apple are protecting Rosenstein and his colleagues, because they most certainly use technology every day. Warrants don’t apply here because the tech is designed so that no one can be ordered to open it up. Before smartphones and laptops existed, FBI agents weren’t demanding that a neurologist autopsy a dead suspects brain to try and find some phone numbers of people they were in contact with. If there was a phone book in the suspect’s house, a warrant allowed them to find it. That hasn’t changed today. Law enforcement needs to start thinking of a locked and encrypted phone as a dead brain. If they can hire some Frankenstein hacker to bring it back to life, fine. But otherwise, just do the police work the old-fashioned way. If the past few days are any indication, this could turn into another prolonged war of words. Rosenstein and the FBI probably see a political opportunity with public and political sentiment turning against the tech world. Tech needs to do a lot of things better, but one of those things is making encryption more impervious to the FBI.

JONAH ENGEL BROMWICH,"Photo Kevin Davis, left, and Mayor Catherine Pugh last year. Credit Patrick Semansky/Associated Press The mayor of Baltimore abruptly announced on Friday that she had relieved the city’s police commissioner of duty after a year of unprecedented violence in the city. Mayor Catherine Pugh said that Darryl D. De Sousa, a 30-year veteran of the department who was most recently a deputy police commissioner, would replace Kevin Davis, who became commissioner in 2015. Mr. De Sousa will be Baltimore’s ninth police commissioner since 1994. Baltimore experienced a record murder rate last year and had by far the highest rate of the largest 30 cities in the United States. There have been more than 300 homicides in the city in each of the past three years, including 343 recorded in 2017. By comparison, New York, which has a population more than 10 times that of Baltimore, experienced only 286 murders last year. “The fact is, we are not achieving the pace of progress that our residents have every right to expect,” she said in a statement.

 PM Trudeau (R) appointed John McCallum (L) ambassador to China in 2017
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has fired Canada's ambassador to China, in the wake of controversy over a high-profile extradition case.
Mr Trudeau said in a statement he had asked John McCallum to step down, but did not offer a reason.
Last month, Canada arrested a top official at the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, on a request from the US.
The detention of Meng Wanzhou angered China and soured its relations with both Canada and the US.
In January, a Canadian man was sentenced to death in China, after a court said a jail term of 15 years was too lenient.
Two other Canadians were arrested following the detention of Ms Meng.
Announcing Mr McCallum's departure, Mr Trudeau said: ""Last night I asked for and accepted John McCallum's resignation as Canada's Ambassador to China.""
He said the veteran diplomat had served Canadians honourably and with distinction with many positions in cabinet, and thanked him and his family for their service.",The prime minister's move comes amid tensions with China over the detention of a Huawei executive.,2019-01-26T20:46:06Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Trudeau fires Canadian ambassador to China after controversy,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47015700,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6DA1/production/_105356082_mediaitem105355411.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,fires,1
"JACK NICAS, THOMAS FULLER and TIM ARANGO","The traffic continued as they made their way through Paradise. At times, they stalled in traffic as flames menaced and other motorists panicked and abandoned their vehicles to try to escape on foot. Propane tanks exploding around them added to the atmosphere of doom. It sounded like a war, said Mrs. Selby, 80. It was very scary, very intense. The evacuation was also complicated by the topography of the town. In the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, Paradises main connection to the outside world run along Skyway, a highway that runs along a ridge, making escape even more dangerous. The police chief of Paradise, Eric Reinbold, who lost his home in the blaze, said the terrain and traffic flow played a role in a number of the deaths. Four people were found dead in their cars in a neighborhood of Paradise with steep terrain. The particular area is out on a finger of a ridge, where there is a canyon on both sides, said Chief Reinbold, 35. Its dense brush, dense trees, its one way in, one way out, so its very possible that the fire was just so intense that there was no way of avoiding that when trying to leave. The Butte County Sheriffs Office said Sunday that they had brought in a truck where family members of those missing in the Camp Fire could provide DNA samples to identify the remains of those killed in the blaze. On Sunday, Paradise was ringed with miles of scorched earth. Inside the town were the charred remains of gas stations, hair salons and tattoo parlors.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Australias blistering heat wave began in December and has only intensified since then. So far the country has had record runs of hot days and its hottest night ever recorded. Now, catastrophic bush fires have turned the Tasmanian sky red and conditions are expected to become more calamitous later this week.
The Tasmania Fire Service has been battling dozens of blazes across the state over the weekend and into the start of the week. The largest fire is burning near Lake Echo and nearing 100,000 acres in size. Numerous other fires and challenging conditions have stretched the fire agency thin.
The fire danger rating exceeded forecast conditions today, with some areas reaching severe, the agency wrote in a press release on Monday.
The southern half of the state has been particularly hard-hit where fires have burned parts of Southwest National Park thats listed as a World Heritage Area by UNESCO. Fire have also crept into local towns, and there are unconfirmed reports that structures have been lost to the flames according to the Australian. The fire service said that it has enlisted help from the state of New South Wales, which has sent a 737 air tanker to drop flame retardant on the fires in the Huon Valley.
Flames are within 20 miles of the state capital of Hobart, according to fire service maps, and the fire service is expecting hot, dry conditions over the next two days. The agency announced there would be a complete burn ban for the southern part of the state and a partial ban in the north. It also warned residents to review or create a bush fire survival plan, underscoring how dangerous conditions could become.
Temperatures in Hobart will reach 31 degrees Celsius (88 degrees Fahrenheit) on Tuesday, according to Australias Bureau of Meteorology. Thats more than 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal for this time of year. Nights will be warmer than normal as well, which means fires wont die down as much as they could. 
Those temperatures are fairly mild compared to the suffering in other parts of Australia where triple digit temperatures have been the norm. Tasmania is much milder than the rest of the country, though. Owing to its small size, its climate is heavily moderated by cooler ocean winds. But the anomalous warmth is having the same impact as it would.
Like everywhere else on the planet, climate change is altering the equation and leading to hotter conditions and increasing the odds of more destructive fires. Tasmania saw unprecedented bush fires in 2016 through the same World Heritage Area burning this time around. As temperatures rise even further, previously unburned areas could become more flammable and with that, resources will be stretched ever thinner.","Australia’s blistering heat wave began in December and has only intensified since then.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"The asteroid that hit Earth 65 million years ago didn’t just suck for the big lizards. Shockwaves likely knocked down the trees, fires would have burned up entire forests, and less light would have meant fewer plants. What if you were a bird who lived in those trees! That was your home! New research shows how the strike would have decided which species made it and which species didn’t. Without trees, only ground-dwelling birds would have survived. This surely would have had a profound impact on the kinds of species still around today—a bottleneck in evolution’s history that changed the course of life forever. “The elimination of forests basically left a long-term signature on the subsequent evolutionary history of birds,” study author Daniel J. Field, an evolutionary paleobiologist at the University of Bath, told Gizmodo. “We think that only non-tree dwelling bird species would be able to pass through.” The researchers created their hypothesis by looking at a host of different data points. For example, tree pollen went missing from the fossil record for a thousand years after the asteroid strike. Bird fossils from that time period seem only to consist of ground-dwellers. Put that together, and the story emerges: An asteroid hit Earth and wiped out the trees, meaning an evolutionary dead-end for any bird that couldn’t make do elsewhere. The study was published in Current Biology. You might ask why are there so many tree-dwelling birds today. It seems that once the forests came back, there was a massive diversification of species, and birds would have capitalized on the new niches and colonized them quickly, said Field. Other scientists said this research is an interesting way to tell the evolutionary story following the mass extinction. “This paper presents an intriguing explanation for why only a few lineages of birds survived the mass extinction event and then later diversified tremendously in response to recovering habitats,” Sushma Reddy, assistant professor in biology at Loyola University Chicago, who was not involved with the study, told Gizmodo. “It sets a new hypothesis to be tested as more fossils are discovered.” But absence of evidence isn’t the evidence of absence—just because you don’t find something doesn’t mean it’s not there. There could be more to the story yet to uncover. “For the fossils we know about, it fits the hypothesis laid out here. However, birds are notorious for have a very limited fossil record,” said Reddy. Perhaps there’s more evidence to support the hypothesis in other groups of animals, like mammals. Still, mass extinctions are important pages in the book of Earth’s history. Life, uh, finds a way.

Mark Kaufman,"For the second time in less than eight months, California broke its record for the largest fire in the state's history. Tuesday morning, the Golden State's fire protection agency, Cal Fire, reported that the Mendocino Complex fire had now burned over 290,000 acres — over nine times the size of San Francisco — surpassing the previous record of 281,893 set in December by the destructive Thomas Fire. SEE ALSO: A NASA prototype could save the lives of firefighters as blazes erupt in western U.S. The Mendocino Complex, which is comprised of two massive fires whose edges are as close as three miles apart, is not nearly finished. The larger of the two fires, at some 240,000 acres, is just 20 percent contained. Other major wildfires are also burning across the state, including the 94,000-acre Ferguson Fire which has closed down Yosemite National Park indefinitely, and the 167,000-acre Carr Fire — the twelfth largest in state history — which last week produced a towering fire tornado. Though climate change itself, specifically extreme and recording-breaking heat, doesn't create fires, it enhances them. As fire experts pointed out earlier in the season, hot temperatures and heat waves have parched much of Northern California's vegetation to near-record levels of dryness — turning the land to fire-ready kindling. California's large-scale fires are creating seriously polluted air over vast portions of the West. As climatologist Robert Rohde noted on Twitter Monday, ""the worst particulate air pollution anywhere in the world that we have data is in southern #Oregon due to the smoke from the #wildfires."" This is a growing, and troubling, trend. As air quality continues to improve around most of the U.S., wildfires are tainting the air across a large swathe of the West. The reason is simple. Twice as much U.S. land burns today than in the 1980s, filling the air with more tiny bits of particulate matter. Since 2000, California has seen seven of its top 10 largest-ever recorded fires. What's more, over the same period, the state has experienced eight of its 10 most destructive fires in history. The U.S. Forest Service is in its highest level of fire response, with 29,500 firefighters battling blazes around the nation. Most, however, are combating fires in the super-parched West, where the record-breaking Mendocino Complex promises to spread even more.","For the second time in less than eight months, California broke its record for the largest fire in the state's history.

Mark Kaufman,"Triple-digit temperatures and parched land have left much of California's expansive forests vulnerable to any spark or flame. The Carr Fire, which started on July 23 after a vehicle caught fire, has spread to nearly 100,000 acres as of July 30.

""In California, persistent heat and dryness increased fire danger,"" wrote the U.S. Drought Monitor on July 24, the day after the Carr fire began. In particular, the area around Redding is experiencing conditions worse than ""abnormally dry,"" and is now listed as experiencing ""moderate drought."" Much of the entire heat-stricken Northern Hemisphere has recently experienced record heat waves or above-average summer temperatures. Redding could be experiencing its warmest July on record, according to KRCR News meteorologist Rob Elvington. Redding's scorching 2018 summer isn't an anomaly. Each of the city's last June-July average temperatures for the last five years have been among the five hottest on record, noted Elvington. These conditions have helped further dry out the land and spawn a fire that leapt over the Sacramento River last week. Those conditions also stoked a towering vortex that propelled the Carr Fire's own violent weather system. ""This is a large and dangerous plume dominated fire in which spreading is not driven by the wind, but rather the fire itself,"" the National Weather Service wrote over the weekend. During the day, satellite images have picked up the fire's towering plume, which exploded to over 20,000 feet in around 40 minutes. Here is another radar rendering of the #CarrFire plume during the destructive vortex. The plume undergoes rapid vertical development, growing from 6 to 12 km (19-&gt;39Kft) in 40 min.

Matt Novak,"The Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&amp;E) has preemptively cut off power to roughly 87,000 customers in Northern California to prepare for dangerous fire conditions. The move is unprecedented in the region but the power company is being extra cautious after last years devastating fires. As SF Gate explains, the decision to cut electricity in a dozen counties was made because power lines can become incredibly dangerous during high winds. Downed power lines have been blamed for starting fires in the past. And now that humidity levels are below 20 percent, the dry conditions in the area mean that tonights winds could be catastrophic. The decision was announced late last night on Twitter but many people in the region are unhappy with the fact that they didnt receive more warning. PG&amp;E sent out tweets as early as October 13, but PGECurrents.com, the website with information about how to prepare for a power outage, is currently offline. Nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and the communities we serve. We know how much our customers rely on electric service, and we have made the decision to turn off power as a last resort given the extreme fire danger conditions these communities are experiencing, PG&amp;Es senior vice president of electric operations told the East Bay Times. Wind gusts in Mt. St. Helena have been as fast as 72 mph overnight, but wind gusts in the East Bay have been between 25 and 45mph.

Mike Butcher,"The UK government recently passed the Space Industry Bill, covering the basics like spaceflight licensing, insurance requirements and safety commitments. It didn’t make much of a splash when it was announced, but it’s a huge move for the UK as it laid the regulatory groundwork that will be needed to create an operational spaceport, potentially by 2020. Some £10 million has been earmarked to build the spaceports and complementary projects, and the UK is also set to create the world’s first fully commercial astronaut training ground, with construction expected to start later this year. A new UK spaceport would actually make it the first such port in Europe, since the European Space Agency’s (ESA) is located in the not-very-European-location of French Guiana in South America. The UK is already in a good position. Government figures suggest that a quarter of all telecoms satellites are “substantially built” in the UK. It hopes now to expand that to make the UK a “one-stop shop” for the private space industry. A big component of this will be, as the bill said, the opportunities afforded by “using satellite data and machine learning technology to support the rollout of charging points for electric vehicles,” for example. This is creating a rich new environment for startups, entrepreneurs and, crucially, investors. The cost of building and launching a satellite has fallen from more than $100 million to less than $1 million in recent years. This makes it a new reality for startups and makes the spacetech sector increasingly attractive to venture capital investors. Thus, today, Seraphim Capital today is launching “Space Camp Accelerator”. This is the UK’s first dedicated accelerator programme for startups in the spacetech industry. Space Camp’s aim will be to “help the best spacetech startups secure funding, achieve scale, and foster close working relationships with industry leaders.” It’s being backed by both the UK and European space agencies, as well as by corporate partners including Rolls Royce, alongside Seraphim Space Fund partners including Airbus, Surrey Satellite Technology, SES, and Telespazio. Six startups will be selected to join the programme, with a focus on identifying the best data- and satellite-led businesses that are either addressing the biggest challenges facing corporates in the space industry or creating value for industries on earth, from transportation to agriculture to urban planning. The nine-week programme will run twice annually, with the first cohort beginning on 8 May 2018 and the second following in September. Seraphim Capital manages the £70 million Seraphim Space Fund, which invests exclusively in spacetech. In a statement, Mark Boggett, CEO at Seraphim Capital, said: “Space is a $350 billion industry that underpins many elements of our everyday lives. $2.5 billion was invested in spacetech startups by VCs globally in 2017, but those startups still need greater access to industry-specific advice and support. We’re turning the accelerator concept on its head: investability is a prerequisite for the startups we invite to be part of Space Camp Accelerator, not the endgame of their involvement as it might be for other programmes.” Dentons, the global law firm, will host the programme at its offices in London, and will provide the cohort with facilities around the world as appropriate. James Bruegger, co-founder of Space Camp and partner in the Seraphim Space Fund said: “Space is a multi-billion dollar industry and one of the fastest growing areas of tech investment. The sector’s profile has never been higher, thanks in no small part to Elon Musk reaching for Mars. However, what really impacts those of us here on the ground is the largely hidden way in which data from satellites is really driving the lifeblood of the digital economy. Apps like Uber, Deliveroo, and City Mapper – that many of us rely on in our everyday lives – are all ultimately powered by such data.” The potentially is pretty cool. The next Elon Musk might well build the next billion dollar space-tech startup right in London. The UK is already widely recognised for having one of the most vibrant space-tech ecosystems. The future looks bright for UK spacetech.","The UK government recently passed the Space Industry Bill, covering the basics like spaceflight licensing, insurance requirements and safety commitments.

"Eliott C. McLaughlin, CNN","(CNN) Three Massachusetts cities are nearing a critical first step of recovery -- ensuring homes are safe and have power -- after a deadly series of fires and explosions last week, Gov. Charlie Baker said. Utility workers accessed 8,600 meters, turned them off and cleared each home of gas in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover as of 6:30 a.m. Sunday, the governor said. All homes should have power restored by later in the morning, he said. ""We still have a very long way to go, but we're very happy that people can return to their homes this morning,"" Baker said. At least one person, a teen, was killed and several more were injured when more than 60 suspected gas fires broke out in the three towns north of Boston. Thousands were evacuated, and 18,000 people lost power at one point. Andover Fire Rescue Chief Michael Mansfield likened the scene to ""Armageddon."" Leonel Rondon, 18, was killed after a chimney that had been blown off a home in one of the explosions struck a car in Lawrence, CNN affiliate WHDH reported. He died at a hospital, authorities said. An investigation into what caused the fires and blasts remains underway, but on Saturday, National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt said that a pipeline controller in Columbus, Ohio, noticed a pressure increase in a pipeline in Lawrence. The NTSB, which is investigating because transportation -- in this case, of natural gas -- was involved, will look into system procedures, operations and safety culture at Columbia Gas and its parent company NiSource, as well as construct a timeline of events surrounding the fires. ""We are very interested to understand the operations of Columbia Gas. We will be looking at their record keeping, their procedural compliance, their procedures, their training, the oversight of their contractors,"" Sumwalt said, adding that he expects his agency expects to remain in the area through the week, if not longer. A full report on the exact cause may not be complete for up to two years, he said. There is no evidence that anything nefarious contributed to the fires, Sumwalt said. The next two phases of recovery, Baker said, will be assessing damage to the low-pressure gas system and having technicians inspect each piece of equipment that distributes gas. Police and fire personnel, as well as 120 utility representatives, will be on standby as people return to their homes, the governor said. Residents should contact authorities if they smell gas, or notice fire-related damage or anything odd with their gas appliances, he said. ""It's going to be a complicated process to get you back to normalcy,"" Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera said. Residents, he said, they should make sure to keep lists of any expenses they incurred from their displacement whether it's spoiled groceries and broken appliances or child care and lost wages. Authorities hope to have a plan -- and perhaps hotels -- for the dozen or so families permanently displaced soon, Rivera said. The Red Cross reported Friday that about 400 people were staying in shelters. The remaining displaced residents, which officials say are in the thousands, likely stayed with friends and family, Red Cross spokesman Jeff Hall said. Baker declared a state of emergency Friday and said New England-based Eversource would replace Columbia Gas as the lead utility in the recovery efforts. The governor and Columbia Gas of Massachusetts president Steve Bryant have quibbled over the utility's level of preparedness. CNN's Augusta Anthony, Ray Sanchez, Nicole Chavez and Alison Kosik contributed to this report.","Three Massachusetts cities are nearing a critical first step of recovery -- ensuring homes are safe and have power -- after a deadly series of fires and explosions last week, Gov.

Darrell Etherington,"SpaceX has successfully test fired its Falcon Heavy rocket – but this is just the prelude to the big show. The static test fire performed today is a necessary step prior to an actual test launch, firing up all 27 of the rocket’s big Merlin engines prior to trying to do the same but actually following through with a proper take-off. The test fire, completed at the SpaceX Cape Canaveral launch facility from which Falcon Heavy will make its first voyage, occurred early Wednesday afternoon, and SpaceX signalled following the test that all went well. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk then revealed that because of the good firing of the engines, it’s now on track for launch within the next “week or so.” That’s great news, because the test launch was already postponed from late last year, and then it looked like it might be even more delayed owing to the government shutdown, which affected SpaceX’s ability to launch from Cape Canaveral. The shutdown has been suspended, at least temporarily, and that means it’s now time to get back to launch activities – including the inaugural flight of SpaceX’s really big rocket. With Falcon Heavy, SpaceX hopes to be able to launch heavier payloads, servicing more clients and potentially rolling multiple missions together for more economical operation. Falcon Heavy has nearly three times the load capacity of the Falcon 9, and is a crucial component in SpaceX’s plan to eventually fly crewed operations and make it to Mars.","SpaceX has successfully test fired its Falcon Heavy rocket – but this is just the prelude to the big show.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"• Fire and smoke forced the closing of the 101 freeway — the main coastal route north from Los Angeles — between Ventura and Santa Barbara. In addition to evacuations, officials in Ventura County issued boil-water advisories. • Hundreds of schools were ordered closed for the rest of the week because of the thick blanket of smoke filling the skies. The Los Angeles Unified School District said at least 322 schools, including independent charters, would not hold classes on Thursday. • The National Weather Service, which warned of the risk of “very rapid fire growth,” said winds could diminish Friday into Saturday. Wildfires circled the Los Angeles area and threatened Bel-Air. A blaze erupted in Los Angeles’s Bel-Air neighborhood on Wednesday, near cherished landmarks like U.C.L.A. and the Getty Museum. Flames raced to the edges of the 405 freeway, which carries about 400,000 vehicles a day and is the nation’s busiest highway, prompting lane shutdowns and forcing some commuters to drive through a shower of ash as fires burned along the horizon. By Wednesday evening, the fire in Bel-Air had consumed at least 475 acres and a handful of structures, small figures compared with some of the other blazes. But in such a densely populated area, the prospect of warm, dry Santa Ana winds whipping the flames into other neighborhoods had many residents of Los Angeles’s west side preparing for possible evacuation. Officials ordered 700 homes in Bel-Air evacuated. Forty miles to the northwest, the largest of several fires had consumed 96,000 acres by Thursday morning and at least 150 structures — probably hundreds more, fire officials said — and threatened 15,000 others in the city of Ventura and neighboring communities, and was 5 percent contained. Emergency officials said early Thursday that the blaze, known as the Thomas Fire, “continues to burn actively with extreme rates of spread and long-range spotting when pushed by winds.” Part of the region’s 101 freeway was shut down as the fire reached the highway and edged northwest of Ventura. Other major fires were burning in the northern San Fernando Valley and the rugged region north of Los Angeles. A lack of rain in recent months has raised the danger. Video From the deck on the roof of his home in Ventura, Tom Sheaffer has spent most of the week watching the fire move from Santa Paula all the way west to the ocean. Mr. Sheaffer, who was born and raised in Ventura, said he had never seen a fire as bad as this. “This is a whole different level,” he said on Wednesday. “The fuel around here is mostly grass, but it’s dry grass and it really hasn’t burned for many years. The confluence of the hot, dry winds and that fuel that’s been building for so many years has just created this awful situation.” The strong winds that are driving the fires are a normal feature of late fall and winter in Southern California. What is different this year — and what is making the fires particularly large and destructive — is the amount of bone-dry vegetation that is ready to burn. “What’s unusual is the fact that fuels are so dry,” said Thomas Rolinski, a senior meteorologist with the United States Forest Service. “Normally by this time of year we would have had enough rainfall to where this wouldn’t be an issue.” The situation in Southern California is similar to what occurred in Northern California in October, when high, hot winds fueled fires that killed 40 people and destroyed thousands of homes. But while Northern California has since had a lot of rain that has essentially eliminated the fire threat, the south has remained dry. “We haven’t had any meaningful precipitation since March,” Mr. Rolinski said. Reporting was contributed by Jennifer Medina, Richard Pérez-Peña, Alan Blinder, Mitch Smith, Henry Fountain and Mark Storer.

"JOHN ELIGON, MITCH RABALAIS and WILLIAM WIDMER","Two of the fires took place in Opelousas at Greater Union and Mount Pleasant Baptist and the third was at St. Mary Baptist in Port Barre. Officials reported a fourth, smaller fire that was intentionally set at a predominantly white church in Caddo Parish, about three hours north.
In his State of the State address on Monday, Gov. John Bel Edwards called the fires disturbing. Churches are sacred places, and no one should fear for their safety in their house of worship, he said. 
The blazes have evoked uneasy recollections of racist attacks on black churches across the country. But parishioners and residents said they would also let the investigation unfold before making any judgments about what the fires might say about their community, which is just north of Lafayette.
With a black population nearly 42 percent that is larger than many of the surrounding areas, St. Landry Parish is a place where an eccentric black Republican politician and lawyer has defended Klansmen in court, and where a nondenominational Christian congregation has attracted a diverse crowd and grown so much that it recently broke ground on a new $12 million, 43,000-square-foot building.
We are a very close-knit society here in St. Landry Parish, said Elbert Guillory, 75, a former Republican state senator from Opelousas who defended the Klansmen. There are good relationships within the black community and there are very good relationships interracially. And so youd have to wonder, where does this come from?

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The second heat wave in two weeks in Southern Australia continued to punish the region, with temperatures in Melbourne hitting 109.4 degrees Fahrenheit (42.8C) on Friday afternoon, and the state of Tasmania struggling to deal with 30 uncontained fires, according to the Guardian.
Electrical blackouts lasting over two hours affected some 200,000 people in the state of Victoria, and while temperature changes at roughly 2:00 p.m. local time cooled Melbourne, many areas experienced little relief:
With the last semi-final of the Australian Open scheduled for the evening, Melbourne residents were relieved by a cool change at 2pm that lowered temperatures by 12C within 10 minutes.
The duty forecaster at Victorias bureau of meteorology, Michael Halfpenny, said the cool change had arrived to south-west Victoria early on Friday afternoon and was finally making its way through to the city.
But parts of the state were still sweltering Swan Hill, on the south bank of the Murray River, reached 47C [116.6F] at 3pm, and Kyabram, in the Goulburn River Valley, hit 46.7C [116F].
In East Gippsland near Timbarra, a nearly 10,000-acre (4,000 hectare) fire grew so large on Friday that its 6-mile-plus (10 kilometer) smoke column began generating its own lightning, the Guardian added.
Today is the worst day that weve had for the fire season to date, Tasmania Fire Service chief officer Chris Arnol told the paper.
Earlier this month, Australia experienced the hottest daily low temperature on record when it reached 97F (36C) in New South Wales on Jan. 17. Sweltering conditions throughout the country have persisted for months, with temperatures up to 22 degrees Fahrenheit (12 degrees Celsius) above normal in Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia on Christmas Eve, while unprecedented bush fires in Queensland were reported in November 2018.
According to NPR, Australias State Emergency Service has declared the ongoing elevated temperatures a threat to public safety, while the Twitter feed of Australias Bureau of Meteorology became a stream of all-time-high temperature reports and fire advisories.
In addition to the impact on people, wildlife has not fared wellthe Central Land Council, which represents Aboriginal peoples in the southern half of the Northern Territory, reported finding 90 dead or dying feral horses in the Ltyentye Apurte Community in the Outback, Motherboard wrote. The council was forced to euthanize an additional 50 horses that were suffering, it said, and said that the fate of another 120 animals that were too unwell to be transported had yet to be determined. ABC reported that pastoralists in Western Australias Goldfields area had shot at least 2,500 feral camels, many of which were encroaching on livestock feed and watering ponds.
Extreme temperatures in November 2018 may have killed as much as one-third of the entire Australian population of spectacled flying foxes, while algal blooms in tandem with poor water management decisions have killed over a million fish in the Darling River in New South Wales, according to the Independent. Researcher Elizabeth Hanna with the Australian National Universitys Climate Change Institute told NPR, What we dont see so predominantly is the koala which fall out of the tree one by one by one.
The New Zealand Herald reported on Sunday (local time) that the heatwave was now spreading there, with temperatures predicted to be between 85-95F (30-35C).
Numerousscientificstudies have confirmed that climate change, which is driven by worldwide emissions of greenhouse gas from human activity, is making heat waves more common and more devastating. Australia in particular is baking, and all available evidence indicates that the trend wont be slowing down anytime soon.","The second heat wave in two weeks in Southern Australia continued to punish the region, with temperatures in Melbourne hitting 109.4 degrees Fahrenheit (42.8C) on Friday afternoon, and the state of Tasmania struggling to deal with “30 uncontained fires,” acco…",2019-01-26T22:15:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",Australia Continues to Fry Under Scorching Heat Waves,https://earther.gizmodo.com/australia-continues-to-fry-under-scorching-heat-waves-1832086167,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--gbskPDq6--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/avauv3gppgglqzhrebvx.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,fires,1
Marcus Gilmer,"More harrowing footage of the California wildfires shows just how close the fires in the southern part of the state keep creeping to large urban areas. The new video from ABC7 show the Peak Fire burning right up to the edge of a busy Highway 118 in Ventura County, forcing passing motorists to drive in lanes as far from the highway shoulder as possible while firefighters battled the blaze. If there's any good news here, it's that the Peak Fire, which burned 186 acres, has been 100 percent contained according to California Fire officials. But this footage also shows the horrific reality faced by Californians as they try to maintain normalcy even as these deadly fires continue to encroach upon their daily lives. There's a certain terror in the normalization of an event like a helicopter dropping a load of water on a raging fire while regular rush hour traffic creeps by. It's a grim reality driven home by scenes from all around the state, especially the town of Paradise, California, which has been all but wiped out by the Camp Fire, now the deadliest fire in the state's history. While the Peak Fire may have been contained, Southern California is still being burned by both the Woolsey Fire, which has burned over 96,000 acres, and the Hill Fire, which has burned 4,500 acres.

JENNIFER MEDINA,"LOS ANGELES President Trump plans to travel to California on Saturday, to tour the damage and meet with those affected by the wildfires that have ravaged the state. The visit will come a week after he blamed state officials for the destructive blazes, erroneously attributing the cause of the fires to poor forest management and threatening to withhold financial payments to the state. But he has since praised the states efforts, praising the firefighters incredible courage and promising federal assistance. The president has visited the state just once since he was elected, preferring instead to attack its leaders and policies from a distance. There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor, he wrote on Twitter last weekend, as firefighters were still battling back flames on both ends of the state. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.

Mark Kaufman,"It's the time of year when winds really kick up in California, and firefighters on Tuesday night captured footage of relentless gusts driving a new blaze over the parched terrain. Firefighters in San Bernardino County an arid region east of Los Angeles spent the night combatting the newly-born Sierra Fire amid potent seasonal winds, known as Santa Anas. Though this particular fire ( 147 acres and well-contained), is quite small compared to the expansive Camp and Woolsey fires, it shows how persistent 50 mph gusts can whip fire over the land land that has been parched by a confluence of dry winds and a long, scorching summer. In the video, a bulldozer, which had been clearing vegetation to limit the spread of fire into an adjacent community, can be seen working while the winds blow smoke through the air and stoke brush fires in the background. Santa Ana winds are notorious for stoking fall fires in California. These dry winds, traveling east from the great U.S. deserts, pick up in the fall and eventually peak in December, Sasha Gershunov, a research meteorologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said in an interview. But typically by mid-November and certainly December some rains will wet the dry California vegetation. The winds will always blow, but these days they're increasingly gusting over dried-out terrain. This makes for perfect fire conditions. SEE ALSO: When will this terrible wildfire season in California end? ""Now were in our traditional fire season, but the fuels are untraditionally dry this late into the season,"" said Gershunov. ""This seems to be getting more common as the climate changes,"" he added. Some of the most destructive, deadliest wildfires occur in Southern California, a place not defined by pine forests, but shrubs and grasslands. Here, a confluence of Santa Ana winds, development in fire-prone areas, and climate change have boosted the state's growing wildfire woes. Overall, the amount of land burned in the United States has more than doubled over the last 30 years, and predictably, these fires have been enhanced by a warming globe.","Read more... {""player"":{""description"":null,""image"":""https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xYQczNj5of0ZdTSHBbAfO2mCAsg=/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fvideo_uploaders%2Fdistribution_thumb%2Fimage%2F87017%2Fef559f76-def4-4e94-8c9d-4c9418…",2018-11-14T17:49:40Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}","Watch California's powerful, relentless winds stoke the state's fires",https://mashable.com/article/california-fires-santa-ana-winds-video/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8uY6VnvrslCwLG_cUHFSBXnOvrU=/1200x630/2018%2F11%2F14%2F29%2F0c00b1ed7f4043cfb71bbeddea29e34f.425ed.png,mashable,Mashable,fires,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Jessica Wentz escaped the concrete confines of New York for her childhood home of Santa Rosa, California last year. At the time, the decision seemed like a no brainer, leaving behind a landscape dominated by humans for one where homes mingled with the forest and rolling chaparral hills of Northern California. But the dream of moving home turned into a nightmare on an early October night. Whipped by gusty winds and tinderbox conditions, the Tubbs Fire roared into town, melting cars, consuming homes, and leaving nearly two dozen dead en route to becoming California’s most destructive fire in history. By the time the flames were contained on Halloween, the fire had claimed 5,636 structures, including Wentz’s parent’s home where she had grown up. “I’m definitely reconsidering my whole perspective of where I want to live and how I want to live and how I want to raise a family,” Wentz, a staff attorney at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, told Earther. “It’s hard to explain that, to feel like I can’t return to that place.” Millions of Americans may soon be forced to confront similar feelings. California has been at the epicenter of a fiery crisis over the past year as everything from iconic locales like Wine Country to interstate towns like Redding burn. More generally, across the West towns small and large have been decimated by wildfires in recent years thanks to rising temperatures, more human-sparked fires, and more humans living in harms way. It raises an uncomfortable question that coastal residents, policymakers, and insurance underwriters have been forced to grapple with in recent years: Is it worth it to build (or rebuild) in a landscape primed for explosive fires? The answer—for now—is yes, but that calculus could change as rising temperatures and more frequent droughts conspire to make the forest a riskier place to live. And it’s an open question of who will foot the bill as that risk increases—and what happens when the risk becomes too high. “Increasing wildfire risk is a top concern of many insurers,” Chris Folkman, a senior director at catastrophe modeling firm RMS, told Earther. 2017 was the costliest wildfire season in American history. The National Centers for Environmental Information estimates that were $18.4 billion in wildfire-related damages, including three separate California fires that topped $1 billion. The losses were an eye opener for insurers. Folkman said the previous standard for issuing policies in fire prone areas relied on surcharges in high risk areas based on what insurers viewed as “frequent but manageable outbreaks of claims.” “As we’ve learned from recent events, this approach will no longer cut it,” he said. Indeed, this year has seen fire-lated damages continue to mount, with the Carr Fire currently sitting as the sixth-most destructive fire in California history and the Ranch Fire taking the claim as the largest. Across the West, more than 5.9 million acres have burned for the year-to-date, upwards of a million acres more than than the 10-year average. Rising temperatures are in part responsible for more dramatic wildfire. But humans are making fires worse in other ways as well. The vast majority of fires are started by us, and decades of fire suppression have increased fuel loads for incendiary fires. Perhaps most importantly, there’s more people living at the so-called wildland-urban interface or WUI, than ever before. A paper published earlier this year found that from 1990 to 2010, the WUI grew from 224,325 square miles to nearly 297,300 as 13.4 million new homes were built there. “This area is larger than the state of Wisconsin, and made the WUI the fastest-growing land use type in the conterminous United States,” Miranda Mockrin, a research scientist with the U.S. Forest Service who co-authored the paper, told Earther. All of this means more property and people in harm’s way, upping the risk of catastrophic fires. There are a few ways that risk is currently being mitigated. The most obvious is firefighting to either tamp down fires or control them in ways that can help clear some of that heavy fuel load. But fighting fires is a costly endeavor. Last year, the federal government spent $2 billion fighting wildfires with state agencies chipping in billions more to combat blazes. “A lot of that money is spent on protecting homes,” Judd Boomhower, an economist at the University of California, San Diego studying fires, told Earther. That creates what economists call a moral hazard, essentially encouraging risky behavior. In the case of wildfires, firefighting incentivizes people to either move to fire-prone areas or rebuild after disaster strikes. This means insurance rates don’t reflect the true risks. What’s more, a number of states have something called the FAIR Plan, which offers individuals insurance in areas deemed too disaster prone by private insurers. That includes a number of fire prone states, such as California, New Mexico, and Oregon. Those policies often have high premiums and are only viewed as a last resort. But California law also prohibits insurers from cancelling a homeowner’s policy while they’re rebuilding after a fire or other natural disaster. Moreover, companies have to renew a policy at least once after that, making rebuilding a much more attractive option. “I think we’re on a threshold.” Boomhower said (while stressing he was not advocating for it) that the most market-based solution would be to charge communities a fee for firefighting services. While private wildland firefighting might be a libertarian wet dream, it’s definitely not politically palatable. It’s also unfeasible to let insurers cancel policies in the wake of wildfire damage, since kicking people while they’re down is a surefire way to lose an election. But taking the two most obvious fixes off the table doesn’t mean the problem is totally intractable in the short-term. In her work looking at the wildland-urban interface, Mockrin found some communities were already adapting to our hotter, more flammable present in the wake of fires. Their solutions ran the gauntlet from voluntary programs and education about risks to more stringent building codes. But nearly all the solutions have focused on new builds, leaving older homes facing higher risks. “It’s very rare to see regulations that require retrofitting,” she said. “The only thing I’ve seen for that is if your roof needs to be replaced, it has to be fire resistant.” Folkman said RMS is working on a new wildfire model that will help capture some of the risk in more actionable terms. The idea is that quantifying the biggest risks—say rising temperatures, drier fuels, or housing density—will allow state agencies or even local communities can take more preventative actions that keep houses safer. It could also help insurers set rates that are more in line with the risks while also rewarding good behaviors. That’s something already happening in some places. In Colorado, for example, a number of insurers require some fire mitigation for homeowners to get a policy. Beyond these fixes, there’s even bigger picture stuff, like prescribed burns to reduce fuel loads, fixing the firefighting budget or, you know, reducing carbon emissions so the climate doesn’t get even hotter and more fire-prone. But eventually, the rising tide of risk and repeated losses could be too much, forcing individuals and communities to confront some hard truths. Wentz wasn’t ready to leave California so soon after moving back home. Instead, she settled on buying a place in what she described as “the center of town.” It’s a compromise much like managed retreat somewhat inland from the increasing rising ocean to a place where risk is lower but still present. “Over half the acreage in Lake County has burned over the past five years,” Wentz said. “You’re seeing fires come through multiple times. Once you have two fires in the area over a couple decades, that’s a sign to insurance companies. I think we’re on a threshold.” We could find out what’s on the other side sooner than later, and it’s unlikely to be pretty.","Jessica Wentz escaped the concrete confines of New York for her childhood home of Santa Rosa, California last year.

AJ Dellinger,"Record-setting heat plagued much of southern California Friday, with temperatures touching as high as 117 degrees during the day. The unseasonably hot weather sparked a number of brush fires that swept across hundreds of acres of land and destroyed several homes. The National Weather Service reported that at several locations in California saw new, all-time record-high temperatures. The National Weather Service said the weekend will likely be slightly less intolerably hot for residents of the region, but most of the southern part of the state will remain under an excessive heat warning well into the evening. According to the Los Angeles Times, new record highs were set at the Van Nuys Airport (117 degrees) and Burbank Airport (114), as well as in the cities of Santa Ana (114) and Ramona (115). Daily records were also topped in downtown Los Angeles (95 degrees) and Woodland Hills (115). Coastal cities of Camarillo (92 degrees) and Oxnard (86) also experienced new daily record high temperatures. Those unwieldy conditions weren’t just tough on the citizens of the region, but also for the environment. Per the LA Times, a brush fire broke out in the San Bernardino National Forest that quickly spread and forced residents of the Forest Falls area to flee from their homes. The fire encompassed more than 200 acres and was “out of control” near Interstate 8, burning traffic medians alongside the stretch of road. The roaring fires forced “hundreds” of people from their homes, according to the Los Angeles Times, and at least one dozen buildings were destroyed in its blaze. It is believed that several of those structures were homes, but officials did not have an official tally on what was lost. Firefighters also worked to stomp out several smaller fires that sparked in Angeles National Forest, Montecito Heights, Sylmar, and Pacoima. It seems likely those won’t be the last to occur from the current heat wave. KABC-TV in Los Angeles reported the National Weather Service has issued “red flag” warnings for the Los Angeles County Mountains, Angeles National Forest, Ventura County mountains, and Los Padres National Forest until 6pm local time Saturday. The alerts signify an increased risk of fire danger in the regions, some of which are also under wind advisories until Saturday morning. The heat-induced brush fires are just the latest incidents in California’s seemingly endless state of being on fire. Even before the record-breaking temperatures started bearing down on SoCal, wildfires were doing a number to the northern part of the state. Late last year, raging wildfires wreaked havoc on southern California, forcing the evacuation of more than 230,000 people while destroying hundreds of homes and torching more than 80,000 acres of land in its path. Brush fires in the Los Angeles area two years ago destroyed more than 22,000 acres of land and gave the city sky an apocalyptic look, while sand fires the same year pushed thousands from their homes. If the last few years—and what we know about likely effects of climate change—are any indication, things are likely only going to get worse from here.

Devin Coldewey,"While some spacecraft get the chance to go out in a blaze of glory, others are in it for the long haul – Voyager 1 more so than any other. The mission celebrated its 40th anniversary this year, but it’s not just a lump of metal floating through interstellar space: that baby still runs. Thrusts, rather. Of course, many parts of the Voyager craft still work despite their age — they’ve been sending reliable telemetry back since launch, including the memorable data in 2012 indicating that Voyager 1 had entered interstellar space. But the crafts’ power sources are estimated to run dry around 2025, at which point they will no longer be reachable. In anticipation of that moment, perhaps, a group of engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory have been kicking the tires on Voyager 1. They noticed that the craft’s attitude control thrusters, which it uses to keep itself pointed the right direction, have been falling in efficiency for years. Fortunately, the Voyagers are equipped with backup thrusters included with this eventuality in mind. Only one problem: the last time they were used was 37 years ago, in 1980. To reawaken these dormant thrusters the team had to go back to the original Voyager documentation. “The Voyager flight team dug up decades-old data and examined the software that was coded in an outdated assembler language, to make sure we could safely test the thrusters,” said JPL’s Chris Jones, who led the effort, in a JPL news release. That’s because for all the team now knows, not being the original software engineers, there could be some bug or strange feature in the code that might interrupt normal operations or (heaven forbid). And the thrusters had never been tested for the 10-millisecond “puffs” needed for reorientation. On November 28, the team sent the signal to warm up the thruster and fire off a few puffs. The radio waves traveled for 19 hours and 35 minutes before reaching Voyager 1 13 billion miles away; 19 hours and 35 minutes after that, they got the results of their little experiment. “The mood was one of relief, joy and incredulity after witnessing these well-rested thrusters pick up the baton as if no time had passed at all,” said Todd Barber. The test went so well that not only will Voyager 1 be switching over to the backup thrusters until there’s no longer enough power to keep them warm, but they’re looking into to doing the same thing for its twin, Voyager 2 — after proper testing, of course.","While some spacecraft get the chance to go out in a blaze of glory, others are in it for the long haul – Voyager 1 more so than any other.

Patrick Allan,"There are a lot of gun terms thrown around in the media these days, like “clip,” “casings,” and “semi-automatic.” But if you’re not familiar with firearms, many of these terms might go over your head. This glossary of common gun lingo will help clear things up so you can be an informed part of the conversation. The shooter who recently terrorized the Las Vegas strip, leaving 59 dead and hundreds injured, used … Read more Read Obviously, this is a sensitive subject, especially in light of the many recent tragedies that have occurred. But knowledge on the subject of guns is important—no matter where you stand on the matter—since misinformation does nothing but cause more confusion and frustration for everyone. Real discussion can only occur when we all understand the basic facts. In alphabetical order, these are the gun terms you may not know: ACP : An abbreviation of Automatic Colt Pistol. Designates various John Browning cartridge designs and calibers primarily used in Colt and Fabrique Nationale de Herstal semi-automatic pistols, like.45 ACP,.380 ACP, and.25 ACP. AK-47 : An incredibly popular automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov, and first used in active service back in 1948. They are very reliable and cost very little to make so they’re the gun of choice for many military and revolutionary outfits. As of 2004, “Of the estimated 500 million firearms worldwide, approximately 100 million belong to the Kalashnikov family, three-quarters of which are AK-47s” Ammunition (ammo) : A package of components that includes gunpowder, a primer, and a projectile encased in a casing. Amount of ammunition is measured in rounds, which is the what’s loaded into a gun. Ammunition comes in hundreds of sizes, and must match the firearm in order for it to be used. AR-15 : Stands for ArmaLite Rifle-15, not “assault rifle.” It’s a lightweight semi-automatic rifle that comes in a wide variety of models. They are considered “modern sporting rifles” by some and “assault rifles” by others. Variants of the AR-15 have been used in many high-profile mass shootings in the U.S., including Sandy Hook, Aurora, San Bernardino, Sutherland Springs Church, the Las Vegas srip, the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, and most recently the Waffle House shooting in Nashville, Tennessee. Assault rifle : A technical term for a selective-fire rifle, usually used by a military or police force, which fires reduced-power ammunition from a detachable magazine. It can fire in either semi-automatic or fully automatic modes. Examples include AK-47s and M16s. Assault weapon : A political term, not a technical term, that changes depending on who is using it. Connecticut defines assault weapons as “selective-fire firearms capable of fully automatic, semi-automatic, or burst fire at the options of the user.” Virgina defines it as any weapon with a magazine capacity greater than 20 rounds. The Federal Assault Weapon Ban, which was passed in 1994 but is now expired, had its own complex list of guidelines for defining assault weapons. Automatic : A gun that continuously fires bullets as long as the trigger is pressed or held down and there is still ammunition in the magazine. More commonly known as a “machine gun.” Ballistics : The science and study of cartridge discharge, and the launch, flight, behavior, and effects of projectiles (in this case bullets). Ballistics experts can determine where a bullet was fired, where it went, and what it did. Beretta : An Italian firearm manufacturing company— Fabbrica d’Armi Pietro Beretta. It’s the oldest active manufacturer of firearm components in the world. They make semi-automatic pistols, revolvers, shotguns, rifles, submachine guns, machine pistols, and more. Blank : A round of ammunition loaded with black powder but no bullet. Commonly used in film, TV, theatre, military exercises, and for starting races. Bolt action : A type of rifle that fires one round at a time. Once a round is fired, the user must manually pull back a metal, cylindrical mechanism called the bolt to unload the empty shell and load another round into the chamber. Buckshot : Shotgun ammunition that contains medium or large-sized pellets (.24” in diameter or greater) that fire out of a shotgun shell all at once. Used for self-defense and hunting large game. Bullet : The projectile in a cartridge or round of ammunition. When the primer is struck, the gunpowder is ignited, and the bullet is propelled down the gun’s barrel and toward its target. Casings : The containing unit of a cartridge or round. It holds the gunpowder, the projectile(s), and has a built in primer (for igniting the gunpowder). Usually made of metal for rifles and handguns, plastic for shotguns. Sometimes called a “shell.” Caliber : The diameter of a gun’s bore (the inner diameter of the barrel) measured as fractions of an inch. It also determines the size of ammunition that can be fired by the gun. For example, “.22 cal” or “.45 caliber.” Caliber can also be measured in millimetres, like “9 mm,” but there is no decimal point and the word caliber is dropped. Clip : A popular, non-technical term for a magazine (see below). Cock : The action of manually drawing the hammer of a gun back, arming the hammer to be released at the pull of the trigger, which would fire the weapon. Many weapons, especially those with internal hammers, can be cocked automatically by pulling the trigger. This that action and sound you see and hear in movies and TV when a standoff escalates. Double tap : Simply two shots fired in rapid succession, usually without re-aiming the firearm between shots. Firearm : By federal definition, under the 1968 Gun Control Act, it’s a rifle, shotgun, or handgun using gunpowder as a propellant. Air guns and other devices that fire projectiles without combustion are not considered firearms. Flash suppressor : An attachment at the end of a firearm’s barrel that lets hot air and gas escape the barrel. It makes for a smaller flash of light when a round exits the barrel, improving visibility for the shooter. Folding stock : A rifle or shotgun stock that can be doubled over for compact storage. Gauge : This is the bore size (the width inside of the barrel) of a shotgun, similar to the way caliber is for rifles and handguns. It’s based on the number of round lead balls of bore diameter that equals a pound. Glock : A series of popular semi-automatic handguns designed and produced by Austrian company Glock Ges.m.b.H. (or GLOCK). Hair trigger : A trigger that can be pulled (or “breaks”) with little pressure and an extremely light touch. High-capacity magazine : In most jurisdictions, it’s any magazine that holds over 10 rounds. Some high-capacity magazines can hold as many as 100 rounds. Note: many modern semi-automatic pistols have magazines that hold between 15 and 18 rounds; modern semi-automatic rifles come standard with magazines holding between 20 and 30 rounds. Hollow-point : A bullet with a concave nose designed to increase expansion and fragment upon penetration of a solid target. Does more internal harm to the target, but is considered safer for innocent bystanders who might be otherwise struck with a bullet that passes through a target. Magazine : A container that holds cartridges or rounds under spring pressure to be fed into a gun’s chamber. Magazines are usually detachable and refillable. With a semi-automatic or automatic weapon, a full magazine is inserted into the gun, the hammer is cocked, and rounds are automatically loaded into the gun’s chamber from the magazine as it fires. Pistol : A type of handgun that fires bullets. It’s a small, portable, concealable firearm designed to be easily fired from one or two hands. They can be single shot, semi-automatic, or fully automatic in the form of a machine pistol. Glocks, revolvers, snubbies, and Desert Eagles are all pistols. Pistol grip : An extra handle attached to a rifle or shotgun behind the trigger like you’d find on a pistol. Point blank : The distance at which a firearm can be directly aimed at a target without worrying about trajectory. Believed to come from old bowmen terminology in England and France, referring to practice conducted with white bull skull targets. Point blank, or “point blanc,” meant the archer was standing very close to the target and could easily point their bow directly at the white of the bull’s skull. Private party transfer : A second-hand purchase of a firearm involving you exchanging cash for a gun from a private party, no questions asked, like at a gun show. Some states require records to kept for such purchases, but most of them don’t. Recoil : Often referred to as a gun’s “kick,” or the backward force the gun exerts when it’s fired. The heavier the bullet and the faster it leaves the barrel the more recoil there is. Revolver : A handgun or pistol with a multi-chambered cylinder (usually holding six to eight rounds) that rotates with each pull of the trigger. If you’ve ever seen a western, they’re all using revolvers. “Single action” revolvers require you to manually cock the hammer back before firing each round. Rifle : A gun with a long barrel that’s fired from the shoulder and used for precision shooting. The barrel has helical pattern grooves cut into the bore walls (the inside of the barrel), a process known as “rifling.” They come in many varieties, including bolt action, semi-automatic, and automatic. Round : A complete unit of ammunition (also known as a cartridge) that has a casing, a primer, a propellant, and a projectile. Safety : A mechanism on modern firearms that prevents a gun’s trigger from being pulled, thus preventing the gun from being fired. Typically, the safety should always be left on until a user is ready to fire their weapon. Saturday night special : A colloquial term used for any inexpensive handgun, especially a very small pistol that can easily be concealed in your pocket. They’ve also sometimes been called “suicide specials.” Sawed-off shotgun : A shotgun that has had its barrel shortened to less than 18” (often by sawing it off), or a shotgun with an overall length less than 26”. These types of guns are federally restricted. Scope : A magnifying tube attached to the top of a rifle, shotgun, or pistol that allows a shooter to see and aim at distant target more easily. Semi-automatic : A self-loading firearm. It fires one bullet each time the trigger is pulled, but also performs all necessary mechanical steps to prepare another bullet to be fired. Once a magazine is loaded into a semi-automatic gun and the gun is cocked, a user could pull the trigger over and over firing bullets until the magazine was empty. Shells : A popular, slang term for the leftover casing of a round. Also, sometimes used to describe shotgun ammunition. Shotgun : A firearm fires groups of small pellets or very large slugs instead of bullets. They’re designed for shooting fast moving targets, like birds, deer, or rabbits, at close range. Silencer : A slang term for a suppressor. This device is attached to the end of a gun’s barrel and reduces the sound of its discharge, or altering the sound’s characteristics so it’s less intense. They are tightly controlled under federal law. Snubby : Slang for a revolver with a very short barrel. They can be considered to be “Saturday Night Specials” (see above). Stopping power : A term often used to describe an ammunition’s ability to cause a human or animal to be incapacitated when shot with it. It’s an imprecise term, but basically, a cartridge or round with high stopping power is doing more damage per each shot than a round with less stopping power. Self-defense rounds are usually marketed as having high stopping power. Strawman purchase : When you have someone else purchase a gun for you, then they hand the gun over to you for a much lower price or small fee. It’s illegal, but it’s hard to stop in states where Private Party Transfers aren’t regulated. Waiting period : The legally mandated time between purchasing a firearm and receiving the firearm, anywhere from seven to 25 days. It’s designed to give law enforcement officials time to perform a background check on the purchaser, and provides a “cooling off” period to help prevent impulsive acts of violence and suicides.","There are a lot of gun terms thrown around in the media these days, like “clip,” “casings,” and “semi-automatic.” But if you’re not familiar with firearms, many of these terms might go over your head.

KIRK JOHNSON,"But getting to that point is hard. Infant mortality is a problem. Few seeds survive to germinate. Scientists trying to restore land devastated by wildfire say coating the seeds with the protective layer may help them through the vulnerable early days. The thinking is a little like swaddling a baby. The idea is still in testing. Along the way, the fires are also becoming their own brutal testing ground. They have gotten bigger, with more acres burned per fire. Last year came close to the record on that measure. And the fires are often hotter as well, enough in some cases to all but sterilize fragile rangeland soils deep below the surface, making regeneration harder. Why has so much rangeland been burned? It’s partly that this type of land is less treasured than the green, forested places that attract hikers, campers and nature lovers. Grass and sage country is important for ranchers, bird-watchers and for devotees of Edward Abbey and his book “Desert Solitaire.” But when blazes roar through, there are fewer people and buildings that must be defended. With limited budgets, firefighting agencies like the United States Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have to prioritize. Many range fires burn until they go out on their own.","Wildfire has destroyed acres of rangeland. Now scientists are trying to restore it.

Andrew Freedman,"Thursday looks to be a pivotal, frightening day in Southern California's battle against a wildfire siege that began early this week and has since spread out of control. At least three large fires are currently burning in and around Los Angeles, including one — the Thomas Fire — which has already burned at least 90,000 acres near Ventura. Early Thursday morning, authorities closed the 101 Freeway in both directions due to strong winds pushing fire close to the road, cutting off movement between Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. Evacuation orders have gone out for idyllic communities in the Ojai Valley, as well as parts of Santa Barbara, as flames move toward the coast, according to the LA Times. More evacuations are likely on Thursday. SEE ALSO: Wildfires lead to hellish scenes for Los Angeles commuters The weather conditions on Thursday are downright dire, with strong, damaging winds rushing through mountain passes and down hillsides toward the coast. This will create extraordinarily dry air, and make any new fires or ones that are already in progress extremely difficult, if not impossible, to control. California’s fire history is replete with Santa Ana-driven, damaging blazes. However, the combination of factors present on Thursday — powerful winds, preexisting fires, desiccated vegetation, and also population growth — make it stand out as an especially risky day for the state. According to news reports, more than 200,000 people have been evacuated due to the fires, and this number may climb as the winds interact with the fires to push them in new directions at a faster clip. According to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), which forecasts the risk of wildfires based on anticipated weather conditions, fire weather is likely to be ""extremely critical"" — a rare designation reserved for only the most threatening situations — in a swath of Southern California on Thursday. These combustible conditions are going to affect about 9.5 million people, the SPC forecasts. Another 10.7 million people reside in a ""critical"" fire weather zone, including the city of Los Angeles. Elevated fire risk is forecast for Southern California straight through Saturday. ""Large fire spread and extreme fire behavior will occur with any new/ongoing fires,"" the SPC said in a forecast discussion. Average temperatures across California during the summer months (June, July, and August) in 2017. Image: NOAA The high winds may prevent aircraft, including helicopters and heavy water bombers, from doing their work, as well. This further inhibits firefighters' ability to contain these blazes. The National Weather Service is predicting strong winds to last all day on Thursday. The winds have already exceeded hurricane force in some high elevation areas, with gusts above 75 miles per hour. While wildfires are a typical occurrence in Southern California each fall, when the dry, offshore Santa Ana winds blow, the current blazes are occurring later in the year than normal. In addition, conditions in the region are far drier than they normally would be. These fires are an illustration of how short-term weather variability can interact with longer-term climate trends to create a precedent-setting, potentially deadly extreme event. A fire sends embers all over residential neighborhoods north of Ventura, Calif. on Dec. 5, 2017. Image: Marcus Lam/LA Times via Getty Images ""The risk of large wildfires in coastal California typically peaks in Autumn after the long dry summers — typical of California’s Mediterranean climate — increase the flammability of the vegetation that fuels wildfires,"" LeRoy Westerling, a scientist researching climate and wildfire at the University of California at Merced, said in an email. ""The overlap between the dry fuels and these warm dry wind events marks the peak fire risk for the year in coastal California,"" Westerling said. ""Usually, Autumn rains put an end to the fire season by wetting fuels and raising humidity, even though wind events may continue to occur."" The problem is, Westerling noted, it hasn't rained much in Southern California since March. The state also had its hottest summer on record, which dried out the vegetation that grew after one of its wettest winters, forming a perfect weather whiplash combo that is conducive to igniting large fires. ""Southern California has remained unusually dry through November and into December this year, extending the high fire risk fueled by the confluence of dry conditions and Autumn winds that are driving the large fires burning in coastal Southern California,"" Westerling said. While these fires cannot be directly tied to climate change, since they were most likely ignited by downed power lines or arson, they are consistent with what scientists expect to occur more frequently from a warming, drying climate in much of California. The entire American West, in fact, is likely to see — and in many cases has already seen — an increase in the size and frequency of large wildfires. ""Climate change is increasing the variability of precipitation as well as increasing temperatures,"" Westerling said. ""This means that the probability of extremely large wind-driven fires in California occurring later in the year is increasing.""","Thursday looks to be a pivotal, frightening day in Southern California's battle against a wildfire siege that began early this week and has since spread out of control.

COREY KILGANNON,"The extreme temperature swings that many researchers link to climate change are adding to the challenges of winter. 
Officials monitor weather forecasts closely for freeze-thaw cycles, when they put extra repair crews on call.
During a polar vortex in late January, for instance, single-digit temperatures in the city quickly ballooned into the 50s. The thaw, much welcomed by many New Yorkers, worried Tasos Georgelis, deputy commissioner for water and sewer operations at the Department of Environmental Protection, which operates the citys water system.
When you get a freeze and a thaw, the ground around the water mains expands and contracts, and puts external pressure on the pipes, Mr. Georgelis said. 
Along the citys roughly 6,500 miles of water mains, there are typically between 400 and 600 breaks a year, he added. The majority occur in winter, when the cold can make older cast-iron mains brittle.","A Con Edison worker repairing underground cables this month in Flushing, Queens.

"ALAN BLINDER, RICHARD FAUSSET and JOHN ELIGON","Social media posts offered a glimpse of the man they arrested.
Facebook photos of Mr. Matthews show a young man with long hair. In one picture, he is wearing a black sleeveless T-shirt and holding a black electric guitar. He described himself as the lead singer of a black metal band called Vodka Vultures, though there was little online evidence of the bands activity. Still, he wrote several posts that showed his familiarity with the genre.
He wrote favorably of the recent movie Lords of Chaos, a dramatized version of the black metal scene, and apparently referenced Varg Vikernes, perhaps the most notorious figure in the black metal movement, who was found guilty in Norway of killing a heavy metal guitarist and burning three churches.
The path to Mr. Matthews was laid out in an affidavit, with the big break coming Tuesday when an A.T.F. team found a piece of what appeared to be a two-gallon red gas can at Mount Pleasant Baptist Church.
The authorities realized that the same can was for sale at a local Walmart. On Wednesday, an investigator working for the retailer shared with them that a similar can had been purchased late on March 25 less than three hours before the first church fire along with a package of shop towels and a lighter, all paid for with a debit card that authorities said was owned by Mr. Matthews.
Investigators learned, too, that Mr. Matthewss father, Roy Matthews, was a longtime deputy in the St. Landry Parish sheriffs office and the owner of a beige 2002 Ford pickup that appeared to match the truck that consistently appeared around the time of each fire, the affidavit states.
Sheriff Bobby Guidroz of St. Landry Parish said that he had summoned Mr. Matthewss father on Wednesday to tell him that his son was considered a suspect in the fires, which all took place in the middle of the night and did not injure anyone.
He was shocked and hurt, as any father would be, Mr. Guidroz said of the older Mr. Matthews, whom he described as a great deputy and one of his best friends.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Carr Fire is in the record books as one of California’s largest and most destructive fires. But it will also forever live in nightmares for unleashing one of the most terrifying spectacles on Earth in the form of a firenado. On Wednesday, CAL FIRE released three new videos that show the firenado ripping through the Northern California countryside on July 26. The state fire agency also announced that a local fire inspector was killed by the fiery winds. The videos were captured on the ground and from the air by CAL FIRE and local fire departments. They reveal vegetation burning red hot and a tight column of smoke, fire and ash spiraling higher into the sky in what looks like a scene straight out of a horror movie right before a portal to hell opens. But no, this is life on Earth, a reminder that our planet is capable of spinning up terrifying meteorological events all on its own. We know that vegetation burned at incredibly high temperatures, causing air to rise and rotate. And scientists estimate that those firenado winds reached 143 mph, the equivalent of an EF-3 tornado, and spanned an area as wide as three football fields on the ground. But while we know the outlines of what caused it and how serious the damage was, there’s also a ton of open questions about the firenado. That’s because we have precious few examples to compare it to and glean data from. With a paucity of examples and research to draw on, scientists are going to be studying the conditions and aftermath of the Carr Fire firenado for a long time in an attempt to better understand just what happened.

He said building by residents between wooded areas was a ""crime"" that had resulted in blocking escape routes. Mr Kammenos was confronted by angry locals as he visited areas devastated by fires east of Athens this week. At least 81 people died and search teams fear they will find further victims as dozens more are missing. Arriving in the fire zone in the town of Mati on Thursday, Mr Kammenos was surrounded by residents who accused him of abandoning them. ""You left us alone,"" one person told the minister, who was accompanied by the local mayor and the head of the air force. One man told the BBC he had reached the fire station to ask for help, and found firefighters unaware of the blaze. Another resident complained that people had been advised to dive into the sea to escape, when most of the elderly were unable to reach the sea in the first place. Many of the survivors were saved by the sea, but a large number of the victims in Mati were trapped close to a cliff-edge, unable to reach the water.

The Howe Ridge Fire “grew significantly” on Sunday according to a Facebook post by the park, the same day Glacier hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit for the first time in recorded history. The blaze has led the park to close portions of the iconic Going-to-the-Sun Road from Apgar to Logan Pass, and to evacuate Lake McDonald Lodge and Avalanche Creek Campground around 9 p.m. local time on Sunday. The park also evacuated private home inholdings and park ranger housing. According to the Missoulian, the park has requested a structure protection team to hold back the flames. There are at least two other fires currently burning in the park, all likely sparked by lightning. So far, firefighting efforts have consisted of planes dumping water, smokejumpers parachuting in, and attempts to access the fires on foot, but the blazes continue largely uncontained for now. Earther has reached out to Glacier National Park for more information on the size of the fires, firefighting efforts, and how long evacuation orders will remain in place or if they’ll expand. Smoke continues to obscure views and fill the sky with noxious fumes. As ash and other particulate matter falls from the sky, it could also add insult to injury for Glacier’s glaciers. Rising temperatures have caused the glaciers to recede and disappear over the course of the park’s history. The dark particles from wildfire smoke will absorb more sunlight, acting as a dark blanket that could cause the glaciers to melt even faster. Not only has it been hot, it’s been dry. According to the National Weather Service, Missoula—located about 130 miles south of Glacier—has gone 40 days without a lick of measurable rain. If the streak continues for seven, it will set a record for the longest dry stretch. Records go back to 1893 and the current record was set in [checks notes] 2017. Well then. Western Montana is under a number of fire restrictions due to the hot, dry weather. Glacier is under a Stage I ban, which essentially means folks need to be more vigilant about campfires, smoking, fireworks, and off-roading. To the south of Glacier, a Stage II burn ban is in place, which means no fires, fireworks, smoking outdoors, or off-roading. I feel like a broken record saying this, but it bears repeating that we are witnessing a new era of wildfires in the West. Rising temperatures have lengthened wildfire season by drying out fuels and melting out snowpack earlier. The increasing heat also ups the odds of explosive fires like what we’ve seen from California to Montana to British Columbia. And it’s going to get worse.","Weeks after Yosemite Valley closed due to wildfires for the first time in decades, parts of Glacier National Park in Montana have been evacuated thanks to an explosive fire.

Matt Simon,"Actions have consequences, as our parents likely told us as kids. But inaction has consequences, too. Life or death consequences, in the case of Californias new normal of massive, climate-change-driven wildfires.
After a series of devastating fires over the last few years, critics have turned their ire toward PG&amp;E, a utility that brings electricity to 5.4 million households and businesses in Northern California. Its equipment has been blamed for 17 of 21 major fires in 2017 alone. Facing the prospect that itll be officially implicated in last Novembers Camp Fire, which virtually destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 86, the utility has announced that its seeking bankruptcy protection.
What happens to PG&amp;E nextwhether it sells off bits of the business to survive, or the state forces the company to split up, or its turned into a public utilityisnt clear. But safety will haunt the utility no matter what. They have a failed track record, says California State Senator Jerry Hill. They have no safety culture today.
Preventing electrical equipment from sparking fires is not some arcane art. But it does have its complications, and forcing a utility to get its act together might require forceful regulation of the kind typically reserved for a railroad baron.
The biggest threat to the electric grid is wind. In California this becomes particularly problematic in the fall, when seasonal winds tear in from the east. These winds are hot and dry, and desiccate the vegetation, making ignition all but certain.
High wind not only makes the fire spread very fast, but it also knocks all those power lines and knocks all the equipment, which can generate explosions of sparks, whether that's arcing between lines or transformers exploding, says Michael Gollner, a fire protection engineer at the University of Maryland. It's almost always due to either collapse of power utility poles or contact between different lines.
Those complications arent necessarily a problem if the equipment is surrounded by pavement. But miles upon miles of power lines are strung through the wildlands of California, where they are surrounded by unkempt brush.
Even before these seasonal winds arrive, the lines are a major liability. We hit these really, really dry periods throughout the west in the summertime, says fire ecologist Robert Gray. That means a whole lot of air conditioners running. There's more juice running through the line and it sags closer to lower vegetation.
One fix is to bury the lines, but that doesnt work in much of California, where a lot of rock sits at the surface. You could do it, but it would be enormously expensive. Even if lines were buried where theres dirt, digging them up to do repairs is still pricey.
Then why dont utilities just cut power to lines when they know strong winds are coming? They do, actually, but that call is far from simple. You also cut off certain communities from vital services, says Gollner. You can turn off medical equipmentthere's all sorts of things to consider when you make those decisions. They have to weigh both liabilities, which is bizarre.
The best thing to do now, experts say, is to take a page from the era of railroad barons and rein in the utilities. From the 19th century well into the 1920s, America had a serious problem with railway fires. Burning coal or wood threw sparks out of the engine, which easily ignited vegetation around the tracks. It was like dragging a flare across the countryside.
Then regulators said: Yeah, thats going to have to stop. They made the railroads adopt spark arrestors. They required inspections for brakes, says wildfire historian Stephen Pyne. There were laws passed.
Regulators dragged the railroads into court if they didnt comply. A century ago, this was a huge industry, big money, big political clout, says Pyne. That's not unlike the power line situation.
First and foremost: lines simply have to be kept away from brush. That means a whole lot of money spent in fuel management, which California has been historically terrible at. In California, utilities are legally liable for any fire their equipment starts, even if they arent deemed to be negligent, so they better be damn sure that that equipment is clear of brush. That costs money, but its a tiny investment compared to paying for the ravages of wildfiresPG&amp;E says its facing a liability of $30 billion from just two years worth of conflagrations. Hence bankruptcy.
(PG&amp;E declined to comment for this story, pointing instead to a press release that says it will make investments in system safety as it works with regulators, policymakers and other key stakeholders to consider a range of alternatives to provide for the safe delivery of natural gas and electric service for the long-term in an environment that continues to be challenged by climate change.)
Utilities know full well how to manage their risk. Both Pyne and Hill point to San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, which regulators found liable for the Witch Fire of 2007, as a model of current safety practices. For instance, it created a weather center that monitors for fire conditions. They created a new industry standard that has been ignored by PG&amp;E almost in every regard,"" says Hill. ""Ignoring those basic practices I believe resulted in the fires of 2017 and 2018.
In the long term, though, the solution may be for communities to become more independent about their power. Its not hard to foresee a future (however far off) in which electricity is much more decentralized: Instead of power coming from massive plants dotted throughout California, neighborhoods could establish their own hubs, using solar or wind power to charge large batteries throughout town. Outfitting your home with solar panels still aint exactly cheap, sure, but that price will continue to drop as the technology evolves. And decentralization in California very much depends on PG&amp;Es fate: If the state ends up breaking the utility into smaller entities, that might make things easier.
It's burying lines where we can, where it's feasible and appropriate,"" says Gray. ""It's decentralizing the hub so if you do have a power outage it doesn't impact huge areas. But it's also a system that uses a multitude of different sources of energy.
This is scary new era of climate-change-driven wildfires. But by reining in the utilities, just as we reined in the once-almighty railroads, perhaps we can help avoid catastrophes like Paradise.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","California is burning. The state’s wild-ass wildfires are becoming the norm, but this change is something many communities in California can’t afford. These wildfires degrade the air quality—and towns near and far are feeling it. Right now, nearly 20 fires are ablaze in the state. The Mendocino Complex Fire has quickly risen to the state’s second-largest wildfire in modern history. The still-raging Carr Fire, meanwhile, is the state’s sixth most destructive. Hell, even Yosemite National Park is on fire due to the Ferguson Fire, which has been burning for 24 days and counting. “If you are near the fire or downwind of the fire, you will be impacted.” The smoke billowing out of these fires has been on the move, posing health threats to communities that might’ve not been worried about the fires at all. Smoke from the Ferguson Fire has traveled about 100 miles to Reno, Nevada, where air quality advisories are on. The smoke created when flames ignite trees and organic matter is nasty stuff full of particulate matter that can lodge itself in people’s lungs and eventually make its way to the heart. Once in our bodies, it can cause lung disease, lung cancer, and heart disease. And the toxic compounds in these particles are worse than the smoke spewing out of cars, said Greg Huey, the chair of Georgia Tech University’s Earth and Atmospheric Sciences department who’s researched the topic. “Car ignitions have a lot of emissions controls on them,” he told Earther. “Even a coal-fired power plant, which we might normally think of as dirty has quite a bit of emission control compared to wildfires. You have a lot of smoldering fires. You can see a lot of brown and black smoke, so you can see quite a range of products that come out of fires. It’s just a much dirtier combustion.” That smoke moves quickly as winds shift, and the people who lie in its path bear the consequence, said Tom Flannigan, a spokesperson with the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. “Our mountains and our microclimates are such that some areas might not be feeling any of the impact at all while others are disproportionately impacted,” he told Earther, “That is very well due to the topography of our state, but most of what we see is that if you are near the fire or downwind of the fire, you will be impacted.” Much of the air throughout the state, as well as neighboring states like Nevada and Oregon, is currently in the “unhealthy for sensitive groups” range. Where the fires have concentrated, southeast of Sacramento near the Nevada state border, the air quality is straight up unhealthy and even hazardous in some areas—for everyone. “It’s a serious public health concern that we have.” California cities already deal with some of the highest levels of air pollution in the country, especially in the state’s Central Valley, where many of its oil refineries are located. The people poised to suffer the most are the low-income families and communities of color that already deal with poor air quality on the daily due to their vicinity to industry. These fires aren’t helping. “It’s a serious public health concern that we have, so we work to let people know that they should do what they can to limit their exposure,” Flannigan said. A study published last month found that extreme air pollution days have gotten worse in the last 30 years for states from Nevada to Montana, and wildfires are largely to blame. And the situation will continue to get worse in the face of climate change. While California used to have a distinct fire season, today it’s more of a year-round thing, Flannigan said. That’s bad news for human health, Huey at Georgia Tech emphasized. “The more fires you have, the more acreages burned, the more emissions you have,” Huey said. “You’re going to raise the levels [of particulate matter] that people can be exposed to.”","California is burning.

MITCH SMITH,"“We may not be able to feed the cows enough to gain weight,” said Michael Kelsey of the Oklahoma Cattlemen’s Association, which has been taking donations to provide hay and other supplies. “But if we can feed the cows enough to maintain, we’re in good shape. That’s just the reality of the disaster.” Rhett Smith’s ranch on a gravel road outside Taloga, Okla., was directly in the flames’ path. Unlike some of his neighbors, Mr. Smith saved his house and his 100 cows. But his grass was gone. So when two tractor-trailers carrying 64 bales of hay rolled down Mr. Smith’s winding driveway, a sense of relief washed over him. The hay would be enough to feed his cattle and his neighbors’ herds for at least a few weeks. The trucks were driven by Levi Smith and his brother, Blake, who raise cattle about 100 miles from Vici, along the Kansas-Oklahoma border. The brothers had never met Rhett Smith before — and are no relation to him — but they said they empathized with all he was going through. Their family’s land burned last year, the brothers said. And donated hay had gotten their cattle through it. Photo Eddie Fahley tossed a strap to Matt Schaller in Vici, Okla., as they secured a load of hay for a rancher whose land burned. Credit Mitch Smith/The New York Times “They think it can’t get any worse,” Levi Smith said, “but when these loads of hay come in, it gives you hope.” In the sparsely populated counties where cattle roam, people rely on neighbors and take pride in giving help without being asked. Signs around Vici (which is pronounced “Vy-Sigh”) offer free meals, free clothes, free care for orphaned calves. In nearby Lenora, hay bales are stacked along the side of a road for whoever might need them. As eager as people are to assist, they also seem reluctant to receive. “Nobody wants to take any help if they don’t have to,” said Nick Campbell, a town trustee in Vici. “We’re trying to get them to understand that we’re there for them, whatever they need.” The Oklahoma fires, which burned an area about the size of Chicago and New York City put together, made relatively few national headlines. But in agricultural circles — and especially in places that have seen their own fires — word of the destruction spread swiftly. Prairie fires are a fact of life on the Great Plains, but recent years have brought a series of unusually strong, multiday blazes that set records and spread out of control. When Travis Brown lost much of his pasture in Montana’s fires last summer, other ranchers sent hay. Photo Firefighters struggled to fight a fire near Seiling, Okla. Credit Nick Oxford/Reuters So when Mr. Brown heard about the new fires in Oklahoma, he and three other Montana ranchers paid about $940 each to send more than 100 hay bales to Oklahoma. “I remember the feeling of just being overwhelmed after seeing so much of our livelihood burned,” Mr. Brown said. “The smoke hadn’t event cleared away yet, and people are saying, ‘You’re going to be O.K.’” Around Vici and Taloga, where drivers greet passing trucks with a wave and the skyline is dotted with wind turbines and oil pumpjacks, the flames have subsided. But the damage remains. The fire’s timing was especially cruel, coming in the midst of an extreme drought. Dead cows appear along roadsides, hooves pointed to the sky. Driveways lead to piles of rubble. When the wind blows, it smells a bit like a campfire. “You can see across the river and just see the black as far as you can see,” said Lori White, a Putnam, Okla., rancher who lost a calf and about a third of her pasture in the fire, and who has been helping coordinate hay deliveries for ranchers who fared worse. Last weekend, as a much-needed rainstorm tamped down the last of the flames, Matt Schaller delivered hay to ranchers around Vici. Mr. Schaller, who works on a grain farm, had driven more than 1,100 miles from Michigan with a load of donated bales, part of a nonprofit group he helped start last year after making deliveries during the Kansas fires. “It’s just what you do,” Mr. Schaller said.

AJ Dellinger,"Workers at a National Health Service hospital in the United Kingdom were reprimanded for their role in an extremely narrow data breach that exposed the personal information of exactly one person: Ed Sheeran. According to the BBC, two medical staff workers at Ipswich Hospital in Suffolk, England accessed the health records of the famous singer and Game of Thrones background actor for no legitimate reason. The staffers were both given a written warning for the incident, and a member of the administrative staff was fired. Sheeran checked into the hospital on October 16th, 2017 after suffering a bicycle accident that broke his right wrist and left elbow and forced him to cancel a number of his tour dates. During his brief stint at the Ipswich Hospital, he was asked to take pictures and sign autographs for the staff. The BBC filed a Freedom of Information request regarding the visit, at which point it discovered members of the staff were responsible for a data breach. While the hospital did not disclose how exactly the employees accessed Sheeran’s files or what information they gleaned from it, the FOI response noted that the workers “accessed patient information without legitimate or clinical reason.” The snooping incident caused the hospital to launch a review of how it goes about providing care to “high profile” patients, examining “confidentiality, privacy of the patient and their loved ones, and practical considerations.” The hospital first made note of the review in April but did not disclose the data breach at the time. While the Sheeran episode obviously has a very limited scope in who was affected (just Ed, really), it’s still certainly a data breach and it raises a considerable number of questions regarding the safeguards put in place to protect the privacy of patients. ProPublica highlighted these small-scale infractions, which can often lead to much larger violations of privacy for individuals. The publication shared the story of a woman who was outed on social media for testing positive to HPV after an acquaintance working at the hospital she was treated at looked at her records. In another case, a nurse searched medical records of her nephew’s partner and found she had a child that she put up for adoption. That secret was exposed to the rest of the family without consent. These types of breaches may not grab headlines the way massive hacks or ransomware campaigns like the one that hit NHS hospitals in 2017 do, but the small incidents happen with more regularity than you might think. A 2011 survey of healthcare IT managers found that 27 percent of breaches of personal health information were the result of workers improperly accessing the records of friends and relatives. That’s enough to make anyone nervous about their next doctor visit.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","It is becoming increasingly clear the planet is trying to tell us it is sick of our crap and it is done playing. The latest example? A firenado sucking a team of firefighters’ hose into the sky. The surreal footage comes from British Columbia, which you may remember saw day turn into the night due to wildfire smoke the last time we checked in. While we’ve recently a bit preoccupied with Florence’s record-setting rain and the strongest storm on Earth playing Jenga with Hong Kong’s skyscrapers, British Columbia has quietly continued to burn. As of Monday, 3.3 million acres of the province had burned, nearly 10 times higher than the annual average over the past 10 years. This has been British Columbia’s worst wildfire season on record, besting a mark set just last year. Thank you, climate change. While cooler weather has helped tamp down flames, there are still 11 fires of note and dozens of other blazes the provincial fire service is battling. And one of those fires appears to have whipped up a firenado, the most on-brand weather disaster of 2018. Video captured by firefighter M. C. Schidlowsky shows the firenado sucking up 100 feet of hose, the white hose line disappearing into billowing smoke. Schidlowsky said in a caption on the original video that the hose melted as the firenado raged for 45 minutes. It’s unclear which of the 11 fires this is from, but there are a few burning in the vicinity of the Vanderhoof, which is where the original video is tagged. This isn’t the first firenado of 2018. That distinction belongs to a whirling frenzy of flames and wind whipped up by California’s Carr Fire that killed at least one firefighter. Scientists are studying it intensely to understand what led to such a large, powerful firenado to form. The British Columbia firenado doesn’t appear to anywhere near as large as the Carr Fire’s version, but it sure screwed over the crew out there fighting it. In addition to sucking up a crucial tool, the vortex also apparently threw burning logs back as a final eff you to the firefighters who Schidlowsky said worked 7 days straight for 16 hours a day.",It is becoming increasingly clear the planet is trying to tell us it is sick of our crap and it is done playing.

Firefighters are tackling 16 major blazes across the state amid hot weather, strong winds and low humidity. At least seven people have been killed in the Carr fire in the state's north.

It is only 30% contained so far, with authorities warning it could take another week to get the blaze under control. Experts say 2018 has the worst start to the fire season in 10 years - partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation. In December, Governor Jerry Brown said devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change had become ""the new normal"". What is the row with Mr Trump? The US president has criticised Governor Jerry Brown and California's environmental laws on social media in recent days. He tweeted on Monday that the wildfires were being ""magnified &amp; made so much worse"" because of a Californian policy to divert water into the Pacific Ocean. Skip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Governor Jerry Brown must allow the Free Flow of the vast amounts of water coming from the North and foolishly being diverted into the Pacific Ocean.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Amidst a government shutdown and on the heels of a sober report concluding Californias Camp Fire was the worlds costliest disaster last year, President Donald Trump decided it would be a good time to reiterate the lie that poor forest management is to blame for Californias wildfires woes. He also again threatened to cut off FEMA aid to the state.
The news was announced this morning on Trumps communication platform of choice, in a typo-laden tweet that has since been taken down and rewritten with the standard English spelling of forest.
Heres the original:
The confusing wording of the tweet has led some outlets to report that the president already ordered FEMA to cut off funding to the state of California. But as we should all be well aware at this point, Trump has a habit of sounding off about matters of national importance without bothering to inform the parties involved, whether hes firing the secretary of state via Tweet or attempting to kick transgender people out of the military.
FEMA told Earther that a statement was being prepared in response to Trumps supposed order, but a spokesperson declined to provide further details. The spokesperson did say that FEMA has continued to pay for disaster recovery despite the government shutdown. There are no disaster projects on hold presently and we are not aware of any that will have to be put on hold in the near future, FEMA said.
The California Governors Office of Emergency Services and state fire agency CalFire, which coordinate with FEMA on wildfire responses, did not immediately respond to requests for comment regarding Trumps tweet.
Its not the first time Trump has at least threatened to pull federal aid to California as fires in the state spiral out of control. He issued a similar ultimatum back in November as firefighters were in still battling the Camp Fire. Its also hardly the first time Trump has pointed a finger at state environmental policies or forest management as the cause of Californias fire woes. Hes been doing so months, although Trumps fallacious fire culprit seems to have evolved over time from environmentalists who are wasting the rivers by diverting them into the ocean to state forest managers who cant be bothered to rake enough. 
Every version of these wild-ass claims has been thoroughly debunked by everyone from state firefighters who say they have plenty of water to fight the blazes, to Republican voters in Malibu who have correctly observed that better forest management wouldnt have prevented wildfires in their forest-free backyards to the president of Finland who said he never told Trump good forest management is the result of raking.
A charitable read on Trumps thought-salad about forest management is that hes heard about how the antiquated Forest Service practice of stamping out small brush fires has caused fuel loads to increase on forests throughout the West, priming them for larger fires.
But as University of New Mexico fire scientist Matthew Hurteau explained in a Guardian article in November, this is not the predominant cause of the recent fires that have scorched California.
Rather, human development at the wildlife urban interface has upped the number of fires being sparked, whether due to poorly-maintained power lines or an errant cigarette butt, in addition to putting more people and property in harms way. And climate change has primed landscapes to burn more frequently and more intensely, with hot weather and persistent drought turning landscapes into tinderboxes and causing fire season to start earlier in the spring and extend later into the fall.
Whats more, as Axios notes, more than half of Californias forests are federally-managed, and more fires burned on federal land than state land last year.
Hopefully, this latest threat to cut off FEMA aid will turn out to be as empty as the last one. 2018's wildfires took a devastating toll on California, and the state needs all the help it can get. Since President Trump issued disaster declarations for Ventura, Los Angeles, and Butte counties, FEMA has approved nearly 49 million in federal aid, according to a data tracker on the agency website. On Tuesday, newly-elected Governor Newson, along with the governors of Oregon and Washington state sent a letter to the federal government asking for more collaboration on managing the unprecedented fires the West faces.

MICHAEL COOPER and ROBIN POGREBIN,"“We have no higher obligation than to ensure that our dancers and staff have a workplace where they feel respected and valued, and we are committed to providing that environment for all employees of New York City Ballet,” the company’s executive director, Katherine Brown, and the leader of its interim artistic team, Jonathan Stafford, said in a joint statement. “We will not allow the private actions of a few to undermine the hard work and strength of character that is consistently demonstrated by the other members of our community or the excellence for which the company stands,” they said. The allegations were detailed earlier this month in a lawsuit filed by Alexandra Waterbury, 20, who had trained for several years at the School of American Ballet, the academy affiliated with City Ballet. The suit was against Mr. Finlay, whom she had dated, and the ballet company, which she accused of condoning a “fraternity-like atmosphere.” The company denied that it condoned such behavior, noting that it had investigated the allegations as soon as it learned of them this summer and penalized the dancers. In the suit, filed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, Ms. Waterbury accused Mr. Finlay of sending nude photos of her to Mr. Ramasar, and said Mr. Ramasar had sent back an image of a bare-chested “female ballet member.” The suit accused Mr. Catazaro of having exchanged images with Mr. Finlay, but did not specify of what. Mr. Ramasar, a principal since 2009, was one of the company’s leading lights. Born in the Bronx, he established himself as one of City Ballet’s most dynamic, charismatic presences in the core Balanchine repertory and, especially, in new work. This year he appeared as Jigger Craigin in the revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s “Carousel” at the Imperial Theater in what Ben Brantley described in The New York Times as “an electric Broadway debut.” Mr. Catazaro, who was born in Canton, Ohio, became a principal dancer with the company in October. Ms. Waterbury’s suit said that nude photos of other female dancers were also shared, and described lewd and misogynistic language in some of the texts, which she said she discovered on Mr. Finlay’s computer. The suit said that one donor had written to Mr. Finlay about his desire to “violate” dancers at another company, and added, “I bet we could tie some of them up and abuse them like farm animals.” It said Mr. Finlay replied “or like the sluts they are.” Rob Daniels, a spokesman for City Ballet, said the company had identified the donor as a former member of the company’s young patrons circle who had made modest contributions that totaled approximately $12,000 from 2010 to 2016. He said that at the suggestion of some of the dancers in the company, City Ballet would make a donation in that amount to a local charity focused on women’s issues.","Amar Ramasar, one of the company’s stars, and Zachary Catazaro were implicated in a photo-sharing scandal that has roiled the company.",2018-09-15T14:52:23Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",City Ballet Fires Two Male Dancers Named in Photo Sharing Scandal,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/15/arts/dance/city-ballet-fires-two-male-dancers-accused-of-sharing-photos.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/15/arts/00nycb-news1/00nycb-news-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fires,1

FOX 12 Staff,"PORTLAND, OR (KPTV) -  DoubleTree by Hilton employees accused of racially profiling a guest in a Portland hotel lobby were fired Saturday morning.
The hotel posted on their Twitter that the two men involved were fired stating, ""their actions were inconsistent with our standards &amp; values.""
We have terminated the employment of the two men involved in the mistreatment of Mr. Massey. Their actions were inconsistent with our standards &amp; values. We reiterate our sincere apology for what he endured &amp; will work with diversity experts to ensure this never happens again.
— DoubleTree Portland (@doubletreepdx) December 29, 2018
The story generated headlines nationwide after Jermaine Massey posted video of the incident on Instagram.
Watch the full video here.
On Friday, DoubleTree Portland had issued a statement on Facebook and Twitter saying the employees involved in this case have been placed on leave pending an investigation.
The employees involved have since been placed on leave for the duration of this investigation, and we will take the appropriate measures to ensure this does not happen again. (4/4)
— DoubleTree Portland (@doubletreepdx) December 28, 2018
However, Massey issued a statement saying the hotel has been refusing to answer questions he had posed through his attorney.
In the tweet posted Saturday, DoubleTree said they ""will work with diversity experts to ensure this never happens again.""
Masseys attorney Greg Kafoury told FOX 12 Saturday he questions the timing of the hotels decision.
Why did it take the Hilton chain a week to figure out that the conduct violated their values? We are investigating similar reports from other Hilton hotels, Massey said.
Kafoury says a lawsuit will be filed against the hotel within ten days.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"California is entering its sixth day battling dangerous wildfires. They have been driven by extreme weather conditions: low humidity, high winds and parched ground. Authorities issued a purple alert - the highest level warning - amid what it called ""extremely critical fire weather"". Fanned by high winds, six large fires, and other smaller blazes, swept through tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours. About 5,700 firefighters have been battling the fires, with many drafted in from neighbouring states to help. The Thomas fire in Ventura County is the largest, and has destroyed more than 430 buildings. Nearly 200,000 residents were evacuated from their homes, with many forced to flee in the middle of the night as the flames rapidly spread. Three firefighters have been injured and hundreds of buildings destroyed. One death was reported after a 70-year-old woman was found dead in her car on an evacuation route. Satellite imagery shows the vast Thomas Fire, north of Los Angeles, which has spread as far as the Pacific coast. US President Donald Trump issued a state of emergency in response to the fires. There are fears the blaze will hurt California's vast agricultural industry. Much of the state's avocado crop has been destroyed. About 90% of US avocados are grown in California and the industry is worth millions to the economy. The fires have destroyed homes and scorched residential areas. In the wealthy Los Angeles enclave of Bel Air, firefighters were seen removing belongings from luxury homes as the flames spread. Several evacuation orders were lifted on Friday afternoon, leaving residents free to return home and assess the damage. By Saturday, firefighters had made progress in containing the blaze.",Firefighters have started to contain wildfires that have devastated southern parts of the state.,2017-12-09T23:06:11Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",In pictures: Wildfires devastate southern California,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-42296941,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1017A/production/_99141956_hi043428945.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,fires,1

In the ruined town of Paradise, Butte County, forensics teams are continuing to search for human remains. The official death toll is 42, with dozens of people missing.

A county in shock By Dave Lee, BBC News, Paradise, northern California It's five days since the Camp Fire destroyed this town. Power lines are strewn across the streets, cars melted into their driveways. Image copyright AFP Image caption A California license plate in the ashes of Paradise There are clues to the panic that must have swept through what was a charming town. A garden table, with food-serving tongs at the ready - both now fused together by the extreme heat. In nearby Chico, on the site of a fairground, impressive emergency planning is in action: last night's shift of firefighters sleep in a warehouse, while today's get their briefings. But being prepared for the worst doesn't make it any less traumatic. This is a county in shock - at lives, homes and livelihoods lost. And the knowledge that, in California, this will happen again. How great is the challenge in Butte County? Convoys of fire engines could be seen rumbling through the charred ruins of the town on Tuesday, Reuters news agency reports, as crews headed out to fight the deadliest wildfire in the state's history. Workers used chainsaws to clear downed power lines and other obstacles from the streets. At least 6,607 residences have been destroyed in the county along with 1,032 commercial and other structures. ""Thirty percent [containment] is kind of where we're getting close to rounding the corner,"" said Cal Fire spokeswoman Erica Bain. Media caption Paradise resident Sorrell Bobrink describes 'apocalyptic' scenes ""When we're in the 30s and 40s, they're getting a good handle on it. By the end of this week I'd like to see that number up to 40, maybe 45."" Another Cal Fire representative, Scott McLean, said firefighters were now more optimistic because of changing weather conditions. What is being done to find the missing? Officials warn that finding human remains could take weeks. It was expected that 150 search-and-recovery personnel would arrive on Tuesday to reinforce 13 coroner-led recovery teams in the fire zone, Reuters reports. Three portable morgue teams have been requested from the US military along with a ""disaster mortuary"" crew, cadaver dog units to locate human remains and three groups of forensic anthropologists. Many victims in Paradise are believed to have been elderly residents or people with mobility issues who would have found evacuating more difficult. Why are the fires so bad? Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. Media caption With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them The California Public Utilities Commission is investigating what sparked the latest blazes - amid reports electrical companies may have suffered malfunctions near the sources shortly before the fires began. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. The state's 40-million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas. And then there's climate change. Recent years have produced record-breaking temperatures, earlier springs and less reliable rainfall. Citing the role of a warming climate, California Governor Jerry Brown declared: ""This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal."" Have you been affected by the wildfires?

George Dvorsky,"With powerful Santa Ana winds gusting as high as 80 miles per hour, firefighters are bracing themselves for another challenging day in Southern California. Over the course of the week, destructive wildfires in the state have forced the evacuation of more than 230,000 people, destroyed hundreds of homes, and torched over 80,000 acres of land. Since the wildfires began on Monday evening, at least 14 different blazes have swept through a region extending from San Diego to the San Fernando Valley. The fires are being fueled by unusually strong Santa Ana winds and large amounts of dry vegetation—ironically caused by heavy rainfall earlier this year—which are now parched and dried out. The fires have caused severe traffic disruptions, closed schools and museums, and triggered power outages. The largest of the fires, the Thomas Fire, encompasses an area measuring 115,000 acres, and it’s just five percent contained. States of emergency have been declared in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, including the city of LA itself. To date, some 230,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. No deaths have been reported, but several firefighters have sustained injuries. Flying above California aboard the ISS, Russian cosmonaut Sergey Ryazansky took these photos of the wildfires. Earlier this week, California’s Office of Emergency Services sent a broadcast text alert to 12 million people across seven different counties warning of the wildfires. It’s the largest alert the office has ever sent. The state is hoping to avoid a repeat of early October 2017 when wildfires killed 44 people in the state. The text didn’t ask people to evacuate, but instead advised of dangerous conditions. Meteorologists have had to adjust to the severe conditions. A color-coded system used to convey wind strength reached uncharted levels, going past the red “high” level, moving into the purple zone, which indicates “extreme” winds. Incredibly, at 80 mph (130 km/h), the winds reached hurricane-force levels. “The forecast for tomorrow is purple,” said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire protection. “We’ve never used purple before.” These winds are fueling existing fires, turning small brush fires into raging infernos in a matter of minutes, and blowing hot embers into adjoining areas, potentially starting new fires. These high winds are also making it difficult—if not impossible—for firefighters to do their work. On Thursday, the wildfires swept through northern San Diego county, moving toward Oceanside and other coastal communities. The Lilac fire, which extends for 4,100 acres and is zero percent contained, made its way through the Bonsall area, torching areas along State Route 76 corridor and destroying 20 buildings. Earlier this week, 29 horses— including elite thoroughbred race horses worth hundreds of thousands of dollars—were killed when the fire reached the San Luis Rey Training Center. Those rescued endured severe burns, and were treated for smoke inhalation, dehydration, and stress. In Bonsall, around 500 horses had to be rescued when the Lilac Fire began to threaten the region some 45 miles north of San Diego, according to CNN. “There was so much smoke it was difficult to see,” Dan Durhan, a horse trainer, told the Associated Press. “Some of the horses were turned loose so they could be safe. They were scattered around.” Despite these losses, firefighters are making some progress. Of the 14 wildfires, five are now classified as contained (the Oak, Riverdale, Little Mountain, Meyers, and Paper fires). In Bel-Air on Thursday, the 475-acre Skirball Fire failed to get any bigger, largely the result of firefighting crews who worked along its western and northern edges near the 405 freeway and several luxurious, multi-million-dollar homes.

Timothy J. Seppala,"Okay, all set? Good. Nikola alleges (PDF) that Tesla infringes on three of its patents: fuselage design, a wraparound windshield on a semi truck and a mid-entry door. Nikola claims that these design similarities have ""caused confusion"" among customers and stolen away over $2 billion in business, and that if problems arise with Tesla's Semi (like battery fires or glitches with autonomous driving ), they'll be attributed to Nikola. Typical patent troll stuff. Unlike most patent troll cases, this one could have merit. Nikola unveiled its hydrogen-powered semi in December 2016. Elon Musk first showed off the Tesla Semi last December. Once you start looking at the drawings in Nikola's patents, or compare photos of concept vehicles, you'll see that there are some similarities between the trucks. Nikola also alleges that Tesla reached out to poach an employee and doesn't hold any patents for its truck design compared to Nikola's half-dozen. Where's that $2 billion in lost business claim come from? The amount Tesla's stock price jumped after unveiling the Semi and racking up pre-orders from large commercial customers.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","An enormous wildfire in northern California may become the largest on record for the state, less than a year after the Thomas Fire in southern California earned that dubious distinction. It’s the latest reminder that we now live in an era of fast-growing, hard-to-contain megafires. Update 8/7: Well, it happened: The Mendocino Complex fire now stands at 283,800 acres and containment remains low. It’s eclipsed the Thomas Fire and still growing. The Mendocino Complex fire, which includes the Ranch and River fires burning side by side in Lake and Mendocino counties, currently stands at a combined 274,000 acres, placing it just shy of the Thomas Fire as largest wildfire in modern state history. The fires are still growing, and state officials believe the fire complex could climb to the top of the list soon, according to the LA Times. “Look how big it got, just in a matter of days,” Scott McLean, a deputy chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire), told the LA Times. “Look how fast this Mendocino Complex went up in ranking. That doesn’t happen. That just doesn’t happen.” Indeed, the fires exploded into existence just 10 days ago on July 27, and have been consuming land at breakneck speed. The larger of the two—the Ranch Fire—makes the top 10 list in its own right. As of this morning, the blaze had torched 225,000 acres and was just 21 percent contained. The River Fire, meanwhile, is closing in on 50,000 acres and nearly 60 percent containment. Thousands of personnel are working to contain the fires, which together threaten thousands of structures. But with scorching temperatures and little rain on tap for the next few days, they may prove hard to stamp out. Over the weekend, President Donald Trump declared a “major disaster” in California, ordering that federal funds be made available to help the state cope with its destructive blazes and help residents affected by the Carr Fire, another enormous wildfire burning not too far away in Shasta and Trinity counties. Trump also took to Twitter to blame California’s “bad environmental laws” for the situation and to falsely assert that the state is somehow diverting water it could be using to fight fires into the ocean. So, there’s that. The truth is that mega-fires like the Mendocino Complex are increasingly becoming the norm out West thanks to a combination of more humans living at the wildland-urban interface, persistent drought, misguided policies that caused large amounts of vegetation (aka fire fuel) to build up on landscapes, and climate change. “Our contribution to climate warming has effectively made fuels 50% drier and doubled the amount of western forests that have burned since 1984,” Jennifer Balch, a fire ecologist at the University of Colorado Boulder, told Earther via email. John Abatzoglou, a climate scientist at the University of Idaho, noted several climate and weather factors that set the stage for the Mendocino Complex conflagration. There was the very wet winter of 2016-2017, which “helped created a bumper crop of grasses last summer,” as Abatzoglou put it in an email. This year’s fire season has been incredibly dry, with unusually hot nights since July that have inhibited fire-suppression activities. Abatzoglou also pointed to the long-term trend, noting that the dryness of fire fuels and frequency of hot nights have trended upwards in recent years. The rise in extreme fire activity across the West has been on display over and over in recent months, and it’s clear we need to get our shit together. A wildfire fix in the 2018 omnibus spending bill was a step in the right direction, allowing federal agencies to access disaster funds rather than tapping their normal budgets to deal with the biggest blazes. But there’s still plenty more work to do, from allocating additional resources toward removing vegetation on wildfire-prone landscapes to setting and enforcing strong building codes to holding those who start fires accountable. We could also try doing something about climate change.","An enormous wildfire in northern California may become the largest on record for the state, less than a year after the Thomas Fire in southern California earned that dubious distinction.

Crewmembers onboard the International Space Station have taken some particularly arresting images of smoke plumes pouring out of the fires burning more than 100,000 acres of land in Southern California. SEE ALSO: Thursday is one of the most dangerous wildfire days in recent Southern California history ""Thank you to all the first responders, firefighters, and citizens willing to help fight these California wildfires,"" NASA astronaut Randy Bresnik said in a tweet on Thursday.

""Firefighters continue to work aggressively to protect life and property while working on control efforts around the fire perimeter,"" CalFire said in an incident update. The fires are being fed by the desiccated remains of lush vegetation that grew during one of the wettest winters on record in California, only to endure a record warm and dry summer. That, plus the strong Santa Ana winds have combined to create ideal conditions for devastating wildfires. Russian cosmonaut Sergey Ryazanskiy also caught sight of the fires from 250 miles up.

"Paola A. Rosa-Aquino on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The Humboldt marten was once a denizen of vast swaths of old growth forests in Northern California and Southern Oregon. But rampant logging has shrunken its habitat, pushing the objectively adorable little predator into small isolated populations and amplifying other threats, like cannabis growth and wildfires. On Tuesday, conservation groups petitioned Oregon for both state and federal protections for the furry mammals under the Endangered Species Act in the hopes that they’ll have a fighting chance. The roughly 400-strong subspecies has already been flirting with extinction for quite some time. “Small isolated populations are at really high risks of becoming extinct,” Tiarra Curry, senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity, which submitted the petition, told Earther. “To save them, we have to create habitat corridors of appropriate forest habitats to reconnect the population.” The picture is looking pretty dismal: Only four remote populations of the kitten-sized creature remain—two in the state of California and two in Oregon—each pocket with fewer than 100 animals. Currently, neither state has regulations in place to protect it save a trapping ban in California. Today’s remaining Humboldt martens face numerous threats. The cannabis industry has already been known to contribute to deforestation and habitat loss in California. But as the Guardian noted in a recent article, illegal marijuana cultivation also poses a threat to the small weasel-like animals, destroying their homes and introducing rodenticides into forest food webs. Now that the marten is trapped in small patches of habitat, populations are increasingly at risk from wildfires, too. According to Curry, this wouldn’t have been a problem historically. But a a 2017 wildfire tore down dense forests separating the northernmost population in California from the southernmost population in Oregon. Other threats abound in Oregon. The state’s highly localized populations are susceptible to any environmental or man-made threat, including cars speeding down the highway that runs by the coastal dunes where they live. “Anything that affects this little strip of habitat could wipe them out,” Curry said. Incredibly, the Guardian reports it is still legal to trap Humboldt martens in Oregon where the animal’s glossy mink-like pelt sells for about $20 each. This is not the first time conservation groups have pushed for the marten to be granted threatened species protections in Oregon state. A 2010 petition to list the subspecies was denied by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, leading to a lawsuit against the agency in 2015 and an overturning of the decision. While it’s unclear what Oregon will decide this time around, in California, the Humboldt marten’s prospects are looking a bit brighter this week. According to the Guardian, the state has already announced its intention to list the animal as an endangered species. We’re reached out to the California Fish and Game Department for confirmation and will update if we hear back.

RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA,"The new fire ignited near the 405 Freeway in the Bel Air neighborhood, forcing the authorities to close the northbound lanes of the interstate, one of the major links between the bulk of the city and the San Fernando Valley. With Santa Ana winds whipping from the east, the blaze posed a risk of jumping across the highway, where it would threaten the Getty Center museum and the Brentwood neighborhood. To the north, in Ventura County, a fire that broke out on Monday and grew to 50,000 acres on Tuesday continued to burn unabated, and had destroyed at least 150 structures, state officials said — and possibly many more. Evacuation orders covering thousands of people were in effect for parts of the city of Ventura, and Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency. Parts of the 101 Freeway, along with many smaller roads, were closed to traffic. California has seen some of its most destructive fires ever this year. In October, even as more than a dozen fires broke out in the northern part of the state, a separate one quickly grew in the Anaheim Hills, burning through thousands of acres.

Lizzie Plaugic,"With Echo, Canogar explores subtle changes in our world It sometimes seems like technology is at odds with the art world — a tension between brain and heart. But plenty of artists, from Da Vinci to Cory Arcangel, have proved that’s not true, and continue to prove it as technology evolves. In Technographica, we explore how contemporary artists are using technology in unusual and unexpected ways. In his latest exhibition, Echo, Madrid-based artist Daniel Canogar is trying to make a point about how we interact with the world. The project, a series of abstract LED sculptures that react in real time to changes in the world, explores issues like deforestation, climate change, and pollution. The exhibition consists of five sculptures. Each sculpture receives real-time data dedicated to certain environmental topics: air quality data, volcanic activity, wind changes in the city where a sculpture is installed, active fires, and rain data from 192 international cities. The sculptures are made of warped sheets of metal fitted with dozens of magnetic LED tiles that follow certain algorithmic patterns based on the data they receive. Daniel Canogar with ‘Gust,’ the LED lights of which react to wind data collected in a city of choice — in this case New York. “My entire project as an artist is always about the impact that technology has on us,” Canogar told The Verge. “About how we communicate, how we see the world, how we experience ourselves and our bodies and how’s that’s constantly being shifted and modified.” Canogar says he spent two years finding flexible LED tiles that would be able to conform to the warped and twisted sheets of metal. After the tiles were affixed to the metal sculptures, Canogar used an algorithm to pull real-time data from various scientific websites that would determine how each piece would light up and display different patterns. Daniel demonstrates the flexible nature of the magnetic LED light panels that he uses in all the works in ‘Echo.’ These panels are then placed on a skeletal steel structure. In this case the panel is being applied to the Troposphere. Each sculpture has “a personality,” Canogar says. The rain data sculpture, titled Basin, is molded into a concave shape, while the LED lights create blue ripples that are meant to “mimic the aesthetic qualities of a pond.” Ember, the sculpture that reacts to active fires, is shaped like a bonfire. These twisted sheets of metal helps to give the artwork what Canogar calls a “creature-like,” appearance, each piece curved into a pose with exposed data cables hanging down like tails. “I want [viewers] to be almost sensually attracted to the work,” Canogar says. “Then once I have people’s attention, I’m hoping that they’ll think about the content, the data-driven information that’s gathered on the screen.” Diego Mellado works on managing the cables of ‘Basin’ during installation of a show of Echo at bitforms gallery, New York. The data isn’t necessarily meant to change anyone’s minds, or to take a political stance, he says, but rather to encourage viewers to spend some time thinking about what these data sets mean on a global scale. Each sculpture in the series becomes a lifelike representation of our world, and humanity’s effect on it. Canogar said he wanted to see what would happen if we stopped seeing screens as screens, and instead as something more sentient. “Screens have taken on a new presence in our everyday life,” he says. “We tend to think of screens as this framed device, that we watch TV on, or a computer monitor. But it started to occur to me that it would be interesting to think of the screen as a membrane.” Canogar is best known for large-scale public art installations, the largest of which was 2014’s Storming Times Square, a participatory video installation projected onto Times Square billboards. At the time, Canogar said of the piece, “Filming in Times Square has changed the way I think and feel about ‘the crowd.’ I have studied each and every one of the video captures of the participants, over 1,200 of them. They feel like friends and collaborators.” With Echo, “the crowd” becomes a more intangible thing: sometimes responsible for changes in the environment, and sometimes just experiencing it. As for why he called the exhibit Echo, Canogar says it’s about the way the sculptures interact with the environment they’re representing. “I feel like they’re kind of listening to the planet. Of human phenomena but also natural phenomena,” he says. “They’re not really answering back, they’re just listening to the echoes.” ECHO : A SERIES OF FIVE SCULPTURES TROPOSPHERE The LED visuals on Troposphere (above) react in real time to air quality readings in a particular city — in this case, Washington D.C. The more the color orange is displayed, the more polluted the air; the more blue, the less pollution is present. The information is updated every five seconds, drawing data from five different reading stations in the D.C. area. EMBER Ember displays visuals that are created by interpreting data from the number of uncontrolled fires burning around the world — which was approximately 3,500 at the last check, according to Canogar. The more fires burning, the faster the animation moves. BASIN The source of data for Basin is rainfall from 195 capital cities around the globe. Basin reacts to this data by moving slowly when a small amount of rain is falling and speeding up when more rain is recorded. ‘Basin’ in the foreground, ‘Gust’ on the left, and ‘Magma’ on the right. ‘Basin’ hangs in the center of the gallery space. ‘Magma’ is displayed to the left. MAGMA The patterns displayed on Magma are created by drawing data from the volcanic activity of over 600 volcanos from around the world. Volcanic activity is rated between 1 (dormant) to 5 (full eruption). Every time a volcano changes its rating, the lights on the panels change accordingly. GUST The LED lights on the surface of Gust react to wind speed data collected from pre-selected city — in this case, New York.","With Echo, Canogar explores subtle changes in our world",2017-12-09T15:00:02Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Artist Daniel Canogar visualizes real-time environmental shifts with LED sculptures,https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/9/16751832/daniel-canogar-echo-art-exhibit-madrid-environment,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OdrERdtgxcciEFA7TYBPR3VgEuA=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9812567/akrales_170929_1977_0251.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,fires,1
RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.,"President Trump said he believed the nations gun laws had little to do with the shooting in Pittsburgh and suggested that placing armed guards inside the synagogue might have prevented the massacre. While the authorities have not provided other details of Mr. Bowerss rifle, the AR-15 is a civilian version of the militarys M16 and the M4 carbine, the primary combat weapons carried by soldiers and Marines. The difference is that an AR-15 cannot fire in burst mode which discharges three rounds with one trigger pull or in full automatic mode, where the weapon fires until the trigger is released or the ammunition runs out. It fires one bullet at a time. But it is a powerful weapon: light, easy to hold and to fire, with limited recoil, its bullets shooting out of the muzzle more than twice as fast as most handgun rounds. The standard AR-15 magazine holds 30 bullets and can be swapped out quickly, allowing a shooter to fire more than a hundred rounds in minutes. The AR-15 and its variants have become the gun of choice in the deadliest mass shootings in recent years. Congress outlawed the manufacture of assault weapons in 1994, but lawmakers allowed the ban to expire in 2004. The power of the rifle used in Saturdays massacre was chillingly revealed in frantic calls over police radio as the killing unfolded.","AR-15 style rifles on display at a gun shop.

"ALAN BLINDER, RICHARD FAUSSET and JOHN ELIGON","Social media posts offered a glimpse of the man they arrested.
Facebook photos of Mr. Matthews show a young man with long hair. In one picture, he is wearing a black sleeveless T-shirt and holding a black electric guitar. He described himself as the lead singer of a black metal band called Vodka Vultures, though there was little online evidence of the bands activity. Still, he wrote several posts that showed his familiarity with the genre.
He wrote favorably of the recent movie Lords of Chaos, a dramatized version of the black metal scene, and apparently referenced Varg Vikernes, perhaps the most notorious figure in the black metal movement, who was found guilty in Norway of killing a heavy metal guitarist and burning three churches.
The path to Mr. Matthews was laid out in an affidavit, with the big break coming Tuesday when an A.T.F. team found a piece of what appeared to be a two-gallon red gas can at Mount Pleasant Baptist Church.
The authorities realized that the same can was for sale at a local Walmart. On Wednesday, an investigator working for the retailer shared with them that a similar can had been purchased late on March 25 less than three hours before the first church fire along with a package of shop towels and a lighter, all paid for with a debit card that the authorities said was owned by Mr. Matthews.
Investigators learned, too, that Mr. Matthewss father, Roy Matthews, was a longtime deputy in the St. Landry Parish sheriffs office and the owner of a beige 2002 Ford pickup that appeared to match the truck that consistently appeared around the time of each fire, the affidavit states.
Sheriff Bobby Guidroz of St. Landry Parish said that he had summoned Mr. Matthewss father on Wednesday to tell him that his son was considered a suspect in the fires, which all took place in the middle of the night and did not injure anyone.
He was shocked and hurt, as any father would be, Mr. Guidroz said of the older Mr. Matthews, whom he described as a great deputy and one of his best friends. He was in terrible shape.","Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas, La., was one of three historically black churches that were destroyed in St. Landry Parish in recent weeks.",2019-04-12T00:14:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","A Charred Gas Can, a Receipt and an Arrest in Fires of 3 Black Churches",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/us/holden-matthews-black-church-fires.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/us/11church-fires/11church-fires-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fires,1
Andrew Freedman,"The wildfires raging across Southern California have scorched tens of thousands of acres of land, destroyed hundreds of homes, and disrupted countless lives. While the scenes of flames screaming up hillsides, and smoke trailing hundreds of miles out over the Pacific are dramatic, they're not unprecedented. In fact, they're not even that rare. However, they are likely to be more damaging in the future, and more common in certain parts of California and the American West in general, thanks to climate change and other factors. SEE ALSO: California's worst fire season just got even more terrifying Wildfires, particularly during the fall, are endemic to California. In Southern California, the biggest blazes tend to flare up when the dry, warm Santa Ana winds blow, sometimes unceasingly for days on end. This week, for example, the Santa Ana wind event began on Monday, and is not forecast to stop until Friday night. Flames from a wildfire leap above traffic on Highway 101 north of Ventura, Calif., on Dec. 6, 2017. Image: Noah Berger/AP/REX/Shutterstock Much of the time during these events Southern California gets lucky, and there are no major blazes to speak of. It's not one of those years. This year is proving to be California's worst wildfire season on record. In October, more than 40 were killed and at least 10,000 homes lost when fires tore through Sonoma and Napa Counties, devastating the community of Santa Rosa, in particular. Known as ""El Diablo"" winds in this area, the offshore airflow was instrumental in propelling the wildfires faster than people could get out of the way, let alone allow firefighters to squelch the flames. Santa Ana winds result from a particular weather pattern featuring a high pressure area anchored over the Great Basin, and a low pressure area southwest of California, over the Pacific Ocean. The air pressure contrast between these two systems results in a funneling of air from east to west. As the air descends from the higher elevations toward the coast, it warms and dries, leading to extremely low humidity. These background conditions set the scene for a major fire, provided there's a spark. This year, there's been added fire risk from repeated heat waves that have sent temperatures soaring into the triple-digits as late as October, further drying out vegetation that is now serving as fuel for the fires. “It’s the coincidence of an ignition,"" that determines whether a Santa Ana event will lead to major fires, said Jon Keeley, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, in an interview. ""And the two big causes of ignitions during Santa Ana wind events are power lines that blow down from the strong winds and arson."" The winds themselves can initiate a fire by downing power lines, something suspected in the fires that affected Northern California in October. Power outages preceded the Thomas Fire in Ventura on Tuesday, as well. Upper level winds showing the huge area of high pressure, or ""ridge,"" in the jet stream across the West, highlighted with the blue box. Image: earth.nullschool.net Importantly, the winds also make the fires nearly impossible to contain, blowing hot embers well ahead of the fire line, allowing blazes to hop across 10-lane highways with unsettling ease. The National Weather Service has been warning of the likelihood for ""extreme fire behavior"" with any fire that starts during this long-lasting wind event, going as far as designating the fire danger as ""extremely critical"" in the Los Angeles area. Once the fires get going, they can create their own weather, sucking in air from surrounding areas and lofting it upwards, promoting further fire growth and unpredictable behavior. Longer term trends This week, the high pressure area, or ""ridge"" in the jet stream, is extremely pronounced, part of a tendency toward more extreme weather patterns across the country. Recent studies indicate there may be connections between altered weather patterns, which are favoring drier conditions in California, and climate change. Last summer was the state's hottest on record, following a wet winter, which in turn followed the worst drought in modern California history. These episodes of weather whiplash have left the Golden State's trees stressed, making them more susceptible to toppling over from strong winds. Multiple studies have found that long-term climate change, which is mainly due to human emissions of greenhouse gases, is raising the risk of large wildfires in the Western U.S. However, according to the USGS' Keeley, this doesn't apply to the lower elevations of southern California. His research has shown that the warming climate is leading to more frequent and larger fires in Northern California, particularly in high elevation forests, he said. There are broader, non-climate forces at work, too. Population growth is placing more people in harms' way, including by building in areas at the so-called wildland-urban interface, or WUI, where areas that traditionally burn as part of their natural ecology butt up against homes and businesses. In short, urban sprawl is not helping solve our wildfire problem. Keeley emphasized this point, saying that it's not just climate change, but global change that will alter wildfire severity and risk going forward. Wildfires are likely to have more catastrophic human impacts due to population growth along with climate change, he said. California statewide average temperatures for June through Nov. 2017. Image: noaa/ncei. For example, he cited a 1964 wildfire that burned almost the exact same area as the deadly Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa. However, back then, the blaze caused no fatalities and only destroyed about two-dozen homes. Since that fire, though, he said the population in that area grew fivefold. “We need to be thinking about all the global changes that are taking place,” Keeley said. In the near-term, though, the Santa Ana winds are forecast to increase on Wednesday night, and may hit 70 miles per hour in some spots of Southern California on Thursday. In other words, this latest round of fires, which is a sign of the state's heritage and future challenge in a warming world, may yet grow worse.","Read more... {""player"":{""description"":""These fires may be a glimpse into SoCal's future under climate change."",""image"":""https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-UjmGCjSM8A3WRuM-dU4wz3FFDc=/https%3A%2F%2Fvdist.aws.mashable.com%2Fcms%2F2017%2F12%2F2c93672f-2bfe-c7a0%2Fthumb%2…",2017-12-06T22:40:04Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}",The combustible mix behind Southern California's terrifying wildfires,http://mashable.com/2017/12/06/causes-of-southern-california-terrifying-wildfires-climate-change/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/44W3cplqc12pcASZtA9Xo3fYuNs=/1200x630/2017%2F12%2F06%2F0c%2Ff6cdf617cb964daf939a45ff2bdc5e85.b9168.jpg,mashable,Mashable,fires,1
JENNIFER MEDINA and PATRICIA MAZZEI,"The mudslides in Montecito wiped out entire blocks, killing at least 17 people with a brutal force that shocked residents and even emergency workers — in neighborhoods that survived fires just weeks ago. On Thursday, rescue teams continued to search for as many as 43 people, holding out hope that they could survive in the thick mud, as deep as 10 feet in some places. Photo Josie Gower was among the 17 killed. The area was ravaged by the largest wildfire in California history last month, and the mudslides were a direct result of the burned ground. Without any vegetation in the way, the hills were vulnerable to falling rock and debris. Parts of the hills still puffed with smoke from those fires as the rain came down Tuesday. Four children were killed by the mud; the youngest victim was just 3 years old, according to a list issued by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office on Thursday. Nearly all of those who died lived within a two-mile radius in the flatlands of this small wealthy community just south of Santa Barbara. Most of the area was under voluntary evacuation orders. Among those reportedly missing were the 25-year-old stepsister of 12-year-old twins, one who lived, one who died; a 28-year-old woman whose 10-year-old son died; and a teenage boy whose father died and 14-year-old sister was dramatically rescued Tuesday after firefighters slogged through the rubble for six hours. On Wednesday, Mr. Gower went to his mother’s home, where he had grown up and she had lived for decades. The mud around San Ysidro Creek had spread nearly 1,000 feet, he said, and there were boulders the size of cars. Last year, the front yard flooded when about four inches of rain came down in a day, Mr. Gower said. But Ms. Gower assured him on Monday that she had set out sandbags and was prepared. They had no idea that the mud would prove far more dangerous than the water. “The creek was not even there,” he said. “We’ve had nothing like this at all, nothing like this has happened in Santa Barbara’s history, and nobody was prepared.” Photo James and Alice Mitchell. Credit via Associated Press In the past 48 hours, Mr. Gower and his sister, Breezy Haigh, have gone over and over what could have been done differently — alternating between blaming themselves and blaming county officials. “The night before I told her, ‘Why don’t you come stay here?’ and now of course I wish I would have pushed her,” Ms. Haigh said Thursday. Like her children, Ms. Gower had been back in her home for only a few weeks. “I feel like the county let us down. During the fire, they took so much precaution. People didn’t take this seriously. If it had been a mandatory, she would still be here.” Some blamed the desire to stay put on “evacuation fatigue,” because so many residents had returned to their homes only in the days before Christmas. Officials from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But they have said that they notified residents of the danger and decided which areas to evacuate based on input from weather, fire and flood experts. Like several other victims in the neighborhood, Alice and James Mitchell chose to stay home because they were not under mandatory evacuation, said their daughter, Kelly Weimer. The couple, married more than 50 years, had left for the wildfire and were still packed in case the floods forced them to leave again. So the Mitchells stayed in for dinner to celebrate Mr. Mitchell’s 89th birthday and went to bed early. Their bodies were found Tuesday down the road from their house, which they had named Casa Contenta, the house of contentment. All that was left was its foundation. Photo Rebecca Riskin. Credit via Associated Press “Nothing else is recognizable,” said Clay Weimer, the Mitchells’ son-in-law. Another home nearby had apparently slid down the hill. “The house next to them? Who knows where that house came from.” The white poodle Ms. Weimer gave her father for his birthday last year, Gigi, is still missing. Another nearby neighbor, Rebecca Riskin, 61, was found by the freeway about a mile away from her home, said her ex-husband, Ralph Riskin. The couple’s 25-year-old daughter, Julia, was rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter from the roof of a cottage on Ms. Riskin’s property, Mr. Riskin said. “Robert, my son, called me and said that his sister Julia was O.K.,” said Mr. Riskin, before he was overcome with emotion. “But he said, and I’ll never forget it: ‘We can’t find Mom.’” Many residents were still stunned at the sight of massive boulders around the town Thursday. A huge hole had taken the place of the living room in Ms. Gower’s home. Initially, Mr. Borgatello tried to get himself out of the mud, using his arms to pull his body up. But after he began shivering, he told Ms. Haigh, he realized he would be warmer if he stayed covered in the muck. Mr. Borgatello was released from the hospital Wednesday, she said, and has repeatedly spoken with some confusion about the night. “She looked at least 10 years younger than she was,” said Ms. Haigh, 35, adding that her mother swam at the local YMCA daily and kept her hair platinum blond. “She would have lived to be 100. I’m too young to have a dead mother.” The child of Italian immigrants who settled in Santa Barbara, Ms. Gower had spent her entire life in the area and delighted in having her three grandchildren, who called her Nonna, all nearby. “She was the life of the party, every party,” Ms. Haigh said through tears. “For her, every party was the ‘party of the century.’” Ms. Haigh and Mr. Gower had only begun to think about making plans for a funeral Thursday, anxious that they would not be able to find a place big enough for all the mourners in town.

"Ari Phillips on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","In early December, the Thomas Fire erupted in Southern California. By the time it was fully contained some five weeks later, it had upended the lives of thousands of people. It also affected countless wild animals, including two bears that suffered severe burns on their paws. Less than two months later, those bears have made a miraculously quick recovery and are back in the wild thanks to an innovative healing technique: fish skin bandages. Two adult female black bears, along with a five-month old mountain lion, were rescued shortly after the fire by rescue workers. The bears had suffered third-degree burns on their paws, and one of them was too injured to even stand up. ( Warning : The photo below is pretty gnarly, if you’re squeamish about burned skin turn back now.) Jamie Peyton, with the UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital and Center for Advancing Pain Relief, originally estimated it would take four to six months for the wounds to heal. That was too long to keep the bears in captivity, especially after it was discovered one was pregnant. Frequently changing bandages and administration of pain medication were also serious logistical hurdles. So, she helped come up with an unusual healing technique. According to a news release, Peyton had heard about a group in Brazil using sterilized tilapia skins to treat human burns. She decided it was worth a try. The payoff was near immediate, as the sutured fish skins allowed the bears stand on their own, a sign that the burn pain was less crippling. In a matter of weeks, new skin had grown back on the bears’ paw pads. The tilapia wraps, which were made from live fish purchased at a nearby market, last for about 10 days before turning leathery and losing the collagen necessary to help repair skin. Along with the fish bandages, the bears also received acupuncture, chiropractic treatment, and cold laser therapy to help with pain and healing. Even though the bears’ original habitats were destroyed by the fire, they were released back into the wild on January 18, where their burns will continue to heal. Officials with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife moved dirt and logs to create new winter dens for them in Los Padres National Forest. The Thomas Fire burned more than 280,000 acres, destroyed over 1,000 structures, and forced over 100,000 people around Santa Barbara and Ventura to evacuate their homes. As California continues to recover from this conflagration and others, Peyton sees great promise in the new technique for treating future victims. “One animal can change the face of medicine,” Peyton said in a statement. “I think these bears and the mountain lion are inspiring us to think outside the box. These individual animals have contributed to promoting how we’re going to treat burns in the future.” The CDFW posted a complete photographic overview of the bears’ rescue, recovery, and release. The images are more graphic than those included here, but also more illuminating. Take a look for yourself.","In early December, the Thomas Fire erupted in Southern California.

Mark Kaufman,"The real Smokey Bear narrowly avoided death in the pine-filled Capitan Mountains of New Mexico, nearly 70 years ago. Just west of the town of Roswell, firefighters found the bear cub clutching to the upper reaches of a tree, with singed paws and legs. The stranded black bear would almost certainly have perished amid the ashy land, but foresters saved him, and ultimately brought the tiny omnivore to the National Zoo in Washington D.C. Here, the newly named ""Smokey Bear"" lived out his domesticated life, well beyond the wild threats of the American West, where forests burn, and indomitable fires are king. Today, of course, Smokey Bear lives on as a 74-year-old message, the longest-serving public service campaign in U.S. history. He is stern, though approachable. Authoritative, yet gentle. He only says one thing, ever. ""Only you can prevent wildfires."" But as Smokey the campaign run by the U.S. Forest Service, the National Association of State Foresters, and the non-profit advertiser the Ad Council approaches his 75-birthday, he has entered changing climes. Earth's temperature has been rising for over a century a rise that is indisputably caused by humans. But over the past four decades, this rate of warming has accelerated. A Smokey illustration in 1995, as he puts out a forgotten campfire. Image: Rudy Wendelin/U.S. department of Agriculture Though the nation's fire woes are a complex confluence of potent culprits, Smokey's modern world, parched by heat and dryness, is increasingly aflame, and climate change is making it worse. Wildfires are burning more than twice as much land as they were in the early 1980s (when modern record-keeping began), and these blazes are burning for weeks not just days longer. Yet Smokey's message though imperfect remains relevant in an increasingly fire-damaged nation. ""You can prevent wildfires thats a great message,"" Mike Flannigan, a fire scientist at the University of Alberta, said in an interview. ""I like to think every human-caused fire is preventable."" Globally, humans are responsible for starting around 95 percent of fires, said Flannigan, whether by downed power lines, a sparking vehicle, or a campfire gone wrong. So, encouraging Americans to be careful in fire country by drowning campfires in water or not carelessly tossing cigarette butts into the woods is unquestionably valuable, if not critical. A Smokey PSA from 1947. Image: Ad Council, US Forest Service &amp; National Association of State Foresters But limited to five words, Smokey's famous adage while memorable and enduring comes with a catch. ""Smokey's other message is not as obvious,"" said Flannigan. ""It's 'Fire is bad'."" ""Smokey's other message is not as obvious"" But, emphasized Flannigan, ""Fire is not bad it's nature at work."" ""Smokey has a place,"" Stephen Pyne, a wildlife historian at Arizona State University, added in an interview. ""The problem is when Smokey's message gets generalized."" Smokey's modern message There are bad fires, and there are good fires. ""We want fires of the right sort,"" said Pyne. Wildfires improve the wilderness. They open up sunlight while removing dead brush. They fertilize the land and crack open pine cones, spreading seeds. And, critically, they thin the forests and woodlands, depriving large fires of the fuel they relish when growing into towering conflagrations. In a modern world besieged by fires, then, we also need fire. In fact, when it's possible, many fire experts promote intentionally and intelligently lighting fires to thin out forests that we've let become overgrown. This is called prescribed burning. ""Some fires we need to fight, and some we need to light,"" said Pyne. That's why Pyne suggests a mild alteration of Smokey's legendary message. ""Why not just have him say 'Help Smokey stop bad fires?"" wondered Pyne. Or, perhaps, it's time to let Smokey retire and hand over the reins to Smokey's cubs to carry the modern message, while leaving Smokey to walk into the sunset, with his furry head and iconic flat-hat held high. ""Let him retire with dignity,"" said Pyne. SEE ALSO: The EPA has lost its mind It's quite unlikely, however, that Smokey will be retired. He's not just a massive advertising success, perhaps one of the most successful in U.S. history who doesn't know Smokey Bear? His message, though oversimplified, remains important not because of his legend, but because of his relevance to the future. Because forests, especially in the Western U.S. and Canada, are growing more susceptible to flames. ""The climate is changing,"" said Flannigan. ""Were getting more extreme weather for fire, and there are more people on the landscape."" ""The climate is changing"" This is a recipe for catastrophic flames, which recently proved historically deadly in the California town of Paradise. Though this blaze might have been caused by flawed power lines, not poor campfire etiquette, the consequences of accidental fire can be identical: towering, unstoppable flames. A Smokey PSA from 1953. Image: Ad Council, US Forest Service &amp; National Association of State Foresters Thousands of years ago, before hundreds of millions of people had populated North America, lightning strikes likely started nearly every fire on Earth. Lightning however, is more limited in scope, in part because lightning has a season. ""But now with humans, as long as the fuels are dry and the weather is conducive, you can have a fire any time of the year,"" said Flannigan. After all, in the parched West, all it takes is a spark. Under the right conditions, once a fire reaches the crowns of trees, humans are generally powerless to stop the flames, noted Flannigan. Even massive 747 aircraft swooping over fires and dropping loads of crimson retardant has little effect. ""Dropping retardant makes a nice picture,"" said Flannigan, ""But you might as well be spitting on a campfire."" Smokey's survival Smokey has survived through 14 presidential administrations, largely immune to America's contemporary episodes of social unrest, warring, and economic tumult. Yet, how successful has Smokey been at stopping, or avoiding, wildfires? A smokey PSA from 2017. Image: Ad Council, US Forest Service &amp; National Association of State Foresters It's nearly impossible to say. As the Ad Council pointed out over email, ""there are difficulties measuring something that never happens."" What is understood, however, is that Smokey is well known. Of over 6,700 outdoor recreationists recently surveyed, 8 of 10 could identify Smokey, according to the Ad Council. So his message is likely being heard. And Smokey has evolved and changed his message, in a nuanced but relevant way. In 2001, his message shifted from ""Only you can prevent forest fires"" to ""Only you can prevent wildfires."" This was appropriate, as some of the America's largest wildfires don't occur in forests, but in scrublands and chaparral. Whatever Smokey's true success rate, the U.S. Forest Service still considers the anthropomorphized bear as one weapon in its battle to stop accidental fires. ""The objective of wildfire prevention strategies, whether engineering, enforcement, education, administration or the Smokey Bear campaign, is to prevent human-caused ignitions from starting,"" the federal agency said in a statement. ""Smokeys message is about preventing a wildfire from starting in the first place."" Although seasoned fire experts like Pyne, who grew up with Smokey think his message can be refined, it's hard to argue Smokey isn't an important part of the modern solution to climate change-enhanced infernos. After all, we're going to need all the help we can get. Money alone, to fight fires and treat the land (reducing fuels in heavily wooded forest) won't solve the problem. And the U.S. Forest Service knows it. In 1995, 16 percent of the agency's budget was devoted to fighting fire. Now, it's up to 50 percent. And by 2025, ""two out of every three dollars the Forest Service gets from Congress as part of its appropriated budget will be spent on fire programs,"" the agency concluded in a 2015 report. An illustration of Smokey reading his fan mail in 1979. Image: RUDY WENDELIN/U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ""Were seeing expenditures go up and up and up,"" said Flannigan. ""Despite how much we're spending, our area burned has more than doubled."" Solving the nation's modern wildfire woes doesn't have a silver bullet solution regardless of what leading politicians, like Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, contend. Yes, it will mean reducing overgrown vegetation, or fuels, in our historically ill-managed forests. It will mean dramatically lowering global societies reliance on carbon emitting fossil fuels. It will mean fortifying communities against fire. And it will mean not acting foolishly in fire country. That's where Smokey, with his unpretentious, chummy demeanor, comes in. ""The status quo is not an option for the future,"" said Flannigan. ""We cant spend, spend, and spend and continue to get our butts kicked. When you have a battle with a lion you lose."" ""Were losing.""","The real Smokey Bear narrowly avoided death in the pine-filled Capitan Mountains of New Mexico, nearly 70 years ago.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Massive, ravaging wildfires are now the norm on the West Coast, with the state of California now regularly breaking fire records, Canada’s British Columbia experiencing the third-worst fire season in recorded history, and all the smoke from those fires spreading across much of the continent and even further. But don’t worry, an area man has a plan, according to Global News, and that plan is blowing all the smoke from Canadian wildfires back up across the border with box fans. Per Global News’ report, Spokane, Washington resident Caleb Moon formed a Facebook event titled “ Blow Spokane’s Smoke Away to Canada.” It is impossible to believe that the August 24th event, which asks each of the city’s 550,000 to place “at least 5 box fans on their roof” to accomplish this, is anything but a joke. But Moon at least played it earnest in an interview with the network: The event may sound like a joke, but Moon said he’s serious about this. “We figure a small box fan can move smoke about six feet, so if you put 500,000 of them together, you can do the math on that, we can probably get it pretty far into Canada,” he said. British Columbia Centre for Disease Control senior environmental health specialist Sarah Henderson told Global News the idea was “very ridiculous,” noting that a fan does not magically clean air but “pulls air through it.” So even if it did work—which, again, it would not—the fans would probably just pull in fresh smoke from California. In any case, dumb plans for how to deal with the wildfires are kind of in vogue in the U.S. right now. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has spent much of the past few weeks rambling about how the fires are caused by anything from poor forest management to “environmental terrorists” and definitely not climate change, as is agreed to be a major factor by experts. Donald Trump has blamed the fires on “ bad environmental laws ” preventing firefighters from just spraying them with water, which is complete nonsense but nonetheless served as a pretext for the White House to seize control of protected California waterways and open up more federal lands to logging.

WIRECUTTER STAFF,"Besides controlling the holiday lights, you can swap out your regular bulbs with smart bulbs and change the whole look of a room by changing the lights colors. The smart bulbs Wirecutter likes, including Philips Hue and LIFX bulbs, can create custom scenes in different colors to light up walls or illuminate your décor to match a holiday or mood. As with smart plugs, you can control these bulbs with Alexa or Google Assistant. The holiday season means two things are likely to show up on your doorstep: visitors and packages. A doorbell camera like the Ring system can help you make sure youre not surprised by either. Wirecutter reviewed all the latest doorbell cameras and especially liked models that allow you to view and chat with porch visitors through a smartphone app whether youre on the other side of the door or the other side of the world. Doorbell cameras can also alert you when a package is dropped off, so you can run to the door to pick it up, call a neighbor if youre not home, or, in a worst-case scenario, identify the thief who ran off with it. In fact, just the sight of a doorbell camera on a front porch may deter such package thefts. If installing a doorbell camera seems like too much work, a Wi-Fi outdoor security camera can provide many of the same benefits, including recording suspicious activity. But these cameras dont come with doorbells, so they arent as good for interacting with visitors. According to the National Fire Protection Association, the top three days for home candle fires are Christmas, New Years Eve and New Years Day, and fires that begin in a Christmas tree are more likely to result in death than other home fires.

TIM ARANGO and INYOUNG KANG,"Experts also worry that not enough attention is given to all the ways people have made the problem of wildfires worse. Population growth in California means there are more people on the roads — cars are a prime culprit in wildfires — and more homes built in wilderness areas. “It would be easy to throw our hands in the air and say it’s just climate change, and we can’t do anything about it,” said Jennifer K. Balch, a professor of geography at the University of Colorado at Boulder and an expert on wildfires. “But actually we are starting the majority of wildfires, and we can do something about it.” Another factor, many experts say, are policies in California that protect forests from timber harvesting and a reluctance to set off controlled fires to burn vegetation. William Stewart, an expert on forestry at the University of California at Berkeley, said that part of the California dream was keeping “nature as it is,” with minimal management of forests. With so many fires burning so often, Stephen Pyne, a fire historian at Arizona State University, worries the public has become accustomed to disaster, unwilling to have difficult conversations about where houses are being built and whether controlled burns are a good idea.","Thursday: How people start or exacerbate blazes, a sudden opportunity for Duncan Hunter’s challenger, and a teetotaler’s guide to Sonoma County.",2018-08-23T13:00:46Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: The Human Element in California’s Wildfires,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/us/california-today-fires-humans.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/us/22caltoday/22caltoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,fires,1
"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","As the U.S. grapples with one of its worst wildfire seasons on record, Australia is getting a head start on what looks to be an equally brutal year of bushfires. Since early August—wintertime in the southern hemisphere— hundreds of bushfires have flared up in the Australian provinces of Queensland and New South Wales, prompting some local authorities to declare bushfire season open more than a month ahead of schedule. This freak fire lashing has experts extremely worried for what lies ahead as Australia transitions into spring and then summer. “We’re dreading what the rest of the season holds for us,” former New South Wales Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Greg Mullins told Earther. Fueling the flames is a drought that’s been described as the worst in living memory. Last winter was Australia’s hottest on record and the driest since 2002, and for large swaths of eastern and southern Australia, there’s been little rain to slake the thirst since. About 60 percent of Queensland is currently in drought. So is 100 percent of New South Wales, a province that produces a quarter of the nation’s crops. Many of its fields are looking frighteningly brown. This winter has also been unusually warm, and that combination of heat and drought is causing landscapes to light up like a tinderbox when something provides the spark. For the most remote fires, the spark is often lightning, but a large number of the blazes are being started by humans as well. Mullins said farmers often use small, contained fires to burn off weeds or undergrowth outside of fire season, but some of those burns have gotten out of hand this winter. Fire managers, who typically use the winter to conduct prescribed burns that reduce fire fuel, are grappling with a similar issue because of the parched conditions. “At least some of the fires in New South Wales originated as hazard reduction burns that got out of control because it was so flammable,” Lesley Hughes, an ecologist with the Australian Climate Council, told Earther. None of this bodes for the months ahead, especially with the eastern Pacific tipping into an El Niño state, something that normally delivers warmer, drier weather to southern Australia. “We’re looking down the barrel at this insane fire season,” University of Tasmania fire ecologist David Bowman told Earther. “It’s difficult to exaggerate just how extreme the whole thing is.” Bowman, Hughes, and Mullins all pointed to climate change as the key driver of longer, more intense fire seasons in Australia, like the one this year’s lining up to be. A 2015 report by the Australia Climate Council reached a similar conclusion, noting that climate change is upping the likelihood of fire weather by increasing the frequency of heat waves and, in southern Australia, exacerbating drought. For Mullins, who’s been fighting bushfires since the early 1970s and whose father was a firefighter for over 60 years before him, decades of life experience tell him how profoundly the fire season has changed. He recalled how the onset of dangerous fire weather used to be far more predictable. Today, it’s not only harder to say when a fire outbreak will occur, but the worst fires are on a scale nobody’s prepared to fight. “It’s the new normal,” Mullins said. “We can’t handle it.”","As the U.S. grapples with one of its worst wildfire seasons on record, Australia is getting a head start on what looks to be an equally brutal year of bushfires.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them California's biggest wildfire on record is expected to burn for the rest of the month, fire officials said on Tuesday. The Mendocino Complex Fire has already engulfed 290,692 acres (117,639 hectares) - almost the size of Los Angeles. Barely a third of it is under control, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Firefighters are tackling 18 major blazes across the state amid strong winds and low humidity. The fire - which comprises two blazes in the state's north - was declared the biggest in California's history on Monday. Officials had set a target to extinguish the fire by mid-August, but they now say they will need until early September. The fire has burned 75 buildings and led to thousands of evacuations. A separate blaze - the Carr fire, further north - has killed at least seven people and destroyed more that 1,500 structures. Burning through almost 160,000 acres, it was 47% contained by late Monday. Meanwhile, more fires have been breaking out, adding to the mammoth workload of fire crews. The so-called Holy Fire, in southern California, grew dramatically and rapidly on Monday, with two hikers needing to be airlifted to safety. How are firefighters coping? At least 14,000 firefighters are struggling to contain the multiple outbreaks. The crews have been boosted by US army personnel and more than 1,000 prisoners. The inmates - who are considered low-risk offenders - work on a volunteer basis but they also receive $2 (£1.50) a day, plus $1 an hour. Fire crews from Australia and New Zealand have also flown over to share their expertise in battling bush fires. Firefighters told the LA Times about their gruelling schedule. One said his crew had slept - sitting up - in the seats of their fire engine on some nights. ""It's been pretty crazy - they're calling this the new norm,"" said Omar Estorga, captain of a crew working on the Carr Fire. ""In years past, there were one or two big fires a year. Now they're doing three to four huge fires in a week."" Nearly half of the 10 largest California wildfires on record have occurred in the past decade, according to Reuters news agency. Officials have rejected a theory, tweeted by President Donald Trump, that the fires' spread was being ""made so much worse"" because of a Californian policy to divert water into the Pacific Ocean. Deputy fire chief Mr Mclean dismissed Mr Trump's comments to US media, saying firefighters had ""plenty of water"" to carry out their work. Will it get worse? National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley has warned that conditions are not going to immediately improve - with temperatures as high as 43C (110F) being forecast for some areas. Media caption Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years Experts say 2018 has the worst start to the fire season in 10 years - partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation.

Sidney Fussell,"Patent infringement suits are usually boring, but the ongoing Tinder vs. Bumble beef is full of soapy, corporate intrigue. Tinder’s parent company, Match Group, launched a patent infringement suit against rival Bumble on Monday. The suit alleges Bumble has stolen numerous design ideas since Tinder’s creation in 2014. CEO Mandy Ginsberg sent an internal memo to staff, saying “this is not about singling out any individual company. This is about protecting the integrity of your work.” Bumble’s response—heavy-handed references to swiping aside—rebukes the accusations in Match’s suit. Instead, Bumble says the suit is part of a pattern of behavior meant to harass and intimidate the start-up into accepting buyout offers from Match, which also owns online romance services, OkCupid and Match.com. From the Bumble blog : We swipe left on you. We swipe left on your multiple attempts to buy us, copy us, and, now, to intimidate us. We’ll never be yours. No matter the price tag, we’ll never compromise our values. We swipe left on your attempted scare tactics, and on these endless games. We swipe left on your assumption that a baseless lawsuit would intimidate us. Given your enduring interest in our company, we expected you to know us a bit better by now. Tinder and Bumble have had a combative, twisting relationship for years. In 2014, Tinder co-founder and former vice president of marketing, Whitney Herd, who went on to co-found Bumble, filed suit against Justin Mateen, Tinder’s CMO, who was ousted from the company in the wake of Herd’s suit. Herd alleged Mateen threatened and harassed her following their break-up. In text messages uncovered as the suit played out, Mateen threatened Herd repeatedly with misogynist language and accused her of fraternizing with “Muslim pigs” to advance in her career. The lawsuit settled for $1 million in 2017. In its suit, Match alleges that Chris Gulczynski and Sarah Mick, two ex-Tinder employees who created Bumble alongside Herd, had confidential knowledge of certain Tinder features and implemented them in Bumble. The suit further alleges Bumble’s backtrack feature, which lets users undo an accidental left swipe, was originally a Tinder idea. As was its picture messaging system, which blurs photos until the receiver taps them, easing concerns of looking at intimate photos in public, Match claims in its suit. Match also alleges that everything from the card-like UI to the language of swiping is meant to look like Tinder. When reached for comment, Match sent the following statement: Match Group has invested significant resources and creative expertise in the development of our industry-leading suite of products. We are committed to protecting the intellectual property and proprietary data that defines our business. Accordingly, we are prepared when necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights against any operator in the dating space who infringes upon those rights. Match says its suit is simply a defense of its patented designs, while Bumble ties the suit to Match’s attempts to buy out the company. TechCrunch reports Bumble declined a $450 million offer from Match in August 2017. Negotiations were reportedly ongoing until as recently as November. Background sources tell TechCrunch that Match’s suit puts pressure on Bumble to accept the acquisition while potentially scaring off bidders and investors wary of Bumble’s prospects if the patent infringement suit drags on. Who knew matching making companies could have as toxic, complicated relationships as the rest of us? As the suit continues, we’ll keep you updated.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Californias 2018 is officially the worst year for wildfires in recorded state history, the Los Angeles Times reported on Saturday, citing the National Interagency Coordination Centers year-end statistical analysis. The 1.8 million acres of California land that burned last year was more than any other state in 2018, and it far surpassed 2017's tally of 1.3 million acres in California. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Scott McLean confirmed to the Times that the wildfires were unprecedented.
The Times wrote:
More than 100 people were killed and 17,000 homes and 700 businesses were destroyed in a state where fires are considered one of the annual seasons. Crews responded to more than 8,000 fires last year.
Its a surprise its that amount, but in a sense because of what Ive seen over the last year, no its not, McLean said. Its what weve been living through.
... Firefighters said the most devastating blazes had the most extreme behaviorwind-driven ember storms that created spot fires far beyond defensive lines and, in the case of the Carr fire, a fire tornado that ignited objects lifted into the air.
Many of the recorded deaths happened during the Camp Fire, which rampaged across Butte County and killed some 86 people, mainly as it rolled through the town of Paradise and burned most of it to the ground. The Camp Fire and the Woolsey Fire, both in November, burned more than 250,000 acres alone, the Times noted.
After a seven-year drought from 2010 to 2017, much of California remains a tinderbox with estimates that there are over 147 million dead trees throughout the state. The end of the drought poses its own problems, as fast-growing grasses and other small plants can dry out and catch flame themselves, carrying blazes right to other sources of fuel. Californias rapidly growing population (which has almost doubled since the 1970s) has also brought many more communities into areas at high risk of fires.
Recent research has also indicated that the historical distinction between the December-February wet season and the fire season has largely disappeared, in part due to climate change.
Last year, Cal Fire Director Ken Pimlott told the AP that the state government should consider a ban on building homes in potentially fire-prone areas, saying: Firefighters are living climate change, its staring them in the face everyday. He added that officials owe it to residents and emergency personnel alike to make such decisions, so that they dont have to keep going through what were going through.
California fire officials are planning a major effort to thin forests throughout the state in an effort to stave off future wildfires, but per the San Francisco Chronicle, some experts are questioning whether it will really be enough. Thinning forests reduces available fuel but can also dry out the forest floor or promote growth of less fire-resistant plants, the paper wrote. Denser forests may burn longer, but they may also burn less intensely.
University of California, Santa Barbara UC Cooperative Extension wildfire researcher Max Moritiz told the Chronicle, Its not fair to say that fuel treatments wont do any good. It may provide some protection in some places. But most of us studying this agree that you cant just do this and (expect to) make much headway.
McLean told the paper the efforts may not stop the catastrophic scale of wildfires in recent years, but It gives the folks in those areas time to evacuate and it also give the firefighters a chance to get in there and mitigate the fire.
According to the LA Times, fire officials are bracing for the worst. McLean said that the recent wet winter has promoted even more growth in fuel, saying that its fire management programs have to continue forever. Its an ongoing process from here on out.

""We've lost at least several hundred acres of avocados, probably more,"" the California Avocado Commission told agriculture news site AgNet West. About 90% of US avocados are grown in California, and the industry is worth millions to the economy. About 5,700 firefighters have been battling the fires, officials say. One death has been confirmed - that of a 70-year-old woman found in her car on Wednesday. Three firefighters have been injured and about 500 buildings destroyed. There are now fears the fires will have serious implications for California's vast agricultural industry. Last season's avocado harvest produced a crop worth more than $400m (£300m), according to the California Avocado Commission. Much of this was grown on family-owned farms in the south of the state.

Michael Nuñez,"The scapegoat in Facebook's ongoing data privacy scandal is firing back at the social media giant. Aleksandr Kogan, the relatively unknown scientist who was paid by Cambridge Analytica for data he harvested from more than 87 million Facebook users, is speaking out in a series of interviews, where he explains that he was not a rogue app developer as Facebook has frequently implied, and that the problem could be much bigger than most people realize. SEE ALSO: How to find out if Cambridge Analytica stole your Facebook data Across several interviews over the weekend, Kogan has made a couple of things very clear: He wasn't the only developer harvesting and sharing data without the direct consent of users, and Facebook knew exactly what he was doing for years before it acted. He also revealed another interesting twist in this ongoing saga: The partner he worked with in order to create the quiz app that has drawn so much criticism for harvesting data now works at Facebook. In an enlightening and sprawling 60 Minutes interview that aired on Sunday evening, Kogan explained how Facebook has misrepresented the notion that he was somehow a lone actor. At one part in the interview, Kogan explained just how large the scope of this type of behavior was: Aleksandr Kogan: It seems crazy now. But this was a core feature of the Facebook platform for years. This was not a special permission you had to get. This was just something that was available to anybody who wanted it who was a developer. Lesley Stahl: How many apps do you think there are, how many developers, who did what you did? Aleksandr Kogan : Tens of thousands. Lesley Stahl: Tens of thousands? Aleksandr Kogan : Tens of thousands. In the same interview, Kogan highlighted another interesting piece of information: Joseph Chancellor, who was once Kogan's co-worker, now works for Facebook. And for some very unclear reason, Joseph Chancellor has not faced the same type of scrutiny that Kogan has. Lesley Stahl: And where is he today? Aleksandr Kogan : He works at Facebook. Lesley Stahl: Wait a minute. Is — did he have anything to do with the study you did for Cambridge Analytica? Aleksandr Kogan : Yeah. I mean, we did everything together. Lesley Stahl: So they've come after you but not someone who did exactly what you did with you. Aleksandr Kogan : Yes. Lesley Stahl: And he actually works at Facebook? Aleksandr Kogan : Correct. Lesley Stahl: Are you on Facebook? Aleksandr Kogan : No. They deleted my account. Lesley Stahl: You can't be on Facebook. You're banned. Aleksandr Kogan : I'm banned. Lesley Stahl: And the partner works for them. Aleksandr Kogan : Correct. Lesley Stahl: What's wrong with this picture? I'm missing something? Aleksandr Kogan : Yeah, I mean, this is my frustration with all this, where I had a pretty good relationship with Facebook for years. Lesley Stahl: Really, so they knew who you were? Aleksandr Kogan : Yeah. I visited their campus many times. They had hired my students. I even did a consulting project with Facebook in November of 2015. And what I was teaching them was lessons I learned from working with this data set that we had collected for Cambridge Analytica. So I was explaining, like, ""Here's kinda what we did. And here's what we learned. And here's how you can apply it internally to help you with surveys and survey predictions and things like that."" In a separate interview with Buzzfeed News, Kogan surprisingly downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and also the political consulting agency's behavior prediction capabilities, calling it ""nonsense."" But perhaps even more shocking was Kogan's description of his cozy relationship with Facebook, which included several visits to the company's headquarters and public collaborations on ""at least 10"" research papers with Facebook’s Pete Fleming, who is now the head of research at Instagram. Kogan's close relationship with the social media giant and the pedestrian nature of his data harvesting is light years away from what Facebook has been saying up to this point. ""If a developer who people gave their information to, in this case, Aleksandr Kogan, then goes and in violation of his agreement with us, sells the data to Cambridge Analytica, that's a big issue. People have a right to be very upset. I am upset that that happened,"" Zuckerberg said during his congressional hearing. Clearly, someone in this relationship is misrepresenting the truth. It's hard to imagine it's anyone but the company whose very own executives struggle to define what it is.","The scapegoat in Facebook's ongoing data privacy scandal is firing back at the social media giant.

Greece has also reportedly sought international assistance from the European Union. The Spanish government says it has sent two amphibious planes to help. Forest fires are common in Greece during hot, dry summers, according to the news service, with temperatures in the country recently reaching up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). Strong winds have fanned the flames, which, since Monday, have raged through small seaside towns and villages like Rafina, Mati and Kineta. More than 300 firefighters, five aircraft and two helicopters have been mobilised to tackle the ""extremely difficult"" situation due to those strong winds, Athens fire chief Achille Tzouvaras said in a press statement. The fires have seen some trying to evacuate by fishing boats, navy vessels, and yachts, which has seen at least four people killed. Some major highways, like the National Road, have been closed or road-blocked. It's impossible to imagine this happening in your home town, but photographs of the villages, homes, and people affected will give you a fleeting insight into what people in Greece are going through right now.

Tom McKay,"California’s devastating Carr Fire is now measured to have spread to over 89,000 acres on Sunday, resulting in at least five deaths, hundreds of destroyed structures, and severe damage to western parts of the city of Redding after it ravaged the nearby communities of Shasta and Keswick. Per SFGate, officials now say that the blaze destroyed 517 structures, damaged 135 others, and some 5,000 others are now at risk of being burned down. The five deaths included Melody Bledsoe and her young great-grandchildren Emily and James Roberts, whose bodies were found in their home in Redding. Two firefighters, bulldozer operator Don Ray Smith of Pollock Pines and Redding fire inspector Jeremy Stoke, also lost their lives, SFGate wrote: Steve Crawford from Cal Fire described it as “unprecedented. It’s burning in every direction all at the same time.” The neighborhood where Bledsoe and her great-grandchildren died experienced what officials described as a “flash fire,” leaving residents little time to escape. “It was probably the scariest thing I’ve ever seen,” said Redding Police Chief Roger Moore, who lost his own home in the River Ridge district while he was patrolling the area Thursday. Additionally, SFGate wrote Redding officials have received reports of looting. According to the LA Times, the Carr fire is just five percent contained despite the continual efforts of 3,400 firefighters and is still headed towards “residential areas west and south of downtown Redding.” Some 38,000 people are under mandatory evacuation orders, with 260 National Guard personnel deployed to enforce those orders and staff roadblocks. At least 13 missing persons are reported, Sgt. Todd Cogle told the paper, though early indications are that some of those are safe and may have had to flee their homes without notifying friends or relatives. A number of other fires are burning across California at the same time, some large enough to result in their own states of emergency. Those include the largely uncontained Cranston Fire some 100 miles southeast of Los Angeles and the Ferguson Fire in Yosemite National Park, the latter of which will take at least two weeks to control. Though the cause of the Carr Fire has been widely reported to be a vehicle malfunction on Highway 299, UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain told the Times that vegetation across the state is already “explosively dry,” having reached that state months before the worst heat waves typically arrive in September. Research has shown the Western wildfire season is now much longer and resulting in bigger blazes. “It’s a lot easier to get bad fires under these conditions,” Swain said, “because you don’t need as much of a push from the winds.” “We now have very strong evidence that global warming has already put a thumb on the scales, upping the odds of extremes like severe heat and heavy rainfall,” Stanford University climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh told the Associated Press. “We find that global warming has increased the odds of record-setting hot events over more than 80 percent of the planet, and has increased the odds of record-setting wet events at around half of the planet.” The AP wrote the fire is part of a nationwide trend of larger, more destructive wildfires linked to a changing climate: In the United States on Friday, there were 89 active large fires, consuming nearly 900,000 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. So far this year, fires have burned 4.15 million acres, which is nearly 14 percent higher than average over the past 10 years. Experts have also pointed to explosive urban growth into areas which were formerly wildlands across California, resulting in more human exposure to wildfires. Capital Public Radio writes : Keith Gilless, a UC Berkeley professor of forest economics, said extreme fires such as these will become more common in California’s populated areas... “I think the trend is really that we moved into the wildlands, more than that the fires from the wildlands moved into our space,” Gilless explained. [The California state government] can lessen their severity, Gilless said, by thinning forests, strengthening building codes for new and existing homes and making roadways and utility corridors safer. Climatologist Bill Patzert warned the LA Times that with the highest temperatures not expected to arrive until closer to September, the worst is yet to come. “The large picture, of course, is that we’re living in a warmer world,” Patzert said. “Temperatures are much higher this summer—next summer—than they were 50 or 100 years ago.” [ SFGate / LA Times ]","California’s devastating Carr Fire is now measured to have spread to over 89,000 acres on Sunday, resulting in at least five deaths, hundreds of destroyed structures, and severe damage to western parts of the city of Redding after it ravaged the nearby commun…",2018-07-29T17:15:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}","California's Devastating Carr Fire Is Now at Least 89,000 Acres, With Five Dead and More Missing",https://gizmodo.com/californias-devastating-carr-fire-is-now-at-least-89-00-1827955856,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s---ZXNcmXH--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/aevy2wcrvdycvdbgff4k.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,fires,1
Heather Dockray,"As America veers toward a Constitutional crisis, Fox News host Laura Ingraham is placing the blame not on Donald Trump but on... LeBron James? On Thursday, Ingraham dedicated a whole segment of her show to James, enjoining the player to ""shut up and dribble"" on the grounds that he wasn't ""educated"" enough to speak about politics. Last night, LeBron finally responded on Instagram with a pithy and forceful photo. SEE ALSO: These LGBTQ Olympians are here to break records (and tiny queer hearts) ""#Wewillnotshutupanddribble,"" Lebron wrote in the caption below. In a segment about Donald Trump, Ingraham said Lebron James and Kevin Durant's recent comments about the president were ""barely intelligible."" James had recently shared a clip on his video platform, UNINTERRUPTED, where he and Durant criticized the president, comparing him to a bad coach in basketball. ""Must they run their mouths like that?"" Ingraham said, in what many are interpreting to be some kind of dog whistle. ""This is what happens when you attempt to leave high school a year early to join the NBA. And it's always unwise to seek political advice from someone who gets paid $100 million a year to bounce a ball."" The segment continued: “You’re great players but no one voted for you,” she added, addressing Mr. James and Mr. Durant directly. “Millions elected Trump to be their coach. So keep the political commentary to yourself, or as someone once said, shut up and dribble.” Ingraham later released a statement and denied any racial intent in her remarks: ""defamatory charges of racism are a transparent attempt to immunize entertainment and sports elites from scrutiny and criticism."" Philadelphia Eagles lineman Chris Long responded by posting a series of tweets featuring Fox News hosts interviewing celebrities and athletes for their political opinions. In other tweets, Long featured Fox News appearances by Chuck Norris, Curt Schilling, Clint Eastwood, Fabio, and Joe Namath. Durant also responded on Friday night: ""Ignorance is something I try to ignore. That was definitely an ignorant comment,” Durant said of Ingraham's segment. “I do play basketball, but I am a civilian and I am a citizen of the United States, so my voice is just as loud as hers, I think – or even louder."" We await President Trump's completely unsolicited tweet on the situation.","As America veers toward a Constitutional crisis, Fox News host Laura Ingraham is placing the blame not on Donald Trump but on...

Scott Malone,"BOSTON (Reuters) - A series of explosions and fires rocked dozens of city blocks across several communities north of Boston on Thursday, prompting evacuations of numerous neighborhoods where gas odors were present, Massachusetts state police reported. No injuries were immediately reported. The state police bulletins on Twitter said it was too soon to speculate about a cause, but local media reports cited the possible rupture of a gas line. The first explosion was triggered by an overpressurized gas line, WBZ News reported. Police said the explosions and fires erupted in a cluster of towns - Lawrence, Andover, North Andover and Methuen - that lie just north of Boston. “We are asking everybody with gas in their homes to leave their homes until further notice,” North Andover town manager Andrew Maylor told one local television station.

"Madison Park, CNN","(CNN) It may take until September to contain the largest fire in California history, which is now nearly the size of Los Angeles. So far, two firefighters have been injured while fighting the Mendocino Complex Fire, which consists of two fires -- the Ranch Fire and the River Fire -- in Northern California. The pair have burned 292,692 acres and was 34% contained as of Tuesday evening. The colossal fire altogether has destroyed 75 residences, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire. Cal Fire estimated that full containment could take until September 1. The Mendocino Complex Fire ignited on July 27. Last year's Thomas Fire, which is the second-largest fire in California history, took more than six months to extinguish after burning 281,893 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. Firefighters in the state are currently battling 17 large fires. Trump weighs in on wildfires This week, President Donald Trump appeared to blame California's environmental protection laws for the cataclysmic fires. Administration officials declined to offer any clarity on Trump's series of tweets. Trump claimed in his tweet that the fires were being ""made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized."" He also added that water in the state was ""being diverted into the Pacific Ocean,"" in a tweet that named California Gov. Jerry Brown. ""This does not merit a response,"" said Evan Westrup, Brown's spokesman. Environmental scientists, California water experts and local officials have disputed Trump's claims. ""It is climate change that is causing this,"" says Michael Mohler, spokesman for Cal Fire. ""There is no other way to explain explosive fuel conditions, that come with increased winds and higher temperatures."" California's multiyear drought ended last year, but it also left a lot of dried and weakened plants and trees. ""You don't recover from six years of drought overnight,"" Mohler said. California has approximately more than 100 million dead trees in the state due to drought and infestation from bark beetles. Dead trees pose a major hazard as they allow wildfires to spread rapidly in hot, dry conditions. Cal Fire's vegetation management crews are out year-round to thin and remove such trees, while also doing prescribed burns. Experts cite hotter temperatures causing lengthier fire seasons, that burn up dry, dead vegetation as factors for more wildfires. Other fires in the state continue Cal Fire reported that warm temperatures, with highs in the 90s and triple digits, are expected in most areas of the state -- which isn't good news for firefighters. But a slight cooling is in the forecast for the weekend. More than 14,000 firefighters are battling the wildfires across the state. The second biggest fire in California is the Carr Fire, located in Shasta County in the northern part of the state. The deadly fire has been burning for more than two weeks and consumed 172,055 acres, as of Tuesday evening. It has killed seven people and destroyed more than 1,100 homes. The next largest fire is the Ferguson Fire, near Yosemite National Park, with 94,992 acres. That fire which has lasted more than three week, has killed two people. CNN's Cheri Mossburg and Sarah Moon contributed to this report.","It may take until September to contain the largest fire in California history,  which is now nearly the size of Los Angeles.",2018-08-08T06:32:25Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Record-breaking California fire is almost the size of Los Angeles,https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/08/us/california-fires/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180807104607-02-california-wildfires-080618-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,fires,1
