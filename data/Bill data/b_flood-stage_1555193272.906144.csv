Eric Niiler,"The record-setting floods deluging the Midwest are about to get a lot worse. Fueled by rapidly melting snowpack and a forecast of more rainstorms in the next few weeks, federal officials warn that 200 million people in 25 states face a risk through May. Floodwaters coursing through Nebraska have already forced tens of thousands of people to flee and have caused $1.3 billion in damage.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its spring flood outlook Thursday, predicting that two-thirds of the country is at risk of ""major to moderate flooding,"" from Fargo, North Dakota on the Red River of the North down to Nashville, Tennessee, on the Cumberland River. The floods from the past two weeks have compromised 200 miles of levees in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers.
The rains and floods are expected to continue through May and become more dire, according to Ed Clark, director of NOAAs National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, Clark said, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities.
A combination of heavy snowfall in late February, tropical rains and wet snow from the bomb cyclone that swept across the country a week ago and frozen or saturated ground surfaces have set the stage for the floods. Ice jams on top of frozen waterways are adding to the problem by diverting floodwaters out of river channels and sending them onto land. Its not looking like we are going to see any dry stretches anytime soon, says Thomas Graziano, director of the water prediction center at the National Weather Service.
Officials say the entire Mississippi River basin has received 3 times as much rainfall as in a normal year.
And it's not done falling yet. More rainstorms are expected to hit the Midwest over the next eight to 10 days. That precipitation will be like water running over concrete, Graziano says. Graziano says he expects this years flood levels to top the disastrous floods that hit the Missouri River in May 2011 and the Red River in North Dakota and Minnesota in 2009.
This winters big snowpack is fueling the floods. In the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota, more than 20 inches of snow remains on the ground. The Missouri, Ohio and Mississippi Rivers drain the central United States, but it takes several weeks for the water to travel downstream. In the meantime, emergency officials are warning local residents to make an evacuation plan as well as purchase flood insurance in certain areas.
Climate scientists say it's too early to tell exactly to what degree human-induced climate change has affected this spring flood cycle, but they note that the watery disaster is following a pattern of extreme weather events across the United States. There's about 10 percent more moisture available in the environment as a result of global climate change, says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.
Under the right conditions, that extra moisture can be amplified into 30 percent more rainfall during an extreme weather event such as a hurricane, bomb cyclone or the series of storms that has hit the Midwest, Trenberth explains.
""The extra fuel from global warming is what keeps [a storm] going,"" he says. ""And it's what turns it from a billion-dollar disaster to a $10 to $50 billion disaster.""

Adam Rogers,"You can see it on satellite imagery—a chaotic blur of wind and water shaped like a giant alien starfish over Australia, extending a tentacle diagonally across the Pacific and right into the Golden Gate. It’s called an atmospheric river, over a thousand miles of water and wind. This weekend is going to be as wet as an entire typical April. On the official scale, the storm will probably top out at “strong”—it might have enough water vapor transport to rate as “extreme,” but probably won’t reach “exceptional,” the real freak-out level of flood danger. That means several inches of rain. This is how California gets most of its disastrous floods, but also most of its drinking water. It’s a crazy way to do business, but understanding these atmospheric rivers might be the key to making sure the human race doesn’t die of thirst. Atmospheric rivers come ashore on nearly every west-facing coastline on Earth. A few times a year one of them does what this weekend’s storm will do: shotguns over Hawaii and into Northern California. “It tails all the way back into the tropics, almost to the date line,” says Michael Anderson, the California State climatologist. “It’s going to come through pretty quick.” Onshore, the fast, wet air from one of these so-called Pineapple Expresses ricochets upward off the coastal mountain ranges like a tennis ball catching the top of the net. The air rises; the water falls. That’s called “orographic enhancement,” and it’s how you get massive bursts of rain and floods. Somewhere between 30 and 60 percent of California’s entire water supply comes from atmospheric river storms. And they are intense. In one study of six years of California rainfall, monitored hour-by-hour, just 1,460 hours qualified as atmospheric river storms. But that scant 2.8 percent of time accounted for over 50 percent of the rainfall the researchers measured. California hoards more than half of that rain as snowfall on the tops of the Sierras. The rest it tries to save in reservoirs—a dozen big ones and about 150 littler ones scattered up and down the state. In the rainy winter months, the reservoirs fill up—ideally—leaving space for the snowmelt to come in the summer. Ideally. During the winter, all the reservoirs stay empty enough to absorb flood waves from storms. “But on April 1, that reserve space starts being relaxed so they can capture snowmelt,” Anderson says. “With a storm this time of year, you still have that flood reserve space, so there’s room for the reservoirs to catch that water. The question will be, as that reserve space is being relaxed, can that water be kept for the conservation pool?” It’s a balance—hold onto water for a rain-free summer and possible drought, be ready to capture snowmelt, but leave enough room to store a flood wave during the storm season. Every reservoir has a rule curve that says how much water is too much. But atmospheric rivers can make it tough to know when to apply those rules. In November and December of 2012, the Lake Mendocino Reservoir absorbed water from two atmospheric river events, enough so that the water encroached into the “flood pool,” which is supposed to stay empty for emergencies. “So the reservoir operators released the water. It was the prudent thing to do,” says F. Martin Ralph, a research meteorologist at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “But nobody knew that there would be no more atmospheric rivers basically for the rest of the year, and that was the beginning of the drought. They never had a chance to refill the reservoir in the spring.” So Ralph, along with the Sonoma County Water Agency (which regulates the drinking water in Lake Mendocino), the US Army Corps of Engineers (which operates the flood prevention aspects of the reservoir), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (which monitors the salmon fishery that’s part of the lake’s hydrology) are all working on a finer-grained system. “It’s possible that with modern weather prediction we can see with some certainty these atmospheric rivers coming a few days ahead, so hypothetically one could consider keeping some of that extra water temporarily, and every day looking at the forecast to see if there’s an atmospheric river,” Ralph says. “If there’s not, the chance of there being a flood problem is essentially zero.” The idea’s still in a planning stage; Ralph’s group is now trying these “forecast-informed reservoir operations” at Mendocino and Prado in southern California. (It's still status quo ante at other reservoirs, like Like Oroville—where the people in charge will be trying out their new spillway, rebuilt since the old one crumbled during last year's rains. But if the new approach works—and so far it seems like it may—reservoirs can keep the water for a not-rainy day. That day may be coming. Or it might not. Water in the American west was variable and unpredictable even before humans started pumping enough carbon into the atmosphere that it’d change the climate. A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor. That by itself would strengthen atmospheric rivers. But a warmer atmosphere means warmer poles, which reduces the temperature difference between the middle of the planet and the ends. That means weaker winds and weaker ARs. “However, there’s a big asterisk on that. It’s inevitable that some storms will be just as strong in terms of wind as they are today, and they will have available to them more water vapor,” Ralph says. “There could be a class of atmospheric river storms that are a lot stronger than we’ve seen in the past.” Ralph’s ideas for managing reservoirs better might end up being a necessary adaptation to a changed climate —and not just in California. The northwestern US gets a quarter to a third of its annual rainfall from atmospheric rivers, and they cause floods there, too. Arizona’s and Idaho’s big winter floods are often due to atmospheric rivers; a few years ago one even caused major flooding in Nashville. They are the drivers of flood and drought around the world. So understanding those ocean-spanning tendrils on satellite maps may be the solution to what’s arguably going to be humanity’s most pressing problem: figuring out what to do when the rains come, and when they don’t.",An atmospheric river means this weekend is going to be as wet as an entire typical April.,2018-04-06T17:30:46Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",An Atmospheric River Will Hit California With a Month's Worth of Rain,https://www.wired.com/story/a-months-worth-of-rain-will-hit-california-this-weekend/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5ac6bb0b19970475a8fa4ab4/191:100/pass/sfrain_623351114208.jpg,wired,Wired,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"JACK HEALY, RICHARD FAUSSET and CAMPBELL ROBERTSON","But the mind-set seemed to have fully changed. Local officials used to regard hurricane response as something akin to major snow removal: sporadic events that therefore warranted relatively little investment. “Two years of these types of storms have really made us look internally at our own preparation,” Mr. Sears said. “Now that we have a better understanding of where people may be at risk, we can better stage assets in that area.” “Matthew got me once, Florence got me twice,” Mr. Sears said Tuesday, recounting what he told the City Council this week. “The next hurricane won’t get me.” Closer to the coast, in Conway, S.C., a few miles northwest of Myrtle Beach, the weariness with the cycle of worry, flood, repeat was palpable. “I grew up here,” said Matt Bruton, 34, a moving and storage business operator, who was hanging out Tuesday in his single-story brick home in Old Sherwood Country Club, an eclectic neighborhood of old and new houses north of the Waccamaw River. The waters had already risen through neighboring Crabtree Swamp to a level higher than residents had ever seen. “We had a record flood during Floyd in ’99, and it wasn’t this high,” Mr. Bruton said. “The hundred-year flood they called it the last time, and here we are again. I’d like to put my house in a different, higher place, but I call this the best neighborhood in Conway.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","When last weeks bomb cyclone hit the Midwest, it was hard to imagine the inundation it could bring amid whiteout conditions and more than a foot of snow. But the warm weather that wrapped in behind it quickly melted out all that white stuff and unleashed historic flooding across parts of Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas, and Missouri.
Floodwaters have worked their way down the rivers that run like arteries through the region, overtop the banks of the Missouri, Platte, Elkhorn, and more. Dams have been destroyed, bridges and other infrastructure have been washed away, and small towns have been cut off from the outside world, surrounded by moats of muddy water. The flooding has also paralyzed the various military bases scattered across the region, with waters lapping up against Fort Leavenworth and Offutt Air Force Base, home U.S. Strategic Command. As Task and Purpose helpfully notes, that means the base that oversees the Pentagons nuclear strategic deterrence and global strike capabilities is largely underwater. 
The situation also neatly illustrates how climate changewhich is leading to more intense precipitationis a threat multiplier.
As of Monday, nine flood gauges operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration remained at major flood stage with another 17 in moderate flood stages. While the on-the-ground photos show the human toll of the floods, satellites are the best way to get a handle on the full scope of whats happening in the Midwest. Below are before and after images captured by the European Space Agencys Sentinel satellites.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","South Carolina has been dealing with flooding since Florence arrived at the coast on September 13. More than a week later, the situation is only worsening for some coastal residents. Potentially record-breaking flood waters are set to inundate areas that didnt see much flooding last week along the northeastern coast of South Carolina, home to the popular Grand Strand beaches. Thats because rain can take a little while to travel downhill through rivers and streams before reaching the ocean. In this case, were talking about rain making its way through the Yadkin-Pee Dee River Basin, which covers more than 7,000 square miles from northern North Carolina to the South Carolina coast. You can think of the Yadkin-Pee Dee River Basin as a bathtub, according to Frank Alsheimer, the science and operations officer at the National Weather Services office in Columbia, South Carolina. This particular event is extremely uncommon. It doesnt matter where you fill up a bathtub with water, its going to fill up anyway because you have edges on either side, Alsheimer told Earther. Any rain that falls, all the way up this far north as northern North Carolina, gets into the basin and very slowly drains down toward the coast. This drainageinto the communities in Georgetown County, South Carolina, as well as the cities of Conway and Myrtle Beachcould affect up to 30,000 people in the area, said Derrec Becker, the chief communications officer at the South Carolina Emergency Management Division to Earther. No mandatory evacuations are in place yet, but many are self-evacuating as they brace for more water. The 11 shelters in South Carolina are just 3 percent occupied so far, Becker told Earther. [The flooding is] probably going to get more severe, he said. Currently, flood waters along the Waccamaw River near Conway, South Carolina, sit at about 20.75 feet, Alsheimer said. This already breaks the previous record of 17.9 feet. And its more than 10 feet above the flood stage for the Waccamaw River, which is fueling the dangerous situation in these areas. Still, an additional two feet of floodwater is forecasted to impact the region by Wednesday. The record-breaking nature of the flood threat speaks to the fact that while rainfall tends to be localized along the basin, this time, the basin got hit from all angles. This particular event is extremely uncommon, Alsheimer said. Were talking about unprecedented levels we havent seen before, and because of that, were going to have a lot of personal suffering of people who live in areas that were never flooded before but will be flooded because of this event. This storm has already left at least 42 people dead throughout North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Its laid the groundwork for a public health crisis due to released animal feces, carcasses, and toxic waste. And some places havent even seen the worst of it.","South Carolina has been dealing with flooding since Florence arrived at the coast on September 13.

Mark Kaufman,"On Wednesday, San Jose Mercury News photojournalist Karl Mondon spotted a man in flooded Guerneville, California rowing through town in a blue dumpster.
A potent atmospheric river a long band of water vapor that often transports ample amounts of moisture to the western U.S. like ""rivers in the sky"" deluged portions of Northern California this week. The Russian River, which winds through the Sonoma County town of Guerneville, reached over 45-feet high and swamped the area, prompting the Sheriff to announce on Twitter that the town had been surrounded by water with no way in or out.  
While California relies heavily on these wintertime atmospheric rivers for its water, scientists expect these storms to grow wetter as Earth's climate heats up. 
""We're likely to see rain in increasingly intense bursts,"" Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said in an interview.
""This really was a firehose aimed at Sonoma County,"" Swain added.

Though it can be challenging to attribute any particular blast of rain to extreme weather stoked by climate change, this destructive event does have a telltale climate fingerprint. 
""It does seem to be another data point suggesting individual atmospheric rivers are becoming wetter,"" said Paul Ullrich, a climate scientist at the University of California at Davis.

""This year is exemplary,"" said Ullrich, noting that atmospheric rivers dumped excessive amounts of rain in California during January. ""It very much supports that hypothesis.""

Generally, scientists expect California's rainy season to become shorter and more contracted but still have about the same amount of rainfall as in the past. That means more extreme deluges. 
Once heavy rains repeatedly hit California, they set the stage for floods. The ground becomes oversaturated with water. 
""That sets up the whole system to overflow,"" said Ullrich.

Future atmospheric rivers are expected to bring loads of water from both the tropics and drier areas over the ocean, said Swain. Due to simple physics, as the atmosphere warms, the air is able to hold more water vapor. Specifically, for every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, the air can hold seven percent more water.

Connie Loizos,"In many ways, it’s the best of times and the worst of times to be a venture capitalist. While money continues to flood into Silicon Valley, the math keeps getting harder to square. At what point do rising valuations stop making sense? How much mental bandwidth does one spend on blockchain technologies? Can the world handle another SoftBank megafund? These are among the many (many) questions we have for a distinguished panel of top investors who are coming together at our giant Disrupt SF show on September 5-7 to discuss what’s happening on the ground, and how they stay above the fray. Among our guests: Megan Quinn, a general partner with the venture firm Spark Capital, who, over the years, has become as well-known in startup circles for her wit as her insights about company-building. (Among her recent tweets: “Any time a late stage company tells me “… and we’ve never done any marketing!!” it has the opposite of the desired effect. Marketing – whether acquisition, brand, performance, etc – is a core competency at pretty much every [company] of consequence building for the long term.”) Quinn knows a thing or two about what companies need to grow, having led a number of early-stage and growth consumer investments for Kleiner Perkins prior to joining Spark and, before that, spending years in product development at both Square and Google. She’s also a straight-shooter when it comes to talking trends. Asked about SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund at a smaller event in San Francisco last year, Quinn was candid about the impact it is having on later-stage funds like the one she is leading, readily noting startups that have met with Spark and other firms about a sub-$100 million round before SoftBank has entered the picture “and is like, here’s $200 million!” Do these “ baby buyouts,” as she’d characterized them at the time, make sense? We’ll ask her! We’re also excited to welcome Sarah Tavel, a Harvard philosophy major turned longtime venture capitalist whose star in the venture industry has been on the rise for years, first at Bessemer Venture Partners, then Greylock Partners, and most recently at Benchmark, the storied venture firm, which convinced Tavel to join its ranks last year. (She became its first, and currently, only, female venture partner.) In between her venture stints, Tavel was also among the first product managers at the digital scrapbook Pinterest, after falling in love with the platform when it was run by five people and joining the company after convincing her colleagues at Bessemer to lead its Series B round. That turned out to be a pretty fantastic move for Bessemer, and for Tavel, who was hired back out of the company by Greylock. Now, Tavel has fallen in to love with crypto, recently making her first bet on the sector with Chainanalysis, which works with law enforcement agencies on virtual currency crimes, among other things. Can Benchmark, which has seemingly approached crypto at arm’s length, stomach much more ? We’ll ask her! Last but not least, we’re thrilled to welcome Aileen Lee, the longtime Kleiner Perkins investor who left in 2012 to form her own venture firm, Cowboy Ventures, and who helped inspire a new generation of women-led venture firms in the process. Lee — who has worked with Bloom Energy (on the cusp of going public ), Dollar Shave Club (acquired by Unilever for $1 billion in 2016), and Accompany ( acquired in May by Cisco) — has more recently helped pioneered something perhaps even more powerful than any individual firm: a network of female VCs who quietly began coming together last year to help elevate other women investors and entrepreneurs. Their express mission: doubling the percentage of women in VC partner roles over the next decade and increasing total funding to female founders by 10 percent within five years. Called “All Raise,” the community, which started with 36 women and grows by the day, is actually hosting a three-part workshop for women founders over two days of Disrupt. (You can learn more about that here.) In the meantime, we’ll be talking with Lee about what she’s seeing at the early-stage consumer and enterprise companies with which Cowboy Ventures meets. Are valuations up or down? Has the market cooled, as is widely believed? Can Silicon Valley firms ignore what’s happening elsewhere, especially in China? We’ll ask her! If you’re looking to better understand what’s happening behind the scenes in venture capital, you won’t want to miss this conversation, taking place on September 5th, the first day of Disrupt. The full agenda is here. Passes for the show are available at the Early-Bird rate until July 25 here.","In many ways, it’s the best of times and the worst of times to be a venture capitalist.

Associated Press,"CINCINNATI (AP) -- The National Weather Service says heavy rains overnight have sent the swollen Ohio River at Cincinnati to its highest point in 20 years. Meteorologist Kristen Cassady says the river reached 60 feet (18.3 meters) Sunday morning, 8 feet (2.4 meters) above flood stage. It's the highest recording since 1997, when the river reached 64.7 feet (19.7 meters). Cassady says rain totals varied between 1.5 and 2.5 inches overnight. She says while no rain is forecast until mid-week, tributaries feeding the Ohio will likely keep the river above flood stage throughout the week.

"Nicole Chavez, CNN","(CNN) South Carolina National Guardsmen allowed deputies to drive around a barricade blocking a flooded road in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence moments before two mental health patients drowned inside the vehicle, authorities say. Two deputies escaped when high water swept away their vehicle on September 18 but they could not pull out the patients on board, the Horry County Sheriff's Office said. Horry County spokeswoman Brooke Holden revealed on Thursday that guardsmen had waved the jail van around a barricade near the Little Pee Dee River in South Carolina. The river was over its flood stage at the time. It's unclear why the guardsmen allowed the jail van to pass. Lt. Col. Cindi King, the South Carolina National Guard's director of public affairs, declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. The sheriff's deputies who drove the prison van -- Stephen Flood and Joshua Bishop -- are on administrative leave with pay, Holden said. The victims were identified as Windy Newton, 45, of Shallotte, North Carolina, and Nicolette Green, 43, of Myrtle Beach. The deputies were transporting the women from Conway, near the coast, to Darlington, about 65 miles northwest. Harrowing police scanner audio provides details of the efforts to save the women, who could be heard talking as rescuers scrambled to save them. ""The officers report they got out. The van is submerged, and they cannot get their inmates out,"" an unidentified person says. Later, someone else reports, ""We have the two deputies that are out of the van and are secure on the boat. The two inmates are in the back of the van -- are still in the van -- and they're talking, and they're working on getting them out now."" The women were ""seat belted"" in the back of the van, Horry County Chief Deputy Tom Fox said. Rescue teams were able to save the deputies from the van's roof. But they could not pull the vehicle from the water because it was too dangerous, the sheriff's office said. The women's bodies were recovered by divers the following day and taken to Medical University of South Carolina for autopsies, officials said. CNN's Dave Alsup, Eliott McLaughlin and Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","South Carolina National Guardsmen allowed deputies to drive around a barricade blocking a flooded road in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence moments before two mental health patients drowned inside the vehicle, authorities say.",2018-09-28T05:18:25Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Two patients transported in police van drown after guardsmen allow it to pass flood barrier,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/28/us/florence-flood-jail-van-drowning/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180919164431-little-pee-dee-river-south-carolina-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,flood-stage,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rachel Becker,"Bill Gates has pledged $12 million in funding to fuel advances toward a universal flu vaccine, STAT News reports. After this year’s devastating flu season, the race for a shot that could protect against a broad range of flu viruses for years on end feels even more urgent — but is $12 million really enough to help? Gates announced the funding today at a conference. Half would come from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the other half would be from the family of Google co-founder Larry Page. The money would be doled out in grants of up to $2 million for individual projects “that are bold and innovative,” the funding website says. Half comes from Bill Gates’ foundation and the other from Google co-founder Larry Page The idea is that the $2 million, paid over two years, would be enough money for researchers to collect preliminary data in animal models. And then the most promising strategies could be eligible to apply for up to another $10 million to take the vaccine candidates to human trials. The foundation is looking for proposals that could be ready to start clinical trials by 2021. Still, the $12 million in seed money seems like a small drop in the flood of funding needed for vaccine development, STAT points out. The National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease spent $64 million on universal flu vaccine research in the 2017 fiscal year alone, according to Bloomberg. And a year without a flu season could still be at least a decade away. The funding proposal also takes aim at the wrong part of the race, according to NPR : there are plenty of promising candidates at the starting line, but fewer have enough funding to actually make it into clinical trials — a key hurdle en route to the finish. ‘’The real bottleneck is getting these experimental vaccines into testing in humans, and that is a very expensive undertaking,” vaccine researcher Sarah Gilbert told NPR. Still, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is funding those efforts from other pots of money. The charity has given more than $9.5 million to support the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai’s efforts to take a universal flu vaccine into human trials, for example. Florian Krammer, a microbiology professor at Mount Sinai who’s working on this project, joked that the team would still be vaccinating mice without the foundation’s support. “They enabled us to start testing our vaccine in humans,” he said in an email to The Verge. He called today’s announcement “a very good step in the right direction.” Paul Radspinner, president and CEO of FluGen, a company that’s working on a candidate universal flu vaccine that uses a genetically modified flu virus, said that today’s announcement was a win for the field. “Having the Gates Foundation throw its weight behind the search for a universal flu vaccine is fantastic news,” he said in an email to The Verge. “We’re not concerned about the size of the investment as I’m sure this is just the first of many announcements by the Foundation about how they will play a significant role in this area.” Gates himself echoed that sentiment, in an interview with STAT. “This is the early-stage money,” he said. “This $12 million isn’t the end of the game.”","Bill Gates has pledged $12 million in funding to fuel advances toward a universal flu vaccine, STAT News reports.

Taylor Hatmaker,"Today in a press conference, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman elaborated on his office’s efforts to investigate the FCC’s flood of fake anti-net neutrality comments while calling for a delay of the agency’s vital net neutrality vote until the source of the fraudulent comments is identified. Schneiderman joined a group of 27 senators who are also calling for a delay on the December 14 vote that is widely expected to repeal Obama-era net neutrality rules. Schneiderman was joined on stage by democratic FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, an Obama-era appointee who was reappointed by the Trump administration. “[It is] incumbent upon the FCC and all of my colleagues to stand back, figure out what’s in this record before us and get to the bottom of these stolen identities,” said Rosenworcel. Schneiderman added that the feedback system was “corrupted” — a fact that he accuses the FCC of being well aware of. According to Schneiderman, the net neutrality feedback process generated more than 23 million total comments, marking an unprecedented level of participation. His office suspects that as many as a million of those comments are linked to stolen identities, including a 13 year old who never submitted a comment, a recently deceased woman and the office of the Attorney General’s own assistant press secretary. He called on government officials in other states that with residents that appear to have “likely victims” to get involved, including California, Missouri, Texas, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Schneiderman cited reports that that half a million of the comments appear to have been filed from Russian email addresses, a fact that net neutrality advocates likely hope will stoke further public interest in the often dry proceedings of the communications regulatory body. Further, Schneiderman notes that 50,000 consumer complaints are missing from the FCC record. The New York Attorney General’s office has been working on getting to the bottom of the fake FCC net neutrality comment controversy for months. Last month, Schneiderman criticized the FCC for its failure to cooperate in his office’s ongoing investigation into the fake comments, which it began in June, making repeated contacts to the FCC over the subsequent five months. Last week, Schneiderman set up a website that allows New Yorkers to report if their name and identifying info was misused to make a fraudulent net neutrality feedback comment appear legitimate. Last month, a dataset analyzing the FCC’s net neutrality comments between April and October of this year revealed that over a million anti-net neutrality comments that flooded the FCC’s system appear to have been sown by spambots, while as many as 99% of the legitimate comments were voicing their support of net neutrality. “There’s no way with this set of corrupted records…[we can] have a vote based on what the American people really think,” Schneiderman said.

"Eliott C. McLaughlin, CNN","(CNN) After the deadly flooding of 2016, Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said Ellicott City was reduced to a ""war zone"" and likened it to the scene of disaster movie set. On Monday, Kittleman said the flooding of 2018 was much nastier. Authorities were still in the assessment stage on a soggy Memorial Day, trying to determine exactly how much worse. Particularly worrying, Kittleman said, is a 25- to 30-foot-wide hole just north of Main Street, where the ground appears to have buckled under the weight of the flooding. ""There are a lot of people whose lives are going to be devastated again, and they've been working so hard to come back and we just need to be there for them and to tell them... all of our resources are there to help them,"" Kittleman said. ""I can't imagine what they're going through. I couldn't imagine what they went through two years ago, and now it's even worse."" The first concern is people. Emergency responders conducted 30 rescues Monday morning as they continued their search for a missing man, identified as Eddison Hermond. Sarah Lopez was at a restaurant, attending a birthday party with Hermond when the flooding began, she told CNN. Hermond left to help a woman rescue her cat from a pet store. Witnesses returned and said Hermond slipped into the river and was carried away, said Lopez, whose husband met Hermond 20 years ago in the US Air Force. As rescuers continue searching for Hermond, there were no reports of deaths or major injuries as of early Monday, Kittleman said. The 2016 flood killed two people, when floodwaters swept away their vehicles. Gas and electricity have been shut down on Main Street, where water ran through buildings as if it were a tributary of the nearby Patapsco River, which swelled to record levels during Sunday's storms. The river is a major waterway that feeds into the Chesapeake Bay. Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric said it will need to survey the damage to its infrastructure before providing a timeline for restoring service. Flooding claimed the old courthouse, Kittleman said, and there are homes on the west end of downtown whose foundations and basements are gone. ""A lot of the businesses, the first floors are gone, like they were two years ago,"" he said. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency Sunday in Howard County. Marked by quaint shops in the bottom floors of brick, stone slab and siding-clad buildings, the historic downtown is a major draw in this community of about 66,000 people located about 12 miles west of Baltimore. Main Street, also known as Frederick Road, was transformed into a waterway over the weekend, as brown water sluiced through town, destroying shops and upending cars. In some areas, the water rose above the buildings' first floors. To understand what authorities were surveying Monday, it's perhaps helpful to understand what happened fewer than two years ago. After 6 inches of rain fell on the flood-prone community in about two hours, residents say the flooding came from nowhere in 2016. In addition to the two people killed, more than two dozen buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed. Residents formed human chains to pluck their neighbors from the rushing waters. Kittleman said at the time that it was the worst devastation in Howard County in 50 years, but the town rallied around the slogan ""Ellicott City Strong"" and got to the arduous work of putting their community back together again. When the rain came Sunday, many residents remained in the throes of recovery. The county was working on stormwater retention ponds and preparing to install additional piping. Money from a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant had just arrived and was slated for repairs and construction, Kittleman said. ""There are things that we are doing. It just can't be done in less than two years,"" he said. ""After the flood in 2016 and working on the recovery there, you can't get things done in a year or two. It just can't happen. And you saw, we get the money from FEMA two years later. That's how it works."" More than 8 inches in 15 hours The river rose 17.8 feet in two hours Sunday afternoon, to 24.1 feet, a record from the previous high of 23.6 feet. The National Weather Service, which issued a flash flood warning for southeastern Howard County through early Monday, reported that parts of the greater Baltimore area got isolated rainfall of more than 9 inches. Three to 6 inches was common throughout the metro area. In parts of Ellicott, more than 8 inches fell between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. Sunday, the weather service said. The eastern portion of the community saw more than 7 inches in that timespan, while the southwestern side of town received more than 5 inches of the wet stuff. There are possibilities that another inch could fall, the NWS said, and though that doesn't sound like much rain, it means trouble for the already saturated ground and burgeoning rivers. Aside from the Patapsco River, there are four other smaller waterways running through and around the Ellicott. The Howard County Department of Fire and Rescue Services urged residents to evacuate downtown or move to higher ground while rescue teams fanned out through the area. They're being asked to stay away from Main Street until authorities can ensure buildings are safe to enter. The Roger Carter Community Center is open for those who need a place to shelter. Gov. Hogan toured the area Sunday with Kittleman. He lamented the destruction, noting that just two weeks earlier, he had visited the historic downtown and spoken with business owners about rebuilding efforts. ""The place looked terrific,"" he said. ""It's just devastating because people have their lives tied up in this and went through a heck of a lot and came back and now they're starting all over again."" Kittleman expressed confidence Monday that Ellicott could make another comeback. ""This is where we're one Howard again, and we'll be one Ellicott City,"" he said. ""We will be stronger in the future. We really will, folks. This is not a place that gives in. We didn't give in in 2016. We're not going to give in in 2018."" Asked what he'd say to downtown business owners who have their doubts about reopening after being hammered twice in 22 months, Kittleman said he sees their side of things. ""I can totally understand what they're saying. If I was in their shoes, I'd probably be reassessing that myself."" CNN's Paul P. Murphy, Lindy Royce, Emanuella Grinberg and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","After the deadly flooding of 2016, Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said Ellicott City was reduced to a ""war zone"" and likened it to the scene of disaster movie set.

Associated Press,"BLADENBORO, N.C. – Major flooding remains in eastern North Carolina more than a week after Hurricane Florence made landfall. Gov. Roy Cooper said Saturday that nine of the state's river gauges are at major flood stage and four others are at moderate stage, while parts of Interstates 95 and 40 will remain underwater for another week or more. Emergency management officials said residents whose homes were damaged or destroyed will begin moving into hotel rooms next week. ""Hurricane Florence has deeply wounded our state, wounds that will not fade soon as the flood waters finally recede,"" Cooper said. South Carolina also has ordered more evacuations as rivers continue to rise in the aftermath of a storm that has claimed at least 43 lives since slamming into the coast more than a week ago. The small farming community of Nichols, South Carolina, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) from the coast, was completely inundated by water, Mayor Lawson Batter said Saturday. He called the situation ""worse than Matthew,"" the 2016 hurricane that destroyed almost 90 percent of the town's 261 homes. Battle said flooding from Florence has wiped out the 150 or so homes rebuilt afterward. ""It's just a mess,"" said Battle, who was awaiting a visit from Gov. Henry McMaster. ""We will try everything we can to come back... but we need to have federal and state help."" In Wilmington, where Hurricane Florence made landfall and which had been cut off by floodwaters, officials said they'd identified three safe routes into town. They encouraged people to avoid travel in areas where the risk of flooding remains. North Carolina Emergency Management Director Michael Sprayberry said Saturday that eastern counties continue to see major flooding, including areas along the Black, Lumber, Neuse and Cape Fear rivers. The Cape Fear river is expected to crest Sunday and remain at flood stage through early next week. He said residents who register with the Federal Emergency Management Agency can begin moving into hotels Monday. The program initially will be open to residents in nine counties, then will be expanded. A FEMA coordinator said about 69,000 people from North Carolina already have registered for assistance. North Carolina environmental officials said they're closely monitoring two sites where Florence's floodwaters have inundated coal ash sites. The National Weather Service confirmed Saturday that 10 tornadoes spawned by Hurricane Florence touched down Monday in Virginia, the strongest of which leveled a flooring company in Chesterfied and killed one worker. An economic research firm estimated that Hurricane Florence has caused around $44 billion in damage and lost output, which would make it one of the top 10 costliest U.S. hurricanes. The top disaster, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, cost $192.2 billion in today's dollars, while last year's Hurricane Harvey cost $133.5 billion Moody's Analytics estimates Florence has caused $40 billion in damage and $4 billion in lost economic output, though the company stressed that the estimate is preliminary and could go higher or lower. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster has estimated damage from the flood in his state at $1.2 billion. He asked congressional leaders to hurry federal aid. ___ Waggoner and Robertson reported from Raleigh, North Carolina.

Harriet McLeod,"CHARLESTON, S.C./RALEIGH, N.C. (Reuters) - Thousands of people in the Georgetown, South Carolina, area were urged to evacuate their homes on Tuesday as rainwater unleashed by Hurricane Florence surged down rivers, threatening to submerge some neighborhoods under 10 feet of water. Georgetown, which sits at the confluence of the Waccamaw, Great Pee Dee and Sampit rivers, was largely spared the initial fury of Florence, which came ashore on Sept. 14 as a Category 1 hurricane, killing 46 people in three states. But the port city of more than 9,000 stands in the path of what the National Weather Service has said could be significant flooding as water dumped by the storm system drains to the ocean. “We are urging people to take this event seriously. We expect the flooding to be worse than Hurricane Matthew a couple years ago,” said Randy Akers, deputy public information officer for Georgetown County. “We always urge people to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.” Akers said between 6,000 and 8,000 people have been exhorted to leave, but it was not clear how many had done so as of Tuesday evening. He said the county lacked authority to mandate evacuations. “We do have some concerns that people are not taking this event as seriously as they should,” he said. Parts of Georgetown could be submerged in up to 10 feet (3 meters) of water in the coming days as the Pee Dee and Waccamaw rivers overrun their banks, the National Weather Service said, adding that the deluge threatened to cut off highways and isolate communities. COAL ASH POND COULD FLOOD In neighboring Conway County, the Waccamaw, which was already well above flood stage on Tuesday, could inundate a coal ash pond that holds more than 200,000 tons of toxic ash, according to Santee Cooper, South Carolina’s state-owned electric and water utility. Santee Cooper said it has removed more than 1 million tons of coal ash, which can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife, from the site in the past few years. The Waccamaw was forecast to crest on Thursday at 22 feet in Conway and at 21.2 feet in Georgetown, a representative with the South Carolina Emergency Management Division said. The potential flood zone encompasses roughly 3,500 homes in Georgetown, 37 miles (60 km) south of Myrtle Beach, and the coastal resort community of Pawleys Island where as many as 8,000 people live, Georgetown County spokeswoman Jackie Broach-Akers said. Authorities warned residents in harm’s way with recorded telephone messages and home visits. The county opened two emergency shelters on Monday, and hotels in nearby Myrtle Beach were offering discounts to evacuees. Public schools were closed until further notice. State transportation crews were working to erect temporary dams on either side of U.S. Highway 17, the main coastal route through the area, and National Guard engineers were installing a floating bridge at Georgetown in case the highway is washed out at the river. In North Carolina, Governor Roy Cooper said on Monday that seven rivers in the southeast part of the state were at major flood stages and three others at moderate flood stages.Meanwhile a new storm was brewing in the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, bringing scattered showers and thunderstorms across the Carolinas on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Florence dumped 30 to 40 inches (75 to 100 cm) of rain on Wilmington, North Carolina, alone. Insured losses from Hurricane Florence will range from $2.8 billion to $5 billion, according to RMS, a risk modeling and analytics firm.

Alice Bell,"Have You Played? is an endless stream of game retrospectives. One a day, every day, perhaps for all time… I really really really like The Flame In The Flood. I am terrible at it, rarely reaching even the mid stage of the river, but I love it. The flood of the title is one that has swept through America, swelling the banks of a regular river until its a wide and treacherous one. Only small islands of safety are left – an old fish bait shop, a homestead, a patch of wilderness – and theyre not even always safe. Sometimes theres a big angry boar or a starving wolf. The flame is you. And your little dog. It’s a survival game, and an unforgiving one, and the reason I like it (when I don’t normally like games like this) is that it doesn’t let you build up a fortress of safety. There is no opportunity to stay put and work on a giant camp with various resource farms around it. Everywhere you stop is quickly stripped of useful bits, if it has any at all, and they dont regenerate. Youre pulled inexorably down river, whilst juggling your needs – hunger, thirst, temperature and sleep. You can die from any of those, or become ill from an infected wound, or get gobbled up by the wolves, or drown as your little raft is smashed against some rocks out in the current. To combat all that you can make better clothes, catch rabbits with snares and cook them over a campfire, reinforce your raft, craft spears and traps, brew up your own penicillin its surprisingly complicated, and finding what you need is usually determined on the roll of a dice. As you explore you poke around rusting school buses, find occasional groups of semi-feral children, or notes about people who used to live in this bit of wilderness. But despite this, The Flame In The Flood is somehow comforting. Its just you and your dog, and the end of the world.","Have You Played? is an endless stream of game retrospectives.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Early this morning, NOAA’s National Tsunami Warning Center issued tsunami warnings for the south coast of Alaska and British Columbia, after a powerful, magnitude 7.9 earthquake rocked the Gulf of Alaska. Tsunami watches were issued for California, Oregon, and Washington State. A few hours later, all watches and warnings had been canceled, leading many Twitter users still-half asleep at their computers to wonder: Why is it so damn hard to predict a tsunami’s strength ahead of time? The reason has to do with the fact that the ocean is very large, and our earthquake and tsunami monitoring infrastructure is relatively limited. As geophysicist Mika McKinnon explained to Earther, a tsunami did arrive, and we predicted its timing pretty damn well. The thing that was—and always is—difficult to predict is the tsunami’s size. “It’s easy to predict when a tsunami will arrive, it is very difficult to predict how big it is going to be,” McKinnon said. “There is a tsunami right now, it just happens to be under a foot tall.” To understand why, it’s useful to start at the source of the event. Tsunamis are essentially massive ripples, emanating out from an area where water was displaced. Think throwing a stone in a pond, only now, the stone is a meteorite the size of a bus, or an undersea volcanic eruption. Or, in this case, a large earthquake. All of these events displace water, creating ripples. Trouble is, it’s very difficult to tell how much water. “How can you tell how the displacement of water was distributed?” McKinnon said. “You’re not going to be able to measure it in the open ocean, where the distance above background is a few inches over a few kilometers. You have to wait for the wave to come to shore and shoal,” the process by which tsunami waves bunch up on shore, the crest-to-crest distance becoming shorter as the height of the wave grows taller. That said, tsunami forecasters aren’t entirely in the dark. McKinnon explained that after an earthquake occurs, the event is thrown into a tsunami modeling system, which gives “a good estimate on travel time.” To determine if a tsunami wave is going to propagate widely, forecasters then turn to the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) network, a series of ocean buoys maintained by NOAA that detect the pressure of waves from a passing tsunami. “People regularly die at this stage in a tsunami.” A series of graphics tweeted out by the National Weather Service Tsunami Alert Center this morning show the location of those DART buoys relative to the recent quake, and predicted arrival times for the tsunami wave. Looking at the prediction maps tweeted out over the last few hours, you can see that arrival times don’t change very much—again, the speed of a tsunami, which depends largely on the depth of the ocean, is something we’re quite good at predicting: The final piece of the puzzle for understanding a tsunami event is tide gauges (those orange dots on the Tsunami Alert maps), which measure ocean surface displacement near the shore. It isn’t until we have that tide gauge data—plus any human observations—that we can really say how big the tsunami event is going to be. Tsunamis look different from the normal ebb and flow of the tide. As the National Weather Service explains, when they come ashore they move like a “fast-rising flood or a wall of water.” Another tell is if the water drains away suddenly, exposing the ocean floor and appearing like a very low tide. Powerful tsunamis that cause large changes to the water level can lead to flooding over a mile inland, according to the NWS. Sometimes, as was the case this morning, we get lucky and tsunami events are minor. But it’s important to note that even if a tsunami generates little flooding, it can still be deadly. Monster waves or no, tsunamis carry a lot of energy. Plus, the first wave isn’t necessarily the largest one, and depending on the bathymetry of the shoreline, waves can pile up and become bigger in certain locations. (Bays can funnel water in, causing waves to interfere constructively and get taller.) That’s where human reports are very useful, but in the case of this morning’s tsunami, such reports were few and far between. Fact of the matter is, there just aren’t that many people living on the south coast of Alaska. Given the complexity of the situation, McKinnon said it’s a good idea to stay out of the water for a few hours after a tsunami warning is lifted. “People regularly die at this stage in a tsunami,” McKinnon said. “They get in the water because it looks like a normal surf, and there are really intense currents and they die.”","Early this morning, NOAA’s National Tsunami Warning Center issued tsunami warnings for the south coast of Alaska and British Columbia, after a powerful, magnitude 7.9 earthquake rocked the Gulf of Alaska.

(Photo: Daniel Mears, The Detroit News) Buy Photo The system that brought record high temperatures and rainfall to Metro Detroit on Tuesday is set to linger through the night, sparking more showers and warmer-than-average readings. “A brief lull in precipitation will be possible for communities located across the southern Metro region, but this will not mark the end of the event as a cold front will bring additional rain to the area tonight and overnight,” National Weather Service officials said in a statement. “Additionally, a rumble of thunder is not out of the question as the cold front moves through.” Metro Detroit tied a record high of 63 Tuesday as showers continued. Rainfall amounts between a half and three-quarters of an inch are possible by dawn as the mercury hovers in the 40s. A flood warning continues through Wednesday afternoon. “Urban, low lying and poor drainage areas prone to flooding will be most susceptible,” the weather service noted in its flood watch for southeast Michigan. “Rises on area rivers, streams and creaks are expected, with the potential for minor flooding to occur.” AAA also issued a statewide flood alert, citing these factors as a “triple threat” to roads. A thunderstorm is possible before 8 a.m., followed by more showers and wind gusts as high as 18 mph, the weather service said.

(Photo: Daniel Mears, The Detroit News) The thermometer should drop into the 20s at night as skies clear. Thursday’s forecast calls for highs in the upper 30s, about average in late February, weather service records show. That’s a shift from Tuesday, which seemed more like spring. Detroit Metro Airport tied a record high, 63, last set in 2016, according to the weather service. More than 1.10 inches of rain fell, beating the previous record of 1.07 set in 1891. Other rainfall totals since Monday include 2.73 inches in Pinckney; 1.95 inches in White Lake Township; and 1.88 inches in Farmington Hills. By Tuesday night, the National Weather Service reported moderate flooding in Clinton Township after the Clinton River reached its 16-foot flood level. The Rouge River was 1.36 feet above its 12-foot flood stage in Southfield and 1.16 feet above the 15-foot flood level in Detroit, the weather service reported. The Huron River in Ann Arbor was at 14.53 feet, near the 16-foot flood level, according to the weather service. The rainfall caused flooding in Redford Township, police said, where officials closed Graham at Lennane for hours, in Canton Township on Sheldon Road and on Hanover in Dearborn Heights. “Due to the heavy rainfall, frozen ground conditions coupled with rapidly melting snow, many of the ponds, creeks and streams in the area are at capacity,” city officials said in a statement. “Sheldon Road is currently closed between Palmer Road and Geddes Road due to flooding of the Lower Rouge River. Sheldon will only be open to local traffic until the water recedes. Motorists are advised to avoid driving onto roads that are covered with water. Even a shallow depth of fast-moving flood water produces more force than most people imagine.” AAA advises drivers to avoid flooded roads and standing water, to drive slow, to avoid using cruise control, and to check their tires. The insurance company says about 5,700 car crash deaths per year in America occur on wet pavement. Michigan State Police also warned to prepare for flooding. “Floods can be both damaging and life-threatening,” said Capt. Chris A. Kelenske, deputy state director of emergency management for the state police, in a statement. The Road Commission for Oakland County also urges drivers to use caution on gravel roads. The snow melt and rain causes roads to soften, become bumpy and has “contributed to washout-like conditions, especially in hilly areas,” the commission said in a statement. Further north, the Mackinac Bridge was closed to traffic due to ice falling from the cables and towers on the bridge.

Harriet McLeod,"CHARLESTON, S.C./RALEIGH, N.C. (Reuters) - The port city of Georgetown, South Carolina braced on Wednesday for flooding touched off by Hurricane Florence, as emergency management officials urged residents to evacuate despite forecasts that scaled back the threat of 10-foot high water. Florence, which crashed ashore two weeks ago as a Category 1 hurricane and killed 46 people in three states, has since dissipated, but the storm’s torrential rainfall threatens to swamp the Georgetown as it drains toward the ocean. Forecasts now show floodwaters rising 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters) in Georgetown, which sits at the confluence of the Waccamaw, Great Pee Dee and Sampit rivers about 30 miles (50 km) south of Myrtle Beach, considerably lower than initially feared. “We’re encouraging people not to let their guard down though, because just as quickly as forecasts change in our favor, they can change against us,” said Jackie Broach-Akers, a spokeswoman for the Georgetown County Emergency Management Operations Center. Despite bright sun on Wednesday, Broach-Akers said officials were urging 6,000 to 8,000 residents to leave their homes, with rivers expected to crest in Georgetown on Friday morning and remain above flood stage for four or five days. “(The sunshine) makes it harder to believe that something bad is right around the corner,” she said. The North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies said preliminary research suggests that Florence was among the rainiest storms to hit the United States in some 70 years. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said the river flooding caused by Florence, which dropped nearly 20 inches (50 cm) of rain in some places in the state, is something his state has not had to cope with before. ‘FULL BATTLE MODE’ “This is unprecedented and we are still in full battle mode,” McMaster said at a press briefing on Wednesday at Emergency Management Division headquarters in Columbia, the state capital. Flooding has already destroyed 46 homes in the state, significantly damaged more than 1,000 and forced 11,000 people to flee their homes, including 3,000 in Georgetown, EMD Director Kim Stenson told reporters. In Conway County, where the Waccamaw was already well above flood stage, South Carolina’s state-owned electric and water utility, said floodwaters stopped rising before inundating a pond that holds more than 200,000 tons of toxic coal ash. “The river’s rise has slowed and we think it’s cresting today,” utility spokeswoman Mollie Gore said from the site, where 115 workers had shored up the dam around the pond. “We still have a foot between the top of the river and the top of the dam.” Santee Cooper said it has removed more than 1 million tons of coal ash, which can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife, from the site in the past few years. The Waccamaw was expected to crest by late Thursday at 21.2 to 26.4. feet in the upriver communities of Conway and Bucksport, the National Weather Service Southeast River Forecast Center in Atlanta said. “This is going to be a very long flooding event,” said John Atwell, a weather service hydrologist. Some 1 to 2 inches of rain moving into the central and western parts of the state in a next day or two will prolong the flooding, said meteorologist Rich Otto of the weather service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. “Any additional rainfall is just going to filter into those rivers,” Otto said. Crews worked to erect temporary dams on either side of U.S. Highway 17, the main coastal route through the area, and National Guard engineers were installing a floating bridge at Georgetown in case the highway is washed out at the river.

Joseph D. Lyons,"Florence has taken the lives of two more people — this time while in law enforcement custody as they were transferred between health facilities. Horry County Sheriff's deputies were transporting two women when the van they were riding in was submerged in flood waters. The two ""detained"" women who died in Florence floodwaters were mental health patients. Brooke Holden, the Horry County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson, told Bustle in a statement that the vehicle — staffed by two deputies — was traveling on Highway U.S. 76 from Conway to Darlington. That's a drive of about an hour and 20 minutes in good conditions. This area of South Carolina is inland to the northwest from Myrtle Beach. Holden said when the vehicle was about half a mile from the Little Pee Dee River, it was ""overtaken by floodwaters."" She said that the deputies who were in the vehicle tried to free the two women but were unable to do so. ""The two deputies attempted to extricate the persons being transported,"" Holden said. ""Despite persistent and ongoing efforts, floodwater rose rapidly and the deputies were unable to open the doors to reach the individuals inside the van."" The deputies were rescued and by a high water rescue team from the top of the van and transported to a local hospital, local TV station WLOS reported. The vehicle remains in the floodwaters due to rising waters and dangerous conditions, although the ""recovery effort"" is ongoing. Horry County Sheriff Phillip Thompson says in a statement provided to Bustle, ""Tonight's incident is a tragedy. Just like you, we have questions we want answered. We are fully cooperating with the State Law Enforcement Division to support their investigation of this event."" The two women were first described as inmates but that was clarified in later reports, according to local news channel WPDE. They were confirmed dead by the Marion County Coroner, although they have not yet been publicly identified by name. ""They were trying to negotiate through fast-running water, and it just didn't work out,"" Marion County Coroner Jerry Richardson told the AP. South Carolina's State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) will investigate the incident. Bustle reached out to the SLED for more information on their investigation. The law enforcement agency confirmed to WPDE that they were sending agents to the area. The WMBF news team reported that the Little Pee Dee River has been at flood stage since the weekend and won't crest until Friday when it is projected to reach 16 feet — a full seven above normal flood stage. The road conditions in South Carolina were widely reported, even as early as Tuesday morning, as a ""growing web of road closures,"" according to Jennifer Berry Hawes at The Post and Courier, who also reported Tuesday morning that there were 60 road closures in just Horry County. The Horry County Sheriff's Office posted many warnings about the floodwaters on its Facebook and Twitter page earlier on Tuesday. ""WE’RE HERE FOR YOU,"" the office's Facebook post, shared from the county's emergency management office, said. ""Our hearts go out to those affected by the flooding in our County, and we hope you know that we are here for you no matter what may come. #TeamHorry is out in the streets working to ensure that everyone stays safe and dry, and we’ll be here until everyone goes home."" The death of the two women brings the total count of those killed by the storm to 37.","Bustle Two ""Detained"" Women Died In Florence Floodwaters While Trapped In A Sheriff Van Bustle Florence has taken the lives of two more people — this time while in law enforcement custody as they were transferred between health facilities.

Eli Meixler,"Flooding from Hurricane Florence, which battered the Carolinas this month, is so severe that NASA was able to spot darkened, contaminated rivers flowing into the Atlantic Ocean. Nearly 8 trillion gallons of rain fell on North Carolina during the storm, according to the National Weather Service in Raleigh. That deluge took a devastating toll, swelling rivers and inundating homes. NASA satellite images released this week reveal just how engorged, and polluted the rivers and other waterways became. One image, captured on Sept. 19, indicates that “soils, sediments, decaying leaves, pollution, and other debris have discolored the water in the swollen rivers, bays, estuaries, and the nearshore ocean,” according to NASA. The discoloration is visible as navy blue and black tributaries spilling from the coast in unsettling plumes. A second image from NASA’s Landsat 8 combines visible and infrared imagining to trace the amount “ colored dissolved organic matter ” (CDOM). CDOM, which includes detritus like leaves, roots and bark, appeared in “high” concentrations even in the ocean around North Carolina’s Cape Lookout. NASA also released an image of the Trent River, which swelled to an all-time high of 29 feet on Sept. 17, according to the National Weather Service. The river more than doubled “flood stage,” or the height at which a river overflows its banks and causes damage nearby. Hurricane Florence crashed into the Carolinas on Sept. 14, shattering rainfall records and causing “catastrophic flash flooding” that claimed dozens of lives. By Sept. 18, sixteen rivers had breached their “flood stage”, according to the North Carolina Department of Public Safety. Rivers swollen by Florence also poured into industrial facilities like coal ash dumps and hog farm manure pits in North Carolina, raising environmental concerns that the floodwaters could spread pollution across the state. This week, lawmakers began considering a $1.7 billion relief package to fund recovery efforts after the storm.","Flooding from Hurricane Florence was so severe that NASA could see darkened, contaminated rivers flowing into the Atlantic Ocean",2018-09-26T08:16:34Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",NASA Captures Polluted Carolina Rivers Spilling Into the Ocean After Hurricane Florence,http://time.com/5406624/nasa-carolina-river-pollution-hurricane-florence/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/rts21drj.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Photo “Moose Murders,” a crime on stage. Credit Ruby Washington/The New York Times “The simple answer,” he conceded to The Times, “is yes.” Reviews were brutal. Brendan Gill of The New Yorker said it “would insult the intelligence of an audience consisting entirely of amoebas.” Dennis Cunningham of CBS advised, “If your name is Arthur Bicknell, change it.” (In one account, a woman leaving the theater shouted to a police officer, “Arrest this play!”) Here’s the Times review by Frank Rich, who years later would call it “the worst play I’ve ever seen on a Broadway stage.” In the years since its ill-fated debut, “Moose Murders” has gained notoriety, if not respect. In 2011, Mr. Bicknell published “ Moose Murdered : How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love My Broadway Bomb.”) In fact, there have been revivals of “Moose Murders” around the world — and at least one comical twist.

JIM SALTER / AP,"(ST. LOUIS) — Residents in parts of southwestern Iowa were forced out of their homes Sunday as a torrent of Missouri River water flowed over and through levees.
Heavy rainfall and snowmelt forced river levels across several Midwestern states to dangerous levels. At least two deaths were blamed on flooding, and two other men have been missing for days. While river levels on Sunday were starting to level off in Nebraska, other residents in Iowa, Kansas and Missouri were bracing for worse flooding to come.
The Missouri River reached 30.2 feet (9.2 meters) Sunday in Fremont County, Iowa, in the state’s far southwestern corner, 2 feet (0.6 meter) above the record set in 2011. People in the towns of Bartlett and Thurman were being evacuated as levees were breached and overtopped.
County Emergency Management Director Mike Crecelius said it wasn’t just the amount of the water, it was the swiftness of the current that created a danger.
“This wasn’t a gradual rise,” Crecelius said. “It’s flowing fast and it’s open country — there’s nothing there to slow it down.”
Thurman has about 200 residents. About 50 people live in Bartlett.
Lucinda Parker of Iowa Homeland Security &amp; Emergency Management said nearly 2,000 people have been evacuated at eight Iowa locations since flooding began late last week. Most were staying with friends or family. Seven shelters set up for flood victims held just a couple dozen people Saturday night.
Hundreds of people remained out of their homes in Nebraska, but rivers there were starting to recede. The National Weather Service said the Elkhorn River remained at major flood stage but was dropping. It was expected to dip back below flood stage by Tuesday. U.S. 30 reopened near Arlington on Saturday.
The flooding is blamed on at least two deaths. Aleido Rojas Galan, 52, of Norfolk, Nebraska, was swept away in floodwaters Friday night in southwestern Iowa, when the vehicle he was in went around a barricade. Two others in the vehicle survived — one by clining to a tree. On Thursday, James Wilke, 50, of Columbus, Nebraska, died when a bridge collapsed as he used a tractor to try and reach stranded motorists.
Two men remain missing. A Norfolk man was seen on top of his flooded car late Thursday before being swept away. Water also swept away a man after a dam collapse.
In St. Joseph, Missouri, home to 76,000 people, volunteers were helping to fill sandbags to help secure a levee protecting an industrial area. Calls were out for even more volunteers in hopes of filling 150,000 sandbags by Tuesday, when the Missouri River is expected to climb to 27 feet — 10 feet above technical flood stage.
The rising Mississippi River also was creating concern. The Mississippi was already at major flood level along the Iowa-Illinois border, closing roads and highways and swamping thousands of acres of farmland. Moderate Mississippi River flooding was expected at several Missouri cities, including St. Louis.
Flooding has also been reported in Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.

Hillary Leung,"Large parts of the U.S. could experience a “potentially unprecedented flood season” through May as forecasts anticipate record levels of precipitation, according to a report released Thursday.
More than 200 million people in 25 states are at risk, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) warned.
Much of the Midwest, including Nebraska, Minnesota and Iowa, has already be hit with historic flooding this year after the wettest winter in known history. Parts of Mississippi and the Red River of the North basin received rain and snow up to 200 percent above normal, according to NOAA’s spring outlook.
Last week, thousands were forced to evacuate their homes as a “bomb cyclone” storm prompted emergency declarations across Midwestern states. In Nebraska, heavy rain and snowmelt killed at least three and left two missing. Gov. Pete Ricketts called the weather event “the most devastating flooding we’ve probably ever had in our state’s history.”
Officials say this deluge is “a preview” of the spring flood forecast, according to the Washington Post.
“We expect the flooding to get worse and become more widespread,” said Mary Erikson, deputy director of NOAA’s National Weather Service, told the Post. “The stage is set for record flooding now through May.”
According to the NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, the April to June period will see above average precipitation in the majority of the country, increasing the flood risk, which could be further compounded by melting snow. Major or moderate flooding is forecast for 25 states.
“The areas of greatest risk for moderate to major flooding include the upper, middle, and lower Mississippi River basins including the mainstem Mississippi River, Red River of the North, the Great Lakes, eastern Missouri River, lower Ohio, lower Cumberland, and Tennessee River basins,” the outlook report says.
Nearly two-thirds of the Lower 48 states are expected to be at “elevated” risk of flooding this spring.
“[The flooding] could be worse than anything we have seen in recent years,” Erikson said.

Jonathan Shieber,"A slew of well-funded new entrants backed by massive amounts of capital are chasing Tesla’s lead in an effort to power the next generation of the electric vehicle industry. Electric vehicle startups have raised more than $2 billion in the U.S. over the first months of 2018 alone, a huge increase over the $650 million raised in 2017, according to data from PitchBook. And the investment trends point to more competition for Tesla from established car companies and upstart manufacturers alike in the next few years. All of this activity is thanks to the size of the industry that’s in play. The market for electric passenger vehicles is expected to reach $356.5 billion by 2023 led by $205.9 billion in sales coming from the Asia-Pacific region, according to predictions from the market intelligence firm, Absolute Reports. Given those numbers, it’s no wonder that investments into electric vehicle companies and the enabling technologies for them keep climbing — and most of the cash commitments are being made in newly formed companies. PitchBook data indicates that early-stage deals are on the rise, with 15 investments into startup electric vehicle companies in 2017. (It’s important to note that PitchBook data, and the work of other market intelligence firms, is somewhat fuzzy and imprecise.) In 2018, first investments accounted for the bulk of the $2 billion raised. Many of these electric vehicle challengers emerged from the wreckage of other companies that had sought the pole position in the race for auto-industry dominance. Several new companies have emerged from the collapse of Faraday Future and Fisker Automotive, even as both companies found themselves reborn with new leases on life thanks to redoubled capital commitments from global billionaires, Chinese companies awash in money and traditional venture firms angling for a shot at Tesla’s market dominance. Tesla’s terrible, horrible, no good, very bad year (to date) While the size of the electric vehicle market is one factor motivating the competition, another is the series of miscues from Tesla, the independent electric vehicle market leader, which has competitors wondering if the wheels are coming off Elon Musk’s big bet. By any measure, Tesla has had a very bad year. Consumer Reports just issued a report saying it could not recommend the company’s latest offering, the Model 3. And production for that new car, the company’s first effort to manufacture a low-cost electric vehicle, has caused innumerable problems for Musk and his staff. Cost overruns have outlets like Bloomberg speculating that Tesla wouldn’t have enough cash to make it through the calendar year. The company spends exorbitant amounts of money compared to its established automaker competitors. The company’s staff has ballooned from fewer than 1,000 employees in 2010 to nearly 40,000 now, according to Bloomberg, and competitors like GM and Ford bring in 2.5 times as much revenue for each employee compared with Tesla. Production problems are also compounded by an aggressive schedule for new vehicles, which has the Tesla hype machine calling for a new Roadster, a crossover car and an electric semi truck all supposedly coming to market in the next few years. Stalled production and cost overruns aren’t Tesla’s only concerns. The NTSB is investigating the company’s liability in another deadly crash involving its autonomous systems and top executives have been bolting for the exits in what Musk categorized as a “flattening” of his company’s management structure. No wonder executives at new startups just now entering the market may be thinking that Musk and Tesla may no longer be in the drivers’ seat. Karma Revero (PRNewsFoto/Karma Automotive) U.S. startups take their marks It’s against this backdrop that competitors like Evelozcity and Independent Electric Vehicles, two startups born from the wreckage of Faraday Future (the once-relevant Tesla competitor) have come to market to potentially challenge Tesla’s supremacy. While Independent Electric Vehicles has stayed under the radar — with not much known about the company other than Jalopnik’s report of Chinese backers and an executive team headed in part by Steve Osario, Faraday’s former head of design operations and advanced model development — Evelozcity has made a splash. From its base in Los Angeles, Evelozcity boasts a $1 billion commitment from undisclosed international backers and a seasoned executive team (culled primarily from Faraday Future) that includes the former chief financial officer of BMW, Stefan Krause; Richard Kim, who was instrumental in the development of BMW’s i3 and i8; and Karl Thomas-Neumann, who joined the company from GM’s European division. Two other companies in the Los Angeles area, the Irvine, Calif.-based Karma Automotive and a newly reborn Fisker Inc. also have cars they’re putting into the market — along with a rebooted Faraday Future, which reportedly received a billion-dollar investment from a white knight before it was forced into insolvency. What most of these would-be Tesla competitors have in common is a determination not to eschew the principles of auto manufacturing in favor of a completely new approach. “There will be a lot of room to grow for many,” said one executive at a new early-stage electric vehicle company. “If I look at the combustion engine industry… when it started you had thousands of companies competing for a much smaller market.” Global competition and China’s potential to race ahead If new entrants in the U.S. aren’t worrying enough for Tesla, then the deluge of electric vehicle startups coming from China should. An article in The South China Morning Post listed 10 startups coming from the world’s new economic powerhouse with a combination of capital and manufacturing muscle that could spell real trouble for other independent electric vehicle and autonomous driving-focused automakers. “Tesla paved the way, now we’re taking this a step further,” Padmasree Warrior, the head of the U.S. arm of Shanghai-based electric vehicle startup, NIO, told The Wall Street Journal. “We have a mission to transform mobility.” That Chinese investors should push so aggressively into the market isn’t surprising (remember that the Asia-Pacific region will account for $205.9 billion in sales), and global numbers show that investors are already anticipating that rising wave of demand. There are at least 34 new, early-stage startups that were launched in 2017 alone to tackle the electric vehicle ecosystem. Of the companies mentioned by The SCMP, six are squarely focused on electrification. They include Byton, a company backed by one of China’s best (and most government-connected) funds, Legend Capital; along with the auto manufacturer Harmony Auto and League Automotive Technologies. Byton expects to begin production in 2019 and has a seasoned executive team from some of the world’s best manufacturers. Nio’s backers aren’t too shabby either, given that they include Chinese tech giants, Baidu, Tencent Holdings and Xiaomi. Financial investors include the global venture capital powerhouse Sequoia Capital and domestic dynamo Hillhouse Capital. And the trinity of Tencent, Baidu and Sequoia are also backing another electric vehicle competitor in WM Motor, another Shanghai-based Tesla challenger that has automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding as another pillar in its foundation. Arrayed against those three new entrants are four other companies like Xiaopeng Motors (backed by two tech titans — Alibaba and Foxconn — and four sterling investors in IDG Capital, Yunfeng Capital, CICC and Morning Ventures); Singulator Motor, which has backing from the Tongling government; and CHJ Automotive, a company backed by two players in the automotive industry, Zhejiang Leo Group and Changzhou Wunan New Energy Car. Anyone who wonders what effect a flood of Chinese manufacturers can have on a market would do well to look at the role Chinese companies played in significantly driving down the cost of solar panels and wind turbines — and the ways those suppliers now control global renewable energy markets. The Byton connected car is seen during its launch at CES 2018 in Las Vegas on January 7, 2018. MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images Big Auto’s big bet Even as these companies raise billions in commitments from investors to build the next generation of electric vehicles, the big automakers that first developed the technology (and then subsequently shelved it) are placing their own massive bets on electrification. As Reuters reported at the beginning of the year, big auto is committing at least $90 billion to electrify at least some of their most popular vehicles over the coming years. The big car companies are motivated in part by the competition they see coming from Tesla and startups, but more importantly from government regulations in China, Europe and potentially the U.S. “There are three contenders for this huge market opportunity,” said one executive at an upstart electric vehicle company, speaking on background. “The first is the OEMs. But they had to learn from Tesla how to do it.” Originally, these companies were skeptical about market adoption, but now, with China leading the charge toward electrification through regulation they have no choice. “The government will push it,” this executive said. “But the government will then have to deal with the principle of increased margins and higher costs for consumers.” For this executive, in these still-early days of mass electrification the two companies that are most committed are GM and Volkswagen. Beyond big auto, this executive also said that big tech — namely Alphabet, the parent company of Google and the autonomous driving company, Waymo, and Apple — represent the biggest competitive threat. The leader of the pack? Despite all of the competitors shifting into overdrive, Musk’s Tesla still remains the company to beat — even with its many missteps. The fact remains that Musk is the first person to build a new, independent automaker in the last century. That’s no small feat, but it accomplished in a vastly different competitive environment. It’s easy to win a race when there are only two or three other cars to beat. It remains to be seen how well Tesla can do when it faces a full field.",A slew of well-funded new entrants backed by massive amounts of capital are chasing Tesla’s lead in an effort to power the next generation of the electric vehicle industry.

Claire Reilly,"James Marsden plays robot host Teddy Flood in Westworld. John P. Johnson/HBO James Marsden is the poster boy for charming robots. In Sydney this week to promote Westworld, he was on stage in front of a giant poster of himself playing sentient robot Teddy Flood in the HBO show. Marsden might have ditched the cowboy hat and stubble in real life, but he still looks like a theme park's version of a perfect human. But the good guy Teddy of season one (who died five times but was still so gosh-darn polite) has made way for a darker Teddy in season two. Now, his character is joining forces with other robot hosts on the show to rise up against the humans that run Westworld -- and things are looking bloody. Hell yes. Still, as his character rebels against his creators on screen, Marsden is hoping artificial intelligence doesn't get that far in the real world. ""Not to be overly cynical about the whole thing, but I know that we are a culture of people who get excited about new,"" he says. ""We get excited about progress, we get excited about what's next. And not always do we think, 'Should we do this? What are the repercussions of this happening?' ""I hope we don't get to a point where our creation takes over us or renders us obsolete."" Westworld has been playing with the ideas of human consciousness and artificial intelligence for two seasons now, delighting and confusing fans in equal measure and generating plenty of fodder for fan-theory threads on Reddit. (Marsden says he was often just as in the dark about big plot twists in the show and eventually began ""surrendering to not knowing."") But while Marsden does worry about AI and often thinks we ""rely on technology too much"", he's still fascinated by that line between human and machine. ""At the core of the show, it is asking what it means to be human,"" he says. ""If you have these sentient creatures who are programmed to accrue memories, have experiences, exhibit human-like emotion and behaviour -- what keeps them from being human? ""If a thing that's made out of nuts and bolts and wires can have a soul or feel, how is that any lesser than a human being?"" It's a question we can expect to see thrashed out even more in season two, as everyone from the not-so-sweet Dolores to the woman-on-a-mission Maeve question their reality and why they should have to submit to their human masters. As Dolores says, they are the ""creatures who look and talk like us, but they are not like us."" Marsden is excited to see how fans react to the hosts taking back the power and becoming a little less innocent. ""The whole first season the hosts were the ones that you empathised with. What happens when the power dynamic shifts and this group of people now have the strong hold?"" he says. ""It'll be interesting to see where the audiences empathies lie."" Sitting down with Marsden in Sydney, it's hard not to see the similarities between him and the show's hosts. After all, as an actor, singer, dancer and former Versace model, he can seemingly do everything. How do we really know he's not a robot? ""You don't,"" he says. Now I'm the one questioning my own reality. You can watch season two of Westworld on Sundays on HBO (and be sure to catch our Westworld Morning After After Show every Monday too).

Gina Martinez,"A series of photos of a rising North Carolina river over three days shows the historic scale of the flooding in parts of North Carolina – even as the storm formerly known as Hurricane Florence moves slowly out of the Carolinas. The Cape Fear River in Fayetteville was at 60.1 feet and still rising as of noon Tuesday. It’s projected to crest at 61.6 feet, which is far from the 1945 record of 68.9 feet, but higher than the 58.9 feet it reached after Hurricane Matthew, according to the National Weather Service. The Cape Fear River expected to spread to a width of up to 2 miles, with several thousand homes and business threatened. As the city of Fayetteville begins to flood, up to 150 homes will be threatened, according to the National Weather Service. The flood waters aren’t expected to recede to normal levels until late Friday – one week after the hurricane made landfall. The Cape Fear River is just one of several major rivers that are spilling over their banks after Hurricane Florence brought massive storm surge and record rainfall to North and South Carolina. More than 25 inches of rain fell on inland parts of North and South Carolina – deluging streams and rivers with vast amounts of water. Lumber River in Lumberton is also at a Major Flood Stage with 21.9 feet of water, breaking the previous record of 21.8 feet, the National Weather Service said. The floodwaters are inching closer to the local Pepsi plant and dozens of homes will be isolated and inundated. Several roads will be closed near the river. Flooding is expected to continue there for the next few days. As of Tuesday, the death toll from Florence was at 32 and rising, with 24 of those deaths taking place in North Carolina, according to the Associated Press. The National Hurricane Center downgraded Florence to a tropical depression, but warned that catastrophic flash fooding, river flooding and landslides are still expected in western North Carolina and southwestern Virginia. On Sunday, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper warned residents at a press conference to steer clear of flooded areas in the upcoming days. “Never drive through flooded roads. Just a few inches of water can wash your car away,” Cooper said. Last week Mike Doll, Senior Meteorologist at Accuweather, warned that residents near the Cape Fear River and other low-lying areas next to streams, creeks and rivers, should prepare for river flooding. “Once the last drops of rain [have] occurred doesn’t mean problems are over,” he said. “People that live in flood-prone areas near creeks and rivers need to be prepared. Even after the rain has ended, residents should still pay attention.”",A series of photos of a rising North Carolina river over three days shows the historic scale of the flooding in parts of North Carolina – even as the storm formerly known as Hurricane Florence moves slowly out of the Carolinas.

Jason Parham,"Out of the typhoon that was Alabama’s special senate election, it was black women in particular who showed up in force for Doug Jones, the Democratic challenger. According to exit polls, an overwhelming 98% of black women voted for Jones, with 93% of black men backing the former US attorney—ultimately propelling him to a bone-thin upset over scandal-plagued Republican nominee Roy Moore. The numbers were especially surprising given how much pre-election punditry focused on the lack of mobilization among black Alabamians. Yet, amid the ensuing flood of news and analysis, it was a headline from Bossip—a website known to exalt and skewer black celebrities with equal fervor—that cut against the collective jubilation with bulls-eye precision, grounding the moment in an easily overlooked reality: “Black Women Saved Your Lil Wack A$$ Country Again. You’re Welcome. Now Where’s Our Money?” The headline teemed with flair and lacked any morsel of subtlety; it was pure velocity. It was also the norm for a site that in recent months has emerged as a singular voice in entertainment media. Bossip, by definition, is a gossip blog that reports on public and private figures in the black cultural vortex of reality TV, film, music, and professional sports. And though the site has been in existence since 2006, it wasn’t until this year that it began experimenting with its shamelessly, in-your-face headline virtuosity. Upon the release of the Black Panther trailer in October, Bossip offered its own perspective of the online pandemonium surrounding one of its stars, Michael B. Jordan. According to the post, sight of the actor in the preview “shattered the whole entire internet before noon.” (Jordan’s good looks are a recurring topic among certain communities, online and off.) The headline that accompanied it was even more toothsome in its cultural rigor: “Poon-Sizzling Villain Bae Michael B. Jordan Is Destroying Dashiki Drawls Across Wakanda.” Bossip was there, too, when Taylor Swift issued Reputation in November. And when a BuzzFeed article referred to the singer as ""aggressively white,"" thus sparking an online melee between defensive fans and Black Twitter, it was a Bossip headline that perfectly captured the pandemonium: “Taylor Swift’s Tapioca-Splattered New Album Sparked Hilariously Petty Hysteria."" On the site, no topic is off limits—discussion of Drake’s personal affairs (“Drake Rumored To Be Homeboy Humping Bella Hadid’s Airmax Loving Cakes After The Weeknd”) stand side-by-side with posts about star chef Mario Batali’s carnivorous past (“Bafangool! Marinated Pork Shoulder Mario Batali Admits To Sexually Assaulting Several Of His Women Employees”) and Olympian Simone Biles' style choices (“Call Gabby Douglas: Simone Biles Claps Back At Messy Miserables Roasting Her Hair”). Just this week, Bossip referred to the mother of Keaton Jones, the Tennessee boy whose anti-bullying video went viral, as “JoKlan The Scammer” after photos of her posing with a confederate flag were made public. Even Donald Trump has become a recurring target on the site. His many nicknames include: “Cheeto-Crusted Chump-In-Chief,” “PERVY Potus,” “Delusional Donny,” “Creepy Cop-A-Feeler-In-Chief” and “Dusty Dorito Diablo Trump,” to name but five. For me, and many people I know, Bossip headlines have become a joy of their own. They’re fat with drama and posture and ruthless humor. Each headline is volcanic, erupting like a great mass of heat, or a crack of thunder, full of fire and cultural insight, all of it done with great ceremony. In one recent interview, a Bossip editor spoke to the emergence of certain phrases—such as “smash those cakes to smithereens”—in crafting headlines, saying: “It’s all about making it more visual and being more specific.” Bossip belongs to a class of digital tabloids that cover black culture with a penetrating eye and a lust for the sensational. During its height, from 2011-2014, MediaTakeout was known as a kind of “Black TMZ”—feared for its eagerness to air celebrity dirt but loved for its embellished headlines. Once, when Kanye West was spotted in a fast food restaurant, a headline exclaimed: “Kanye West Takes Kim Kardashian For a ROMANTIC DINNER... At WENDYS!!!” (A frequent target of the site, West later referred to MTO as “full of shit.”) During one awards performance from 2013, Miley Cyrus was pilloried without a second thought: “Everybody's Talking About MILEY CYRUS SMOKING WEED On Stage... The Bigger Story Is... How Come She Got The Body Of A SENIOR CITIZEN????” Though the site is not the cultural giant it once used to be, there was a time when MediaTakeout headlines were notoriously known for their punctuational virility—just slick enough to make you believe the inferno was worth the spectacle. “There are days when it feels like the site gets as much mileage out of grammar and punctuation as it does from real people and what they do in the real world” Zach Baron wrote in 2013 for GQ. There’s also The Shade Room and BallerAlert, two black web tabloids that have found huge audiences on Instagram, with 15 million followers between them. They operate as portals of breaking news as much as they do celebrity fodder, and supply comedic escape and narratives of uplift in heaping doses. One recent TSR post, a favorite of mine, inquired into the whereabouts of R&amp;B one-hit wonder J. Holiday—his song “Bed” peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2007—joking how he “went to bed [and] haven’t got up since.” Bossip’s headline recalibration this year, though, has opened a gulf between it and its competitors, the result of a semantic tightrope act. In news media, for publications like The Washington Post and New York Times, headlines have always veered toward a kind a journalistic centrism; they greet a reader on common ground, prioritizing accessibility over impact. Bossip headlines are all the more remarkable because they act as an extension of black style—which is to say they embrace, head on, the syntax and niche vernacular of a small community of people. The undertaking is both a praise of and a lifeline to a facet of black culture. Language, after all, is all about position; it’s not just about what is said, it’s also about who you’re speaking to, and from what angle. In reading this, depending on how you identify, you might have wondered about the use of phrases like “poon-sizzling,” “Airmax loving cakes” or “clap back,” and you would be completely justified in doing so. The terms are not meant for mass consumption (though, on occasion, the co-optation of terms like “on fleek” have a way of breaking through the mainstream). It’s exactly that kind of cultural specificity used in such a casual and matter-of-fact way that makes Bossip an arrestingly tempting read. That’s partly its function, too—knowing exactly who its audience is. Which is why I would never betray the site’s trust by translating its profuse, profane lexicon here. That’s been the point all along. If you know, then you know. And if you don’t, then maybe it’s not meant for you.","The gossip site and its competitors know that it’s not just what you say—it's who you're speaking to, and from what angle.",2017-12-15T15:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",How Bossip Smashed Headline Conventions to Smithereens,https://www.wired.com/story/bossip-art-of-headlines/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a3326cf3dbbc51f4dd9bb24/191:100/pass/Bossip-FINAL.jpg,wired,Wired,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Benjamin Goggin,"Singer R. Kelly appeared in a Chicago court for the second time in his sexual abuse case on Monday, with his attorney Steve Greenberg entering not guilty pleas on all ten of his charges. 
 Appearing in an orange Department of Correction jumpsuit, according to reporters in the Leighton Criminal Court courtroom, Kelly was assigned to associate Cook County judge Lawrence Flood, who has previously handled a variety of criminal cases ranging from bribery to DUIs. 
 In the courtroom, Flood reportedly upheld a previous ruling that said Kelly did not have to pay $161,663 in back child support to be released from jail. His bond is currently set at $1 million, $100,000 of which he must pay to be freed before his next March 22 court date. 
 Per Flood's and the bond court's order, Greenberg surrendered Kelly's passport to prevent the artist from fleeing the US. 
 Kelly did not produce the bail money, however, and will head back to jail. Greenberg has told reporters that Kelly's finances are in disarray. ""This is someone who should be wealthy at this stage of his career, and through mismanagement, through hangers-on and bad contracts and bad deals and bad leases like he had in his studio, he really doesn't have any money at this point,"" he said. 
 Kelly's appearance comes the same day that celebrity attorney Michael Avenatti, who is representing a previous employee of Kelly's, said he will produce a second tape apparently showing evidence of sexual abuse committed by R. Kelly. 
 Previously, Avenatti submitted a video to Cook County attorneys that reportedly shows Kelly engaged in sex acts with a girl who claims to be a minor while on camera. Kelly reportedly acknowledges her age in the video as well. 
 The charges and new evidence come amid renewed interest in Kelly's case following the release of the Lifetime documentary ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" which documented numerous allegations against Kelly of sexual abuse of minors. 
 In court, prosecutors read detailed allegations that matched up with several accounts told in the documentary. 
 Greenberg told reporters over the weekend that ""all the women are lying.""

Meteorologists say the Llano River, which came close to a record-breaking level Tuesday will crest again at a similar spot Wednesday morning. Deputies with the Burnet County Sheriff's Office removed the body from the floodwaters of Lake Lyndon B. Johnson at about 1 p.m. near Kingsland, according to Spectrum News in Austin. Texas Game Warden Search and Rescue teams are now involved in multiple air and water rescues along the river as calls for service come in ""one after the other,"" according to a Tweet from the department. Christy Baught, a floodplain administrator for Llano County, said other local agencies are also assisting with rescue operations, as the flooding has placed residents in serious danger. ""The Llano River has hit major historic flood stage,"" reads a post from the Llano County Office of Emergency Management. ""It is currently at 40' and has almost topped the bridge in Llano. Anyone living within 1/4 mile of the river should evacuate immediately to higher ground."" RELATED: Missing driver recovered from Sabinal River identified The Llano River crested around noon at 39.9 feet, just short of the 1935 record of 41.5 feet. The National Weather Service predicts that Wednesday morning's crest will reach a ""similar height."" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the Texas State Operations Center to a state of increased readiness in response to the ongoing flooding. ""When severe weather strikes, Texas will ensure our responders and local officials have what they need to respond and protect those in harm's way,"" he said. ""I also urge all Texans to take their safety into their own hands by closely monitor changing weather conditions and heeding warnings from local officials."" The flooding has shut down several roadways and bridges in the area, and at about 9:30 a.m., the FM 2900 bridge in Kingsland, Texas, collapsed from the pressure of the raging floodwaters, according to a report from KEYE-TV in Austin. The National Weather Service reported Tuesday morning that more than 10 inches of rain has inundated portions of the Llano River watershed since early Monday. The water has rushed into the river, causing it to rise to almost unprecedented levels. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for Gillespie and Llano counties through 7 p.m. Tuesday and a flood warning along the Llano River in Llano County, Sandy Creek near Kingsland and the Pedernales River at Johnson City. The Llano River is in a major flood stage, meaning there will be ""extensive inundation of structures and roads."" Such a stage calls for ""significant evacuations of people and/or transfer of property to higher elevations,"" according to NWS's website. Baught said the Llano County Office of Emergency management has set up shelters at the First Baptist Church of Llano, Inman's Kitchen an the Kingsland Community Center. She did not know if anyone was missing in the storm. Flooding has also affected other rivers in the Hill County. The National Weather Service said Guadalupe River, Sandy Creek and Nueces River are facing a ""dangerous situation."" RELATED: Rain suspends search for person still missing in Texas flood According to the Austin American-Statesman, homes near Robinson City Park, Scotts Acres, Castell, the FM 2900 Bridge in Kingsland, Kingsland Lodge and Marble Falls are expected to face severe flooding.

Three victims have been found and authorities on Monday temporarily called off the search for the fourth until the rain passed. Patrick Ojeda was swept away on Friday as he tried to drive across a bridge over the Sabinal River in Uvalde County. He was found a mile downstream.

WRAL,"By MICHAEL BIESECKER, Associated Press About 3.4 million chickens have been killed in flooding from Florence as rising North Carolina rivers swamped at least 60 farm buildings where the animals were being raised for market, according to the North Carolina Department of Agriculture. Sanderson Farms said Tuesday 1.7 million of the losses occurred at independent farms that supply its poultry processing plants. The company said its facilities suffered no major damage, but supply disruptions and flooded roadways had caused shutdowns at some plants. In addition, about 30 farms near Lumberton have been isolated by flood waters, hampering the delivery of feed to animals. The lack of food could cause additional birds to die if access isn't restored quickly, the company said. The Department of Agriculture said that about 5,500 pigs were also killed in the storm, and that number could changed based on further recovery efforts. The pork industry trade group says farmers have been working before and after the storm to move at-risk animals to higher ground. The industry lost about 2,800 hogs during flooding from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. The Department of Environmental Quality said the earthen dam at one hog lagoon in Duplin County had breached, spilling its contents. Another 25 of the pits containing animal feces and urine have either suffered structural damage, had wastewater levels go over their tops from heavy rains or had been swamped by floodwaters. Large mounds of manure are also typically stored at poultry farms. Even though the sun shown in parts of the state Tuesday, major flooding is continuing after Florence's passage and is expected to worsen in some areas. Sixteen North Carolina rivers were at major flood stage Tuesday with an additional three forecast to peak by Thursday. An environmental threat is also posed by human waste as low-lying municipal sewage plants flood. On Sunday, the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority reported that more than 5 million gallons of partially treated sewage had spilled into the Cape Fear River after power failed at its treatment plant. The Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that 16 community water treatment facilities in North Carolina are unable to supply drinking water and that seven publicly owned sewage treatment works are non-operational due to the flooding. Duke Energy is continuing cleanup operations Tuesday following a weekend breach at a coal ash landfill at its L.V. Sutton Power Station near Wilmington. Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said a full assessment of how much ash escaped from the waterlogged landfill is ongoing. The company initially estimated Saturday that about 2,000 cubic yards (1,530 cubic meters) of ash were displaced, enough to fill about 180 dump trucks. The coal-fired Sutton plant was retired in 2013 and replaced with a new facility that burns natural gas. The company has been excavating millions of tons of leftover ash from old pits there and removing the waste to a new lined landfill constructed on the property. The gray ash left behind when coal is burned contains toxic heavy metals, including arsenic, lead and mercury. Photos from the site provided to AP by Cape Fear River Watch, an environmental advocacy group, show cascades of gray-colored water spilling from at least two breaches at the landfill and flowing toward Sutton Lake, the plant's former cooling pond which is now used for public recreation, including fishing and boating. Sutton Lake drains into the Cape Fear River. Sheehan said Duke's assessment is that there was minimal chance any contaminants from the spill had reached the river. At a different power plant near Goldsboro, three old coal ash dumps capped with soil were inundated by the Neuse River. Duke said they had no indication those dumps at the H.F. Lee Power Plant were leaking ash into the river. Duke's handling of ash waste has faced intense scrutiny since a drainage pipe collapsed under a waste pit at an old plant in Eden in 2014, triggering a massive spill that coated 70 miles (110 kilometers) of the Dan River in gray sludge. The utility later agreed to plead guilty to nine Clean Water Act violations and pay $102 million in fines and restitution for illegally discharging pollution from ash dumps at five North Carolina power plants. It plans to close all its ash dumps by 2029. In South Carolina, workers with electricity provider Santee Cooper erected a temporary dike in hopes of preventing flooding of an old coal ash dump at the demolished Grainger Generating Station near Conway. The dump is adjacent to the Waccamaw River, which is expected to crest at nearly 20 feet (6 meters) this weekend. That's nine feet above flood stage and would set a new record height. ___ Follow Associated Press investigative reporter Michael Biesecker at twitter.com/mbieseck","WRAL.com 3.4 million chickens drown as NC rivers swollen by Florence WRAL.com By MICHAEL BIESECKER, Associated Press.

Louise Matsakis,"For the average internet user, Wikipedia operates in the background, its 44 million entries serving as a priceless resource, rarely thought of until you need to know the capital of Azerbaijan. This week, however Wikipedia's volunteer editors and the nonprofit that makes its work possible, the Wikimedia Foundation, suddenly found themselves in the news, tasked once again with providing a ground-level truth for a platform unwilling to provide one of its own. On stage at the South by Southwest conference on Tuesday, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki announced that her company would begin adding ""information cues"" to conspiracy theory videos, text-based links intended to provide users with better information about what they are watching. One of the sites YouTube plans to use is Wikipedia. ""We’re just going to be releasing this for the first time in a couple weeks, and our goal is to start with the list of internet conspiracies listed where there is a lot of active discussion on YouTube,"" Wojcicki said on stage. The move came as a surprise—even to the Wikimedia Foundation. ""In this case, neither Wikipedia nor the Wikimedia Foundation are part of a formal partnership with YouTube. We were not given advance notice of this announcement,"" the organization said in a statement. YouTube, a multibillion dollar corporation flush with advertising cash, had chosen to offload its misinformation problem in part to a volunteer, nonprofit encyclopedia without informing it first. YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the move prompted protestations from the media and some of Wikipedia's editors. ""As a longtime Wikipedia editor, I wondered whether YouTube thought deeply about how relying on Wikipedia to combat disinformation on YouTube videos is going to impact Wikipedia and the community of editors,” says Amanda Levendowski, a clinical teaching fellow at the Technology Law &amp; Policy Clinic at New York University Law School. Wikipedia never claimed to be perfect, and isn't. But YouTube is far from the first tech company, or even the first social platform, to use Wikipedia's content for its own goals. Its parent company, Alphabet, frequently uses Wikipedia content in Google search results. Facebook is also testing using Wikipedia to fight its own misinformation problem, though it informed the Wikimedia Foundation of its intentions first. Artificial intelligence researchers also frequently use the online encyclopedia—which still adds 20,000 new entries each month—to train algorithms or teach smart assistants. And Levendowski notes that Alphabet-owned Jigsaw used Wikipedia article discussion pages, in part, to train its open-source troll-fighting AI. ""Our content powers hundreds of semantic web services and knowledge graphs, including those maintained by Google, Apple, and Yahoo!. Our traffic data is used to track the flu virus, analyze changes in the stock market, and predict which movies will top the box office. Our structured and linked data platform, Wikidata, is used to organize datasets from the Library of Congress to the Metropolitan Museum of Art,"" says Katherine Maher, the executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation. Which is to say that much of the tech industry uses Wikipedia—it's not only YouTube that has to consider the consequences of making it the arbiter of truth. Who Writes History It's worth acknowledging that Wikipedia is, for the most part, remarkably good at its job. The site is a free, generally reliable, vast source of information. But it does have its issues. Only 16 percent of the site's volunteer editors identify as female, according to a 2013 study. Nearly half of all articles about geographic places were written by inhabitants of just five countries: the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, and Italy, a 2015 Oxford University study concluded. The same study found that more edits have been made from the Netherlands than all of Africa combined. These disparities result in real consequences both for the kind of content that ends up on Wikipedia, and how it's written. While it presents itself as a source of facts, articles can have their own slants. ""For certain political topics, there's a central-left bias. There's also a slight, when it comes to more political topics, counter-cultural bias. It's not across the board, and it's not for all things,"" says Sorin Adam Matei, a professor at Purdue University and the author of Structural Differentiation in Social Media, a book that studied 10 years worth of Wikipedia editing logs. The vast majority of edits to Wikipedia are also made by a tiny fraction of its volunteers. Seventy-seven percent of Wikipedia's content is written by one percent of its editors, according to Matei's book, which he co-wrote with Brian Britt, an assistant professor of journalism at South Dakota State University. ""The diversity and representation of our editor community has been an area of critical focus for our movement over the past several years. To truly be a free knowledge resource for all, Wikipedia has to reflect the lived experience of the world—and this extends beyond gender, to language, geography, and more,"" says Maher. ""At the Foundation, we’re committed to supporting the diversification of the Wikimedia editor community, and the efforts of those working to make Wikipedia more representative."" Funding efforts to diversify Wikipedia's contributor base is challenging, though, when companies use its content, but don't also invest in its future. Or when they choose to treat it as an ""endlessly renewable resource with infinite free labor,"" as longtime Wikipedia editor and librarian Phoebe Ayers put it. Google confirmed to New York Magazine that it hasn't contributed financially to the Wikimedia Foundation. Scraping Wikipedia content has already had unintended effects in other parts of the web. Consider what happens when you search a number of news outlets on Google. Several daily US newspapers in major metropolitan areas, like the Chicago Tribune and New York Daily News, are presented as having ""political alignments."" The search results describe the former as conservative, and the latter as centrist. But if you search for an openly partisan outlet, like Breitbart, no political alignment shows up, because Wikipedia's editors haven't added one to its entry. Because the information lives on Google, independent from its source, it's not always apparent why a piece of information did or didn't end up in a search result. Of course, anyone could add a political alignment label to Breitbart's Wikipedia entry if they wanted to. Wikipedia's greatest strength is that anyone can contribute to it, a feature that also draws the most criticism. Powerful people have been caught editing entries to suit their own interests, or to bend history, exonerating themselves of past offenses. Scraping Wikipedia content has already had unintended effects in other parts of the web. In 2015, for example, a Politico investigation uncovered that someone with access to New York City Police Department computers had edited Wikipedia pages detailing alleged police brutality. They attempted to delete Wikipedia entries entirely for several well-known victims, including Eric Garner. The NYPD Wikipedia scandal is far from the only instance in which the site has been manipulated; a Twitter bot updates daily with anonymous edits made to the site from IP addresses associated with Congress, for example, though not all the edits it chronicles have political or policy implications. Wikipedia has also struggled with how to deal with people who are paid to edit articles to suit their benefactors. Wikipedia never claimed to be perfect, and isn't. But tech giants still use it as an unassailable force—often in an attempt to hide their own failures of moderation Conspiracists At the Gate Some Wikipedia editors have expressed concern that YouTube's new feature will make their jobs even harder by sending a flood of conspiracy theorists to the site, eager to edit pages to shape their worldview. So far, though, Wikipedia does have a good track record of fighting back against people interested in propagating misinformation. A 2016 study conducted by three Stanford researchers found that most hoaxes are detected and dealt with on Wikipedia quickly. While anyone can contribute to Wikipedia, the process is fairly bureaucratic, and not something you can do easily in the heat of the moment after watching a conspiracy theory video on YouTube. In fact, Wikipedia has had trouble recruiting new editors in the past because of the sometimes cumbersome safeguards it has installed to prevent poor-quality edits from making their way into entries. If an army of flat-Earth truthers do try to infiltrate Wikipedia, what they will create is extra labor for the site's editors, who aren't compensated for their work. They may also harass the editors of articles that debunk conspiracy theories, a problem that the site dealt with during the Gamergate controversy. Perhaps worse than vandalism is the worry that Wikipedia links on YouTube, or on any platform, will become a symbol rather than a source of more information. Users might not read the encyclopedia entries, but merely interpret them as a cue. Videos that are presented without Wikipedia pages or other additional information might be viewed automatically as more legitimate than those that are. ""When people go to interfaces they do not think, they do not want to think, they want to see conventions and encoded signals that help them make quick decisions,"" says Matei. ""It will signal just this is fake, this is bogus."" More than anything, that's perhaps the greatest risk that comes with tech companies using Wikipedia to fight misinformation. Using the crowdsourced encyclopedia as a shield, platforms abdicate responsibility for their own problems, without having to give anything back in return.",YouTube and other tech giants have repeatedly turned to Wikipedia to help solve some of their biggest problems—often without giving back.,2018-03-16T20:52:26Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}","Youtube, Facebook, and Google Can't Expect Wikipedia to Cure the Internet",https://www.wired.com/story/youtube-wikipedia-content-moderation-internet/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5aaaf558a54678516963cb4c/191:100/pass/YoutubeWikipediaProsCons.jpg,wired,Wired,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABC News,"Residents of the central U.S., brace yourselves. A major storm system is developing in the central U.S. and it will bring several high impact weather events across much of the region, including the potential for a major flash flood event Saturday. Flood watches Saturday morning have been posted from northern Texas to western Pennsylvania, and includes many metropolitan areas such as Dallas, Little Rock, Nashville, Louisville and Pittsburgh. On the colder side of this system, winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings have been posted for snow and ice accumulation. Minneapolis is in the path for the brunt of this developing snow event. There's a series of flood watches and warnings across the Midwest. Parts of Minnesota will experience snow on Saturday. There will be severe storms in parts of the South on Sunday. The storm will really start to develop Saturday morning before bringing widespread impacts by mid-day and into the evening. Accumulation, heavy rain, and dangerous thunderstorms will develop in the Mississippi River Valley from Little Rock to Memphis, as well as along parts of the Midwest from Paducah, Kentucky to Cincinnati. On the northern side of this storm, snow will develop and intensify as it heads towards Minnesota. Low visibility and blowing snow will be likely be an issue Saturday evening. By Saturday night or Sunday morning, the storm will slide eastward with very heavy rain and thunderstorms from Louisiana all the way to Pennsylvania. A wintry mix and some snow will be likely for parts of New England including Hartford, Connecticut and Albany, New York. The storm will clear the U.S. by Sunday night. Cities such as Louisville, Kentucky, and Little Rock, Arkansas, will experience heavy rainfall this weekend. There's a high risk of flooding in parts of Arkansas, Kentucky and Ohio. The storm will tap into high moisture content across parts of the South and Midwest. A high risk of flash flooding has been issued by the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center, and covers Little Rock, Paducah, Louisville and Cincinnati. Locally, over 4 inches of rainfall is expected through Sunday in the region. However, this will be on top of the rain that has already fallen in some areas. Nearly 10.5 inches of rain has been reported in parts of Arkansas this week. This means that any excessive rain that falls will cause flash flooding The heavy rain, however, will miss northern Indiana, Michigan and northern Illinois, the latter of which has been dealing with ongoing major river flooding from rain over the last week. An area stretching from Texas to Kentucky will experience rain Saturday. Parts of the South will experience tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds on Saturday. Strong severe storms will develop across the South and mMidwest today. Intense storms will develop by mid-day and into Saturday night. An enhanced risk for severe weather has been issued for parts of Louisiana up through parts of Kentucky. Tornadoes, perhaps a couple of strong ones, could develop later Saturday across the enhanced risk region. Damaging winds and large hail will also be possible. The severe weather threat is not expected to remain intense through the day on Sunday. The central U.S. will experience stormy weather this weekend. On the colder side of this storm, there is some freezing rain and light snow moving across northern Missouri and Kansas on Satiurday morning. The snow will expand and intensify as it heads towards the upper Midwest. Heavy snow, low visibility and blowing snow will be likely in Minnesota and parts of Wisconsin by Saturday afternoon and evening. Nearly 6 inches to 10 inches of fresh snow is likely across parts of Minnesota and northern Wisconsin. Some snow and ice makes its way towards New England on Sunday. Accumulations will be light, but could catch some people off guard considering how warm the Northeast was all week. Many rivers in northern Indiana and Southern Michigan are still running high on Saturday morning. Some rivers still have a few days before they will begin to recede, and some have time before they crest. With more heavy rain on the way, widespread river flooding is expected on the Ohio River next week. The Ohio River at Parkersburg, West Virginia, will rise into moderate flood stage, even near major flood stage by Monday or Tuesday. The Ohio River at Racine Lock is forecasted to reach major flood stage by Monday night and Tuesday. A 48 inch crest could flood the town of Racine, West Virginia. In parts of Louisville and Cincinnati, the rising Ohio river is expected to be the highest it has been in 20 years, but only moderate impacts are expected. This could change based on the how much rain the region receives this weekend.","Residents of the central U.S., brace yourselves.

Clive Thompson,"Back in the last presidential campaign season, reporters on the tech and politics beats began noticing a rise in far-right memes that supported Trump. Memes being memes, these seemed initially like weird, off-color jokes. They wondered: What the hell is going on? Was this shitposting ironic or serious? Or both? Either way, it seemed newsworthy. The memes were climbing the trending lists on every social network and landing on the front page of Reddit. So journalists began filing what became a flood of stories about alt-right political memes and loopy conspiracy theories. Like Taylor Swift as a white nationalist icon and Pepe the Frog in a Nazi uniform. “Surely if we expose this,” one tech journalist told herself, “it’ll put people off it.” It didn’t. When, a year later, Trump had won and Nazis were openly marching, those reporters began to realize that their coverage had had precisely the opposite effect. It had helped bring white supremacy into the mainstream by giving it crucial exposure. They had wildly amplified the importance and reach of what were, in all likelihood, a not huge number of miscreants.“Every once in a while I’ll look back and see something that I wrote a year and a half ago and the pit of my stomach falls,” one reporter says. Hate groups had gamed the media. They did it energetically and successfully. Now it may be time to invoke the wisdom of ­ WarGames —where the only way to win is not to play. That’s the conclusion of some fascinating research by Whitney Phillips, assistant professor of communications at Syracuse University and an expert on online trolling. She interviewed dozens of journalists who covered the meme wars—including the ones quoted above and WIRED’s Emma Grey Ellis —and mapped out how and why the nativist right got so good at hacking the media’s attention. One early hoodwinking of the mainstream media occurred in 2008. The denizens of Anonymous on the 4chan forum were amusing themselves by making ironic jokes about pedophilia—they popularized an image of a cartoon named Pedobear and quipped about an army of “9,000 penises” (the number 9,000 being a shout-out to an anime series favored by many users of 4chan ). Then a 4chan member experimentally tried to bring the joke mainstream—by posing as a member of a pedophile group on the discussion boards for The Oprah Winfrey Show. Oprah fell for it. She warned about this “known pedophile network,” talking up Pedobear. The denizens of 4chan were thrilled, and as Phillips notes, they learned a lesson: “It’s culturally fun to screw with reporters.” As the presidential election loomed, this yank-the-media’s-chain strategy was neatly integrated into the machinations of various hate groups online. Today’s white nationalists know their radioactive misogyny, racism, and anti-Semitism are likely to turn off “normies.” If you want to bring that stuff mainstream, they intuited, you need to be highly ironic. Leave it unclear whether you’re earnest. “Generally, when using racial slurs, it should come across as half-joking,” wrote the editors of the Daily Stormer, a white supremacist site, in their style guide. “It should not come across as genuine raging vitriol. That is a turnoff to the overwhelming majority of people.” Better yet, this was the great age of sock puppet and bot-farm technology too. So it was possible for white supremacists to give their memes and conspiracy theories artificially generated upvotes and retweets, helping them mount the “recommended” leaderboards of social media. That was part of the ploy: Make something seem so big that reporters would feel remiss in not pouncing on it. One problem reporters faced was that, from the far-right’s point of view, any coverage was good—even coverage that rebutted or fact-checked their memes. They were following the script often attributed to PT Barnum and, not incidentally, Trump: All publicity is good publicity. “That’s how Pizzagate got so big,” says danah boyd, a friend of mine who runs the Data &amp; Society Institute, which commissioned Phillips’ study. Stories about Pizzagate—a conspiracy theory linking Hillary Clinton to a (nonexistent) pedophile ring supposedly run out of a pizzeria in Washington, DC—would prompt viewers to do online searches. “People who don’t trust the media see a story and think, well, I guess I’ll self-investigate.” And that leads them to the conspiracy theory sites, which they probably would not have found otherwise. The Nazis needed media outrage to amplify their message and bring it retail. LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Memes So, what’s to be done? Covering online hate memes plays into their makers’ hands. But not covering them seems neglectful. Online far-right hate-mongers do exist. One idea, boyd suggests, is what’s known as “strategic silence”: Be less wanton in the choice of details used in reporting. The concept comes from the world of suicide research, where scientists have reliably found that when journalists report on a prominent suicide in lavish detail—describing how someone took their own life, the contents of a note—it produces a spike of copycats. After Robin Williams killed himself and wall-to-wall media coverage ensued, the next month’s suicide rate jumped 10 percent. In contrast, studies show that when media coverage is less detailed, you don’t see these dramatic spikes. That’s not a bad road map for how we talk about online memes. We—including myself—could use greater precision and less hyperbole. Phillips suggests we stop using the fungible phrase “trolls” when talking about hate groups: It both minimizes their genuinely vile goals and makes them seem like a huge horde. (Many meme campaigns are probably “three dudes and their bots,” as Phillips cracks.) Many of these campaigns were never organically big enough to warrant coverage. They were like the PR stunts that corporations stage to provoke coverage, which journalists rightly ignore. Done with nuance, coverage of high-profile suicides can be a teachable moment. When Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain took their own lives this June, many stories included suicide hotlines or links to get help. Maybe there’s a parallel in hate-meme coverage: links to groups that fight extremism or support victims. Media restraint might slow the spread of extremist ideas, but it can’t entirely stop it. Social media means everyone’s a publisher now. This suggests we all could engage in strategic silence too, and less “OMG” meme-spreading. Still, there’s a reason white nationalists tried to game the media: The “lamestream” still matters. In an ironic way, for traditional press, it’s an oddly validating message. The media just has to be sure not to validate back. This article appears in the August issue. Subscribe now. More Great WIRED Stories",Covering hateful memes plays into their makers’ hands.

Patrick Howell O'Neill,"The day started with an intense tropical storm consuming San Francisco, but by evening the clouds had parted just in time for a group of grinning and excited venture capitalists, techies, and real estate agents to gather at atop a downtown highrise that overlooks the city all the way to across the Bay to Oakland.
Everyone was there to discuss all the money to be made off the newest class of overnight millionaires that Silicon Valley is about to birth.
2019 is slated to produce an extraordinarily long list of multi-billion-dollar IPOs from San Francisco Bay Area heavyweights like Lyft, Uber, Palantir, Pinterest, Airbnb, Slack, Postmates, and Instacart. The result will be a massive and sudden injection of liquid cash into a region already infamous for both the nations priciest real estate as well as a vast and growing wealth gap between rich and poor neighbors.
On stage at Mondays event, a three-hour catered affair titled Tech IPOs effect on Bay Area Real Estate held in DocuSign headquarters, Deniz Kahramaner, a big data real estate agent at the tech real estate firm Compass, laid out a series of shocking numbers about what to expect as San Franciscos rich prepare to get so much richer. He estimated $250 billion in total valuation of the local companies expected to IPO this year, based on private investment, which dwarves anything seen in half a decade.
Are we going to see a one bedroom condo worth less than $1 million in five years? Deniz Kahramaner, a big data real estate agent at a company called Compass rhetorically asked the room. Probably not.
When Bravo reality television star and Sothebys real estate agent Roh Habibi took the stage, he thought out loud about whether his newly IPO-rich clients should spend $9 million on a single San Francisco property or buy three $3 million properties spread out around Northern California.
A few miles away, Oakland High School teacher Matt Fields lives in a two bedroom apartment with three people. Even sharing a bedroom with a friend, Fields still pays around $1,000 monthly in rent in order to live in the community where he teaches.
The City of Oakland is three days into a public school teacher strike centered around the difficulty of living in the Bay Area on a non-tech salary.
Combined with student loans and the learning curve any second-year teacher faces, Fields says his $47,000 salary and glacial pace of raises makes the grueling first few years of teaching even more taxing. The result is an extraordinarily highteacher turnover rate in every corner of Oakland.
If union demands for higher teacher salary and better school conditions are met, Fields says, the best case scenario is that he may be able to rent his own bedroom inside a shared apartment.
Its not an option to fail, Fields told Gizmodo in a conversation about the strike. Were in a situation right now where I, as a college educated, second-year teacher, cannot even afford to have my own bedroom in the place where I teach, and that needs to change.
I have been reconciled for some time to the fact that my own income is not enough to support my family in Oakland, Lara Trale, an English teacher at Oakland High School, said on Monday to Gizmodo by phone. Students and families are being priced out too. Ive seen the same thing to happen to colleagues. Theyre excited, motivated, and driven but feel like they cant make a lifelong living in a place where they have to share a room.
The imminent slate of tech IPOs promises to push real estate prices higher in what is already the costliest market in the country, according to multiple studies as well as the real estate agents in the room at DocuSign.
That is super beneficial, Habibi told a rapt crowd of real estate brokers on Monday, for the tech industry rich who will be readily buying and the real estate agents who will be aggressively selling. For people stuck on the outside looking in, the view is turning dark.
Back inside DocuSign headquarters, its bright as hell. A group of real estate agents couldnt help themselves from uttering wow out loud with every new big dollar figure on center stage: 211 techie buyers projected to purchase property above $10 million, thousands expected to buy above $1 million, and San Franciscos real estate dominated by buyers51.1 percent of whom come from the software industrywho are about to have a whole lot more money in their pocket.
Laughs and maybe a little jealousy hit when the conversation turned to Nema, a luxury housing company known for building and buying property within walking distance to tech giant headquarters in downtown San Francisco and then selling at absurd prices to engineers who readily pay whatever it takes to avoid public transportation. Heres a $6,303 per month studio from Nema near Ubers headquarters, in case you happen to be nearby and about to come into a windfall of cash.
As you might expect from a crowd like this, Californias income inequality gap and housing crisisproblems deemed a code red by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsomnever came up during Monday nights beautifully catered event.
Instead, the panels last question probed Habibi about the flashiest pads hed sold recently to clients rich enough to buy huge amounts of land in the heart of Silicon Valley. A panel consisting of a real estate agents, tech CEO, and venture capitalist was congratulated as a very well balanced conversation about the impact of new tech IPOs. The teachers like Fields and Trale, up since 6:30 am that morning to strike despite flash flood warnings, went unrepresented and unmentioned.
I wish I had a clever, optimistic answer, Anthemos Georgiades, CEO at the real estate startup Zumper, said. But the next two to three years, if you look at the liquidity about to come to market with these IPOs, and then you look at how few buildings coming to market that would actually bring inventory. Its basic supply and demand. It makes no sense to think anything will get cheaper.
For someone who doesnt make what a Facebook employee doesthe company has a median annual salary of $240,000 the prospects of living in and around Silicon Valley and the entire San Francisco Bay Area is now more uncertain, even for the students who were born, raised, and recently began their public education there.
Its a crisis, Newsom said last year when he was running for governor. We cant live on intentions. At the end of the day, if you want to move the mouse, youve got to move the cheese. The middle class of the state is leaving in droves. This is a Code Red in California.","The day started with an intense tropical storm consuming San Francisco, but by evening the clouds had parted just in time for a group of grinning and excited venture capitalists, techies, and real estate agents to gather at atop a downtown highrise that overl…",2019-02-26T20:20:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}",Upcoming Tech IPOs Will Mint Hundreds of Overnight Millionaires and Silicon Valley Vultures Are Licking Their Chops,https://gizmodo.com/upcoming-tech-ipos-will-mint-hundreds-of-overnight-mill-1832889859,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--b15-Czv1--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/za0ctle2zvxsnnyzkdes.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WRAL,"By JOHN RABY, Associated Press CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Severe thunderstorms spawned suspected tornadoes and triggered widespread flooding that left at least three people dead in Kentucky and Arkansas. The system that stretched from Texas to the Canadian maritime provinces on Sunday had prompted emergency declarations a day earlier in Missouri, Indiana and Illinois. In south central Kentucky, the body of a male was recovered from a vehicle submerged in floodwaters in a creek near the community of Franklin on Saturday, the Simpson County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. The victim's identify was being withheld pending notification of relatives. About 20 miles (32 kilometers) away, Dallas Jane Combs, 79, died after a suspected tornado destroyed her Adairville home earlier Saturday, the Logan County Sheriff's Office told media outlets. Sheriff officials said Combs was inside the home when it collapsed on her. Combs was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities said Combs' husband was outside putting up plastic to keep rain out of the home when he was blown into the basement area. He sustained minor injuries. In northeast Arkansas, an 83-year-old man was killed after high winds toppled a trailer home. Clay County Sheriff Terry Miller told KAIT-TV that Albert Foster died Saturday night after the home was blown into a pond. About 50 miles (80 kilometers) away, the National Weather Service said the roof was blown off a hotel in Osceola, about 160 miles (257 kilometers) north of Memphis, Tennessee. Storm-related damage also was reported in Middle Tennessee, where Fox17 in Nashville reported extensive damage to homes and vehicles. Fox17 says at least a dozen homes were damaged in one Montgomery County subdivision. The National Weather Service said it was sending crews to survey damage in a section of central Tennessee. Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens signed an executive order earlier Saturday declaring a state of emergency ahead of the anticipated storms and flooding in parts of southern Missouri. The order activates the resources of the Missouri National Guard and ensures state resources are available in the event of weather damage. Other state leaders have issued similar orders: Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb declared a disaster emergency for 11 counties and Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner issued a state disaster proclamation for three counties hit by flooding. Flood watches and warnings spanned multiple states Sunday morning, from Missouri to central Pennsylvania, while a wind advisory remained in effect for nearly all of Lower Michigan. The weather service said moderate flooding was expected along the Ohio River in Kentucky and Ohio, including in Cincinnati, where the river was 8 feet above flood stage Sunday. Transportation officials said parts of Interstate 64 in Louisville, Kentucky, were closed in both directions Sunday due to high water. ___ Associated Press writers Ken Miller in Oklahoma City, Jeff Karoub in Detroit, Ken Kusmer in Indianapolis and Margery Beck in Omaha, Nebraska, contributed.","WRAL.com 2 dead as severe weather moves eastward through central US WRAL.com OKLAHOMA CITY — At least two people are dead as a strong storm system that included possible tornadoes roared eastward through the central United States, leaving demolished homes, da…",2018-02-25T07:31:40Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Wral.com'}",2 dead as severe weather moves eastward through central US - WRAL.com,http://www.wral.com/2-dead-as-severe-weather-moves-eastward-through-central-us/17371798/,https://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/weather/2018/02/25/17371798/media_850cf7bf37044b5fae68b79eb97f0a77-DMID1-5dwsorwxo-640x480.jpg,,Wral.com,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Connie Loizos,"It’s been painful, the silence of Silicon Valley with regards to Saudi Arabia, whose shifting accounts about the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi have nearly veered into slapstick. He freely walked out the Saudi consulate in Instanbul! No, rogue killers got to him. Okay, fine, the truth is that he was in a fist-fight and was subdued to death by Saudi officials. Wait. We did set out to brutally murder him, just as Turkish officials told the world at the outset. It isn’t hard to understand why the story of Khashoggi’s final moments has finally come full circle. Why not just tell the truth when the world — including everyone in technology who has taken the region’s money — is too cowardly or greedy to take a stand against it? In fairness, breaking up with Saudi Arabia, which has drenched the Bay Area in capital, is easier said than done. Forcing an investor to sell is practically impossible if it has a contractual right to be involved and isn’t interested in selling to other shareholders for a higher price. No doubt, too, many see little to gain by speaking ill of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, or MBS, who is running the show and may be more menacing than they’d realized. In fact, while some in tech are using this moment to win points for not raising money from murderous regimes, nary a recipient of MBS’s capital has spoken publicly about why he or she won’t again accept funding from Saudi Arabia until MBS is removed from his powerful position. Not a single person. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son – – whose $93 billion Vision Fund is anchored by a $45 billion commitment from MBS — met with MBS privately on Monday to express concern about Khashoggi’s murder but also to preserve his options, presumably. Indeed, we’d now guess that comments made last week by SoftBanks COO Marcelo Claure, who said there was “no certainty” that SoftBank will launch another Vision Fund, were largely overblown. Many will be relieved if that second fund materializes. But if we were running a unicorn company, we still wouldn’t get too comfortable. Even assuming that the Vision Fund continues to deploy billions of dollars with the help of MBS, it will take time to get his scent off future rounds. As analyst Chris Lane of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. told Bloomberg earlier today, likely SoftBank will have to pause three to six months before starting to again cut major deals, owing to its ties to the prince. In the meantime, the ordeal looks increasingly like part of a series of shocks that are bound to have a systemic effect — and make burn rates more important than ever to control. Consider: While we’re busy obsessing over MBS, longer-term frictions with China — which has also poured money into Silicon Valley — grow more concerning by the day, from an ongoing trade war with the U.S., to allegations of intellectual property theft, to Beijing’s continued militarization of disputed islands in the South China Sea, to newer concerns over currency manipulation. There’s also the performance of the U.S. stock market, which is reacting to these various pressures. Tech shares are pushing U.S. benchmark indexes back into positive territory today — one day after the year’s stock market gains were completely wiped out. But these zigs and zags have U.S. endowments, foundations and pension fund managers feeling nervous. More worrying, these traditional “limited partners” to venture firms are already over allocated to venture as an asset class because the cadence of fundraising has been faster than ever in recent years while exits have been comparatively slow. “We keep stuffing the snake,” says Chris Douvos, an LP who has helped fund numerous seed-stage firms over the years, including First Round Capital. “But not as much is coming out the back end as coming in the front end. That’s left everyone with a huge bubble” with which to contend. Douvos isn’t sure how big an impact tech’s suddenly strained relationship with Saudi Arabia could have, but he thinks — as we do — that it could be the first shoe to drop. He thinks that’s not necessarily a terrible thing, either. While a flood of capital from around the world has changed how Silicon Valley builds companies, it might be time to rethink that process anew. “Maybe being cash-flow negative until you’re a $100 billion company isnt sustainable. Maybe you start building toward earlier profitability,” says a hopeful Douvos. “Thats very much at odds with the traditional Silicon Valley ethos, but it starts to untangle the web of all this trapped capital.” It would also give public shareholders an earlier crack at fast-growing companies and perhaps help Silicon Valley find its backbone. More realistically, these headwinds may see U.S. companies that can’t stand on their own run even faster to Saudi Arabia, where the prince will only become more emboldened, and his terms more cutthroat.

"feedback@businessinsider.com (Michael Biesecker), Michael Biesecker","Duke Energy said Saturday night that heavy rains from Florence caused a slope to collapse at a coal ash landfill at a closed power station near the North Carolina coast. Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said about 2,000 cubic yards of ash were displaced at the L. V. Sutton Power Station outside Wilmington and that contaminated runoff likely flowed into the plant's cooling pond. The company has not yet determined whether the weir that drains the lake was open or if contamination may have flowed into the Cape Fear River. That's roughly enough ash to fill 180 dump trucks. Florence slammed into the North Carolina coast as a large hurricane Friday, dumping nearly three feet of rain and swelling the region's rivers. The resulting flooding forced swift-water rescues and left several people dead. Sheehan said the company had reported the incident to state and federal regulators ""out of an abundance of caution."" The coal-fired Sutton plant was retired in 2013 and the company has been excavating millions of tons of ash from old waste pits and removing it to safer lined landfills constructed on the property. The gray ash left behind when coal is burned contains toxic heavy metals, including arsenic, lead and mercury. Duke has been under intense scrutiny for the handling of its coal ash since a drainage pipe collapsed under a waste pit at an old plant in Eden in 2014, triggering a massive spill that coated 70 miles of the Dan River in gray sludge. In a subsequent settlement with federal regulators, Duke agreed to plead guilty to nine Clean Water Act violations and pay $102 million in fines and restitution for illegally discharging pollution from coal-ash dumps at five North Carolina power plants. The company is in the process of closing all of its coal ash dumps by 2029. In this June 23, 2014 file photo, the dried-up bed of an inactive coal ash pond is seen at Duke Energy's Sutton plant in Wilmington, North Carolina. Mike Spencer/The Star-News via AP Spokeswoman Megan S. Thorpe at the state's Department of Environmental Quality said state regulators will conduct a thorough inspection of the site as soon as safely possible. ""DEQ has been closely monitoring all coal ash impoundments that could be vulnerable in this record breaking rain event,"" Thorpe said. She added that the department, after assessing the damage, will ""hold the utility accountable for implementing the solution that ensures the protection of public health and the environment."" There are at least two other coal-fired Duke plants in North Carolina that are likely to affected by the storm. The H.F. Lee Power Station near Goldsboro has three inactive ash basins that flooded during Hurricane Matthew in 2016, exposing a small amount of coal ash that may have flowed into the nearby Neuse River. The old waste pits are capped with soil and vegetation intended to help prevent erosion of the toxic ash beneath. The Neuse is expected to crest at more than nine feet above flood stage Monday and Sheehan said the company expects the same ash basins are likely to be inundated again. At the W. H. Weatherspoon Power Station near Lumberton, Sheehan said it had already rained more than 30 inches by Saturday evening, causing a nearby swamp to overflow into the plants cooling pond. The Lumber River is expected to crest at more than 11 feet above flood stage Sunday, which would put the floodwaters near the top of the earthen dike containing the plant's coal ash dump. Environmentalists have been warning for decades that Duke's coal ash ponds were vulnerable to severe storms and pose a threat to drinking water supplies and public safety. ""Unfortunately, Duke Energy has spent years lobbying and litigating and still has not removed the coal ash from its dangerous riverfront pits in the coastal area, some of which are in the floodplain,"" said Frank Holleman, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center who has battled the company in court. He added: ""When a hurricane like Florence hits, we have to hope and pray that our communities do not suffer the consequences of years of irresponsible coal ash practices by the coal ash utilities.""","Matt Born/The Star-News via AP Duke Energy said Florence's heavy rains caused a slope to collapse at a coal ash landfill at a closed power station near the North Carolina coast.

Harry McCracken,"If I could go back in time and attend any tech-company press event I missed the first time around, I might set my Wayback Machine for July 23, 1985, which was 33 years ago this coming Monday. Once I arrived, I’d head to Lincoln Center and sneak into the extravaganza which Commododore held to introduce a new computer called the Amiga. From a purely technological standpoint, the Amiga was a marvel, with graphics and multitasking muscle far beyond anything offered by the likes of Apple, IBM, or Tandy. (Its capabilities remained impressive more than two years later when I came up with the money to buy a later model, the Amiga 500.) But the reason I’d love to have been in the audience is to have been able to witness Andy Warhol use the computer to “paint” Blondie’s Debbie Harry. Fortunately for you and me, the clip is readily available on YouTube: I mean no disrespect to Warhol or Harry when I say that their participation in this event probably had a financial incentive. And all Warhol is doing is using GraphiCraft, a paint program, to flood a digitized image of the pop diva with color—a technique which probably appealed to him, since he was fond of self-imposed artistic limitations such as using a $20 Polaroid camera. But the whole stunt is a charming cultural artifact. (Harry: “Are you ready to paint me?” Warhol: “Yeah.”) Warhol did spend some time with an Amiga after leaving the stage: His January 1986 interview in AmigaWorld magazine references a digital painting he did of Dolly Parton. And in 2014, additional, long-forgotten artwork was rescued from his Amiga floppy disks, including a self-portrait. He died in February 1987, when the Amiga 1000 he used still represented the state of the art in personal computer graphics. For much more about Amiga than you really need to know, you can check out the tribute I wrote in 2010 when the machine turned 25.","A pop artist, a pop star, and a dazzling computer make history—or at least give us a surprisingly endearing little moment.

JESSE GREEN,"But Ms. Orlandersmith digs deep enough into each character, and with such decency, that no segment seems obligatory. Even the worst human among them — a vile racist (and homophobe) called Dougray — is allowed his back story, which helps explain, if in no way excuse, him. Photo Among the characters portrayed by Ms. Orlandersmith is Dougray, a racist who fantasizes about gunning down Ferguson’s black men. Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times Still, Dougray, who fantasizes about lining up Ferguson’s black males and gunning them down in order to make the town “clean/white/purified/like it must have been once,” threw me out of the play for a moment. Ms. Orlandersmith is so skilled at disappearing into her characters that I had forgotten until then what her process involved. Theoretically, this was a man she had interviewed, stood near, faced. The psychological violence of that encounter seemed almost like a replay of the literal violence it was meant to investigate. Later, I learned that many of the characters Ms. Orlandersmith portrays are fictional composites. I’m not sure whether that makes Dougray more bearable, or less: The idea that there are many Dougrays available for compositing seems terrible, if all too believable. Still, I think that if the play informed audiences about Ms. Orlandersmith’s methods, it might help them better understand her aims. Some of her earlier works, like the autobiographical “Forever,” are clearly factual, however poetically the facts are rendered. Others, like the Pulitzer Prize finalist “Yellowman,” are clearly fiction. Or perhaps “Until the Flood” is more effective for leaving you uncertain about which genre it falls into. The production, directed by Neel Keller, carefully splits the difference between documentary objectivity and poetic license. On a set (by Takeshi Kata) replicating the impromptu memorial of candles and stuffed animals that lined Canfield Avenue in the weeks after Mr. Brown’s death, Ms. Orlandersmith moves from character to character with minimal fuss, adding or subtracting a simple costume piece (by Kaye Voyce) but otherwise not attempting anything but verbal verisimilitude. Moody projections (by Nicholas Hussong) establish the locations, just as the lovely interstitial music by Justin Ellington establishes the elegiac tone. Despite this evenhanded treatment, I found myself crediting the black characters more than the white ones. No doubt this was in part because white racism, however outright or covert, is a familiar gargoyle, stuck with its one leer. Ms. Orlandersmith’s black characters are much more nuanced, and able to explore themes that, coming from whites, would seem taboo. One of those is raised right from the start by a black retired schoolteacher named Louisa Hemphill. Acknowledging the damage done by racism — she grew up heeding signs that said “Don’t let the sun go down on you in this town” if you’re black — she nevertheless concludes that Mr. Brown was not only set up to be a victim but also “set himself up.” Several other characters echo this thought. Hassan, describing the routine threat of death from police violence, says there is a part of him that “wants to stand before a gun” knowing that the “redneck” holding it “would aim to shoot and not miss.” And when Paul, a 17-year-old who lives, as Mr. Brown did, in the “defeated” Canfield Green apartments, cries, “Please God let me get out,” he means get out alive. Those are two of the saddest lines you are likely to hear from a stage today, and therefore two of the most important. Composite or not, they ring damningly true.

Megan Borowski,"Heavy rain was already falling in the South on Saturday morning as western North Carolina prepares for the potential for as much as a foot of snow this weekend. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. A major storm in the southern U.S. dumped significant amounts of rain in Texas on Friday night into early Saturday morning. Areas near Houston reported rainfall rates overnight of up to 2 inches per hour as bands of thunderstorms moved through. Bunker Hill Village in Harris County received 7.88 inches of rain over past 24 hours, while Lake Jackson saw 7.72 inches and College Station received 3.98 inches. The radar on Saturday morning shows the storm is primarily a rain-producing system, with the heaviest bands producing downpours east of Houston. Heavy rain is falling in the South on Saturday morning with snow in northwestern Texas. When all is said and done in Texas and the Gulf Coast, widespread rainfall totals are expected to amount to 3 to 6 inches. As a result, the risk of flooding is extremely significant. Flash flood watches and flood watches are in effect from eastern Texas to Georgia on Saturday. Winter weather alerts and flood watches are in place due to the storm system moving through the South and Southeast over the weekend. On the northern edge of the system, there is snow and ice occurring with this storm. Already 3.25 inches of snow has been reported in Lubbock, Texas. Snow and a wintry mix are beginning to spread from the Texas Panhandle to northern Arkansas Saturday morning. Winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings are in effect from New Mexico to Virginia. The storm system will track to the east-northeast Saturday afternoon into evening. During this time, cold air from the north will be wrapped into the system, which will set the stage for moderate to heavy snowfall in the Piedmont region and North Carolina. Very heavy snow is expected to fall in southwest Virginia and North Carolina on Sunday. The storm will move in the Southeast on Sunday morning and deliver heavy snow to western North Carolina. Further south, torrential rain will dominate, setting the stage for flooding in Georgia. Upwards of 6 inches of rain is expected in the Southeast once the storm has moved through by Monday. The National Weather Service has already issued flood watches for much of northern Georgia. Winter storm watches and warnings are in effect in the Southeast as well. The system will be offshore by noon on Monday, but it still will be producing rain and snow from Virginia to Tennessee and Alabama. As much as a foot of snow could fall in the areas of Boone and Asheville, North Carolina, over the weekend. Snowfall totals of 6 to 12 inches will be widespread in Virginia and North Carolina. Localized amounts of greater than 1 foot are highly likely for the mountainous western areas of these states.",Snowfall totals could be as much as a foot in western North Carolina.,2018-12-08T13:38:52Z,"{'id': 'abc-news', 'name': 'ABC News'}","Major storm to bring heavy rain to South, snow to North Carolina",https://abcnews.go.com/US/major-storm-bring-heavy-rain-south-snow-north/story?id=59696142,https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/lubbock-snow-ugc-mo-20181208_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,abc-news,ABC News,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Associated Press,"(OMAHA, Neb.) — Floodwaters are receding across most of the hard-hit Midwest, but there could be new problems if the forecast for significant rain later this week holds up. Already the flooding along the Missouri River and its tributaries has caused at least $3 billion damage and forced thousands from their homes as floodwaters penetrated or flowed over several hundred miles of levees.
The flooding is blamed in three confirmed deaths, and two Nebraska men have been missing for more than a week.
Extensive damage
The flooding has taken a heavy toll on agriculture in the region, inundating tens of thousands of acres, threatening stockpiled grain and killing livestock. Thousands of people have been forced from their homes in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri, and some have yet to return to assess the damage. Residents of Kansas City, Missouri, are being asked to conserve water while KC Water treats murky water caused by filtration issues. Flooding has closed about 140 roads in Missouri, even as water levels begin falling along much of the Missouri River.
Officials in those three states plan to work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine if any changes need to be made to the system of levees that is supposed to protect towns and cities from swollen rivers.
Yet more flood damage is possible as spring rains arrive and more snow in northern states melts and flows into rivers.
“We’re not done yet and I think that’s the other thing that we want to make sure folks are watching very closely,” Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said.
Lingering problems
Flooding continues to cause problems along several major rivers in the eastern Dakotas and northwestern Minnesota.
The National Weather Service says there’s a 10 percent chance the Red River will approach the 2009 record of 41 feet (12.5 meters) in Fargo, North Dakota, and neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota.
Both cities have implemented significant flood-fighting measures in the last decade, including home buyouts and levees that could be tested this year. But both cities have still declared emergencies and are launching sandbag-filling efforts — 1 million sandbags in Fargo and 150,000 in Moorhead.
Spring flooding also is a concern in southern Minnesota. Gov. Tim Walz, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and U.S. Rep. Angie Craig were among the public officials who joined Hastings residents to fill thousands of sandbags over the weekend. The Mississippi River at Hastings is forecast to rise to major flood stage this week.
In eastern South Dakota, major flooding is expected along the James and the Big Sioux rivers in the next couple of weeks, though record crests are not anticipated, according to Mike Gillispie, National Weather Service hydrologist in Sioux Falls.
“Sioux Falls itself should be in pretty good shape,” he said. “Just upstream (on the Big Sioux), though, Baltic, Dell Rapids, Trent, some of those smaller communities up through that stretch of river, there are significant impacts up there. Roads in the cities are being flooded, maybe even houses.”
Forecast fears
The weather service predicts eastern Nebraska and western Iowa could receive 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) of rain from Wednesday to Friday. That much rain would certainly send river levels higher, creating problems for homes behind levees that were weakened in the initial flooding.
The forecast may be revised as the storm gets closer. Meteorologist Bryon Miller said the good news is that the river crests following this week’s forecast storm will likely be lower than during recent floods.
“It doesn’t look like it will be anywhere near the crests we saw at the height of this,” said Miller, from the NWS office in Valley, Nebraska.
A combination of heavy rains and rapid snowmelt atop ground that was already saturated and in some places still frozen sent the Missouri River and other rivers over the top earlier this month.
Flood flow
This week’s storm system could also bring rain to the Mississippi River basin and exacerbate problems there.
But so far most of the flooding along the Mississippi hasn’t created major issues, National Weather Service meteorologist Jim Hladik said.
“The current levels are somewhat routine along the Mississippi,” Hladik said.
The Mississippi is expected to crest sometime in April, depending on the timing of spring rains and snowmelt. The river will be susceptible to flooding over the next month, Hladik said.
The Mississippi River is expected to keep rising in the Minnesota capital of St. Paul this week after reaching major flood stage Monday morning.

(Photo: Gerald Herbert, AP) Although the torrential rain from Florence may be coming to an end in the Carolinas, the slow-motion disaster of river flooding will continue to wreak havoc across the region for days – or potentially weeks. It may take up to two weeks for all of the runoff to drain slowly downstream from the mountains to the coast, forecasters warn. As of mid-day Monday, 19 river gauges in the Carolinas were at ""major"" flood stage, the National Weather Service said, and record crests could be challenged or shattered in some communities. Nearly 20 rivers in the Carolinas were expected to crest in major flood stage this week, the Weather Channel said. ""Just because much of the rainfall has stopped does not mean the danger has ended,"" the National Weather Service in Wilmington, North Carolina, said Monday. Officials warned that this could be the worst flooding in the state’s history. ""Flooding has become catastrophic in some areas and access to some communities will only be possible by boat into later this week,"" AccuWeather meteorologist Mike Doll said. ""This is truly a life-threatening situation."" Rivers such as the Cape Fear, Lumber, Waccamaw and Pee Dee are most at risk. In Lumberton, North Carolina, the Lumber River crested at an all-time record high of 22.18 feet Monday morning. “It’s hard going through it all over again,” Lumberton resident Bruce Mullis said, recalling Hurricane Matthew's rampage in 2016. “It’s only been two years. It’s honestly traumatizing.” In Fayetteville, the Cape Fear River is forecast to crest at 61.8 feet on Tuesday, which is over 25 feet above flood stage and only 7 feet below the all-time record. Thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate in that city as the rivers rise. More: 'There is no access to Wilmington' as Florence flooding overwhelms North Carolina More: Lack of flood insurance heaps misery on homeowners slammed by Hurricane Florence Record river flooding has already been reported in several North Carolina cities and towns, including Chinquapin, Trenton and Manchester, the Weather Channel said. As rivers swelled, North Carolina state regulators and environmental groups were monitoring the threat from gigantic hog and poultry farms located in low-lying, flood-prone areas. The flooding will next expand into western North Carolina and Virginia, including potential landslides in parts of the Appalachians, Weather Channel hurricane expert Rick Knabb said. ""We need everyone to be just as afraid of flooding as you would be for the winds of a hurricane or tornado,"" Knabb said. ""Waters are rising in entire communities. If you’re trapped in a flooded building, go to the highest level and call 911."" At least 18 people have been killed by Florence or its remnants since the storm first hit the region late last week. The storm will easily beome the USA's costliest hurricane of the year, so far: ""AccuWeather estimates that Florence will cause $30-60 billion in economic impact and damage."" By 11 a.m. Monday, Tropical Depression Florence was centered about 240 miles west of Charlottesville, Virginia, and was moving northeast at 15 mph. The Weather Channel said that millions of people in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast remain under flash flood watches as the remnant moisture from Florence heads north. Although the typical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season has passed, officially, the season lasts until the end of November. Ten tropical storms have formed so far this season in the Atlantic, of which 5 have been hurricanes, the National Hurricane Center said.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice and John Bacon, USA TODAY","Officials say recent flooding in parts of Nebraska has caused nearly $1.4 billion in estimated losses and damage. (March 20)
 AP, AP
Flooding that has overwhelmed levees and swamped a wide swath of the Midwest since last week's bomb cyclone storm is creating a ""slow-moving natural disaster"" with damages that total at least $3 billion.
Friday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said the damage cost in her state is an estimated $1.6 billion, so far. Earlier this week, Nebraska's damage total was reported to be over $1.4 billion.
Damage costs from other flooded states, such as Missouri, Kansas, South Dakota, Minnesota and Illinois, have yet to be tabulated. 
At least 3 people have been killed due to the flooding. 
On Thursday, Iowa Gov. Reynolds sent a request to President Donald Trump seeking an expedited Presidential major disaster declaration for 57 counties severely impacted by floods along the Missouri River and across the state. Across the state, water has inundated homes and businesses, destroyed crops, and forced evacuations.
Nebraska's cleanup is also a mammoth task. Damage to roads, levees and other structures in the state has reached almost $450 million. Crop losses were at $440 million and cattle losses totaled $400 million.
""I don't think there's ever been a disaster this widespread in Nebraska,"" he said.

While rivers are receding for now across parts of Nebraska, Wisconsin and Iowa, water draining downstream is causing the Missouri River to rise across northeastern Kansas and Missouri, AccuWeather said. The river's water levels are forecast to challenge the crest record of 31.63 feet at Atchison, Kansas, by the weekend.
As of late Friday, at least 100 river gauges in the central U.S. were listed at ""major"" or ""moderate"" flood stage, the National Weather Service said. 
Then there is the Mississippi River to contend with. The river is forecast to reach major flood stage in St. Paul, Minnesota, by the end of March, AccuWeather says.
""It is possible that many parts of the Mississippi River will remain above flood stage ... into the first part of the summer in the slow-moving natural disaster,"" AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said.

The bomb cyclone hammered more than a dozen states with heavy snow and/or rain along with high winds. Much of the region was already saturated or the ground frozen, meaning the water could not be absorbed. The result: More than a dozen states have dealt with flooding, flood watches and flood warnings.
In Minnesota, 35 of the state's 87 counties are already battling flooding or ice jams, city emergency management officials said.
Last SlideNext Slide
""Significant winter snowpack, deep frost, increased soil moisture, late thaw, recent precipitation and above normal streamflows are all contributing to a higher risk of flooding throughout Minnesota,"" the agency warned.
More: The waters are rising, the floods are coming. What can we do?
While Missouri River levels are on a downward trend, they will start to rise again when snow in South Dakota begins to melt, warned David Pearson, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service in Omaha, Nebraska.  He expects to see that secondary rise of an additional 1 to 2 feet by April 1.
I think we should be vigilant to that for the next month, possibly more,"" he said.
In Wisconsin, rivers have been receding since early in the week. But the National Weather Service warned that the reprieve may not last long.
""There is still 10-25 inches of snow across northern WI,"" the officer tweeted. ""This will continue to melt over the next several days, and could cause rivers to start rising as it does.""
In Missouri, the town of Craig, 100 miles north of Kansas City, was underwater. A mandatory evacuation was ordered for the  250 residents.
""Darkness has settled over town, and all you can hear is the sound of rushing water and the damn railroad signals going off,"" the town tweeted. ""@BNSFRailway no trains coming but plenty of water on the tracks. Sleep tight River Rats tomorrow is a new day.""

Bryan Bishop,"At SXSW 2018, I was invited to take part in a four-day immersive story experience called a SimuLife. Mounted by the Austin-based creative lab Interactive Deep Dive, SimuLife is meant to blur the line between fantasy and reality by letting me interact with the story as part of daily life. It’s like David Fincher’s movie The Game, executed in the real world. Other than those broad edicts, I wasn’t given any advance information about the experience. I’m documenting my journey through the story — wherever it leads. The story starts with Part 1: I’m a transdimensional dopplegänger. Everything had been building toward Tuesday. It was the day Faith and I planned to blow up Cooter &amp; Cooter’s acquisition of OpenMind in her timeline and the day I’d be meeting with Kai Goodwin in mine. Each offered an opportunity to halt the progress of OpenMind in our respective worlds, but they didn’t account for Bishop. We would need to find another way to deal with him. But the first message I received that morning was from Paige. The previous night, she’d sent me a poem, the result of a new writing schedule she’d decided to adopt after we’d discussed her career ambitions. The poem was fierce and defiant, and I praised her effusively. She wrote back how much it meant to her and asked if I’d be willing to read more. Part of me obviously knew Paige wasn’t real, but I still felt real friendship toward her. In a lot of ways, we’d become constants for each other over the past few days. But I also knew Tuesday was the final day of the story, and there was a melancholic twinge as I told her how happy I was that we’d met. My meeting with Kai was set for noon, with the C&amp;C press conference scheduled for an hour later. I could only hope that Bishop’s dimension-swapping would land me in the right places at the right times, but at 11:30, everything went sideways. My phone rang… and it was Nikita. I stammered a reply: “Wait, how are you—” “How am I what?” Calling me on this number, I thought. I hadn’t heard the dimension-switch sound, yet here I was, receiving a call from the OpenMind timeline. Had I switched over while in the shower? Had I simply missed the sound? But there wasn’t much time to worry about the mystery: Nikita told me she was at the library, and she had some information I needed to see immediately. I ran out the door, and a few blocks later, my phone lit up. This time it was Marilyn, saying Ruben was in jail because he’d hacked some servers. Later, I realized he’d followed through on our plans from the previous night and deleted the OpenMind code from the Goodwin Communications servers. But all I could think about in the moment was that I was somehow flipping back and forth between timelines, seemingly at random. A few steps later, another text — Nikita this time. It was all happening so fast, I could hardly keep track of where I was, but she told me I had to find Faith. My mind raced. I had no way of contacting Bishop’s wife, but one thought came to mind: the hotel room. I rushed back, hoping against hope that I’d find her there, just as I had on Saturday night. I touched my keycard to the lock and threw the door open. Nothing. I had one long-shot idea left. Faith knew Bishop was supposed to get together with Kai today, so I headed to the location of my noon meeting on the off chance she would be there. When I finally arrived, Kai was nowhere to be seen. I sat down at a table in front of the store, and then I heard it: wub-wub-wub-WHOOSH. I’d switched timelines. Whether back to my own or to OpenMind, I wasn’t sure — until I saw Faith crossing the street. I had a queasy feeling in the pit of my stomach. Everything was in turmoil, and in that moment, I wasn’t sure who I could trust. But she quickly explained what had happened. Last night, when Bishop was in the shower, she’d tried to steal the dimension-hopping gizmo. But he’d caught her in the act, and he knew she was trying to sabotage his plans. Bishop then vanished in the middle of the night and must have been pinging between worlds ever since trying to contain the damage. But the fact that Bishop was now meeting with Kai in my world gave us a window. He’d be preoccupied, so Faith had moved the big press conference up an hour. That would let us tear down the deal with Cooter &amp; Cooter before he even had a chance to come back. We found Nikita and Jules outside the library. The information Nikita had alluded to on the phone was a gold mine: a leaked set of internal emails from C&amp;C CEO Harold Cooter himself, breaking down the company’s larger aspirations for OpenMind. With the press conference drawing closer, we walked inside the building, then ducked into a side room to give the documents a look. They were horrifying. References to “mental vulnerability techniques,” “cognitive hacking,” and “neuromarketing.” C&amp;C intended to use the OpenMind thought-reading technology to create complete psychological profiles of people, then use that data to creating marketing campaigns and advertising that would permanently change the way people perceived reality. It wasn’t just about finding a more efficient way to target the most receptive audience; it was about secretly programming people to become loyal, willing C&amp;C customers. It was the kind of leak that could bring the whole operation down, and we all knew it. Then Faith slipped, referring to Bishop in the third person. Nikita caught the mistake in a flash — why was she talking about Bishop like that when I was right there in the room? After reading C&amp;C’s terrifying plans, absolutely anything seemed possible Nikita and her colleagues had put themselves on the line to get the leaked documents, so I decided it was time for me to do the same. I let them know the truth about who I was and where I’d come from. I’d like to say they believed me because I’d earned their trust, but I don’t think that was the case. I think it was the emails — after reading C&amp;C’s terrifying plans, absolutely anything seemed possible. It was time for Faith and me to make our entrance, so we split off from the others and opened the door to the press conference. Seeing my furrowed brow, she leaned in and whispered a reminder — “happy faces!” — and then with smiles wide, we walked inside. The press conference was being held in a large room inside the special-events wing of the library. Pockets of press and photographers were already waiting, along with 50 or so observers. The OpenMind board members and Cooter &amp; Cooter executives were waiting on the stage, and as Faith and I wound our way to the front, the announcement began. We suddenly heard a commotion in the back. Nikita’s protesters burst in, shouting and holding up anti-OpenMind signs. One of the C&amp;C executives calmed everyone down, and then Hayden stepped forward to announce her resignation — the one I’d demanded as a condition of the acquisition. Then, it was time to sign the documents that would formally close the deal. The head of the OpenMind board was up first; Harold Cooter came next, showering the crowd with a litany of buzzwords and marketing hype-speak about what great things C&amp;C would be able to do after rolling OpenMind out on a truly global level. Then it came time to announce Bishop’s return. Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge Bishop returning to the company was going to be the PR masterstroke for Cooter &amp; Cooter. A huge corporation taking hold of this kind of thought-reading technology could have raised immediate concerns, but with him joining as chief visionary officer, they would have a face the public was already comfortable with standing beside them, assuaging fears even as they rolled out sinister initiatives behind the scenes. Bishop was the stamp of approval they needed to make the whole thing work, and why they’d been willing to pay over $1 billion for the overall deal. But that’s also why Faith and I knew we both had to use this moment to blow the whole thing up and make sure no other company would be interested in moving forward with OpenMind in the future. A video started playing about the origins of OpenMind, building excitement for Bishop, but I didn’t even have a chance to see it. Faith’s assistant Dede had quietly appeared and delivered some news. Faith’s aunt had a medical emergency, and Faith needed to go. I’d have to take the lead and handle this myself. Bishop’s role as CVO was announced, and I walked onto the stage, showered with applause from the audience and boos from the protestors. I shook the hands of the various board members, carefully keeping a fake smile plastered on my face. I stepped forward to address the crowd and admitted that when I was ousted from OpenMind last year, I thought my time at the company had come to an end. And so when C&amp;C approached me about coming back, I said, I was excited about the possibilities. But there were some things the public didn’t know about OpenMind, I admitted. I shared that in the early days, the project never received regulatory approval, so I began experimenting on myself. There were no safety checks; no studies about long-term effects. And while the technology worked, there were problems. It caused mental health issues, and people had also died because of OpenMind. Photo by Nick Statt / The Verge The C&amp;C executives started to get nervous and tried to shut me down, but I waved them off. Then I turned to the subject of the leaked emails. As I laid out the corporation’s sinister plans, the crowd grew more indignant. I said I would share the documents with any members of the press that were interested, and that I couldn’t let the technology be used in this way in good conscience. The chant from the crowd was coming from all sides: Rip it up! Rip it up! To my right, a C&amp;C executive pleaded for me to just sign the deal. Instead, I picked the contract up in both hands, leaned into the microphone, and announced that the deal was not happening. I ripped the pages in two, letting them fall to the ground on either side. It was a moment of pure catharsis, the four days of the story culminating in one single, triumphant moment. For that split second, I felt like I was capable of anything. I felt the noise before I heard it. It came from right behind me, but the crowd was too loud for me to make out exactly what it was. It sounded, of all things, like a gong, and when I turned around, I was greeted by a flood of balloons spilling out onto the stage. Where uptight corporate executives had been moments before, there were now dancing, gyrating party people. This was the end of my four-day story adventure: a full-on rave I hadn’t really thought about what the end of my four-day SimuLife would look like, but it appeared that I was looking at it: a full-on rave. It was so surreal, I didn’t know how to process it. Then somebody handed me a glow stick, and I jumped on the floor along with everyone else and started dancing. Someone began chanting “Conga!” and a man in a blue, full-body elastic suit grabbed my hand and began dancing. It was Day-Glo chaos, and it was glorious. The Blue Man led me outside, and when the crowd dispersed, he pulled back his costume, revealing a face I recognized from the other timeline: Dr. Everett. But outside the fiction of the story, I knew that face belonged to Jeff Wirth, director of Interactive Deep Dive — the Austin-based creative lab that had designed my story experience. That seemed to be the signal: the story was over. I talked briefly about what an insane few days it had been. Jeff simply smiled and nodded. He asked if I was going to a previously scheduled meeting with a producer from Meow Wolf later that day, and gave me the time and place. I thanked him for this mind-bending ride, then headed back to my hotel. Going through an experience this intense, with this much emotional investment, had been exhilarating, and as I walked the streets of downtown Austin I was ebullient. But still, one thing nagged at the back of my mind: Bishop. The story experience had been expertly crafted, with every narrative setup leading to a dramatic pay-off. Yet in the end, the show had simply fizzled out, leaving the main villain on the loose. The morning’s finale had been a satisfying moment, but the story itself didn’t feel complete. Nothing’s perfect, I told myself. Not every experience can stick the landing. I simply had no idea what was coming next. Join us for the final installment of The SimuLife Diaries, where I finally have a chance to save the world from the threat of OpenMind — at terrible personal cost.","In the seventh installment of Deep Dive Austin’s SimuLife, Bishop is on the loose, while the resistance rallies in order to stop C&C’s acquisition of OpenMind’s thought-reading technology.",2018-03-15T14:58:32Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}","The SimuLife Diaries, part seven: I stopped an evil megacorp and had a neon rave",https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/15/17123268/immersive-experience-entertainment-alternative-reality-sxsw-2018-meow-wolf-simulife-part-seven,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EoU-53xi8vZlVAacggs0xtMNDWs=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10401385/openmind_logo.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Michael Biesecker / AP,"About 3.4 million chickens and turkeys and 5,500 hogs have been killed in flooding from Florence as rising North Carolina rivers swamped dozens of farm buildings where the animals were being raised for market, according to state officials. The N.C. Department of Agriculture issued the livestock mortality totals Tuesday, as major flooding is continuing after the slow-moving storm’s drenching rains. Sixteen North Carolina rivers were at major flood stage Tuesday, with an additional three forecasted to peak by Thursday. The Department of Environmental Quality said the earthen dam at one hog lagoon in Duplin County had breached, spilling its contents. Another 25 of the pits containing animal feces and urine have either suffered structural damage, had wastewater levels go over their tops from heavy rains or had been swamped by floodwaters. Large mounds of manure are also typically stored at poultry farms. North Carolina is among the top states in the nation in producing pork and poultry, with about 9 million hogs at any given time and 819 million chickens and 34 million turkeys raised each year. The N.C. Pork Council, an industry trade group, said the livestock losses from the storm should be taken in the context. “Our farmers took extraordinary measures in advance of this storm, including moving thousands of animals out of harm’s way as the hurricane approached,” the group said in a statement issued Tuesday. “We believe deeply in our commitment to provide care for our animals amid these incredibly challenging circumstances.” The industry lost about 2,800 hogs during flooding from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Sanderson Farms, a major poultry producer in the state, said it lost about 1.7 million chickens after flooding at more than 60 of the independent farms that supply its poultry processing plants. The company said its facilities suffered no major damage, but supply disruptions and flooded roadways had caused shutdowns at some plants. In addition, about 30 farms near Lumberton have been isolated by flood waters, hampering the delivery of feed to animals. The lack of food could cause additional birds to die if access isn’t restored quickly, the company said. Smithfield Foods, the world’s largest pork producer, said its plants also suffered no significant damage and are operating at limited capacity. The company said it would ramp up production as roads become passable. An environmental threat is also posed by human waste as low-lying municipal sewage plants flood. On Sunday, the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority reported that more than 5 million gallons of partially treated sewage had spilled into the Cape Fear River after power failed at its treatment plant. The Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that 16 community water treatment facilities in North Carolina are unable to supply drinking water and that seven publicly owned sewage treatment works are non-operational due to the flooding. Duke Energy is continuing cleanup operations Tuesday following a weekend breach at a coal ash landfill at its L.V. Sutton Power Station near Wilmington. Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said a full assessment of how much ash escaped from the waterlogged landfill is ongoing. The company initially estimated Saturday that about 2,000 cubic yards (1,530 cubic meters) of ash were displaced, enough to fill about 180 dump trucks. The coal-fired Sutton plant was retired in 2013 and replaced with a new facility that burns natural gas. The company has been excavating millions of tons of leftover ash from old pits there and removing the waste to a new lined landfill constructed on the property. The gray ash left behind when coal is burned contains toxic heavy metals, including arsenic, lead and mercury. Photos from the site provided to AP by Cape Fear River Watch, an environmental advocacy group, show cascades of gray-colored water spilling from at least two breaches at the landfill and flowing toward Sutton Lake, the plant’s former cooling pond which is now used for public recreation, including fishing and boating. Sutton Lake drains into the Cape Fear River. Sheehan said Duke’s assessment is that there was minimal chance any contaminants from the spill had reached the river. At a different power plant near Goldsboro, three old coal ash dumps capped with soil were inundated by the Neuse River. Duke said they had no indication those dumps at the H.F. Lee Power Plant were leaking ash into the river. Duke’s handling of ash waste has faced intense scrutiny since a drainage pipe collapsed under a waste pit at an old plant in Eden in 2014, triggering a massive spill that coated 70 miles (110 kilometers) of the Dan River in gray sludge. The utility later agreed to plead guilty to nine Clean Water Act violations and pay $102 million in fines and restitution for illegally discharging pollution from ash dumps at five North Carolina power plants. It plans to close all its ash dumps by 2029. In South Carolina, workers with electricity provider Santee Cooper erected a temporary dike in hopes of preventing flooding of an old coal ash dump at the demolished Grainger Generating Station near Conway. The dump is adjacent to the Waccamaw River, which is expected to crest at nearly 20 feet (6 meters) this weekend. That’s nine feet above flood stage and would set a new record height.",Rising North Carolina rivers swamped dozens of farm buildings where the animals were being raised for market,2018-09-19T11:55:58Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","3.4 Million Chickens and Turkeys and 5,500 Hogs Have Died in Flooding From Florence",http://time.com/5400429/florence-poultry-hogs/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/florence-flood-poultry-hog.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","A window-rattling winter storm brought blustery conditions, stretching from the northern Rocky Mountains to Texas.
 USA TODAY
Days of heavy rain and snowmelt brought historic flooding to the Upper Midwest on Friday. The floods have left one man dead, threatened a Nebraska dam and nuclear power plant, and halted traffic on the Missouri River. 
The situation has prompted evacuations in Wisconsin, Nebraska, South Dakota and Minnesota.
Heavy rain was courtesy of the massive ""bomb cyclone"" that battered the central United States this week with heavy snow, howling winds and several tornadoes. Rain and melting snow from the storm have already produced record high water levels along portions of the Boyer and Floyd rivers in Iowa and the Loup River in Nebraska, AccuWeather said.
So far, 19 locations in the Midwest have set new flood crest records, said weather.com meteorologist Jon Erdman. Overall, more than 300 river gauges were in flood stage in the central United States, the National Weather Service reported.
A Nebraska farmer was killed Thursday after the tractor he was in got carried away by floodwaters, the Omaha World-Herald said. 
The swollen Pecatonica River spills into downtown Darlington, Wis., on Thursday March 14, 2019. The National Weather Service has issued a flood warning or flood watch for about two-thirds of the state.

Also in Nebraska, the Cooper Nuclear Station along the swollen Missouri River will likely be shut down early Saturday as the river keeps rising, officials reported Friday. The shutdown is a precautionary measure only: even if it floods there is no danger, thanks to built-in safeguards, according to Nebraska Public Power District spokesman Mark Becker.
The U.S. Coast Guard says all traffic on the Missouri River from about 50 miles south of Omaha, Nebraska, downstream to St. Joseph, Missouri, has been shut down due to the rivers high water levels.

Flooding also reached the Dakotas: In Sioux Falls, South Dakota, at the Leif Erickson YMCA camp, executive director Mike Murphy said ""the severity of this particular flood event isnt something that anybody has ever experienced. It came up so rapidly, we weren't able to get our vehicles out or get anything out that we could drive or save,"" he said.

Though dry weather is forecast for the next several days across much of the USA, this round of Midwest flooding should persist into the weekend, the weather service warned. 
AccuWeather warned that the worst flooding may be yet to come for some areas along the upper and middle portions of the Mississippi River over the next several weeks, as much of the snow over the northern Plains, Upper Midwest and central High Plains melts.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Certain details about the rescue are only now coming to light After 17 days underground, all the Thai boys and their football coach have safely escaped from the Tham Luang cave complex. A team of Thai and international divers mounted a dangerous and complicated rescue to bring the boys out, and details of the bid are still emerging now. BBC correspondent Jonathan Head has answered some of the core questions about the boys, the rescue attempt, and what happens next. Why did the kids go so deep into the cave? We will not know that until we hear from them and their assistant coach, Ekkapol 'Ek"" Chantawong. On that Saturday they were scheduled to play a match, which was cancelled, according to head coach Nopparat Kanthawong. He scheduled a training session instead. The boys were keen cyclists so on the Facebook chat group through which they communicated with the parents, coach Ek suggested they cycle to the football field. There was no suggestion there that they would go on to the caves. Image copyright Facebook/ekatol Image caption A Facebook photo shows the coach with some of the young footballers Saturday was the 16th birthday of Pheeraphat 'Night' Sompiengjai, and a local shop said the boys spent more than 700 baht (US$22) on food to celebrate, a large sum in this area. Coach Nop describes Ek as being very kind-hearted and devoted to the boys. He thinks the boys persuaded him to go with them into the caves. The caves are well-known in the area and had been explored by the boys before. The best guess is they went quite deep, which is easy when they are dry, got caught by rising flood water, and were forced to go even deeper. What kind of communication have the children had with their parents and why are they not being allowed to see them? The official explanation is they are weak from their ordeal and potentially vulnerable to infection. These are now very precious lives in Thailand. A massive effort has been made to get them out alive. The Thai authorities are taking no chances. Media caption The boys give victory signs as they recover in hospital Perhaps they also wanted to avoid the excitement of seeing their parents again. Thais are generally less physical than westerners. Hugging is unusual. And the parents are from poor, marginal communities, used to being told what to do by officials, and probably grateful for the lengths the government went to in rescuing them. They would not protest. They were allowed to see them through windows, and are gradually being allowed in, wearing gloves and facemasks, to stand in the same room. Will coach Ek face any disciplinary proceedings? At this stage that seems unlikely. The parents say they have forgiven him, and they are grateful for the efforts he is reported to have made to keep their spirits up in the caves, in particular through meditation, which he learned during 12 years as a monk. Coach Nop said Ek may be asked to go back to being a monk for three months, something Thais typically do as a kind of penance, or to replenish or cleanse themselves spiritually. Such a move would make a lot of sense to Thais, and he would likely be allowed to resume life as normal after that. Also Thailand typically does not have a 'blame culture', where a culprit must be found for any misadventure. There is a more fatalistic acceptance of things going wrong, less public clamour for accountability. How did they survive so long with so little food, and lose so little weight? The boys were in the caves nine days before they were found. They may have had a little food from what they bought to celebrate Night's birthday. They are passionate football players, very fit, and with the training they have had a tight-knit team. This would have helped them ration their food carefully and support each other, perhaps with songs. Media caption Child psychiatrist: ""It will be a challenge for these children to go back to normal life"" Coach Ek taught them to meditate, say Thai navy divers, and gave them more food than he ate. He also told them to drink water dripping from the rocks, rather than polluted ground water. During their last six to eight days they were being fed, initially high-protein gels, but later more normal food, which might have allowed them to start putting on a little weight before coming out. Were they in the dark the whole time? Most of the time. They went in with cheap torches, which would not have lasted long. It is likely they were in the dark for most of the first nine days of their ordeal. Once they were found a Thai army doctor and at least three divers stayed with them, equipped with good torches. Even so they were mostly in the dark, and had to wear sunglasses when they were first brought out. Image copyright Thai Navy SEALs/Getty Images Image caption Rescuers brought them food, light and letters from their parents to help them cope Were they sedated in any way? The Thai authorities are being very coy about this. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said they had been lightly sedated. But the BBC has spoken to a number of people involved in the operation who say the boys were heavily sedated, and only semi-conscious. The logic for this would be the fear their rescuers had that they would panic when wearing diving equipment for the first time in darkness and swirling cave water, endangering the lives of all of them. The two British cave divers who led the rescue effort, John Volanthen and Richard Stanton, are believed to have asked for Australian Richard Harris, a cave diver and anaesthetician, to assist in preparing the boys. How they carried semi-conscious or very drowsy boys through the technically challenging early stages of the journey out, with a lot of diving in narrow passages, we do not know. At times they may have been strapped to a diver's body. Later they were strapped on to a stretcher and suspended from a rope pulley system attached to the cave roof. The entire operation was complex, innovative and very bold. Nothing like it has been attempted before. Some of those involved described the tasks undertaken by the core divers, who carried the boys out, as superhuman. Who has paid for this operation? The Thai government, for most of it. It is likely that the contribution by other countries, like the 30 US air force personnel who went to help, would have been funded by their own governments as a gesture of good will. Many Thai businesses supported with transport and food. Thai Airways and Bangkok Airways offered free flights to some of the foreign divers coming in. Media caption Thailand cave rescue: Meet the volunteer helpers Could the Thais have done this on their own? No, and few countries could. Cave diving is a very specialised skill, and expert cave rescuers are even rarer. Thailand was fortunate that an experienced caver Vern Unsworth has explored the Tham Luang cave complex extensively, and lives nearby. He was on the scene the day after the boys disappeared, and suggested that the Thai government needed to invite expert divers from other countries to help. The Thai navy divers who went down initially struggled, because both their experience and equipment were for sea diving, which is very different. They were driven out of the caves by rapidly rising flood water, and finding the boys seemed a hopeless cause. Once foreign divers arrived, from many different countries, the Thai authorities allowed them to devise first the search, and then the enormously complex rescue. It was a huge logistical operation involving hundreds of people, building guide rope and pulley systems, putting in power and communication cables. It is to Thailand's credit that it was organised so well, and there was no attempt to diminish the foreign contribution. Do you have a question about the Thai cave rescue?

Juli Clover,"Law enforcement officials are revisiting proposals that would require tech companies to build backdoor access into electronic devices to allow for better access to data in criminal investigations, reports The New York Times. This is an issue that was heavily debated following the 2016 legal dispute between Apple and the FBI over the iPhone 5c that belonged to San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook. The government wanted Apple to create software that would allow them to access data on the device, which Apple refused to do. In response to rumors over renewed efforts to build such a tool, Apple software engineering chief Craig Federighi told The New York Times that weakening security protections in iOS devices would be a grave mistake, maintaining Apple's stance on the issue. ""Proposals that involve giving the keys to customers' device data to anyone but the customer inject new and dangerous weaknesses into product security,"" he said in a statement. ""Weakening security makes no sense when you consider that customers rely on our products to keep their personal information safe, run their businesses or even manage vital infrastructure like power grids and transportation systems."" Apple has continually argued for the need for improvements to device security to stay ahead of hackers and other bad actors who exploit security vulnerabilities in iOS devices. During the dispute over the San Bernardino device, Apple refused to build a backdoor tool into its devices and argued that if such a tool existed, it could easily end up in non-government hands. Federighi has previously spoken passionately on the issue, and in early 2016, he published an op-ed in The Washington Post using the same argument he reiterated in his statement to The New York Times. iOS devices, he said, are ""part of the security perimeter that protects your family and co-workers."" From Federighi in 2016: To get around Apple's safeguards, the FBI wants us to create a backdoor in the form of special software that bypasses passcode protections, intentionally creating a vulnerability that would let the government force its way into an iPhone. Once created, this software -- which law enforcement has conceded it wants to apply to many iPhones -- would become a weakness that hackers and criminals could use to wreak havoc on the privacy and personal safety of us all. According to The New York Times, FBI and DOJ officials have been ""quietly"" meeting with security researchers to work on approaches that would provide ""extraordinary access"" to encrypted devices like the iPhone. Based on this research, DOJ officials ""are convinced"" there's a way to create a backdoor to access data without weakening a device's defense against hacking. One method under discussion involves a special access key that would be generated when a device encrypts itself, allowing data to be unlocked without a user's passcode. The key would be stored on the device itself, in a part of the hard drive that would be encrypted separately. Only the device manufacturer, with a court order, would be able to access it. Susan Landau, a computer security professor at Tufts University, told The New York Times that this would create ""significant additional security risks"" given that ""so many more tech companies"" would need to access these keys to comply with the inevitable flood of law enforcement access requests. Talks inside the executive branch have reportedly been renewed over whether to ask Congress to enact legislation that would require tech companies to create a new access mechanisms for law enforcement officials. The talks are said to be in a preliminary stage with no imminent request for legislation ready at this time.

Mike Senese,"On a gorgeous, sunny March 10th, the Maker Faire Cairo team held their fourth annual event in the Egyptian capital city. A representative from Make: has been able to attend each of their lead-up Faires (see our 2015/16 coverage here, and 2017 coverage here ). This year I got to make the trip to see how the skilled Cairo team has continued to grow one of the standout events in our network. Egypt stands in an important place both geographically and historically. Placed at the crux of Africa, the Middle East, and Europe (just across the Mediterranean), its ancient cultures and marvelous engineering have influenced societies for thousands of years. A fitting locale for a Maker Faire if there ever was one! Our visit included a tour of Cairo’s significant cultural spots, a visit to Fab Lab Egypt, and meetings and discussions with local makers and those who had traveled in from nearby countries — Tunisia, Jordan, Saudia Arabia, Germany, Sweden, and beyond. Plus, of course, the Faire itself, held outdoors in a grassy business park at the western edge of Cairo’s growing sprawl. Very well attended, Maker Faire Cairo’s exhibitors and visitors alike tended to be young and diverse, strongly balanced in gender, and with a leaning toward engineering and robotics — a promising mix for the social and technological future of the country. The one-day Faire ended long after dark with an energetic concert featuring a hugely popular Egyptian pop band that had regrouped just for that show. The spirit of the event, and of the entire city, was highly infectious and sets a great example of what a wonderful presence makers have on an international stage. I can’t wait for next year. One of the greatest engineering marvels, the Great Pyramids are in the city of Giza, which, with sprawl, blends into Cairo and is about 30 minutes outside that city’s center. They’re staggeringly large in person and sit on a plateau that give them even more prominence and historic protection from the wide flood field of the Nile (now controlled with modern dams). The dusty town extends close by; behind, the Sahara desert starts its stretch across northern Africa. Ancient Sphinx statue in excellent condition in the Egyptian Museum.

A massive crowd surrounded the combat bots arena throughout the Faire, with all sorts of offensive machinery going head-to-head. Two combat robots make first contact. The favored contender, a vicious spinning cylinder robot, rips into the perimeter barricade as its opponent hammers its shell with its spiked weapon. Local combat-bot builders test out their rigs and shoot flames while waiting for their bout to begin. Attendees watch a Minesweeper team prep their robot for the demonstration. The Minesweeper competition challenges students to build robots that can detect and clear landmines. Attendees got to test their robot-driving skills with this pair of bots, launching tennis balls at each other in a game of agility. Many ROV builders assembled their machines in the shade of the Faire’s tents. Two large pools let the ROV teams demonstrate their underwater crafts’ capabilities.

https://www.facebook.com/zezimak,"Florence continues to inch across the Carolinas, spurring a widespread emergency across all of North Carolina, from the ocean east to mountain west. Floodwaters are expected to push many rivers to all-time highs and could spur life-threatening landslides as the storm’s remnants move west. The storm has been linked to several deaths, according to authorities. Follow the storm’s projected path here and read the latest forecasts here. Key updates: Death toll rises to 17 | Flash floods in Mecklenburg County 1:01 a.m.: ‘It don’t look good’ – North Carolina county orders mandatory evacuation in preparation for potential dam breach Hoke County (N.C.) officials announced on late Sunday night a mandatory evacuation for people living near McLaughlin Lake due to a concern that a dam could be breached as heavy rains continue to fall on the area. Hoke County is located about 25 miles west of Fayetteville, N.C. “It is seriously damaged and we’re just getting prepared for the worst,” Scott Locklear of Hoke County’s Office of Emergency Management told The Washington Post. “It don’t look good,” Locklear said, adding that water is already coming over the dam. According to the county’s announcement, both the Coast Guard and units from Fort Bragg are on the scene to assist with evacuations. The National Weather Service in Raleigh, N.C., also issued an update at 11:30 p.m. Sunday on the status of six rivers in North Carolina. Officials said two of these rivers, Little River and Rocky River, are in “major flood,” meaning there is “extensive inundation of structures and roads” in certain areas along the waterways. River Flood Warnings as of 1130 PM (1/3)... Neuse River at: Goldsboro – Currently in Moderate Flood and rising Smithfield – Currently in Moderate Flood and nearing crest Clayton – Recently fell Below Flood Stage and falling pic.twitter.com/wRknhAgh6p — NWS Raleigh (@NWSRaleigh) September 17, 2018 — Allyson Chiu 11:59 p.m.: As heavy rains continue, multiple flash flood and tornado warnings issued The storm is expected to continue producing “widespread heavy rains over much of North Carolina and northeastern South Carolina,” the National Hurricane Center announced Sunday at 11 p.m. An additional two to five inches of rain is predicted to fall on parts of the Carolinas, the Mid-Atlantic states and southern New England. Some areas could receive as much as eight inches. The center reported that as of Sunday night, Florence had dumped a total of 40 inches of rain in southern North Carolina and 20 inches in northern South Carolina. Due to the unceasing rain, officials warn that “flash flooding and catastrophic/historic river flooding” is still a concern for “large portions of the Carolinas.” The warnings also extend to the Mid-Atlantic and New England states, and there is a risk of landslides in affected areas. Throughout Sunday evening, multiple flash flood warnings were issued for North Carolina and southwest Virginia, the National Weather Service tweeted. Many of these warnings are in place until Monday morning. Tornado warnings were also issued for several cities in North Carolina. Parts of North Carolina and South Carolina were also put on a tornado watch until 5 a.m. Monday. A couple tornadoes remain possible in the area through Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is moving north at 10 mph with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph. — Allyson Chiu 7:27 p.m.: Storm death toll rises to 17 Officials in Gaston County, N.C., said a 3-month-old was killed Sunday when a tree fell through the family’s single-wide mobile home. The infant and the mother were taken to a hospital, where the baby died, said Maj. Jamie McConnell with Gaston County EMS. At least 11 people have died as a result of the storm in North Carolina, and six in South Carolina. — Katie Zezima 6:42 p.m.: At least 16 people have died in the storm At least 16 deaths are now attributed to the storm. A woman in Lexington County, S.C., lost control of her car, hit a tree and was ejected from the vehicle, according to the South Carolina Emergency Management Division. At least six people have now died in South Carolina. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said at least 10 people have died in that state. — Katie Zezima 6:10 p.m.: ‘Looks like we’ve got a new lake in Charlotte’ The National Weather Service declared a rare flash flood emergency for parts of Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, because streams and creeks were running unusually high, in some locations reaching record levels. Tim Habershaw and his roommate, Zachary Finley, walked in their Carolina Panthers jerseys down Central Avenue in Charlote to view swollen Briar Creek, a normally placid brook that had turned into a torrent. “I drove by earlier on my way home from work, and I was like, ‘Whoa, looks like we’ve got a new lake in Charlotte,’ ” said Habershaw, 51, a restaurant server who lives two miles away with Finley, 25, a line cook. “I went home and took a nap, and when I woke up, I told [Finley], ‘We’ve got to go see this.’ ” About 3,000 miles’ worth of creeks, the vast majority little more than unnamed trickles, crisscross Mecklenburg County in a vast lacework that flows to larger rivers and, eventually, to the Atlantic Ocean. Charlotte’s rolling topography tends to funnel floodwaters into low areas that usually correspond to creek beds. Habershaw has lived in Charlotte for 30 years and said he had never seen Briar Creek as high as it was Sunday afternoon. “It’s kind of scary,” he said, “but beautiful.” The heaviest rain fell in southeastern Mecklenburg County. Some places received 10 inches of rain this weekend. — Greg Lacour 5:30 p.m.: Hundreds of dialysis patients rescued from their homes Late Sunday afternoon, Tom Cotter, North Carolina team leader for the relief group Americares, was waiting in the parking lot of a shelter in Wilson, N.C., for the arrival of 105 dialysis patients who were on their way by bus after having been rescued from their flooded homes in Jacksonville, N.C., 90 miles to the south. Many of them had been rescued by boats from their homes, and some had not received treatment for as many as five days. Cotter had brought health screening devices, essential medicine, adult diapers, cleaning supplies and more. A dialysis center across the street will deliver care. “This is very much an ongoing disaster,” Cotter said. “People are still coming into these shelters.” — Steven Mufson 4:27 p.m.: Warily watching the rivers in South Carolina Renee Matthews has been walking to Lynches River at least once every day, checking how far it has risen. Two days ago, the river that surrounds her family’s property in rural Florence County, S.C., was dry and barely rose past her nephew’s knee. By Sunday, the river bank was nowhere to be seen. The boat landing that leads to the bank was buried in debris, and the four-foot concrete barrier next to it was nearly submerged. “It’s probably come up two to three feet,” she said, aiming her phone to take a picture. “You could walk right there two days ago. You could walk all around that tree two days ago,” she said, pointing at a submerged tree. And the deluge of rain has barely started. Flooding happens every few years in this wooded riverfront neighborhood of mobile homes and big houses, some of which were built several feet above the ground. “The water goes all the way to the top of that house,” Matthews said, pointing at an empty vacation home that stands at least six feet from the wet, grassy land. There has been no flooding yet in the county that shares a name with the storm. But officials are monitoring the Lynches River and other bodies of water inland as rain continues and rainfall from the north flows downstream, said Dusty Owens, director of the county’s emergency management division. Here in Florence County, several bodies of water – the Great Pee Dee River to the east, Lynches River to the south, and Black Creek to the north, are all expected to rise. Lynches River, for example, has risen by more than five feet since Friday. The Great Pee Dee could rise to 27 feet by Thursday, surpassing the flood stage by eight feet. “Next week, it’ll be our problem,” Matthews, 48, said. “This river’s going to keep rising.” — Kristine Phillips 3:47 p.m.: At least 15 people dead due to the storm At least 15 people have now died as a result of tropical depression Florence, which slammed into the Carolinas as a hurricane on Friday. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R) said five people were killed in the storm: Amber Dawn Lee of Union County; Mark Carter King and Deborah Collins Ryan, who lost their lives in a generator-related incident on Saturday; Michael D. Prince, who died this morning when he lost control of his car in Georgetown County; and Jeffrey B. Youngren, who died Sunday morning in Kershaw County after driving into a support beam. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said 10 people in the state have died due to the storm. — Felicia Sonmez 3:17 p.m.: An aging levee system holds, while a temporary barrier weakens As the swollen Lumber River in Lumberton, N.C., rose ever higher in Sunday’s pouring rain, the aging levee system in Robeson County held strong, said county spokeswoman Emily Jones. But a temporary sandbag barrier built by volunteers and National Guardsmen amid pouring rain this week had been “compromised” by the rising water levels, Jones said. Water had broken through that section of the river, which passed by railway tracks on the west side of town, during Hurricane Matthew in 2016, flooding businesses and homes. Sebastian Milton, a volunteer with the Cajun Navy who came to Lumberton from Covington, La., to help with rescue operations, said it’s a matter of time before the levee fails as well. [ Cajun Navy races to the Carolinas; citizen rescuers pull people from rising waters ] “That’s a man-made structure,” he said, “it can’t keep holding back the river.” Milton and fellow volunteers were posted on a bridge overlooking the Lumber River and a flooded section of Interstate 95 on Sunday afternoon. Their boats at the ready, they waited in pouring rain for the next emergency call to come in. “There’s still people out there,” Milton said, gesturing toward the expanse of dark water and trees that hid flooded homes. — Sarah Kaplan 2:49 p.m.: In Pembroke, N.C., ‘We’re having problems already.’ In Pembroke, N.C., emergency officials conducted about 120 evacuations and 20 rescues – complicated procedures like pulling people out of submerged cars – since the storm began. Charles Gregory Cummings, the town’s mayor, said officials had been working all week to make sure that the most vulnerable people in the community were safe from the storm. Police officers gave homeless citizens rides to the local shelters and conducted daily drives through public housing complexes, using a bullhorn to inform people about the coming deluge. Pamphlets were posted at every mobile home park bearing information about the forecast and where to seek shelter. Officers checked in daily at a local senior home to make sure their generators were working and they had enough food. On a drive through town to examine flooding “trouble spots,” Police Chief Ed Locklear noted that most of the public housing in Pembroke is located in the low-lying north side of town. There, canals and underground systems that drain water into the nearby swamp are easily overwhelmed by downpours. Several officials said that these canals were still clogged with downed trees and debris from Hurricane Matthew – the town hadn’t had the resources to fix the problem earlier, and only just received recovery funding from the federal government. Now Locklear cruised past a street to one of those housing complexes; it was submerged beneath what looked like a foot of muddy brown water. Sandbags rested against the homes’ front doors. “These are places that always flood,” Locklear said. “And you can see we’re having problems already.” — Sarah Kaplan 2:34 p.m.: Trump monitoring ‘the preparedness and response efforts’ The White House, in a statement, said President Trump is monitoring the storm and its effects: “Today, President Trump continues to monitor the preparedness and response efforts for Hurricane Florence. He was briefed again this afternoon by Sec. Nielsen, Admiral Schultz and Administrator Long. Yesterday, he spoke with Mayor Brenda Bethune of Myrtle Beach, SC and Mayor Dana Outlaw of New Bern, N.C. They discussed the rescue and response efforts in those communities and the President offered the full support of Federal government. Mayor Outlaw thanked President Trump for immediately authorizing the emergency declaration.” 2:31 p.m.: Mandatory evacuations in Fayetteville City officials in Fayetteville, N.C., said at an emergency meeting of the city council on Sunday that the Cape Fear River is expected to crest at 62 feet on Tuesday and recede sometime after 8 p.m. Friday. The river is already above flood stage, and there continues to be flash flooding and critical river flooding in the area, they said. Officials have been notifying residents that there is a mandatory evacuation order for those living within one mile of the Cape Fear and Little rivers. For other neighborhoods there is a voluntary evacuation order. There is also a curfew in effect until further notice. Thirteen roads in the city are closed so far due to high water or flooding, 50 to 60 traffic lights are out, and the city is closely monitoring the levels of nearby dams. Currently there are fewer than 10,000 people without power. Officials also said they have been pushing back against rumors that the city’s water supply is going to be shut off later Sunday afternoon; there are no plans for water to be shut off, they said. One official said that 160 people were transported from a nursing home to shelters last night. The city is working with EMS and others to provide transport to people in wheelchairs and those who need help getting out of bed. Officials are also working to open up more shelters for as many as 7,500 people who may be displaced. — Felicia Sonmez 1:46 p.m.: The storm is spawning an array of safety and environmental hazards Federal officials described an array of life-safety and environmental hazards spawned by Hurricane Florence in a Sunday afternoon teleconference. Among them: The floodwaters are potentially contaminated and could present a health hazard. “If you can avoid contact with floodwaters, do so,” said Reggie Cheatham, director of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Emergency Management. He said there are an estimated 3,300 “hog ponds” in North Carolina that hold manure. There is concern that heavy rainfall could cause them to overflow and send hog manure into waterways. Officials so far are “fairly confident” that farmers prepared adequately in advance of the storm to prevent the ponds from overtopping, Cheatham said. “But we’re not out of the woods yet.” Cheatham said that, at last count, there had been 28 boil-water orders issued by local water systems. Meanwhile there has been a significant spill of coal ash from a storage pond at a closed Duke Energy plant near Wilmington, N.C. Cheatham said 2,000 cubic yards of coal ash spilled into a ditch after floodwaters eroded a portion of the pond wall. That ditch leads to a cooling pond that has an outflow into the Cape Fear River, but he said there’s no evidence so far that the coal ash has reached that cooling pond. Duke Energy said in a statement Saturday that the company “does not believe this incident poses a risk to public health or the environment.” Federal officials are urging evacuees to stay where they are and not attempt to return home. “Don’t feel a need to rush home to file a claim” said National Flood Insurance Program chief executive David Maurstad. Coast Guard Adm. Meredith Austin said three major ports in the Carolinas remained closed, including the Cape Fear port near Wilmington. That closure is significant because the Cape Fear water utility has put out an urgent plea for fuel. “Cape Fear is the number one priority of getting a port open,” she said. “We are aware of the need to get fuel into the port.” FEMA associate administrator Jeff Byard provided the big picture: “This is a long event. We are definitely likely to have isolated communities.” — Joel Achenbach 1 p.m.: ‘This storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now.’ North Carolina officials said floodwaters continue to rage and residents across nearly the entire state are in danger from torrential rainfall, rising rivers, floodwaters and, in the mountains, mudslides. “This storm has never been more dangerous than it has right now,” in many areas of the state, Gov. Roy Cooper (D), said at a midday news conference. “Wherever you live in North Carolina, be on alert for sudden flooding.” Cooper said numerous rivers throughout the state – including the Cape Fear, Lumber, Neuse – are still rising and not expected to crest until later Sunday or Monday. The storm has dumped nearly two feet of rain in many places, and some places are being pummeled with to three inches of rain an hour. Flooding is getting worse in parts of the state, including Pollocksville, Lumberton, Kinston and Goldsboro. The danger is growing in North Carolina’s western mountains, where rains could lead to dangerous mudslides. Officials urged North Carolinians to stay off the roads. Many are closed; at least 171 primary roads are closed throughout the state, including portions of Interstates 95 and 40. People are urged not to drive east of Interstates 73/74 or U.S. Route 64 South. Many secondary roads are closed because of flooding. Cooper estimated that between 750,000 and 1 million people have evacuated certain areas, a figure that will rise with expected mandatory evacuations in some places as rivers rise. About 15,000 people are staying in about 150 shelters across the state, he said. Four medical shelters are open in North Carolina, serving at least 170 patients. More than 900 people have been rescued from floodwaters, Cooper said. At least 700,000 people remain without power and residents should expect to be without for days because so many roads are impassible. “People need to understand that some areas are likely to be without power for a while,” Cooper said. The governor said food, water and high-water vehicles are being delivered to hard-hit areas. The Coast Guard has rescued at least 50 people via helicopter. — Katie Zezima","Washington Post Florence dumps torrential rain, raises floodwaters across the Carolinas Washington Post Florence continues to inch across the Carolinas, spurring a widespread emergency across all of North Carolina, from the ocean east to mountain west.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected on Wednesday to visit North Carolina, where thousands of homes and roadways remain underwater and swollen rivers threaten more flooding less than a week after Hurricane Florence made landfall. Trump, who has been criticized for his response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, plans to arrive at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina, at about 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) and return to Washington at 6:15 p.m. (2215 GMT), according to the White House. More than 15,000 people remain in shelters and more than 200,000 customers are without power across North Carolina, six days after Florence made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, according to state officials. “We continue to feel the effects of this massive storm,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Tuesday. “Even though there is no substantial rain in the forecast and the sun may be shining across many parts of our state, rivers continue to rise and we will see more flooding.” The Cape Fear River was expected to crest at 61.5 feet (19 meters), four times its normal height, on Wednesday in Fayetteville, a city of 200,000 near the Fort Bragg army base in the southern part of the state, according to the National Weather Service. That has disrupted efforts to restore power, clear roads and allow evacuated residents to go home. “There is a strong potential that those who live within the 1-mile evacuation area of the Cape Fear River will be impacted by flooding,” the city said in a statement. The city manager told CNN that 12,000 people are “in harm’s way.” Florence has killed at least 35 people, including 26 in North Carolina and eight in South Carolina, where local media reported that two female mental health patients drowned on Tuesday after a sheriff’s van they were in crashed. One person was killed in Virginia by a tornado that spun off from Florence. SWOLLEN RIVERS Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas. Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage resulting from Florence, which has dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina since Thursday. At least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage, with three others set to crest in the coming days in North Carolina, the state said. In the town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, which has struggled to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, only about 50 residents remained on Tuesday, Fair Bluff Police Chief Chris Chafin told Reuters. The town has largely been cut off by flooding from the still-rising Lumber River, which was expected to crest on Wednesday. As Florence was bearing down on the Carolinas last week, Trump reignited the controversy over his handling of Maria by disputing the official death toll of 2,975 in the U.S. territory, which was compiled by public health experts at George Washington University. Trump said, without offering evidence, that Democrats had inflated the figure to make him look bad. In addition to the deaths, Maria devastated the infrastructure of Puerto Rico, whose 3 million citizens are Americans but do not vote in presidential elections, and left much of the island without power for months. Critics said the Trump administration was slow to recognize the extent of the damage and slow to help.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected on Wednesday to visit North Carolina, which is bearing the brunt of Florence’s deadly deluge and where rivers are still rising while thousands of homes and roadways remain submerged. Trump’s trip to the state follows criticism for his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last year, and more recently for disputing the official death toll of 3,000 in the U.S. territory.

Sandro Galea,"afp/Getty Images Nearly one year after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, the official death toll for the disaster stands at 64. However, a new study, published Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, estimates that at least 4,645 people have died as a consequence of the storm. That is more than 70 times the official estimate. Perhaps most worrisome, it is not at all clear that we are taking steps to mitigate the consequences of future hurricanes. This observation, as a new hurricane season is about to begin, should give us all pause. With this in mind, what lessons can we learn from Hurricane Maria to better prepare us for future disasters? Here are three. 1. Communities should be ready to handle the full range of health consequences of these disasters. While the new data on the deaths due to Hurricane Maria are sobering, the health effects of disasters such as the hurricane undoubtedly extend well beyond these deaths. They include worsened mental health, lack of access to essential care, and a general deterioration in the health of vulnerable populations. The physical and mental health consequences of disasters are lasting, shaping health for weeks, months, even years after the trauma of the event. When Hurricane Harvey struck Texas and Louisiana, for example, affected populations had to contend with the lacerations, broken bones, flood risk, and sudden death they faced not only on the day of the storm but also in the weeks and months that followed, with mold in their homes, contaminated flood waters, and disruptions in medical care due to flooded hospitals and waterlogged medications. This accumulated hazard continued to undermine health long after the storm had passed. Reviews of the mental health consequences of disasters have found that as many as half of those directly in the path of a hurricane risk developing post-traumatic stress disorder, and 10% of those who live in the general area of the storm run a similar risk. Disasters can also fuel depression and substance use disorders. After the September 11 terrorist attacks, for example, rates of alcohol, cigarette, and drug use increased in New York City. Assessments of those affected by storms should look not only at deaths but entire populations exposed to storms and their aftermath. Health systems need to be prepared to deal with the full range of consequences of these events. 2. Efforts to shore up basic infrastructure must happen well before hurricanes hit. The primary reason for the heavy damage to Puerto Rico was that the stability — or lack — of basic infrastructure in Puerto Rico made the island less able to endure the high-force winds, heavy rains, and physical damage from the storm. Puerto Rico has shown us the fragility of power systems, water systems, and roadways. On September 26, six days after Hurricane Maria made landfall, 58 of Puerto Rico’s 69 hospitals had neither power nor fuel. Weeks later, the situation did not improve. Households went an average of 84 days without electricity, 68 days without water, and 41 days without cellular service. Citizens lacked access not only to health care but also to basic resources. Low-lying coastal regions, like Puerto Rico, are particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters. There is simply no substitute for shoring up basic infrastructure and creating disaster plans to bring damaged systems back online ahead of a hurricane to allow these areas to withstand high-force winds and to mitigate loss of life after hurricanes hit. 3. We must invest in human capital well in advance of disasters. The social, economic, and environmental conditions that shape health before disaster strikes are core to deciding how much damage the event is able to inflict, and how quickly communities can recover. While our narratives of recovery often focus on individual resilience, it is the strength of a society as a whole that most determines its capacity to bounce back after the worst happens. We saw this in Puerto Rico, where generations of economic and political marginalization, combined with a shoddy physical infrastructure, set the stage for the misery that continues to unfold. These issues were known about for years. Had they been properly handled, Puerto Rico might have been far more resilient in the face of Maria. Unfortunately, what happened after Hurricane Maria was eminently predictable. We had decades to invest in the island, to fix its roads and power grid, and to reject the economic colonialism that has done so much to undermine Puerto Rico’s fiscal health. In the age of climate change, with extreme weather events becoming more powerful and frequent, we can ill afford to ignore areas that are likely to suffer the devastating consequences of natural disasters. That we will have more Marias is certain, and how we can prepare for them should be clear if we are paying attention.",We aren’t taking enough steps to prepare for future disasters.,2018-05-30T20:02:46Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Hbr.org'}",3 Lessons from Puerto Rico: Mitigating the Health Effects of Future Hurricanes,https://hbr.org/2018/05/3-lessons-from-puerto-rico-mitigating-the-health-effects-of-future-hurricanes,https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2018/05/may18-30-850860206-afp.jpg,,Hbr.org,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lauren Goode,"Better batteries mean better products. They give us longer-lasting smartphones, anxiety-free electric transport, and potentially, more efficient energy storage for large-scale buildings like data centers. But battery tech is frustratingly slow to advance, due to both the chemical processes involved and the challenges that exist around commercializing new battery designs. It remains incredibly tough for even the most promising battery experiments to find their way out of research labs and into the devices we carry. That hasn't stopped people from trying. In recent years researchers and technologists have presented a variety of ways in which the materials in rechargeable lithium batteries—the kind in your phone right now—can be tweaked to improve battery density and, more importantly, battery safety. These technologies aren't going to make it to market in time for the Next Big Product Launch, but as we watch our phones slurp up the last dribble of power at the end of a long day, we can dream about the future. Battery Basics Complex battery technology can make even the most tech-savvy person feel like they need a PhD in chemistry to make sense of it, so here's an attempt to break it down. Most handheld and portable electronics use lithium ion batteries, which are made up of an anode, a cathode, a separator, an electrolyte, a positive current, and a negative current. The anode and cathode are the ""ends"" of the battery; a charge is generated and stored when the lithium ions (carried by the electrolyte) move between the two ends of the battery. Lithium ion is still considered to be one of the lightest and most efficient battery solutions. But because it only has so much physical energy density, there are limits to how much of a charge it can hold. It's also sometimes dangerous : if something goes awry with the separator, and electrodes come in contact with one another, the battery starts to heat up. And liquid electrolytes are highly flammable. This is what often leads to exploding batteries. ""[Electric] car crashes, Samsung phones–those are mostly thermal runaway problems,"" says Partha Mukherjee, who researches energy storage and conversion at Purdue University's school of mechanical engineering. Some of the solutions being worked on now introduce alternative materials that increase the efficiency and thermal stability of batteries—for example, using silicon nanoparticles for the anode instead of commonly-used carbon graphite, or using solid electrolytes instead of liquid ones. Silicon Anode Typically, graphite anode materials are used in lithium ion batteries. But microscopic silicon particles have been emerging as a more efficient replacement for graphite–and at least one company thinks this technology will come to market within the next year. ""An atom of silicon can store about 20 times more lithium than atoms of carbon,"" says Gene Berdichevsky, the CEO of California-based Sila Nanotechnologies and an early Tesla employee. ""Essentially, it takes fewer atoms to store the lithium, so you can have a smaller volume of material storing the same amount of energy"" as a typical graphite material. He says Sila Nano will launch its first battery product for the consumer market early next year. At launch, Berdichevsky expects to see 20 percent improvement in battery life over traditional lithium ion batteries. Others have already pursued a silicon anode as a solution to today's battery problems; there's an entire consortium dedicated to the cause, which includes the Argonne, Sandia, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories. Berdichevsky and Sila co-founder and CTO Gleb Yushin say what sets their research apart is that they believed they've solved the ""expansion"" problem. Silicon has a tendency to swell, essentially destroying batteries with every charge. Sila's tech involves tucking the microscopic silicon particles into tiny spherical structures inside the battery that leave some room for the silicon to expand. That may sound like a simple solution, but Berdichevsky says it's been anything but. ""It's taken us seven years and 30,000 iterations in our lab, no exaggeration, to develop a method for creating this structure,"" he says. Berdichevsky also says the challenge with developing any battery tech is to create something that ""doesn't make one thing better while making other things worse, which is the nature of academia because it's happening in a lab."" Lithium Metal Batteries made with lithium metal have a reputation to overcome: soon after they were commercialized in the late 1980s by Moli Energy, they caused enough fires to warrant a massive recall of all of the cells on the market. But Mukherjee at Purdue University, and others, say lithium metal batteries have been enjoying some renewed interest over the past five years. New designs are emerging which use lithium metal for the negative anode part of the battery instead of graphite, enabling the battery to hold a higher charge. Much of this interest in higher-charge batteries has been driven by the growth of electric cars; as ARPA-E researchers noted in this paper published in Nature last December, ""the present lithium ion material platform"" is unlikely to meet the US Department of Energy's electric vehicle pack goals for weight, energy density, and cost by 2022. Meanwhile, building cells with lithium metal electrodes could increase the energy density of the same batteries by as much as 50 percent. Last week, researchers from Yale University published a paper in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that detailed a new approach to working with lithium metal electrodes. Hailaing Wang, the lead researcher, described it as ""aggressively trying to use 80 to 90 percent of the lithium"" in a battery, otherwise known as deep-cycling. Before the batteries were assembled, the researchers immersed a glass fiber separator in a lithium nitrate solution. Then, while the batteries were operating, the slow release of that lithium nitrate and its decomposition were found to ""greatly improve the performance of lithium metal electrodes."" But the biggest problem with lithium metal is that it still makes for extremely volatile batteries that generate a lot of heat. Wang and his team were able to successfully demonstrate that this combination of technology–lithium metal plus protective additives–works in the lab. Real-world use is a different matter. ""We were operating at a low scale, and the conditions were well controlled, so safety was not a concern,"" Wang said over the phone. He described it as ""good progress, but still far from being commercialized."" Solid State Battery wonks sometimes use ""solid state"" and ""lithium metal"" interchangeably, since they can apply to different parts of a battery and co-exist within the same battery structure. And, like lithium metal, solid state batteries have gotten an increasing amount of attention in recent years because of their potential use in EVs. A solid state battery is one that replaces the either the battery's electrodes, its liquid electrolyte, or both, with some type of solid like ceramic or glass. Because you're replacing the highly flammable materials (aren't you glad you were paying attention at the start of class?) with something solid, the idea is that the battery can withstand higher temperatures, which in theory means higher capacity. One Woburn, Massachusetts-based company is taking a slightly different approach. Ionic Materials is replacing the liquid electrolyte with an ionically-conductive polymer, or plastic, that's also a fire retardant material. ""People are working on variations of anodes and cathodes, but the real block [to battery advancement] is the electrolyte, which is what we're trying to improve upon,"" says Mike Zimmerman, CEO of Ionic Materials. He noted that ceramic and glass can be brittle, and can give off gases when exposed to moisture, so he believes those solids are less-than-ideal solutions for solid state batteries. One of Ionic Materials's key investors told WIRED's Steven Levy last year that the company is trying to combine the best aspects of the low-cost alkaline batteries with power and rechargeable nature of lithium ion. If the company can crack that formula, it believes it can even power an entire smart grid with its technology. Again, that doesn't mean solid state batteries will flood the market anytime soon. Last year Toyota admitted it was having issues developing high-capacity solid state batteries. Then, in April, a senior vice president of research and engineering at Nissan said that development of solid state batteries is ""practically a zero at this stage."" But one other move may give Ionic Materials an advantage: it says it doesn't plan to do its own manufacturing, but instead wants to license its technology to existing battery makers. For most innovators in battery tech, even if they solve the problems of materials, chemistry, and safety, building a facility to produce batteries at scale is a tremendous challenge. It turns out that, unless you have the leverage of Elon Musk, you can't just build your own giant Tesla Gigafactory.

ABC News,"Three reported tornadoes swept through the South overnight, while flooding and other severe weather also wrecked havoc on the region, resulting in at least four deaths. The tornadoes were reported in Kentucky, Tennessee and Arkansas. Three of the deaths reported so far were reported in Kentucky, while the fourth death occurred in Arkansas. A screengrab from a video that a resident shot of a reported tornado near Alvaton, Kentucky. In Kentucky's Logan County, one person died from a house collapsing due to strong winds. In Simpson County, a man was killed after flooding washed away his car. And in Henderson County, a man was found dead submerged in his car. The fourth death, in Arkansas, was caused by a man's trailer being blown away during strong winds. Straight-line wind gusts of 70 mph were reported in parts of Arkansas. There was also widespread damage in parts of Missouri, as well. Missouri State Highway Patrol tweeted this photo of New Madrid County following severe weather. In Hopkinsville, Kentucky, damage to homes prompted 13 residents to relocate to a shelter and 25 residents to move into a hotel. Over 4 inches of rain was reported in the Louisville, Kentucky area on Saturday. Louisville has seen over 10 inches of rain so far this month, nearly three times the city's average monthly rainfall. According to the Louisville Division of Fire, there were over 100 water rescues overnight. Nearly 6 inches of rain has been reported in western Kentucky in the past week. Missouri State Highway Patrol tweeted this photo of New Madrid County following severe weather. Now, the good news: The storms are rapidly losing intensity Sunday morning as they move off to the north and east. Drier air is finally moving into much of the central U.S. for the next few days. However, the concern for river flooding remains. Over 30 gauges across much of the Midwest and south-central U.S. will see major river flooding this week. The Ohio River in Cincinnati will reach 60 feet Sunday, the highest in 20 years. This is moderate flood stage for the area. Homes and businesses near the river will see some flooding. The Ohio River at McAlpine Upper, near Louisville, is on the rise this morning. The Ohio River here is now the highest it's been in 20 years. The river flooding across the central U.S. could linger for much of the upcoming week. It will take time for the some rivers to come to their highest crest and then recede. The Mississippi River, for example, at Osceola will reach major flood stage by next weekend. The next round of unsettled weather arrives around midweek, when more rain and severe weather could return to regions that were hard hit overnight. On the colder side of this storm, snow moved from the central Plains into the upper Midwest. Nearly 5-6 inches of snow reported in the Twin Cities metro area. There are flood warnings and watches across the South and Midwest. It'll be stormy along the Gulf Coast through Sunday night. The Gulf Coast can expect between three and four inches of rain through Sunday night. Some heavy rain and strong thunderstorms will get caught up across portions of the Gulf Sunday, from eastern Texas to southern Mississippi. Locally 3 to 4 inches of rain is possible and some flash flooding will be possible in the metro areas from Houston, Texas, to Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Temperatures will be in the 30s and 40s for most of the Northeast. The Northeast will experience snow and ice on Sunday. In the Northeast, heavy rain and some wintry mix will move in Sunday morning. Temperatures are very close to freezing across interior New England. Therefore there is a risk of some low end ice and snow accumulation on untreated roadways and surfaces. The weather will be stormy in parts of the West through Tuesday. Many western states will experience snowfall through Tuesday. As for the West, another round of cold air and snow is moving in on Sunday. It will bring more heavy snow to Cascades and parts of the Sierra Nevada. Lowland snow will be possible across parts of the Seattle area Sunday. Accumulations should be light. However in parts of the Cascades another 1 to 2 feet will be possible. As the frontal system moves south into California, it will increase the winds out ahead of the system. Wind gusts over 35 mph will be possible in parts of southwest California Sunday. By Monday night and Tuesday, there will be some rain moving into southern California, with locally over 0.3"" of rain possible in the metro area. Another round of snow will be possible in the higher elevations outside of Los Angeles, with 1 to 2 inches of snow possible. It'll be chilly this week for the western half of the country. Behind this frontal system, another round of pretty cold air comes into the west, with wind chills dropping from Washington to the Rockies. Seattle, Portland, and Los Angeles will have chances to have wind chills in the 30's this upcoming week. This comes after having below average temperatures across the region for the last week or so.","Three reported tornadoes swept through the South overnight, while flooding and other severe weather also wrecked havoc on the region, resulting in at least four deaths.

Matt Petronzio,"Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewing company, is devoting two Super Bowl ads this year not to beer, but water. The new TV spots, from the brewer's popular brands Budweiser and Stella Artois, both focus on the need for clean water in different parts of the world. It's undoubtedly an effort by Anheuser-Busch to show off its accomplishments in corporate social responsibility, but it's also an example of trends in Super Bowl ad spend toward promoting good causes, rather than simply trying to sell products. And this year, these ads could spread some much-needed awareness. SEE ALSO: How Apple, Anheuser-Busch, and other companies are helping Harvey victims The Super Bowl has long offered the best TV ad real estate of the year. More than 112 million people are expected to watch the big game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots on Sunday, with coveted advertising spots costing "" north of $5 million "" for 30 seconds. That's a lot of eyes, which is why ""Stand By You"" — the one-minute, heartwarming Budweiser ad that stops just short of being emotionally overwrought — is an important use of airtime. It shows Kevin Fahrenkrog, general manager of Anheuser-Busch's Cartersville, Georgia, brewery, waking up in the middle of the night to lead emergency operations during a natural disaster. We see the brewery switch gears; beer cans are filled with water for people in need, while singer-songwriter Skylar Grey's crooning cover of Ben E. King's ""Stand By Me"" plays in the background. As Budweiser tractor-trailers set out to deliver the cans, the words ""TEXAS,"" ""FLORIDA,"" ""PUERTO RICO,"" and ""CALIFORNIA"" flash across the screen. ""Stand By You"" hits close to home, after Americans witnessed one catastrophic natural disaster after another in 2017, including Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Maria, and the Northern California wildfires. SEE ALSO: Anheuser-Busch brewery halts beer to bottle water for flood victims But the ad also highlights something that many people — and perhaps the average Super Bowl viewer — may not know. In partnership with the American Red Cross, Anheuser-Busch has used its Cartersville brewery to deliver clean drinking water to disaster victims and communities in need for nearly 30 years. In that time, the emergency water program has provided more than 79 million cans of water across the country. Last year alone, Anheuser-Busch and the Red Cross delivered 2 million cans of water to people in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and California. There’s no bigger stage than #SBLII to recognize our real life heroes. Our Cartersville, GA employees and wholesaler partners have helped provide 79 million+ cans of emergency drinking water since 1988. Cheers to them, and to expanding this program in 2018. https://t.co/HjCZA6HNLU https://t.co/uvljAOBade — Anheuser-Busch (@AnheuserBusch) January 26, 2018 The commercial primarily celebrates Anheuser-Busch's efforts, sure. But it also hopefully reminds the millions of people watching the Super Bowl (and other powerful corporations) of the importance of disaster relief at all levels. It should also serve as a reminder that communities are still in need of assistance. One-third of Puerto Rico residents, for example, are still living without electricity and, in some areas, without running water. ""We believe we can make an even greater impact."" A huge conglomerate like Anheuser-Busch halting beer production at one of its locations to help those in need is admirable, but it's also strategically difficult for one brewery in Georgia to serve everyone across the country. That's why Anheuser-Busch just announced it would be converting another brewery into an emergency water response location in 2018. The brewery in Fort Collins, Colorado, will be able to fill cans with water, helping Anheuser-Busch and the Red Cross to reach more people on the West Coast in shorter amounts of time. ""Anheuser-Busch has a long history of giving back, and not only are we continuing to support in the short-term, but we also want to use our upcoming 30th anniversary of the emergency water program to announce our long-term commitment for natural disaster relief,"" said Bill Bradley, vice president of community affairs at Anheuser-Busch, in a statement. ""By adding our Fort Collins, Colorado, brewery to the program, we believe we can make an even greater impact,"" he said. ""Taps,"" the 30-second Stella Artois ad featuring Matt Damon, shifts the focus to developing countries. In partnership with Water.org, the water and sanitation organization Damon cofounded in 2009, the campaign encourages beer lovers to ""Make Your Super Bowl Party Matter"" and help end the global water crisis affecting more than 663 million around the world. ""Such a simple thing,"" Damon says in the spot. ""Clean water at the turn of a tap. It's like magic. It takes no time at all. And yet millions of people in the developing world walk up to six hours every day for water."" ""Millions of people in the developing world walk up to six hours every day for water."" It's a worthy cause, and could change some American viewers' perceptions about global haves and have-nots. But the ad is more transparent in selling a product than Budweiser, driving viewers to buy a $13 chalice, with $3.13 of each purchase going toward Water.org's efforts in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. That's less than 25 percent of each chalice going to clean water initiatives — but Damon does make a decent point: ""If just 1 percent of you watching this buys one, we could give clean water to 1 million people for five years,"" he says in the ad. Proceeds from other Stella Artois purchases will benefit clean water efforts, too — the campaign claims the purchase of a 12-pack will provide clean water to someone for 12 months. (A portion of proceeds from the Budweiser ad's ""Stand By Me"" single will also be directly donated to the American Red Cross.) These aren't the first socially conscious Super Bowl ads by a long shot. Notable recent examples include the powerful 2016 ad from anti-domestic violence organization NO MORE, and Colgate's recurring campaign to get Americans to use less water when they brush their teeth. In 2017, several ads seemed to comment on issues like immigration and the Trump administration, though many marketing teams (of course) claimed any political statements were unintentional. Whether a Super Bowl ad is a well-done, altruistic campaign or a transparent, capitalist gimmick (or some unintended statement in between), the big game continues to offer the perfect time to send a message directly into millions of Americans' homes. There are already predictions that most of Super Bowl LII's ads will focus more on humor than politics or social issues this year, but the potential for social impact remains huge.","Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewing company, is devoting two Super Bowl ads this year not to beer, but water.

Mark Osborne and DANIEL MANZO,"Florence weakened to a tropical depression early Sunday, but that was little consolation to residents in North Carolina who have seen over 2 feet rain and are now fearing major river flooding to start the week. Interested in Hurricane Florence? Add Hurricane Florence as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricane Florence news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Sustained winds were down to 35 mph with the storm starting to speed up a little and move to the west at 8 mph. The center was located approximately 20 miles southwest of Columbia, South Carolina, as of 5 a.m. The storm came ashore as Hurricane Florence on Friday morning at about 7 a.m. with wind speeds of 90 mph. A member of the US Coast Guard walks down Mill Creek Road checking houses after tropical storm Florence hit Newport N.C., Saturday, Sept. 15, 2018. Florence has been blamed for 13 deaths in the Carolinas. Hundreds of water rescues have been carried out by local authorities, the Cajun Navy volunteers and the U.S. Coast Guard since Friday morning. Over 770,000 customers were still without power as of Saturday night. Despite the decrease in wind speeds, heavy rains still a pose a major flooding threat to both North and South Carolina. ""[Florence] will produce catastrophic flooding over parts of North and South Carolina for some time,"" Steve Goldstein, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's liaison to FEMA, said Saturday. Florence has dropped a tremendous amount of rain in eastern North Carolina, with a widespread 20 to 30 inches reported already. Radar is estimating that some areas between Wilmington and New Bern, North Carolina, have received over 30 inches of rain.

Harvey dropped 60.58 inches of rain last year in Texas, setting the state’s new record. Lane just last month dropped a maximum of 52.02 inches of rain in Hawaii, breaking the state record. The 30.59 inches that have fallen in Swansboro sets a new record for North Carolina. Florence also currently stands as the sixth-highest tropical cyclone rainfall total across the U.S. for records dating back to 1950. Heavy rain spreads inland Heavy rains bands are still coming onshore in eastern South Carolina and North Carolina on Sunday morning. Some of the heavier bands have shifted toward Fayetteville, Charlotte and Raleigh. SLIDESHOW: PHOTOS: Hurricane Florence batters the East Coast Torrential rain is causing inland flooding with major roadways, including large portions of I-95, closed. An additional 6 to 10 inches of rain is still possible along the southeast border of North Carolina and South Carolina. Life-threatening, catastrophic flash flooding is likely over the southern to central Appalachians from western North Carolina into western Virginia and eastern West Virginia. Torrential rain will cause flash flooding and increase the risk for landslides in the higher terrains. River flooding an issue next Torrential rain from Florence is currently causing rapid rises in area rivers. Major river flooding is expected on some rivers from southern Virginia to northern South Carolina, including most of North Carolina. The Lumber River, near Lumberton, North Carolina, will rise into major flood stage Sunday morning. It is expected to reach a level very near the record Hurricane Matthew set in 2016.

"feedback@businessinsider.com (Christa Case Bryant), Christa Case Bryant","High school students are running for governor in Kansas. Jim Young/Reuters Jack Bergeson, the garrulous 17-year-old Democrat running for Kansas governor, hadn't even bothered to put his phone number on his campaign website until recently — because everyone already seemed to have it. ""National networks all have my stuff,"" says the young Mr. Bergeson, nibbling on a few fries at his parents' Wichita burger joint. ""They can get ahold of me if they want."" It's a Saturday, and he has been up since 4:30 a.m., when he headed to Kansas City for a CNN interview — only to be displaced at the last minute by the latest Trump drama. ""They're going to reschedule me, hopefully. I don't know when. But they said they would."" At least five other teenagers, and, briefly, a dog named Angus, have followed Bergeson's lead since he discovered one Sunday afternoon two years ago that Kansas has no minimum age requirement — actually, no requirements at all — for gubernatorial candidates. A predictable flood of media attention has followed, something Bergeson, like many other teens who've entered the political spotlight of late, is handling with remarkable cogency and the self-assurance of youth — if at times an understandable touch of naiveté. A former Mitt Romney supporter, Bergeson says he became disillusioned with Republican politics under former Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, whose drastic tax-cutting experiment sparked a revolt even within the state GOP. So, Bergeson now champions Bernie Sanders (one of his slogans is ""Feel the Berg!""), and has designed a campaign platform that includes universal health care, raising the minimum wage to $12, and legalizing marijuana, which he says could help restore state budgets. His comrade and foil in this quest for the statehouse is Republican candidate Tyler Ruzich, a high schooler from the Kansas City area who works part-time at the local Hy-Vee grocery store. Mr. Ruzich, like many young people, is not afraid to challenge traditional GOP stances; he supports LGBTQ rights, advocates reining in the National Rifle Association, and criticizes his party for using the ""euphemism"" of voter ID to engage in voter suppression. While Bergeson and Ruzich are technically opponents, they have a good deal in common: both believe in bipartisanship, reject what they see as tired political posturing, and share a desire to engage their generation in changing America's unhealthy political environment. ""Somebody has to step up,"" says Ruzich, perched on a Starbucks bar stool and swinging his legs. ""I don't think the adults are working together that well."" How it all began As Bergeson tells it, his involvement in politics started years ago, when as a freshman he got hooked on an ""insanely nerdy"" mock government on the old Instagram app called ""Two Parties, One Nation."" Every Saturday was Election Day. ""I ran for president every time and never got any votes,"" he admits, noting that the participants tended to lean Republican (not unlike Kansans). He did however, run the Chicago Transit Authority and got elected to Congress. It was through that online community that Bergeson first met Ruzich, a colleague in the mock US House of Representatives. After Bergeson launched his gubernatorial campaign — and after he got on the Jimmy Kimmel show and began to make something of a name for himself — he realized he could have an even bigger impact if he had a fellow teen running from across the aisle to help boost youth engagement. So, he persuaded Ruzich to launch his own campaign and ""double the impact."" ""If I'm [taking] a Democratic message to a young audience and he's out there talking to a young Republican audience, we're going to get more people involved,"" Bergeson says, noting that three more teenage conservatives have since thrown their hats in the ring — Ethan Randleas, Dominic Scavuzzo, and Joseph Tutera. (Aaron Coleman, a Green Party candidate, had also announced his candidacy at one point, though his current status is unclear.) ""We need to engage voters of the next generation."" Not welcome on the debate stage Ruzich has not exactly been embraced by the state Republican Party, which — in consultation with the leading gubernatorial candidates — has set debate rules requiring all participants to have voted in the 2014 election. At that point, some of the teens weren't even teens, let alone voters. Ruzich says he dislikes pointing fingers, but after some caveats and niceties, confesses he disagrees with how Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who is in charge of state elections and is also a front-runner in the Republican gubernatorial primary, has used his power to render teenage candidates effectively ineligible in this election. ""I see that as a great threat to … the impact the young people can have on this democracy,"" says Ruzich. For their part, state GOP officials argue that it's hard to know if someone who has never voted before is actually a Republican. And while they don't want to squelch political enthusiasm among young conservatives, they also don't want to risk complicating a race that should be relatively easy for a Republican to win — especially with a field that includes Kobach, a Trump ally, as well as the incumbent governor, Jeff Colyer, a surgeon with degrees from Georgetown, Cambridge University, and the University of Kansas. ""We have confidence that our voters will select the right candidate,"" says chairman Kelly Arnold, who served for more than a decade with the Young Republican National Federation and has advised some of the teen candidates on the process of running. ""But you also want to do everything you can to produce a primary candidate that can win the overall election."" That means limiting the number of people on a debate stage, Mr. Arnold says — not unlike the decision in the 2016 presidential primary season to hold one prime-time debate for top contenders and another for lower-tier candidates. Except in this case, the also-rans have been limited to venues like high school gymnasiums. The state Democratic Party, on the other hand, has welcomed Bergeson's participation — including in a gubernatorial forum at their recent convention. ""I think people appreciated having Jack on stage and hearing from him,"" says Ethan Corson, executive director of the Democratic Party in Kansas. ""Otherwise, you're sort of guessing at what those younger people are interested in."" What their peers are saying Even some young Kansans have mixed feelings about their peers' campaigns. ""I admire the kids that are protesting against gun violence — I think that's a more useful use of our time than running for governor, where you can't actually do anything,"" says Ben Engle, a high school debater from Kapaun Mt. Carmel Catholic High School in Wichita. Others wonder whether some of the teenage candidates may be motivated more by a desire to burnish their resumes for college than to actually lead the state of Kansas — and say the quixotic campaigns have been limited to well-off, white kids who can afford the $2,100 necessary to get on the ballot. (Bergeson says he raised the sum from about 60 donors who contributed an average of $40 each, and Ruzich — who says he was born into a "" very, very poor family "" that pulled ahead through financial responsibility — has even had out-of-state donors contribute.) But some point out that social change has often been led by young people. The Marquis de Lafayette, a Frenchman who played a key role in the American Revolution, was just 19 when Congress commissioned him as a major general, and Alexander Hamilton was 21 when he signed the Declaration of Independence. ""We have spent so much time and energy telling kids, 'Do whatever you want to be, be the change you want to see,' "" says James Harris, a debate coach at Andover High School outside Wichita. ""But all of a sudden when they step up to the plate we tell them, 'Oh, it's not your time.'

"feedback@businessinsider.com (Wolf Richter), Wolf Richter","Long Island Iced Tea Some companies recently changed their names and business models in a shift to blockchain technology, and their stocks have shot up. That these companies get away with this is a sign of just how far the global flood of liquidity has confused speculators and turned them into knee-jerk betting automatons. This can happen only during the very late stage of a bubble. It just doesn’t let up. UBI Blockchain Internet, a Hong Kong outfit whose shares trade in the US [UBIA], filed with the SEC to sell an additional 72.3 million shares owned by its executives. In other words, it isn’t selling the shares to raise money for corporate purposes, but to allow its executives, including CEO Tony Liu, to bail out. This is happening after the company – which sports zero revenues and a disconnected phone number in its SEC filings – managed to get its shares to spike briefly by over 1,100%, pushing its market capitalization to $8 billion. UBI Blockchain didn’t do an IPO. Instead, in October 2016, it acquired a publicly traded shell company registered in Las Vegas, called “JA Energy.” It then changed the name and ticker symbol to what they’re now. Over the six trading days starting on December 11, 2017, its shares soared over 1,100%, from $7.20 to $87 on December 18, as the word “blockchain” in its name and sufficient hype and speculator-idiocy took hold. By December 21, shares had plunged 67% to $29. They closed on Wednesday at $38.50. At this price, it still has a ludicrous market cap of $3.64 billion. In its prospectus for the share sale, filed with the SEC on December 26, UBI explains the overcooked spaghetti of its dreamed-up activities: UBI Blockchain Internet Ltd. business encompasses the research and application of blockchain technology with a focus on the Internet of things covering areas of food, drugs and healthcare. Management plans to focus its business in the integrated wellness industry, by providing procedures for safety and effectiveness in food and drugs, but also preventing counterfeit or fake food and drugs. With the advancement of the blockchain technology, the Company plans to trace a food or drug product from its original source within the context of the Internet of Things to the final consumer. It explains that “management is uncertain that the Company can generate sufficient revenues in the next 12-months to sustain our operations. We shall need to seek additional funding to continue our operations and implement our plan of operations.” It added that “due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our financial obligations and to pay our liabilities as they become due,” the auditors in the financial statement for the year ended August 31, 2017, questioned “our ability to continue as a going concern.” For the year, UBI had an operating loss of $1.83 million on zero revenues. It had $15,406 in cash, and: “In order to keep the company operational and fully reporting, management anticipates a burn rate of approximately $220,000 per month, pre and post-offering.” Without any additional funding, the Company will be unable to operate. Therefore, if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues, we must raise additional capital in order to continue operations in order to implement our plan of operations. Alas, all of the shares will be sold by existing shareholders. The company “will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock by the selling stockholders.” So even after the sale of the shares, it will have no cash to operate on. The selling shareholders are the CEO Tony Liu and five other “individuals.” Speculators who buy these shares will hand their money to those individuals – not the company. And the company still has nothing, no revenues, no business model, no cash…. This wasn’t the only outfit to leverage the word “blockchain” to create hype and extract billions from gullible speculators. There’s Longfin [LFIN]. The company went public in the US on December 13, 2017. In its SEC filing, it said it had revenues of $298,786 in the year 2017 and was sitting on $75 in cash. What sent the stock soaring 2,700%, from $5 to $142.82 in a few days, and gave it briefly a market capitalization of over $7 billion, was the December 15 announcement – an elegant and apparently very effective mix of gobbledygook, hype, and silliness that started out like this: Longfin Corp., a leading global FinTech company, announces the acquisition of Ziddu.com, a Blockchain-empowered solutions provider that offers Microfinance Lending against Collateralized Warehouse Receipts in the form of Ziddu Coins. What actually happened, according to Longfin’s SEC filing : Longfin bought an asset called “Ziddu.com” from Meridian Enterprises, a Singapore corporation, 95% of which is owned by Longfin’s CEO and chairman. On Wednesday, Longfin shares closed at $59.95, down 58% from its peak a few days ago. This total insanity over outfits claiming to have a blockchain-related activity has been an ongoing movement over the past few weeks and months. Shares of Digital Power Corp. [DPW], a dotcom-bust survivor, if barely, soared 880% from $0.56 on November 21 to $5.50 on December 18, though it shares have since plunged to $4.05. The company makes lowly power supplies for computers, but after it announced that it would aim its power supplies at cryptocurrency miners, its shares took off. There is a gaggle of others with similar trajectories: Beverage-maker Long Island Iced Tea [LTEA] soared 280% within seconds after it announced that it would change its name to Long Blockchain; also Riot Blockchain, Seven Stars Cloud Group, Siebert Financial Corp, among others. They all have minuscule or no revenues, though their combined market capitalization is many billions. That these companies get away with this, that in fact speculators fall for this crap, that they’re stupid enough to bet what are in aggregate many billions of dollars in a matter of seconds after “blockchain” flashes across their screens, is a sign of just how far the global flood of liquidity has befuddled the minds of these speculators and turned them into knee-jerk betting automatons. This phenomenon happens only during the very late stages of a bubble. But going back over the last three bubbles and crashes, to 1987, I have never seen anything this crazy.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Murweh Shire Council Image caption Local authorities will make plans for an alternative celebration Plans to celebrate the 150th anniversary of an Australian town have hit a hurdle, after local authorities found they were three years too late. The town of Charleville, in Queensland, had begun planning festivities for next year to mark what locals believed was its official recognition in 1868. However, a check of state records showed the historic moment had actually taken place in 1865. Mayor Annie Liston said it was a disappointment. ""We put so much budget towards it, then we found out it was gone. It was the biggest shock to all of us, I can tell you,"" she told the BBC. ""We were all prepared to have this big shindig next year and [the date] is not even correct."" She said local historians had provided conflicting dates in the past and some records were lost in a flood. Charleville resident Laurie Parker told Australia's ABC : ""There's other things we've been concentrating on here and we've been wanting to get rain [to prevent drought] and pick up the economy and things like that, but certainly those sort of birthdays are important to celebrate."" The town of about 3,300 people will make alternative plans.

"USA TODAY, Jim Sergent, USA TODAY","Since Hurricane Florence made a direct hit on the Carolinas nearly a week ago, the storm brought several waves of devastation. First, as the storm roared ashore, it unleashed a huge surge of ocean water that swamped some coastal areas such as New Bern, North Carolina. At the same time, Florence's drenching rain – as much as 3 feet in some areas – left many areas near the coast underwater. For instance, the 2 feet of rain that fell in Wilmington, North Carolina, raised the city's 2018 rainfall total to a record 7 feet. Finally, the rain that fell well inland continues to work its way through the region's streams and rivers as it makes its way to the sea. This slow-motion, river-flooding disaster will continue well into next week. For example, the Cape Fear River in North Carolina crested at 61.6 feet on Wednesday – more than 25 feet above flood stage and 7 feet below the all-time record. Here's a look at how the Florence's waters altered North Carolina's landscape during the past week.

Associated Press,"(COLUMBUS, Miss.) — The full extent of the damage was coming into view Sunday after a tornado smashed into a commercial district in a small Mississippi city, killing at least one person and shattering businesses as severe storms raked the South on a weekend of drenching rains and a rising flood threat.
The tornado Saturday afternoon in Columbus was confirmed on radar, said meteorologist Anna Wolverton with the National Weather Service in Jackson. She told The Associated Press that experts would be headed Sunday to the east Mississippi city of about 23,000 people to gauge the tornado’s intensity.
A woman died after a building collapsed on her and three other people, the Columbus mayor’s office said Sunday in a statement on Facebook, citing information from Lowndes County Coroner Greg Merchant. The statement said 41-year-old Ashley Glynell Pounds of Tupelo was with three other people in a building that collapsed in the storm Saturday evening. The statement gave no information on the condition of the other three people.
Lee Lawrence, who said he has been selling used cars for decades in Columbus, told The AP that four buildings on his car lot had been destroyed. He said trees toppled across vehicles and car windows had been blown out. And he said he had no idea about how badly his collection of antique cars fared. A 1923 Studebaker and a 1930 Chevrolet were among the cars parked amid wind-tossed building debris.
Lawrence said he was at home getting ready to take a bath when the storm struck.
“The wind all of a sudden just got so strong and it was raining so much you could hardly see out the door, and I could hear a roaring. Evidently it came close,” he said, speaking with AP in a phone interview. He said someone called him soon after about the damage to his business and he rushed over.
“It will be a start-over deal,” Lawrence said. “I can’t say it will come back better or stronger, but we’ll come back.”
A photographer working for The AP in Columbus said some antique cars on Lawrence’s lot were parked among the damage and a nearby pet grooming business appeared now to be mostly twisted piles of metal. A printing shop had been speared by a pipe with great force and what seemed to be a vacant commercial building nearby appeared heavily damaged.
Firefighters and law enforcement officers had cordoned off the area, making it difficult to determine the extent of damage after nightfall. Power was out in the area.
Elsewhere around the South, homes, highways, parks and bridges were flooded or put out of commission amid the heavy rains and severe storms. News outlets report that water rescues have been performed in some Middle Tennessee counties. Flash flood warnings and watches remained in place throughout the South and one Mississippi community reported large hail.
Interstate 40 near the Tennessee line with North Carolina was closed by a rockslide, one of the dozens of roads and highways shut down throughout the region, transportation officials said.
Tennessee Department of Transportation spokesman Mark Nagi said on Twitter that a “full scale detour” was in place, with traffic being diverted to Interstate 81 and Interstate 26.
High water threatened property in Tennessee, which, like many other areas of the South, has been soaked by several inches of rain over the past week. Officials said a mudslide destroyed a Subway restaurant in Signal Mountain, Tennessee. No injuries were reported.
In Bruce, Mississippi, rivers broke flood stage and flash floods poured into homes and businesses. News outlets report that officials in Grenada, Mississippi, declared a local state of emergency after dozens of streets and homes flooded. A 6-mile (9-kilometer) stretch of the Natchez Trace Parkway was closed in Mississippi after water covered part of the road.
The National Weather Service had issued a flash flood warning for northwestern Lafayette County in Mississippi after emergency officials reported that a local dam was at risk of failing. Meteorologist Kole Fehling says emergency officials reported the threat involved the Audubon Dam, which blocks a creek on the north side of Oxford and a subdivision.
Weather officials said the storm’s impact stretched from eastern Arkansas to northern Georgia and beyond. Alabama’s governor declared a state of emergency in several counties, hoping to speed recovery in event of damages.
Kentucky announced Friday that it was closing the U.S. 51 bridge over the Ohio River to Cairo, Illinois, because of flooding on the southern approach. The bridge, which carries 4,700 vehicles a day, is likely to stay closed until Thursday, and possibly longer.
Near Jamestown, Kentucky, the Army Corps of Engineers said it was increasing releases from the Wolf Creek Dam on the Cumberland River. Areas downstream of the dam, from Rowena to Burkesville, could be affected by flooding as a result, officials said.
The Ohio River at Cairo is predicted to crest Sunday at its third-highest level ever recorded, and stay that high into next week. The Tennessee River near Savannah, Tennessee, also is forecast to crest at near-record levels.

Cory Doctorow,"When Massachusetts GOP Senator Scott Brown was elected in a 2010 special election, Senate Democrats agreed to delay a key vote on health care reform until he could be seated, so that the vote would be held by elected officials, not the appointed lame duck who was sitting in the seat that Brown was about to occupy. Now, Democrats and activists are calling on the GOP to preserve this democratic fundamental and delay an upcoming vote on the GOP tax plan until newly elected Alabama Senator Doug Jones can replace the appointed lame duck Luther Strange in the Senate. The GOP will almost certainly tell Democrats to go fuck themselves, despite their insistence on observing the imaginary rule that allowed them to steal Merrick Garland's Supreme Court seat and hand it to one of the minor characters from The Handmaid's Tale. So protestors have flooded the Senate, chanting ""No Jones, no vote!"" The party that has had full control of Congress and the White House for nearly a year — and yet has still failed to pass a single significant piece of legislation — is going to have an ever harder time now, thanks to the stunning election of Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama this week. So, in a state of complete panic, House and Senate Republicans rushed on Wednesday to cobble together a secret deal so they can vote next week on their deeply unpopular tax hike on the middle class. Democrats have called on them to delay their vote until Jones is seated. It certainly seems like the right thing to do, and it’s what Democrats did in 2010 after Scott Brown won the special election in Massachusetts, delaying a vote on health care until Brown was sworn in. But of course Republicans have demonstrated zero interest in doing the right thing and are rushing full speed ahead they can. “No Jones?

David L. Craddock,"The 2014 indie hit Shovel Knight paid homage to the Nintendo Entertainment Systems pixel art and game design, but its developers also wanted to polish up the harsh edges of 1980s platform games. In this excerpt from Boss Fight Books new book Shovel Knight, out today, author David L. Craddock speaks to the four co-founders of Yacht Club games about the process. With Shovel Knight, Yacht Club intended to evoke the spirit of NES games by refining or expanding on retro tropes rather than copying them wholesale. Shovel Knight s map screen exemplifies that approach. The map is displayed from an overhead view, a tribute to Super Mario Bros. 3 's board game-style of navigation. Unlike Mario 3, Shovel Knight s map spans several screens. Heavy fog shrouds the right side of the map. Players start on the far left move their character along a grid that connects tiles representing levels, each inhabited by a knight in the Order of No Quarter. Only two stages are open to players early on. Conquering them causes the fog to recede, revealing more paths and levels. Parceling out levels enabled Yacht Club to sand down a rough edge in Capcoms nonlinear progression. Every Mega Man game begins at a stage select screen. Players can choose where to go first, second, and so on. While that approach empowered players to tackle levels in any order, the downside was that they might wind up attempting the hardest stage before becoming grounded in the games mechanics. We didnt want to overwhelm players and risk them making bad choices, said Ian Flood. So we present two levels, then three levels. You can choose based on preference, but its not so bad that you end up at the easiest stage last. Yacht Club circumvented peaks and valleys by gradually ratcheting up challenge in each set of Shovel Knight s levels. Over each successive stage, players develop their skill with the Shovel Blade. By the time they move on to the next set, no challenge feels too formidable or elementary. By the time youve finished the tower, if you go back to the [intro level], it should be cool because youre so much better than you used to be, Sean Velasco said. When a new Mega Man game comes out, Im already a pro at it before I even pick it up. The only thing I need to do is learn the new weapons and new boss patterns, but my Mega Man skill is something thats been cultivated in the same way your Shovel Knight skill has been cultivated. Being able to achieve mastery in a game like that is very rewarding. The cool thing about Mega Man is that its a really difficult game, David DAngelo added. Since you can go to any level in the game, youre way more likely to experience more of the content and invest in the game just because you can see it all. Choosing your own path, we liked. The world map came up as a split between doing that, and trying to teach the player difficult skills over the course of the game. Each of Shovel Knights swings, stabs, and jumps is a lesson in offense. The games levels are classrooms. Yacht Clubs designers fleshed out their lesson plans, appropriately enough, on two giant whiteboards. One was reserved for business concerns like schedules and marketing ideas. The second was a window into their collective imagination. That window opened widest during brainstorming sessions. Usually one person is leading, like Sean writing down ideas, or were all playing the game and someones writing stuff down on the whiteboard, said Nick Woz Wozniak. A lot of times that idea isnt necessarily a thing that well do, but its a spark that leads to another idea. Open communication is important to us. When the time came to spitball level themes, everyone swiveled their chairs toward the whiteboard and lobbed suggestions at Velasco, whose marker squeaked as he sketched and scribbled. Fire and ice were staples of Mega Man games, so they needed levels grounded in those elements. Shovel Knight was a game about knights and sorceresses, so a castle seemed obvious. Someone proposed a clock tower as an homage to Castlevania III. Velasco decorated nearly every inch of the whiteboard with colored marker. Any and every idea for a level that seemed like it would fit Shovel Knight s world was given equal consideration. Environments were their first concern. Bosses came later, after a stage was far enough along that the team felt comfortable extrapolating a character from an areas theme. Pridemore Keep, the domain of King Knight, was the first stage the team designed. By virtue of being made first, Pridemore became the proof of concept they took to their first PAX appearance during Shovel Knight s Kickstarter campaign. I think that was the one where we were testing out what we should and shouldnt do, what looked appropriate and what didnt, how big a character could be, how many colors could be in the background, Velasco said. King Knight was pretty basic, said Woz. We wanted a castle thats gilded: Every room has gold, the environment feels really shiny and garish. Thats how that started. We had other colors for the sky, but pink was what we gravitated toward. We have blue and purple skies saved somewhere, but they didnt look as fun. Players disappear behind the keeps elaborate red-and-gold banners when they walk past, an interaction that permitted Yacht Club to treat banner-covered areas as puzzles. On one screen with a series of platforms and pillars, banners droop from one platform to the next. Some banners hide objects such as dirt blocks that Shovel Knight can dig through, and holes that players must hop over to reach clusters of gems. Though they appear simple, those banners would not have worked on an NES. The whole thing is far outside of NES restrictions, Velasco said of Shovel Knight as a whole. Nintendos 8-bit hardware permitted a single background layer. Pridemore Keep consists of multiple background layers: the sky, made up of purple-tinged or peach-colored clouds, is one layer; the green walls and columns of the Keep against which Shovel Knight runs and jumps is another. Subsequent levels were even more elaborate. By the end of development, Yacht Club had to double back to King Knights stage and add extra frills so the level did not appear too rudimentary compared to others. Staying true to how NES games looked was one challenge. To David DAngelo, differentiating the stages was an even taller hurdle to jump. When youre building a game based on Shovel Knight, which is based on one mechanica down-thrustbeing able to build something that makes you say, Im doing something different here, is difficult to do, he explained. Like, does getting blown around by wind in Propeller Knights stage actually feel more fun? I dont know. But if you line it up with these objects, then, yeah, its more exciting than what youve done previously. Every Mega Man game had 25 screens per level, so Yacht Club followed that formula, tweaking it where needed. There are 26 screens for every level, give or take a screen or two, Velasco explained. In addition to that, there are six secret screens. So you knock out a wall, go to the left. We tried hard to stick to that number of screens because Mega Man s stage lengths feel perfect. Yacht Club constructed levels screen by screen, room by room. We would lay out the stages and come up with the ups and downs, the ebb and flow, said DAngelo. Wed say, Whats going to be on this screen? Its going to be combat. What about this screen? This will be platforming. This screen? Itll be a mix of both. We wont be super scientific about [striking a balance]. Building rooms is where level design becomes more art than science. Working in a room-by-room system is just a higher-level tile set, Flood said. Just like youre thinking about how ice tiles connect to make an ice bridge, now youre thinking about how these rooms connect to make a level. Propeller Knights Flying Machine is in many ways the inverse of Pridemore Keep. The second stage Yacht Club created, Flying Machine is an airborne galleon that belongs to the world maps third set of levels. Propeller Knights was originally going to be one of the easiest stages, DAngelo said. After putting the initial level design in there, we realized, oh, this is really hard. Aboard the Flying Machine, players battle the elements as well as enemies. Gusts of wind blow in from every direction, interfering with the players control over Shovel Knight as they make jumps. Industrial fans generate currents that players can ride to unreachable terrain. Other fans point toward pits, forcing players to either run against their currents or use them to amplify the arc and distance of their jump. Flying Machines trickiest yet most rewarding areas are wide chasms that cannot be crossed by jumping or riding current. Mounted artillery fire lines of cannonballs over the pits in timed intervals. Cannonballs are equidistant from one another, just close enough together for players to pogo from one to the next. In terms of setting up stages so it [all] works, its a lot of math, honestly, DAngelo explained. Whats the speed of Shovel Knight ? Its around three miles per hour. If were going to have you bouncing off cannonballs so that you can do it perfectly, but it still feels stressful, maybe in this scenario [his movement] should be 3.5 miles an hour [as you bounce on cannonballs]. Its just pushing the limit of what youre able to do. Yacht Club took steps to make sure players were ready for the Flying Machines platforming challenges. By the time players reach it, theyve become proficient at pulling off shovel drops and other maneuvers, and the two-button control scheme makes those maneuvers easy to perform. Perhaps most importantly, Shovel Knight never asks players to overcome an obstacle they have never seen before. You present new gameplay ideas in a safe situation where players have room to experiment, said Velasco. Then they understand what the gameplay object is, what the enemy is, what the situation is. You continue to ramp it up: You teach A, then you teach B, then you put A and B together. Its a deeply satisfying formula. We didnt invent it; we just tried to follow it as closely as we could to try and make [gameplay concepts] simple enough for people to understand. Stage components such as cannonballs, industrial fans, pits, and enemy placement coalesce into obstacle courses. Assembling those obstacle courses remains DAngelos favorite aspect of designing Shovel Knight. The gameplay per square inch of the game, he said, referring to the process of building levels inch by inch, pixel by pixel. Ive made a lot of games, and Ive played a lot of games where the space between enemies, objects, and new things to see, the amount of gameplay per inch of the real estate on the screen, is so tiny and so pathetic. Thats something we noticed in NES games. But for DAngelo, one NES game in particular packs in plenty of gameplay. In Super Mario Bros. 3, every stage has new mechanics in it, theyre crazy different, youre doing something youve never done before every second, and its so exciting and fun and surprising. Once taught, players can apply what theyve learned to move through arrays of obstacles. Flowing perfectly through enemies, over pits, and across objects is a point of pride for old-school players, one which Yacht Clubs team hoped new players would enjoy. I think thats what we loved about NES platformers, DAngelo added. That joy of leaping from ledge to ledge, bouncing from enemy to enemy, is really enjoyable. Capturing that feel was important to us.","The 2014 indie hit Shovel Knight paid homage to the Nintendo Entertainment System’s pixel art and game design, but its developers also wanted to polish up the harsh edges of 1980s platform games.

https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=742186908,"LUMBERTON, N.C. — The storm known as Florence is creating a slow-motion natural disaster for the Carolinas that could prove deceptively lethal as swollen rivers and streams spill over their banks and continue to rise. The hurricane, now downgraded to a tropical storm, was blamed by authorities for at least five deaths as of late Friday. Though Florence did not arrive with winds as violent as once feared, forecasters got the storm surge and rainfall correct. They have made clear that this event is all about the water — which the storm has delivered in devastating quantity. The storm made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., in the gloom of dawn Friday as a Category 1 hurricane. As the storm sat along the edge of the Atlantic, some stretches along the coastal Carolinas received close to 20 inches of rain. Florence is projected to migrate at barely more than a walking pace across northern South Carolina, passing close to the city of Florence — truly — on Saturday. The great danger now, experts say, is river flooding and then, once the remnants of the tempest reach the higher terrain of the southern Appalachians, flash floods, mudslides and debris flows. Relief will not come quickly. The National Weather Service said the floods are likely to last for weeks. This is a perilous moment for the hundreds of thousands of people who took to the roads to escape the storm’s fury. The rivers are in most cases several days from cresting. The parts of the country still in the storm’s path have been saturated by summer rains and cannot soak up any surplus from Florence. More than a dozen major rivers in the Carolinas and Southern Virginia are forecast by the National Weather Service to reach flood stage, and some — including the Neuse, Pamlico, Lumber, Waccamaw, Northeast Cape Fear and Pee Dee rivers — are expected to set flood records. There is really nowhere for the water to go. “We’re in God’s hands,” said Rick Foreman, pastor at West Lumberton Baptist Church, as the Lumber River steadily rose Friday and local residents filled sandbags. “We all know that.” The Weather Service forecast the Lumber to reach major flood stage Saturday and to keep rising through Sunday. State Sen. Danny Britt (R) put out a call on Facebook for volunteers to fill the sandbags and, with the help of 40 members of the National Guard, dam a railway channel that has been problematic during floods. “Pretty soon I had a hundred of my closest friends out here helping us out,” Britt said. “Sixty mile-per-hour winds, shingles flying off their own homes, and they’re here working for everyone else.” The river swamped the town after Hurricane Matthew came through two years ago: One church parishioner drowned during that storm, more than 700 families were displaced from their homes, and two of the city’s largest public housing projects were destroyed, Foreman said. And so as a pelting rain fell Friday, residents worked in soaked T-shirts and shorts to try to stave off another disaster. Usually hurricanes this far north deliver their punch and quickly leave town. Florence has been a strange tropical cyclone since it materialized in the distant Atlantic and took an unusual path toward the mainland United States. On Friday afternoon it was traveling at just 3 to 5 mph, still near the coast. “There’s nothing to steer it. It’s all about the steering currents. We don’t have any right now,” said Ken Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. “It’s like a bubble with no wind, it just floats. You don’t want slow, but that’s what we have.” South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R) urged patience, emphasizing that his state has never seen “a hurricane staying on top of us for this long.” The coast has been battered, and the mountains appear to be next. The remnants of Florence are expected to hit the peaks of western North Carolina in a couple of days. National Hurricane Center meteorologist Joel Cline said the mountains will wring water out of the moist tropical air: “It’s like running into a wall, and that moisture has to go somewhere, and it goes up, creates rain, and you have torrential rain in that area.” Cline said July was the wettest ever in that part of North Carolina, and the water table rose 21 inches higher than normal. Florence could add an additional six to 10 inches of rainfall this weekend. Flash floods can materialize within minutes of intense rain as the water rushes down hillsides. “You evacuate from water,” Cline said. “That’s why we’ve been preaching to people that you have to get away from the water.” Appalachian State University in Boone canceled its first home football game scheduled for Saturday. “It’s not often that we have to prepare for a hurricane in the mountains, but we are doing so on our campus,” Jason Marshburn, the director of safety and emergency management at the university, wrote in a letter to students and faculty members. Florence’s remnants are expected to keep traveling north and then northeast, and they could drop several inches of rain in eastern Tennessee and eastern Kentucky, southwest Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Flash flooding is a threat in those states as well. The Carolinas know all about hurricane-related flooding, having experienced Matthew two years ago and Floyd in 1999. Floyd, like Florence, hit Wilmington directly and dumped record amounts of rain. Rivers swelled not only with water but also with the carcasses of livestock. A number of motorists died trying to drive through moving water. Hence the refrain Friday from emergency management officials: Turn around, don’t drown. With the center of the storm still at sea early Friday, scores of residents had to be rescued from homes and the tops of cars in New Bern, N.C. Power outages mounted until nearly 700,000 customers were in the dark in North Carolina alone. Duke Energy said late Friday that it anticipates 1 million to 3 million outages in the Carolinas, and that full power restoration could take weeks. “The storm is wreaking havoc on our state, and we’re deeply concerned for farms, for businesses, for schools and even for whole communities that might be wiped away,” said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D). The eyewall of Florence struck the coast before dawn. At 5:30 a.m. a reporter in a downtown hotel in Wilmington heard the signature hurricane sound — a low, heavy humming combined with an almost musical high note. Eight-foot waves, a local record, ruffled the surface of the Cape Fear River. At 6 a.m. the electronics chirped for a moment as the power went out. Buildings swayed for several hours. The wind in Wilmington gusted to 105 mph, the strongest since Hurricane Helene on Sept. 27, 1958, the Weather Service said. The winds became less violent as the eye, no longer well-formed but instead welling with rain, passed over the city after it made landfall at 7:15 a.m. Trees went down, as did power lines, and streets filled with debris. A Waffle House downtown remained open for a few hours — sandwiches only, no coffee — before closing at noon. Metal signs and roof coverings littered the biggest commercial byway, Market Street, and trees blocked many roads. Traffic lights were out. Residents mostly heeded police commands to stay home and off the streets. In Kinston, a city southeast of Raleigh, two people died in the storm. A 78-year-old man connecting extension cords in the rain was electrocuted, according to Roger Dail, the Lenoir County director of emergency services. And a 77-year-old man died when he was knocked over by wind, he said. In Pender County, officials said that a woman died of a heart attack Friday morning as emergency crews tried to reach her; they were delayed because of downed trees and debris in the road. The crews tried to move the debris with a front loader, but a tree went through the windshield, causing further delays, the officials said. “Our hearts go out to the families of those who died in this storm,” Cooper said in a statement. “Hurricane Florence is going to continue its violent grind across our state for days. Be extremely careful and stay alert.” Sullivan reported from Wilmington, N.C. Berman and Achenbach reported from Washington. Jason Samenow and Angela Fritz in Washington and Lori Rozsa in Miami, Rachel Siegel in Jacksonville, N.C., Sharon Dunten in Savannah, Ga., Ray Glier in Atlanta, Kristine Phillips in Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Sarah Kaplan in Lumberton contributed to this report.","Washington Post Record flooding projected as Florence rolls slowly across the Carolinas Washington Post LUMBERTON, N.C. — The storm known as Florence is creating a slow-motion natural disaster for the Carolinas that could prove deceptively lethal as swollen r…",2018-09-15T00:26:51Z,"{'id': 'the-washington-post', 'name': 'The Washington Post'}",Record flooding projected as Florence rolls slowly across the Carolinas - Washington Post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/record-flooding-projected-as-florence-rolls-slowly-across-the-carolinas/2018/09/14/576d2a5e-b833-11e8-a2c5-3187f427e253_story.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5ZtgkksdipDt3FtQrU72CUfLAZk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NDCK25VYHEI6RIWFGGD7IJ7CKM.jpg,the-washington-post,The Washington Post,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The collapsed dam in Laos caused massive flooding in the Mekong Delta The collapse of a newly built dam in Laos has shone a spotlight on a worldwide construction boom. Many thousands of hydropower dams are either planned or under construction - across South East Asia, South America, the Balkans and Africa. Laos has joined the construction race, with an ambition to become the ""battery of South East Asia"". ""Energy-hungry countries are demanding cheap and clean energy,"" says Julian Kirchherr, a researcher at the University of Utrecht. The anti-dam movement is now contending with an industry that was temporarily written off by some, but is now making a comeback. Critics point to the inherent dangers of building too many dams, too fast and without sufficient consideration for the consequences. With hydropower dams at the heart of debates about energy and the environment, Reality Check looks at what's behind the dam-building rush. Energy for growth The electricity produced by hydropower dams is presented as the means to get people out of poverty, says Susanne Schmeier, a senior lecturer at the IHE Delft Institute for Water Education. ""People need the electricity. We do need sustainable hydropower. The question is: Who decides how it's done?"" Hydropower is the world's largest source of renewable electricity. The dams store river water which, when released, powers turbines and generators to create electricity. More than 3,500 hydropower dams are being planned or built around the world, according to a database maintained by Christiane Zarfl (and others) at the University of Tubingen. This could double by 2030. Most of these dams are at the planning stage, and the data doesn't include dams primarily designed for water supply, flood prevention, navigation and recreation - so the total number of dams being built could be much higher. Brazil leads the way in terms of the number of new dams. China is still expected to produce the most electricity using hydropower. The river basins with the most dams are La Plata (covering parts of Argentina, south-east Bolivia, southern Brazil, Paraguay and a large part of Uruguay), the Ganges-Bramaputra (mainly India but also China, Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan) and the Amazon (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru and Venezuela). According to Ms Zarfl's latest unpublished data, since 2015 almost 100 new dams have been proposed in Africa, with noticeable increases in Angola, Burundi, DRC and Mozambique. And more than 130 have been added in South America, especially Peru, Brazil and Ecuador. New projects such as the vast Belo Monte dam in Brazil, which has pitted indigenous communities in the Amazon against big corporations, and Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam on the Nile are hugely contentious. Along the Mekong River, five dams have been completed, two are under construction and 10 are being planned, according to International Rivers. By 2020, Laos wants 100 operational hydropower plants. Three of the largest dams ever built are near completion in the Amazon. The World Bank's declining involvement Until the 1990s, the World Bank was heavily involved in supporting dam construction projects. However, public pressure and mounting controversies surrounding some high profile dam-building projects led to increasing concerns. In 1993, it withdrew funding from a multi-million dollar project along the Narmada river in India. The Bank, ""once the biggest force behind big dams"", had ""grown skittish"", said the Economist. A report by the World Commission on Dams in 2000, commissioned by the World Bank, highlighted the social and environmental damage that was being caused by large dams. Between 40 million and 80 million people worldwide have been displaced by dams, said the report. Some believe that figure could be much higher if you take into account the effects beyond immediate displacement - such as access to land for agriculture and fishing. Image copyright AFP Image caption The Belo Monte dam, under construction in Brazil's Amazon rainforest, led to street protests in Sao Palo in 2011 ""This watershed moment marked a shift in the way hydropower projects were planned and developed, with greater focus on affected communities,"" says Will Henley, a spokesman for the International Hydropower Association (IHA). The IHA now publishes sustainability guidelines for hydropower projects. China leads the way With the World Bank turning away from the sector, China has filled the gap and now dominates the industry. Since the turn of the century, China has accounted for over half of worldwide hydropower growth, according to the IHA. It has capacity to produce twice as much as the US. And China not only became the largest producer, it also started taking its business abroad. Chinese construction companies and financiers were encouraged to go global as part of the government's attempt to do more business overseas. This is why many experts believe that Chinese companies now control at least half of the hydropower dam-building market worldwide. ""Chinese players were seen as a welcome replacement to World Bank funding because they did not ask as many questions [about resettling communities or biodiversity] as the World Bank"", Mr Kirchherr says. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Three Gorges Dam has 32 hydropower generators China's Three Gorges Dam World's biggest dam Cost up to £25bn 1.4 million people relocated The reservoir submerged 13 cities, 140 towns and 1,350 villages The dam produces the same amount of electricity as 11 nuclear power stations Concerns remain Whether there are too many dams depends on how they are built and the degree of consultation with local communities. ""A very sustainable construction takes time. It needs to have assessments in place that take into account other dams along the river,"" says Christiane Zarfl at the University of Tubingen and co-author of the dams database. ""Building a dam very quickly can lead to mistakes."" As construction projects multiply around the world, campaigners continue to highlight the negative impact of dams on local populations and the surrounding ecosystem. A 2012 survey found that more than 70% of people who had been resettled said they had become impoverished. Dams reduced fish populations in the Mekong River basin relied on by people for food, according to another study. However, the significant benefits of hydropower are clear. These dams produce much-needed electricity and there are agricultural benefits as well. And the renewed interest from the World Bank in supporting dam construction -- with involvement in two recent projects in Laos -- is a clear indication of growing international support for well-managed hydropower, ""especially in the context of the climate change debate"", says Ms Schmeier.

Ethan Gach,"PlayStation Experience was organized a little differently this year with its game showcase taking place last night rather than today and no real keynote speech. Announcements were a little light as well. Regular games are still getting new VR capability added and hey, MediEvil is getting remastered. Instead of standing speeches and and intermittent trailers the PSX 2017 opening ceremony consisted mostly of people sitting on a couch onstage giggling about games that already released like Horizon Zero Dawn or imminent releases like God of War as people in the audience shouted random stuff in excitement. As one person in the Twitch chat put it, the night was more of a laid back podcast than blockbuster affair. Sony executive Shawn Layden didn’t have too many bombshell announcements but we’ve collected some of the more notable highlights below. WipEout Omega Collection is getting a VR mod. It’s a sensible addition to the game given that VR tends to work best when someone’s occupying a fixed space like a cockpit. Although as Layden joked you’ll have to supply your own sickness bags. The mod doesn’t bring any new content outside of the VR capability and is due out in early 2018. The new God of War will be long. There weren’t any new trailers or confirmation of a release date but creative director Cory Barlog did note the game will be around 35-40 hours long. Previous God of War games have been closer to 10 hours, but in 2017 and 2018 even games that aren’t open world are still overwhelming chuck full of stuff to do. Detroit: Become Human lets you press circle to ask about emotional shocks. Quantic Dream’s philosophical reflection on robots and humanity was demoed live on stage as a “fun game to play with friends.” In case you were wondering if David Cage’s new game would involve hyper emotional over the top moments, rest assured it will. There will also be plenty of walking around while game prompts flood the screen. Donut County still looks beautifully chill. Ben Esposito’s game about being a hole in the ground that sucks up everything around it was originally prototyped back in 2012. I’ve been following it ever since and am glad to see it’s shaping up so well. The latest trailer also does the best job of explaining what the game is so you should really just watch that. Currently it’s scheduled to arrive on PS4 (and smartphones and PC) next year. MediEvil is getting remastered for PS4. There’s this thing where Layden wears t-shirts to PSX repping his favorite old game series and then fans salivate over the prospect of them getting revived. Since Rachet and Clank and Crash Bandicoot were such a success, the ritual continued this year. I loved MediEvil. I have fond memories of playing it early in the morning before school and while Sir Daniel Fortesque made terrible jokes. And even I don’t quite know how it Sony chose it of all possible games to get a PS4 remaster (with 4K capabilities). Layden’s shirt did look pretty cool though. You’ll soon be able to have an adorable bird dog fill your entire field of vision. The Last Guardian is getting its own VR capability with a demo available starting on December 12. Where VR makes perfect sense for something like WipEout it’s a little more foreboding in a game with cameras and movement that can be as wonky as Last Guardian’s, so if you’re going to need puke bags for the former, you might need a bucket for this one. Mega Man will be in Monster Hunter: World. He won’t be playable though, instead the blue bomber will be one of your palico buddies should you choose him. In addition to eating sausages with you he’ll also let you listen to chiptunes while you spend countless hours poaching enormous beasts for their hides and whatnot. It’s the clearest evidence yet that Capcom intends on making 2018 the year of Mega Man. You’ll probably be able to change your PSN name in the future, maybe. Kinda Funny’s Greg Miller asked Layden during a short interview at the end of the night when players would finally be able to change their PSN profile names, some of which are decades old and were created when people thought blAze_it_420 was the epitome of funny. “Let me put it this way: I hope we’ll see events occur so that you don’t have to ask me that question next PSX,” he said. Make of that what you will. And there you have it. Overall it was a pretty chill if uneventful night. If you’re interested in listening to some of the developers that were on stage talk about their games and what it’s been like working on them you can catch the entire PSX opening night below.",PlayStation Experience was organized a little differently this year with its game showcase taking place last night rather than today and no real keynote speech.

Eric Berger,"Enlarge / Houston, on Monday, basically all across the city. reader comments 500 Saturday August 25 marks the one-year anniversary of the Texas landfall of Hurricane Harvey. Alongside Hurricane Katrina, it ranks as the costliest hurricane on record for the United States. Revisiting this story now, as another slow-moving hurricane pounds the Hawaiian islands with heavy rainfall and life threatening flooding, seems both appropriate and unfortunate at the same time. As such, we're resurfacing this first-person account from Ars' Houston-based space guru, Eric Berger. The piece originally ran on August 30, 2017 and appears unchanged below. HOUSTON—Lightning crashed all around as I dashed into the dark night. The parking lot outside my apartment building had become swollen with rains, a torrent about a foot deep rushing toward lower ground God knows where. Amazingly, the garage door rose when I punched the button on the opener. Inside I found what I expected to find—mayhem. In dismay, I scooped up a box of books that had been on the floor. As I did, one of the sodden bottom flaps gave way, and a heavy book splashed into the water: From Dawn to Decadence, a timeless account of the Western world's great works by Jacques Barzun. Almost immediately, a current from the rushing water beyond the garage door pulled the tome away, forever. Damn, I loved that book. An indescribably bad night had just gotten that little bit worse. This little scene played out on Sunday morning, around 4am, after sheets of rain from Hurricane Harvey had drenched southern Houston for the previous 12 hours. A few miles away, amidst the tempest, my wife sat on the front porch of her sister's new home. It had been built on pilings to keep it safe from flooding. But when 24 inches falls in less than 24 hours, as it did over Clear Creek south of Houston, bad things happen. Amanda and her sister watched as the flood waters rose, step by step, toward the porch and first story where they sat. A similar situation played itself out all across the fourth largest city in the country that night. Fearful, nervous, terrified people watched the water coming up. And the relentless rain, it never seemed to end. As bayous rose, emergency responders issued warnings on TV and social media: don't go into your attics unless there's an exit or you take an axe. And bring white towels with you, they said, so we can find you on rooftops. People catch a ride on a construction truck as they evacuate their homes after the area was inundated with flooding from Hurricane Harvey. This gallery highlights scenes from around a ravaged Houston. People take shelter at the George R. Brown Convention Center after flood waters from Hurricane Harvey inundated the city on August 29, 2017. An overflight of a southeast Houston neighborhood on Sunday. A closer view of damage on Sunday.

Minute Maid Park, home of the Houston Astros, can be seen to the left. Soldiers with the Texas Army National Guard support relief efforts to residents of Cyprus Creek on Monday. Another flooded neighborhood (notice the Taco truck and flooded homes). Bottled water is among the most valuable commodities during a storm. Another scene from Houston. What a lot of neighborhoods look like right now. Creeks across the region are swollen. Nationally, Houston has a lousy reputation. It's too hot, too humid, and too, well, too sprawly. It is all of those things. And don't tell the Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau I said this, but it's not a great city to visit. There isn't much to do here that's touristy, especially during our sultry summers. But here's a little secret: Houston is a great place to live. It's the opposite of, ""It's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there."" Rather, Houston may not be a nice place to visit, but you would want to live there. I do. But not on that Saturday night. Nor the next day. Nor night. Nor, well, any time through Wednesday. As this article publishes, periodic heavy rains are still pulsing through parts of the upper Texas coast as Harvey finally pulls away. Already, the city has nearly set an annual record for rainfall, and the month is only August. The city, quite literally, is drowning. Allison This is not the first time I've experienced an epic flood in Houston. It was only 16 years ago that another tropical system, Allison, moved into the upper Texas coast. The storm had gone inland, up into the piney woods of Eastern Texas. But four days later it sagged back toward the coast and refueled itself on warmth and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. On the night of Friday, June 8, 2001, it would soak downtown Houston. I remember this night vividly. It predated the existence of smart phones, weather apps, and, well, I was younger and stupider then. So even though it was raining heavily that Friday evening, some friends and I left work and went to a local club to see a Bob Schneider show. The rain got so intense, that even as Schneider crooned songs from his new album, Lonelyland, we could hear the storms outside over the music. It was time to go. Outside, the roads were rushing with water, seeking their way to bayous, which in turn carry water out into the Gulf of Mexico. As I said my goodbyes and dashed to my car it dawned on me—how, exactly, was I going to get home? I'd recently bought a house a few miles northwest of downtown, but to get there from the club I'd have to cross Interstate 10, the freeway that spans the entirety of America, from Santa Monica, California to Jacksonville, Florida. That night, in central Houston, it had become a raging canal. I couldn't cross. My friends had been going the other way, they couldn't get anywhere either. The Saturday morning after Tropical Storm Allison was pretty bad. That night we ended up tromping around the Montrose area of Houston. It was such a surreal scene. The last thing you should do in floodwaters, especially at night, is to walk into them. You don't know how deep they are. You might stumble into a drain. And, yes, there are a few alligators and snakes in the bayous of Houston. But I was in my 20s then—again, young and stupid. Estimated as a 500-year flood by hydrologists, Allison was considered the reference inland rainfall event for Houston. At least now we knew how bad it could get here. The city could be hardened. When I finally made it home around noon the next day, I decided I didn't want to ever be caught unprepared for such a dire situation again. I began paying closer attention to the weather. As a science writer for the Houston Chronicle, I wrote stories about flooding and tropical weather. By Hurricane Katrina in 2005, I had a science blog and filled it with dispatches about the storm. Hurricane Rita followed three weeks later. By the time Hurricane Ike struck Texas in 2008, the third costliest hurricane in US history, I had the bug. I pursued a meteorology certification from Mississippi State University. I left the Chronicle in 2015 to cover space full time for Ars. But over the years I had built an audience I felt compelled to serve, so I started Space City Weather as kind of a hobby. And it more or less remained a hobby until last week, drawing perhaps 25,000 page views a week. I had some loyal fans, but really, who wanted to read forecasts day after day when the seven-day outlook called for hot, sunny days with a slight chance of rain? Harvey The atmospheric physics behind Harvey's prodigious rainmaking ability are pretty simple. A big low pressure system moves into the Texas coast, dragging a bunch of moisture with it. Usually, when big tropical systems achieve hurricane status, they have some capacity to forge their own steering currents. But when Hurricane Harvey made landfall, it ran into a ridge of high pressure over the southwestern United States. This blocked further movement. Once inland Friday night, Harvey was essentially a marble on a flat table, wobbling around. This is a particularly bad thing for people nearby such a storm, since it essentially becomes a conveyor belt for moisture from the Gulf to coastal areas. You've got this counter-clockwise circulation hoovering up moisture from the Gulf at lower levels of the atmosphere, creating a funnel of rising air. And when warm, moist air rises, it rains. And when a storm doesn't move far from the coast, it just keeps raining—and never really stops. Enlarge / Fact check: True. Harvey came inland about 200 miles south of Houston, and the outer rain bands pushed into Houston on Saturday, setting the stage for the first of several exceptionally wet nights. Houston lies a few dozen feet above sea level, and during normal rainfall residential yards drain into streets, streets drain into bayous, and bayous carry water into Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. But this was not normal rainfall; it was extreme tropical rainfall. Meteorologists measure rainfall rates in inches per hour at a given location. A rainfall rate of 0.5 inches per hour is heavy, while anything above 2.0 inches per hour is intense (you'd probably stop your car on a highway, pull over, and wait out the passing storm). Over Clear Creek near where I live, from 11pm to 1am that night, 10.6 inches of rain fell, about as much rainfall as New York City gets from October through December. That happened i n two hours. The next night, the heaviest band of rainfall set up over western Houston, where affluent suburbs are generally protected by two large reservoirs. The Addicks and Barker facilities were built before World War II following devastating floods in Houston. Combined they have a capacity to store about 400,000 acre-feet of water, or about the same amount of water that goes over Niagara Falls in 10 days. The reservoirs filled up for the first time ever during Harvey, forcing the US Army Corps of engineers to release water into bayous that were already flooded, worsening conditions downstream in central Houston. Dramatically, this occurred near the very height of the storm. It seems insane, but this was the best of several bad options. Had the Corps not done this, the dam walls might have failed, leading to a catastrophic release of a wall of water as much as 100 feet high.

Peter Vogel,"November 6, 2018 3 min read Opinions expressed by Green Entrepreneur contributors are their own. It’s not unusual for top fund managers to get 100-plus pitch decks in a month and to speak with dozens of aspiring entrepreneurs. VCs are on the front-lines of the cannabis start-up scene. For this reason, they have a keen eye for quickly spotting trends in the industry. Here, then, are a few insights from some of the country’s most respected funds. Related: 6 Things to Keep in Mind When Fundraising for Cannabis California is on fire With the start of recreational sales in California last January, a flood of new cannabis companies has hit the Golden State. No surprise considering that the state is home to 40 million people and an economy that, if a country, would have the 5th highest GDP in the world (even bigger than the UK). California does everything in a BIG way. This has caught the attention of many VCs, including Matthew Nordgren, Managing Director of Arcadian Fund in Los Angeles. “Based on the size of California and the stage of California’s regulatory environment, we are consistently seeing entrepreneurs launching new businesses across almost every vertical in cannabis,"" he says. ""People here in California can feel the excitement and energy of this new industry and a huge number of them are jumping in head-first."" Related: 3 Hottest Cannabis Trends in California Brands are making their mark When states first become legal, its consumers are usually happy to try any product, just to actually purchase cannabis legally. It’s still a novelty. But as legalization becomes the norm and the industry matures, consumers start to gravitate towards specific brands, choosing their favorites. In this scenario, a strong brand becomes more vital in a consumer’s purchasing decision and a key driver to a product’s success. What makes a strong brand? Piers Cooper, Managing Partner of Fresh VC, has noticed a focus ""on diversity and depth of product offerings. Strong brands have to offer a variety of flavors, dosages, methods of application and continued growth in innovation to keep consumer’s interest in their brand,” he says. Emily Paxhia, Managing Director of Poseidon Asset Management, agrees saying that, “branded products are exploding in California. But she warns, ""If even half of these companies make it past year one, it will be an even more competitive space."" Venture Capital Is Out There Even though federal regulations have not changed significantly yet, we are seeing states legalizing one by one, attracting new investors to cannabis. This has led to a growing pool of angel investors, family offices and venture capital firms -- while institutional investors are mostly sitting on the sidelines. As the number of investors increases, entrepreneurs are at an advantage. Explains Nordgren, “Entrepreneurs now have a much larger world of capital to talk with. This can change deal dynamics significantly as more money comes into the space, and entrepreneurs have more options of where to take money from.” This is good news for start-ups, solid models, strong teams, and consistent execution. When you have more investors vying for an investment, you’ll have much more flexibility to impact or control the terms of the deal.

Dell Cameron,"FCC Chairman Ajit Pai received an award on Wednesday from a conservative media organization for his courage in public service. It is the second time Pai has been awarded for courage in 2018. The award was bestowed by the Daily Caller News Foundationthe non-profit branch of Fox News host Tucker Carlsons Daily Caller news siteciting various threats that Pai and his family received this year amid the fierce public discourse over net neutrality. The invite-only ceremony was said to be hastily assembled at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington D.C., following the funeral of former president George H.W. Bush. In May, federal authorities arrested a suspect accused of calling in a bomb threat during the December 2017 net neutrality vote. Another man was arrested in June and charged with email death threats to Pai, one of which accompanied a photo of the chairmans family and made references to their location. Protesters were also accused of crossing a line when they posted signs outside his home that featured the names of his children. Wednesdays event had been planned prior to the death of the 41st president. Organizers quickly threw together a tribute to Bush to include at the start of the event, which they said could not be canceled last minute. A lot of people there had been at a funeral all day, so things were quieter, Daily Callers editor-in-chief, Christopher Bedford, said by phone. Its kind of funnyits kind of sad that that award would go to someone who was a telecom lawyer, he said. Usually it doesnt take a lot of bravery to be a telecom lawyer, but I thought it was insane the level of vitriol, violent threats, threats against his family, and racist attacks that were directed at him. Bedford, who said he viewed the threats as deadly serious, characterized the dispute over net neutrality as a fight between billion dollar corporations who are angry at other billion-dollar corporations, not typically the stuff, he averred, of a grassroots revolt, or riots and protests. (To the authors knowledge, theres not been a riot over the issue of net neutrality.) Were reporters. We arent there to talk about the policy; whether net neutrality is good or bad. Im not a billion dollar corporation, so it doesnt really affect me that much, added Bedford, saying the event, which had been overshadowed by the day of mourning, was intended to be a fun event. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke was also recognized by the Caller foundation. And White House Chief of Staff John Kelly accepted an invitation to the event, according to one attendee. The FCC did not respond to a request for comment. At the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Pai received an award also for courage from the National Rifle Association; specifically the Charlton Heston Courage Under Fire Award, which came in the form of a handmade long gun that, for security reasons, could not be brought on stage. Pai later turned down the award, citing the advice of ethics officials. Pais charge to repeal the 2015 Open Internet Order, the net neutrality rules enacted under former Chairman Tom Wheeler, drew unprecedented levels of public attention over the past year. The undertaking, which concluded with the order being formally repealed in June, has been widely condemned by digital rights organizations. The chairman, meanwhile, claims the 2015 order was stifling internet innovation and that his new, light-touch approach would encourage it. Does the Federal Communications Commission believe that more than half a million comments about net Read more Read Innovative providers hoping to offer their customers new, even free services had to fear a Washington bureaucracy that might disapprove and take enforcement action against them, he said earlier this year. With the possibility of broadband rate regulation looming on the horizon, companies investing in next-generation networks hesitated to build or expand networks, unsure of whether the government would let them compete in the free market. Pai is widely recognized as one of the most effective soldiers in the Trump administrations anti-regulatory offensive, which has likewise seen myriad rules purged at the Environmental Protection Agency and Departments of Labor, Commerce, Transportation, and Education, among others. But even the rollback of Obama-era pollution rules aimed at bolstering a declining coal industry, which may contribute to over a thousand deaths per year, according to the Trump administrations own analysis, has not seen as fearsome a public debate as net neutrality. Net neutrality is the principle that internet providers treat all data delivered to customers equally. Proponents have long warned that, without government rules in place, internet providers are likely to engage in predatory practices, such as limiting subscribers access to competing online services. Other fears include the creation of a two-tiered system in which certain companies are granted exclusive access to higher internet speeds, leaving startups and small businesses stranded by the waysideso-called fast lanes, which some legal experts argue is a form of discrimination. Although some internet providers have been found in violation of net neutrality principles, and have expressed interested in establishing fast lanes for profit in the past, Pai and his supporters point to the fact that theres been little change in how consumers receive or pay for internet service so far as proof that the Obama-era rules were pointless regulations hindering innovation. The FCCs decision which fell 3-2 along party lines is still being weighed by the D.C. Court of Appeals, however, and telecom lawyers say its unlikely providers will do anything drastic in the meantime that might influence the cases outcome. Scrutiny of Pais office will intensify next year as Democrats take control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Chiefly, control of the House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee, which provides oversight of the FCC, will soon fall to current ranking member, Frank Pallone, Jr., Democrat of New Jersey. Democratic sources say the list of issues to be raised with Pai is long, largely due to the fact that his office has refused to acknowledge most requests for information without an order from the present Republican majority. Questions about instability in the FCCs comment system, which Pai said publicly this week saw a flood of fraudulent activity (including comments linked to Russian accounts), are high on the list. In early 2017, Republicans suggested that they would hold quarterly oversight hearings for the FCC; however, only three were held over the past two years. With Democrats at the helm, the chairman is likely to enjoy (or probably not) a significant uptick in C-SPAN screen time, giving him the opportunity to further test his courage.",FCC Chairman Ajit Pai received an award on Wednesday from a conservative media organization for his “courage in public service.” It is the second time Pai has been awarded for “courage” in 2018.

MICHAEL BIESECKER / AP,"About 1.7 million chickens have been killed in flooding from Florence as rising North Carolina rivers swamped at least 60 farm buildings where the animals were being raised for market, according to a major poultry producer. Sanderson Farms said Tuesday the losses occurred at independent farms that supply its poultry processing plants. The company said its facilities suffered no major damage, but supply disruptions and flooded roadways had caused shutdowns at some plants. In addition, about 30 farms near Lumberton have been isolated by flood waters, hampering the delivery of feed to animals. The lack of food could cause additional birds to die if access isn’t restored quickly, the company said. The N.C. Pork Council says some hogs also may have died when farms flooded, but that mortality figures are not yet available. The pork industry trade group says farmers have been working before and after the storm to move at-risk animals to higher ground. The industry lost about 2,800 hogs during flooding from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. The Department of Environmental Quality said the earthen dam at one hog lagoon in Duplin County had breached, spilling its contents. Another dozen of the pits containing animal feces and urine had either suffered structural damage, had wastewater levels go over their tops from heavy rains or had been swamped by floodwaters. Large mounds of manure are also typically stored at poultry farms. Even though the sun shown in parts of the state Tuesday, major flooding is continuing after Florence’s passage and is expected to worsen in some areas. Sixteen North Carolina rivers were at major flood stage Tuesday with an additional three forecast to peak by Thursday. An environmental threat is also posed by human waste as low-lying municipal sewage plants flood. On Sunday, the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority reported that more than 5 million gallons of partially treated sewage had spilled into the Cape Fear River after power failed at its treatment plant. The Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that 16 community water treatment facilities in North Carolina are unable to supply drinking water and that seven publicly owned sewage treatment works are non-operational due to the flooding. Duke Energy is continuing cleanup operations Tuesday following a weekend breach at a coal ash landfill at its L.V. Sutton Power Station near Wilmington. Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said a full assessment of how much ash escaped from the waterlogged landfill is ongoing. The company initially estimated Saturday that about 2,000 cubic yards (1,530 cubic meters) of ash were displaced, enough to fill about 180 dump trucks. The coal-fired Sutton plant was retired in 2013 and replaced with a new facility that burns natural gas. The company has been excavating millions of tons of leftover ash from old pits there and removing the waste to a new lined landfill constructed on the property. The gray ash left behind when coal is burned contains toxic heavy metals, including arsenic, lead and mercury. Photos from the site provided to AP by Cape Fear River Watch, an environmental advocacy group, show cascades of gray-colored water spilling from at least two breaches at the landfill and flowing toward Sutton Lake, the plant’s former cooling pond which is now used for public recreation, including fishing and boating. Sutton Lake drains into the Cape Fear River. Sheehan said Duke’s assessment is that there was minimal chance any contaminants from the spill had reached the river. At a different power plant near Goldsboro, three old coal ash dumps capped with soil were inundated by the Neuse River. Duke said they had no indication those dumps at the H.F. Lee Power Plant were leaking ash into the river. Duke’s handling of ash waste has faced intense scrutiny since a drainage pipe collapsed under a waste pit at an old plant in Eden in 2014, triggering a massive spill that coated 70 miles (110 kilometers) of the Dan River in gray sludge. The utility later agreed to plead guilty to nine Clean Water Act violations and pay $102 million in fines and restitution for illegally discharging pollution from ash dumps at five North Carolina power plants. It plans to close all its ash dumps by 2029.",About 1.7 million chickens have been killed in flooding from Florence as rising North Carolina rivers swamped at least 60 farm buildings.,2018-09-18T18:36:53Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",At Least 1.7 Million Chickens Drown in Flooding From Florence Aftermath,http://time.com/5399857/chickens-north-carolina-hurricane-florence/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/south-carolina-flooding-florence.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Chuck Burton and Martha Waggoner / AP,"(WILMINGTON, N.C.) — With Wilmington still mostly an island surrounded by Hurricane Florence’s floodwaters and people waiting for hours for handouts of necessities like food, North Carolina’s governor is pleading with thousands of evacuees to be patient and not return home just yet. “I know it was hard to leave home, and it is even harder to wait and wonder whether you even have a home to go back to,” Gov. Roy Cooper said as officials began distributing supplies to residents of Wilmington, population 120,000. The death toll rose to at least 37 in three states Tuesday, with 27 fatalities in North Carolina, as Florence’s remnants went in two directions: Water flowed downstream toward the Carolina coast, and storms raced through the Northeast, where flash floods hit New Hampshire and New York state. Cooper warned that the flooding set off by as much as 3 feet of rain from Florence is far from over and will get worse in places. “I know for many people this feels like a nightmare that just won’t end,” he said. Still stranded by Florence’s epic floods days after the hurricane hit North Carolina, Wilmington residents lined up by the hundreds for free food, water and tarps as officials struggled to open new routes to one of the state’s largest cities. Addressing roughly 10,000 people who remain in shelters and “countless more” staying elsewhere, Cooper urged residents to stay put for now, particularly those from the hardest-hit coastal counties that include Wilmington, near where Florence blew ashore on Friday. A second shelter is opening in Carteret County. Roads remain treacherous, he said, and some are still being closed for the first time as rivers swelled by torrential rains inland drain toward the Atlantic. In South Carolina, two women died after a van was overtaken by rising flood waters near the Little Pee Dee River. Marion County Coroner Jerry Richardson told The Associated Press that the women, detainees being transported to a mental health facility, drowned at around 6 p.m. Tuesday when a van tried to cross a roadway and was overtaken by water. Their names have not been released. Two other people were sent to a hospital for observation. The White House said President Donald Trump will visit North Carolina on Wednesday to see the damage. Beforehand he boasted on Twitter: “Right now, everybody is saying what a great job we are doing with Hurricane Florence — and they are 100% correct.” He warned that the Democrats will soon start criticizing the government response, and “this will be a total lie, but that’s what they do, and everybody knows it!” In Wilmington, workers began handing out supplies using a system resembling a giant fast-food drive-thru: Drivers pulled up to a line of pallets, placed an order and left without having to get out. A woman blew a whistle each time drivers had to pull forward. Todd Tremain needed tarps to cover up spots where Florence’s winds ripped shingles off his roof. Others got a case of bottled water or military MREs, or field rations. An olive-drab military forklift moved around huge pallets loaded with supplies. Brandon Echavarrieta struggled to stay composed as he described life post-Florence: no power for days, rotted meat in the freezer, no water or food and just one bath in a week. “It’s been pretty bad,” said Echavarrieta, 34, his voice breaking. Nearby, about 200 people lined up to buy 40-pound bags of ice as quickly as a Rose Ice and Coal Co. could produce it. Supplies have been brought into the city by big military trucks and helicopters, which also were used to pluck hundreds of desperate people from homes and other structures. Mayor Bill Saffo said two routes were now open into Wilmington, which had been completely cut off by floodwaters, but those roads could close again as water swells the Cape Fear River on the city’s west side. At Fayetteville, about 100 miles inland, near the Army’s sprawling Fort Bragg, the Cape Fear River had risen about 50 feet toward a crest predicted to be more than 25 feet above flood level. On Tuesday, logs and other debris became trapped under a rail bridge as rushing brown water pushed against the span. The flooding got so bad that authorities closed a vehicle bridge in Fayetteville after the river began touching girders supporting the bridge’s top deck. Fayetteville Mayor Mitch Colvin said it was unclear if the bridge was threatened. “We’ve never had it at those levels before so we don’t really know what the impact will be just yet,” he said. The river swallowed trees, lamp posts and a parking lot near its banks. City officials warned still-rising water threatened some neighborhoods and businesses that seemed safe, but said the worst was nearly over and life was beginning to return to normal downtown. Businesses were re-opening and owners removed sandbags and plywood from storefronts. Human and animal waste is mixing with the swirling floodwaters, which have killed about 1.7 million chickens on poultry farms. More than 5 million gallons of partially treated sewage spilled into the Cape Fear River after power went out at a treatment plant, officials said, and the earthen dam of a pond holding hog waste was breached, spilling its contents. The governor said 16 rivers statewide were at major flood stage and more than 1,100 roads were closed. Emergency workers reported rescuing and evacuating more than 2,200 people and around 575 animals, he said. In a bright spot, the Lumber River appeared to be falling in hard-hit Lumberton, about 70 miles inland. Power outages in the Southeast also were down, from a high of more than 910,000 to about 245,000, nearly all in North Carolina.",North Carolina’s governor is pleading with thousands of evacuees to be patient and not return home just yet,2018-09-19T09:14:58Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",North Carolina Governor Pleads for Patience as Florence Evacuees Grow Anxious to Return Home,http://time.com/5400361/north-carolina-florence-evacuees-shelters/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/800-41.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Daniel Cusick, E&E News","Can one town’s solution to flooding be another town’s nemesis? The question goes to the heart of a long-running debate in suburban St. Louis, where a half-dozen communities along the lower Meramec River are grappling with the worst back-to-back floods in recent memory. One of the towns, Valley Park, has a high earthen levee protecting its downtown from rising water. It stayed dry during the epic Meramec floods of 2016 and 2017. The other towns have no levees, and twice they were inundated to the rooftops. Now, as the rebuilding of homes and businesses winds down, a debate over the future of flood risk—and how to defend against it—is stewing along the Meramec, just as it is on other rivers across the country. What is the best way to protect vulnerable communities from severe flooding when the rivers themselves are undergoing dramatic changes? And if one river community takes steps to reduce its flood risk, does it have a responsibility to make sure its solutions doesn’t negatively affect downstream neighbors? Nowhere is that discussion more relevant than on the Meramec, one of the longest free-flowing rivers in Missouri and the site of some of the worst river flooding in the United States over the last 25 years. Along its 220-mile path to the Mississippi, the Meramec drains 4,000 square miles of land from the Ozark highlands to the St. Louis suburbs. It takes on water from forests, farms, industrial sites, and commercial and residential developments. And like many American rivers, it has a checkered health history born of logging, farm runoff, industrial discharges and other ills associated with human development, particularly in its lower basin. Perhaps no symbol of human fouling of the lower Meramec lies just upstream and across the river from Valley Park, where the Peerless Park Landfill sprawls across part of the historic floodway, forming a terraced mini-mountain on the site of what used to be a drive-in theater. Environmentalists contend that the landfill itself has altered the Meramec’s flood profile. On most days of the year, the Meramec flows lazily to its confluence, drawing recreational boaters, tube riders and fishermen who catch bass and catfish from its brown-tinted water. But twice in less than two years—just before New Year’s Day 2016 and again in May 2017—the rain-swelled Meramec rose out of its banks and inundated riverside communities. Among them were the postcard towns of Eureka and Pacific, lying upstream, and the more urbanized suburbs of Fenton and Arnold, which anchor the lower reaches of the Meramec before it joins the Mississippi. Valley Park took a major hit from both storms. Its primary access from all directions—Interstate 44 running east-west and State Highway 141 running north-south—were completely submerged in floodwaters during the two events. The town was stranded from emergency personnel and utility crews. Valley Park city attorney Tim Engelmeyer remembers standing atop the town’s levee as the river crested in 2017, thinking he was watching the second of two biblical floods in just 16 months and wondering if, after more than 125 years of existence, Valley Park would finally succumb to the big one. “What I saw out there was a ridiculously high level of water, like nothing I’d ever looked at before,” Engelmeyer recalled. “It was bad, and it was horrible for every community on this river.” 46 feet of water, 5 deaths Yet while Valley Park takes comfort in the fact that its levee has twice held back historic flooding, other communities up and down the Meramec’s muddy banks face very different risks. “I was here for the floods of the early ’80s and the ’90s,” said Joe Maurath, a 40-year resident and alderman of the city of Fenton, just downstream from Valley Park. “And it’s just at a point now where what we’re seeing is unprecedented. The back-to-back floods [of 2016 and 2017] were unparalleled compared to what we’ve seen in the past.” Agencies charged with investigating flood disasters agree. A report by the U.S. Geological Survey summarizing the 2017 event revealed that the flooding resulted in five deaths in Missouri, while 53 counties were declared federal disaster areas by the Trump administration. At four flood gauges along the Meramec, the river broke century-old streamflow and peak stage records, including a whopping 46.1-foot crest at Eureka, Mo., more than 27 feet above flood stage. In the following months, the Federal Emergency Management Agency paid out $62 million in National Flood Insurance Program claims to Missourians affected by the 2017 floods, while an additional $18 million in low-interest loans and grants was awarded to homeowners, renters and businesses caught in harm’s way. Those kinds of statistics undergird a growing belief among many here that the Meramec is a more dangerous river than it used to be, even though it has experienced major flood events dating to the early 20th century, including a landmark flood in 1982. “It’s overwhelming,” Fenton resident Sue Haskins told the Army Corps of Engineers at a public meeting last November. “I have a small business out of my home.... We never had water for 25 years, and all of a sudden, we got water.” While state and federal officials have identified numerous factors driving the Meramec’s worsening flood profile—including increased rainfall intensity across the region due to climate change, the conversion of historic floodplains into impervious surfaces and backflow flooding from the Mississippi River during high water phases—other observers see a culprit at the river’s edge: the Valley Park levee. Completed in 2005 at a cost of $50 million, the levee is for some a source of consternation. It has helped to drive a wedge between flood control agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers and the communities the corps has pledged to protect from floods. That’s because floodwater that would normally flow to the outer reaches of the floodplain—including downtown Valley Park—is being displaced and redistributed to other areas. That can raise water levels on nearby properties. Robert Criss is among the most outspoken scientists on these risks. He’s a professor in Washington University in St. Louis’ Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and a national expert on river hydrogeology. In an interview at his campus office in St. Louis, Criss accused government agencies, including the Army Corps, of downplaying the substantial role that levees and other human-built structures play in flooding events. “Don’t let anyone tell you these big floods are about climate change,” he said. “It’s all about the constriction of rivers.” Criss acknowledged that on small to midsized rivers like the Meramec, a heavy rainfall can lead to flash flooding. But such floods usually rise and fall quickly, he said. The main reason that communities on the Meramec are experiencing more destructive floods, he said, is that levee district boards and other oversight agencies keep approving projects that channel the water with new control structures. “The game is that if you build a big levee and you declare to everyone that it protects against a 100-year flood, then you can allow all kinds of new development to happen behind it,” said Criss. “The problem is you’re not only walling off the river from people, you’re also walling it off from its natural floodplain,” he added. “It’s a no-brainer that all of that water is going to be shunted somewhere else, and where it’s going is to communities up and downstream.” ‘Nobody is surprised anymore’ Floodwater was pumped over the Valley Park levee into the Meramec River on Dec. 31, 2015. Patrick Evenson/Missouri Air National Guard/Flickr Not everyone sees it that way. Valley Park city officials and federal river managers, notably the Army Corps of Engineers, refute those claims. They say analyses of peak flow data on the Meramec, including during the two most recent floods, indicate that the Valley Park levee is not a factor behind worsening flood conditions. “This levee did not cause all of this destruction up and down the river,” Engelmeyer, the city attorney, said. “A biblical flood did.” Don Duncan, assistant chief of engineering and construction for the Army Corps’ St. Louis District office, also pushed back on the notion that Valley Park’s levee contributed to the severe flooding. “I’m sure you’re aware that anytime there’s a flood, someone wants to point a finger at why water got inside their home or business,” Duncan said. “After the last two Meramec floods, people latched on to the Valley Park levee and ran with it. They liked the fact that they had a scapegoat to point to.” But flooded neighbors and academics aren’t the only ones making the case about levees. The St. Louis-based Great Rivers Habitat Alliance, which represents environmental, recreational and hunting interests throughout the Mississippi and Missouri basins, has also taken a tough line on levees. The group points to environmental and economic concerns. David Stokes, the alliance’s executive director, said that since the Great Mississippi and Missouri Rivers Flood of 1993, communities up and down the watershed have proposed an unprecedented number of new levees, often spurred by the promise of new development and associated tax revenue. “There has been a lot of argument back and forth about it, but we generally subscribe to the view of the scientists who have done a lot of work in this area,” Stokes said. “The bottom line is when you combine [levee building and floodplain development] with climate change and you get a couple of these horrendous rainstorms over a particular basin like the Meramec, nobody is surprised anymore by what’s happening out there.” Gerald Galloway, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Maryland and a retired Army brigadier general who spent decades analyzing the Mississippi River Basin for the Army Corps and other agencies, acknowledged that the pace of levee building has increased in Missouri and river communities across the country. So, too, he said, have the debates over the impacts of those structures in places like the Meramec. Galloway said he places a high degree of trust in the Army Corps’ analyses of river flows. But he acknowledged that some of the thorniest questions about flooding can only be answered with more comprehensive study of river basins. “Every year, the analysis gets better, our information inputs get better and we learn more and more about what’s happening out there,” he said. “But frankly, this is the type of debate that can go on and on and on.” Here’s his bottom line: “If you live on a river and your property is in a floodplain of some kind, you’re eventually going to get wet.” Even so, federal, state and local agencies are not standing still on the Meramec. The U.S. Geological Survey, in conjunction with the Army Corps, FEMA, the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District and others, recently produced a new set of digital flood inundation maps spanning 16.7 miles of the Lower Meramec Basin, including Valley Park and Fenton. The simulations incorporate data from the New Year’s 2016 flood and should provide critical insights as river communities get more serious about disaster planning and flood mitigation. USGS has also initiated a second analysis, still in the planning phases, to determine how land-use change and development over the last 80 years have altered the conveyance of water through the lower part of the basin. “The big story we’re trying to tell is what’s happened over time,” said Paul Rydlund, surface water program manager at the USGS Missouri Water Science Center in Rolla. “We know anecdotally there has been a lot change in the basin since the early 1900s. Our target is looking at how all of that development has changed the way water moves through the floodway.” Meanwhile, the corps is working closely with Meramec communities to identify new strategies for getting people and properties out of harm’s way. One of these approaches involves drafting a new floodplain management plan for the lower basin to help guide land-use planning and development. Matt Jones of the Army Corps St. Louis District’s plan formulation section said a key focus of the new Meramec management plan will be on non-structural solutions to reduce flood risk, such as elevating homes, buying out high-risk properties, and working with municipalities to toughen zoning regulations and building codes. “It’s a way for us to really go to each community to tailor solutions and see what’s in their best interest,” he said. Residents are waiting for answers. Jeff Haase, who has lived on a hilltop subdivision near Arnold since 1993 and who walks regularly in the Meramec River bottom, said he has watched the river change over the last decade as more strip malls and subdivisions have been wedged into the floodplain. It has exacerbated stormwater runoff that has been a problem for years, he said. “If I were to ballpark it,” Haase said, “I’d say a hard rain flows down this hill at about 50 percent higher volume than it did when we came 25 years ago. All of this used to be farmland, and it was wooded over. Now, more and more of the higher areas are being developed. It’s OK for people on the high ground, but it’s not good for everybody else.” Reprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&amp;E News.

ABC News,"A stalled frontal boundary continues to bring flooding rain, severe storms, freezing rain and snow from Texas to Michigan. More than 5 inches of rain has been reported in parts of Midwest over the last 24 hours sending many rivers into major flooding. Some Midwest rivers, such as the Kankakee River in Indiana, are expected to be in record flood stage this weekend. This morning, 28 states from Oregon to Maine are under winter weather alerts. Alerts are in place due to heavy rain from the Great Lakes down to Texas. The storm system stretches from Texas to Michigan on Wednesday morning with ice and snow on the back side from northern Texas to Michigan and heavy rain ahead of it from eastern Texas to Ohio. The line of heavy rain is moving through Texas, Arkansas, western Tennessee and the Midwest on Wednesday morning. The stalled weather pattern will continue to bring more rain on Thursday from Texas into Ohio Valley and a rain and snow mix in the Northeast. At the same time, a new storm system will bring snow to the western Great Lakes and the Upper Midwest. A storm is forecast to bring rain from Texas into Ohio Valley on Thursday evening. The stormy weather will continue into Friday and more rain is expected from Texas through the Ohio Valley. Stormy weather will continue into Friday, bringing more rain to areas between Texas and the Ohio Valley. Rainfall totals will be heavy from Texas into the Ohio Valley, as locally 4 to 6 additional inches are possible.

ABC News,"Exceptional drought, near-record heat and gusty winds helped to ignite several wildfires over the weekend from Southern California to Colorado. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. One of the biggest fires, the Ute Park Fire, has burned 36,083 acres in New Mexico and is only 23 percent contained. A wildfire in southern Colorado, the 416 fire, is now at 2,250 acres and only 10 percent contained. The hottest day of all will be Monday for parts of the Southwest, with highs approaching 110 degrees from Phoenix to Palm Springs, California, and temperatures into the 90s from Denver to Salt Lake City and Albuquerque, New Mexico. Because of such intense heat, an excessive heat warning has been issued for Southern California and Arizona. Also, gusty winds are expected in Nevada and California today. Temperatures in Arizona and Southern California have prompted excessive heat warnings on Monday. Relief from rain in the East An additional 3 to 6 inches of rain fell in the mid-Atlantic states over the weekend -- flooding highways, streets and neighborhoods. Saturated ground, combined with gusty winds, uprooted some trees on top of homes in the Washington, D.C. area. Because of more than 2 feet of rain in the last 30 days in parts of the East, many rivers are rising over of their banks. The Potomac River, northwest of Washington, D.C., is forecast to be in major flood stage later today. It will possibly be at its highest level since the 1990s. The storm system that brought all the rain this weekend is finally moving out this morning. Storms were moving through New York and New England on Monday. The hard-hit areas from Maryland to North Carolina will see minimal rainfall over next few days. Rainfall totals to start the week will be mostly under 1 inch across the Northeast. After a stormy Sunday from New Mexico to Georgia, severe weather will calm down slightly Monday. Tennis ball-sized hail was reported Sunday in western Texas. Winds gusted 60 to 77 mph in parts of central Texas, producing damage yesterday and this morning. Storms continue to fire up this morning in southern and central Texas with flash flooding reported near Austin, where 4 inches of rain has fallen just this morning.

Stephanie Pappas,"When record rains mingled with spring snowmelt in the lower Mississippi River Basin in April 2011, liquid disaster flowed southward and forced some hard choices: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers blasted a hole in a levee in the river system to save the city of Cairo, Ill., from inundation—at the expense of more than 100,000 acres of farmland. Mandatory evacuations were ordered in Memphis, where floodwaters lapped at historic Beale Street. Officials opened two spillways in Louisiana to protect New Orleans and Baton Rouge, sacrificing farms and coastal oyster beds. The crisis would ultimately cause $2.8 billion in damage, according to the Corps. And it is one of many recent examples of the way the restless river has pummeled surrounding communities. Unusual floods struck throughout the basin during winter 2015–16, and more swamped parts of Illinois, Arkansas and Missouri after torrential rains in 2017. Snowmelt swells the Mississippi every spring, but the river reached flood stage in Memphis a month earlier than usual in 2018 due to heavy February rains. Now a new study raises the possibility much of the effort humans have put into trying to control the mighty river has paradoxically made its large floods more destructive. The magnitude of so-called 100-year floods—massive inundations defined as having a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year—has increased 20 percent in the past five centuries on the lower Mississippi, researchers reported this month in Nature. The bulk of the increase has been in the last 150 years, when human engineering of the river has been most intense. “We’ve channelized the river, we’ve straightened it,” says Samuel Muñoz, lead author of the new study and an assistant professor of marine and environmental sciences at Northeastern University. “We’ve made the gradient steeper, and we’ve encased the river in concrete mats and lined it with levees.” The resulting physics is straightforward, Muñoz explains. With little leeway to meander and limited floodplain to spread over, the waters of the Mississippi in places are corralled into a relatively narrow chute, making peak flows higher than they would be otherwise. Muñoz and his colleagues estimate about 75 percent of the increase in 100-year-flood magnitude is due to river engineering, with the rest attributable to natural climate cycles. The study was not able to factor in the influence of anthropogenic climate change effects, though, leaving open the question of how much rising flood levels are driven by engineering and how much by a warming climate. MAGNIFIED FLOODS If left to its own devices, the Mississippi follows a sinuous and impermanent path. The river has “whipsawed” back and forth over the last 10,000 years, changing course when the sediment it deposits blocks its route, says Craig Colten, a geographer at Louisiana State University who was not involved in the new research. If not for Herculean human efforts, he says, the river would likely have switched its outlet during major flooding in 1973 and would empty into the Atchafalaya River—not the artificial route it now flows through before hitting the Gulf of Mexico. Human control of the Mississippi has caused obvious problems along the Louisiana coast. Damming upstream, for example, traps sediments that would otherwise build up the river's delta; this makes the coast more prone to rapid erosion. But a natural-running Mississippi would devastate much of the economic activity that depends on the river, says Clinton Willson, a civil engineer at L.S.U. who also was not part of the new study. The river is a crucial shipping route, Willson notes, and big barges could never navigate natural meanders. Since a historic flood tested the Corps’s nascent taming of the river in 1927, Colten says, the three overarching goals of river engineering have been to protect navigation, New Orleans and the petrochemical industry along the lower Mississippi’s banks. As much as humans have made over the Mississippi, there is a lack of understanding of how it behaved before we started mucking with it, Muñoz says. The oldest depth gauge records cover a mere 150 years, a period that started after human engineering began. Muñoz and his colleagues have attempted to extend this record back to roughly 1500 by sampling bottom sediments from three oxbow lakes in Mississippi and Louisiana. Oxbow lakes are former river channels that were cut off by sediment; they retain all the sands and silts the river carried when the now-lakes were still part of its main channel. Sediment layers left by floods stand out because faster flows carry and deposit larger grains of sediment, Muñoz says. To more precisely date floods that occurred before formal record-keeping began, the team also turned to another data source—trees. Certain types including oak show cellular-level damage when swamped, and which is visible in the trees’ growth rings, providing an annual record of when the river overflowed. The researchers also pulled in data from written records kept since the late 1800s. Taken together, their results showed 100-year floods in recent decades have been about 20 percent larger (in terms of cubic feet of water per second) than 100-year deluges 500 years ago. That increase in flood discharge, or the volume of water flowing past a given point, is “what hydrologists sometimes call ‘flood magnification,’” Muñoz says. “You’re taking what could have been a moderate event and turning it into a larger event.” Teasing apart the factors that magnified the floods has been the tough part of the new research. WHERE DOES CLIMATE CHANGE COME IN? Along with the infrastructure humans have added to the river since the 19th century, climate also affects flood severity. Two natural ocean-temperature cycles influence moisture in the Mississippi Basin, but the team’s modeling found these could explain only 25 percent of the increased flood magnitude. Human engineering explains the rest, Muñoz says. But that leaves out any role that global warming—and accompanying changes in precipitation—might be having on flood levels, says Scott St. George, a paleoclimatologist who wrote an editorial in Nature accompanying the new study. Some research has attempted to untangle these climate threads. A study led by Utah State University meteorologist Simon Wang, published in 2017 in Geophysical Research Letters, found the precipitation that caused major flooding in southern Louisiana in 2016 may have been 20 percent heavier than it would have been without warming that has occurred since 1985. A 2016 paper in Hydrology and Earth System Sciences showed warming over the past century has likely increased the chance of that flooding by a factor of at least 1.4. But how any global warming–fueled changes in precipitation affect flooding along the vast span of the Mississippi depends on when and where those changes happen, Wang says. Most of the river’s floods happen during spring when rains combine with snowmelt. So more or less spring rain or winter snow could affect flood levels. And where those precipitation changes occur—in the upper or lower Mississippi, for example—affects where the water enters the river, as well as which areas are likely to flood. Climate scientists are still trying to pick out these seasonal and regional precipitation trends. At the same time that rainfall patterns might be shifting, rising temperatures could be affecting evaporation from soils and transpiration of moisture from vegetation, St. George says, affecting how much water ultimately makes it into the river and its tributaries. Humans have also been impacting that influx of water through changes in land use and agricultural practices, he says. “I think [the new study’s] explanation is plausible—and it’s possible,” he adds. “But I think it’s also true that we need some more information to really sort out whether human modification—river engineering—is the only thing that may have pushed the Mississippi River floods to be more severe.” The uncertainty over these factors kept Muñoz and his colleagues from addressing the climate change question in this study, but he says they hope to do so in future work. One way to approach this, St. George says, is to look toward the upper reaches of the Mississippi, which are subject to less management. If flooding has increased significantly over long time periods on the river’s northern stretch, it would point to climate as the bigger driver, he notes, whereas minimal change would implicate river engineering. Whichever turns out to be the main culprit, the Mississippi’s levees, spillways and other human-made structures are not likely to go away anytime soon—particularly because there is still excess capacity to handle high water flows—Colten says. The Morganza Spillway in Pointe Coupee Parish, La., for example, has only been opened twice: once in 1973 and again in 2011. Until that excess capacity is exhausted, Colten says it is unlikely the state or the Corps will fundamentally alter their approach to the river. “Decisions about managing the river are very much a human undertaking,” he says. “We have to know the size, we have to know the hydrology and the physics of rivers, but…those decisions are financial and political and regional, and don’t have a lot to do with the science.”","Human meddling with the river is blamed for most of the rise in flood levels, but the role of climate remains unclear -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com",2018-04-10T10:45:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",Taming the Mighty Mississippi May Have Caused Bigger Floods,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/taming-the-mighty-mississippi-may-have-caused-bigger-floods/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/6AB41048-9FEF-4A17-B4A149AF52C8B8C8_agenda.jpg?w=600&h=335,,Scientificamerican.com,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 People in China can pay with their phones to enter make-up rooms, complete with cosmetics
A new trend of ""shareable make-up rooms"" aimed at urban women is igniting debate in China, as companies try new ways to grab a slice of the world's largest market for beauty products.
The rooms represent a new frontier in China's vast sharing economy. Some think they are an affordable way to get to use expensive make-up, while others shudder at the thought of sharing a lipstick with a stranger. 
Although they have been springing up in many Chinese cities since late last year, a recent opening in eastern Wuhan has prompted a flood of discussion online.
But how do you use one, and are they likely to take off elsewhere? 
How do they work?
Using their phones, customers scan a Quick Response (QR) code to pay a small fee, and enter a room with a chair and dressing table. 
An array of beauty products is spread out on the table, including products from high-end Western brands.
Users can help themselves to a range of products: moisturisers, powders, eye shadows and lipsticks. The room also provides brushes and other application tools for people to use.

 Users can help themselves to a variety of make-up products
Products in the Wuhan store are worth an estimated 4,000 yuan ($590; £460), according to the Chutian Metropolis Daily newspaper, so it is not surprising that CCTV watches over users as they beautify themselves.
It costs a small amount to use one of the rooms from anywhere between 15 and 45 minutes. In the Wuhan branch, the maximum a customer can expect to spend in one sitting is 58 yuan ($8.50; £6.70). 
How are they viewed?
Young women who have tried the rooms and who the BBC spoke to had mostly positive impressions.
""I thought the shared make-up room was great, a very creative idea and a very novel invention,"" said Ms Liu, a woman in her twenties from Wuhan. Though she added: ""I may not go often because I don't think they're very practical.""
Another in Shanghai said she would use them again, because she felt her skin was especially damaged and she needed to have access to high-end products. 
Online comments suggested a more mixed response.
Image copyrightPear VideoImage caption
 Ms Feng told Pear Video that she would go back if make-up rooms provided authentic products
Some on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo service said that they thought the concept would make money because it allows people to try products without ""being bombarded by servicewomen at make-up counters"", or forced into an expensive sale for something that might not be right for them. 
One user in eastern Shandong province said she thought the room was ""good"", especially as disposable application tools were provided. 
But others have concerns about the idea of sharing certain make-up products with strangers. 
""Lipstick, for example, lots of people will use - that's not very hygienic,"" one Wuhan-based user told the Pear Video website. 
""Cosmetics are personal items, I can't really accept this,"" another said. Others expressed concern about contracting viruses or skin conditions.
Chinese shareable make-up pods could ultimately attract up to 80 customers a day, one seller told the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper. But at present just a handful of people are visiting.

 Ms Hu said that while the pods were a good idea in principle, sharing products like lipsticks was ""unhygienic""
Are they really a new concept?
Self-contained shareable make-up pods are still a relatively novel idea, and they have only begun appearing in China since October 2018. They are largely being set up by private companies, not the cosmetic brands themselves, and are now found in major Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Nanjing. 
Large public dressing rooms offering similar services have been around in Japan and South Korea since as early as 2014. 
The concept is part of a wave of shareable products that have hit the Chinese market in recent years. Well-known services include shareable bikes and phone chargers; but the country is also home to more obscure rentable goods, including umbrellas and basketballs. 
China promotes shareable technologies for having both economic and environmental benefits, and in the case of luxury brands, helping Chinese users distinguish between fake and real goods in an increasingly saturated market. 
So will they take off?
It is entirely possible, given the surging spending power of urban consumers and their willingness to spend their disposable cash on cosmetic products.
Research from OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants says that China has the largest skincare market in the world, worth US$22bn, followed by the US. 
Chinese women, according to the group's findings, have added more steps and products to their daily beauty routine in recent years, with the average Chinese woman surveyed having a 6 or 7-step daily skincare regime before applying make-up. Some had as many as nine daily steps. 
Pascal Martin, a partner at the company, says China has a ""massive [cosmetics] market with massive growth opportunity"". 
""International brands used to be dominant; it's a market in which everyone is competing,"" he says. ""Yet, you can see Chinese brands gaining share year after year."" 
The appeal of young, fresh-faced celebrities like the popular TFBoys band has also led to a surge in spending on skincare products, with consumers splashing out on products because of the associations with their favourite icon.

 The male beauty industry is also taking off in China
So-called ""little fresh meats"", men who have delicate or feminine features, have become key influencers among young, urban Chinese and are known to team up with local cosmetics brands.
Social media platforms have also seen a rising trend of video make-up tutorials.
And with young Chinese increasingly working longer hours outside the home, and spending more time online, the concept of a shareable make-up room may well prove desirable.
But Pascal Martin says that they are still in the experimental stage, and he is not convinced they will see mass take-off. 
He says that concerns about hygiene could pose a significant risk.
""It is not impossible that the promoters of this concept may have convinced investors to put money in it, even if the concept is not bullet-proof.
""There are many examples in China of original concepts that suddenly take off with the backing of massive venture capital, and then hit reality before scaling down or disappearing.""

Jeff Mason,"HAVELOCK/WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday promised that North and South Carolina would have strong federal support as they recovered from the devastation of Hurricane Florence, whose floodwaters continue to threaten the region. “We’re going to be there 100 percent,” Trump told officials at a briefing shortly after arriving at the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina. “... There will be nothing left undone. You’ll have everything you need.” Trump, who has been criticized for his handling of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, also thanked first responders for their work since Florence made landfall on Friday and recapped the efforts to get food to residents and restore power. He was accompanied by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Federal Emergency Management Agency chief Brock Long, Senators Richard Burr and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott of South Carolina. More than 15,000 people remain in shelters and more than 200,000 customers are without power across North Carolina because of Florence, which came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, according to state officials. Although the storm is long gone, river flooding still poses a danger to the area. The Cape Fear River was expected to crest at 61.5 feet (19 meters), four times its normal height, on Wednesday in Fayetteville, a city of 200,000 near the Fort Bragg army base in the southern part of the state, according to the National Weather Service. That has disrupted efforts to restore power, clear roads and allow evacuated residents to go home. “There is a strong potential that those who live within the 1-mile evacuation area of the Cape Fear River will be impacted by flooding,” the city said in a statement. The city manager told CNN that 12,000 people are “in harm’s way.” Florence has killed at least 36 people, including 27 in North Carolina, eight in South Carolina and one in Virginia. Two of the South Carolina victims were mental health patients who drowned on Tuesday when a van carrying them was swept away by floodwater. SWOLLEN RIVERS Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas. Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage resulting from Florence, which has dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina since Thursday. At least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage, with three others set to crest in the coming days in North Carolina, the state said. In the town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, which has struggled to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, only about 50 residents remained on Tuesday, Fair Bluff Police Chief Chris Chafin told Reuters. The town has largely been cut off by flooding from the still-rising Lumber River, which was expected to crest on Wednesday. As Florence was bearing down on the Carolinas last week, Trump reignited the controversy over his handling of Maria by disputing the official death toll of 2,975 in the U.S. territory, which was compiled by public health experts at George Washington University. Trump said, without offering evidence, that Democrats had inflated the figure to make him look bad. Maria also devastated the infrastructure of Puerto Rico, whose 3 million citizens are Americans but do not vote in presidential elections, and left much of the island without power for months. Critics said the Trump administration was slow to recognize the extent of the damage and slow to help. Former basketball star Michael Jordan, a native of Wilmington, North Carolina, and the principal owner of the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association, donated $2 million to the Florence recovery effort, the team said.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Rivers and waterways, swollen after Florence’s historic deluge, rose dangerously across the Carolinas on Tuesday, closing roads, inundating communities, hindering rescue and repair efforts and preventing evacuees from returning home. Though slow-moving Florence has moved into the U.S. northeast, allowing glimpses of sunlight in the waterlogged state, at least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage with three others set to crest in the coming days, the state said. “One thing we know is that sunshine doesn’t necessarily mean safety,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a late-afternoon press conference and warned the 15,000 residents living in shelters against returning home too soon. More than 1,100 roads were still closed across North Carolina, Cooper said, including several portions of Interstates 40 and 95. Florence, which made landfall on Friday as a Category 1 hurricane before it was downgraded, has already killed at least 33 people, including 26 in North Carolina and six in South Carolina. One person was killed in Virginia when the storm spawned some 16 tornadoes there on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. The White House said President Donald Trump would visit North Carolina on Wednesday. He was criticized for his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico last year, and more recently for disputing the official death toll of 3,000. ‘DRIVING NOT ADVISED’ In the town of Fair Bluff, North Carolina, which has struggled to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Matthew in 2016, only about 50 residents remained on Tuesday, Fair Bluff Police Chief Chris Chafin told Reuters. The town has largely been cut off by flooding from the still-rising Lumber River, which was expected to crest on Wednesday. “I haven’t been home since it started. I can’t get home either,” Chafin said. Much of Columbus County, where Fair Bluff is located, was under water, according to Steve Abbott of the North Carolina Department of Transportation, with most roads closed and “driving not advised.” The Cape Fear River was also expected to keep rising in Fayetteville, a city of 200,000 in the southern part of the state near the Fort Bragg army base, according to the National Weather Service. That has hampered efforts to restore power, clear roads and allow residents to homes. Florence dumped more than 8 trillion gallons (30 trillion liters) of rain on North Carolina, the weather service said. “Road conditions are starting to improve in some parts of our state but rising creeks, streams and rivers continue to make travel unsafe,” Cooper said. Brock Long, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, appeared with Cooper and said his agency would help restore power and open roads. “I think the next 48 hours are going to be incredibly critical,” he said. THOUSANDS OF RESCUES In South Carolina, 40 major roads were closed. Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage after Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain on the state since Thursday. Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas, and more than 650 people were taken to safety in and around Wilmington, North Carolina, said Barbi Baker, a spokeswoman for New Hanover County. The coastal city took a direct hit when Hurricane Florence came ashore and has been largely cut off since then due to storm surges and flooding from the Cape Fear River. More than 324,000 customers, mostly in the Carolinas, were without power on Tuesday, according to power companies, down from a peak of nearly 1 million outages. North Carolina estimated on Tuesday 3.4 million poultry birds and 5,500 hogs died in the storm, exceeding the number killed in the state’s last major hurricane two years ago. Property damage from the storm is expected to range from $17 billion to $22 billion, the risk management firm Moody’s Analytics said. Further flooding could push up that figure.

Natasha Lomas,"London-based edtech startup, pi-top, has unboxed a new flagship learn-to-code product, demoing the “go anywhere” Pi-powered computer at the Bett Show education fare in London today.
Discussing the product with TechCrunch ahead of launch, co-founder and CEO Jesse Lozano talked up the skills the company hopes students in the target 12-to-17 age range will develop and learn to apply by using sensor-based connected tech, powered by its new pi-top 4, to solve real world problems.
“When you get a pi-top 4 out of the box you’re going to start to learn how to code with it, you’re going to start to learn and understand electronic circuits, you’re going to understand sensors from our sensor library. Or components from our components library,” he told us. “So it’s not: ‘I’m going to learn how to create a robot that rolls around on wheels and doesn’t knock into things’.
“It’s more: ‘I’m going to learn how a motor works. I’m going to learn how a distance sensor works. I’m going to learn how to properly hook up power to these different sensors. I’m going to learn how to apply that knowledge… take those skills and [keep making stuff].”
The pi-top 4 is a modular computer that’s designed to be applicable, well, anywhere; up in the air, with the help of a drone attachment; powering a sensing weather balloon; acting as the brains for a rover style wheeled robot; or attached to sensors planted firmly in the ground to monitor local environmental conditions.
The startup was already dabbling in this area, via earlier products — such as a Pi-powered laptop that featured a built in rail for breadboarding electronics. But the pi-top 4 is a full step outside the usual computing box.
The device has a built-in mini OLED screen for displaying project info, along with an array of ports. It can be connected to and programmed via one of pi-top’s other Pi-powered computers, or any PC, Mac and Chromebook, with the company also saying it easily connects to existing screens, keyboards and mice. Versatility looks to be the name of the game for pi-top 4.
pi-top’s approach to computing and electronics is flexible and interoperable, meaning the pi-top 4 can be extended with standard electronics components — or even with Littlebits‘ style kits’ more manageable bits and bobs.
pi-top is also intending to sell a few accessories of its own (such as the drone add-on, pictured above) to help get kids’ creative project juices flowing — and has launched a range of accessories, cameras, motors and sensors to “allow creators of all ages to start learning by making straight out of the box”.
But Lozano emphasizes its platform play is about reaching out to a wider world, not seeking to lock teachers and kids to buying proprietary hardware. (Which would be all but impossible, in any case, given the Raspberry Pi core.)
“It’s really about giving people that breadth of ability,” says Lozano, discussing the sensor-based skills he wants the product to foster. “As you go through these different projects you’re learning these specific skills but you also start to understand how they would apply to other projects.”
He mentions various maker projects the pi-top can be used to make, like a music synth or wheeled robot, but says the point isn’t making any specific connected thing; it’s encouraging kids to come up with project ideas of their own.
“Once that sort of veil has been pierced in students and in teachers we see some of the best stuff starts to be made. People make things that we had no idea they would integrate it into,” he tells us, pointing by way of example to a solar car project from a group of U.S. schoolkids. “These fifteen year olds are building solar cars and they’re racing them from Texas to California — and they’re using pi-tops to understand how their cars are performing to make better race decisions.”
pi-top’s new device is a modular programmable computer designed for maker projects
“What you’re really learning is the base skills,” he adds, with a gentle sideswipe at the flood of STEM toys now targeting parents’ wallets. “We want to teach you real skills. And we want you to be able to create projects that are real. That it’s not block-based coding. It’s not magnetized, clipped in this into that and all of a sudden you have something. It’s about teaching you how to really make things. And how the world actually works around you.”
The pi-top 4 starts at $199 for a foundation bundle which includes a Raspberry Pi 3B+,16GB SD card, power pack, along with a selection of sensors and add-on components for starter projects.
Additional educational bundles will also launch down the line, at a higher price, including more add ons, access to premium software and a full curriculum for educators to support budding makers, according to Lozano.
The startup has certainly come a long way from its founders’ first luridly green 3D printed laptop which caught our eye back in 2015. Today it employs more than 80 people globally, with offices in the UK, US and China, while its creative learning devices are in the hands of “hundreds of thousands” of schoolkids across more than 70 countries at this stage. And Lozano says they’re gunning to pass the million mark this year.
So while the ‘learn to code’ space has erupted into a riot of noise and color over the past half decade, with all sorts of connected playthings now competing for kids’ attention, and pestering parents with quasi-educational claims, pi-top has kept its head down and focused firmly on building a serious edtech business with STEM learning as its core focus, saving it from chasing fickle consumer fads, as Lozano tells it.
“Our relentless focus on real education is something that has differentiated us,” he responds, when asked how pi-top stands out in what’s now a very crowded marketplace. “The consumer market, as we’ve seen with other startups, it can be fickle. And trying to create a hit toy all the time — I’d rather leave that to Mattel… When you’re working with schools it’s not a fickle process.”
Part of that focus includes supporting educators to acquire the necessary skills themselves to be able to teach what’s always a fast-evolving area of study. So schools signing up to pi-top’s subscription product get support materials and guides, to help them create a maker space and understand all the ins and outs of the pi-top platform. It also provides a classroom management backend system that lets teachers track students’ progress.
“If you’re a teacher that has absolutely no experience in computer science or engineering or STEM based learning or making then you’re able to bring on the pi-top platform, learn with it and with your student, and when they’re ready they can create a computer science course — or something of that ilk — in their classroom,” says Lozano.
pi-top wants kids to use tech to tackle real-world problems
“As with all good things it takes time, and you need to build up a bank of experience. One of the things we’ve really focused on is giving teachers that ability to build up that bank of experience, through an after school club, or through a special lesson plan that they might do.
“For us it’s about augmenting that teacher and helping them become a great educator with tools and with resources. There’s some edtech stuff they want to replace the teacher — they want to make the teacher obsolete. I couldn’t disagree with that viewpoint more.”
“Why aren’t teachers just buying textbooks?” he adds. “It takes 24 months to publish a textbook. So how are you supposed to teach computer science with those technology-based skills with something that’s by design two years out of date?”
Last summer pi-top took in $16M in Series B funding, led by existing founders Hambro Perks and Committed Capital. It’s been using the financing to bring pi-top 4 to market while also investing heavily in its team over the past 18 months — expanding in-house expertise in designing learning products and selling in to the education sector via a number of hires. Including the former director of learning at Apple, Dr William Rankin.
The founders’ philosophy is to combine academic expertise in education with “excellence in engineering”. “We want the learning experience to be something we’re 100% confident in,” says Lozano. “You can go into pi-top and immediately start learning with our lesson plans and the kind of framework that we provide.”
“[W]e’ve unabashedly focused on… education. It is the pedagogy,” he adds. “It is the learning outcome that you’re going to get when you use the pi-top. So one of the big changes over the last 18 months is we’ve hired a world class education team. We have over 100 years of pedagogical experience on the team now producing an enormous amount of — we call them learning experience designers.”
He reckons that focus will stand pi-top in good stead as more educators turn their attention to how to arm their pupils with the techie skills of the future.
“There’s loads of competition but now the schools are looking they’re [asking] who’s the team behind the education outcome that you’re selling me?” he suggests. “And you know what if you don’t have a really strong education team then you’re seeing schools and districts become a lot more picky — because there is so much choice. And again that’s something I’m really excited about. Everybody’s always trying to do a commercial brand partnership deal. That’s just not something that we’ve focused on and I do really think that was a smart choice on our end.”
Lozano is also excited about a video the team has produced to promote the new product — which strikes a hip, urban note as pi-top seeks to inspire the next generation of makers.
“We really enjoy working in the education sector and I really, really enjoy helping teachers and schools deliver inspirational content and learning outcomes to their students,” he adds. “It’s genuinely a great reason to wake up in the morning.”","London-based edtech startup, pi-top, has unboxed a new flagship learn-to-code product, demoing the “go anywhere” Pi-powered computer at the Bett Show education fare in London today.

Andrew C. Scott,"Fire is one of the most important forces on Earth. The use of fire by humans has long been considered as a defining property of intelligence, separating us from other animals. The exact timing of the discovery and use of fire by humans has been a subject of continuing research, yet perhaps two questions have, until now, received little attention: What was fire on Earth like before humans appeared? And what experience of fire could early humans have had? Three main components are needed for fire. First, there must be a fuel to burn. Second, oxygen must be available — after all, combustion is essentially an oxidation process that gives off heat and light. And third, there must be a heat or ignition source that allows the fire to begin. We would not expect fire on a barren Earth; there must be plant life on land that can provide a fuel source. And vegetation fires can’t occur until the oxygen level in the atmosphere has reached around 15%. (It is 21% today.) This is why we smother a fire with a blanket or sand, pump carbon dioxide on it, or even flood it with water to extinguish it — to cut off the oxygen. The main sources of ignition before humans appeared were lightning strikes. Our evidence of fire in the fossil record (in deep time, as we often refer to the long geological stretch of time before humans) is based mainly on the occurrence of charcoal. This is the partially combusted plant material left after a fire has been extinguished. The oldest fire recorded on Earth has been identified from charcoal in rocks formed during the late Silurian Period, around 420 million years ago. Though plants had spread on land at that point, fluctuating levels of atmospheric oxygen meant that the first extensive wildfires recorded came somewhat later, dating from around 345 million years ago, the early Carboniferous Period. We know that there were also periods through Earth history when oxygen levels in the atmosphere were higher than today. During these times, fires would have been hotter and more frequent. One of these high-fire intervals occurred during the later stages of the Cretaceous, when dinosaurs ruled the Earth and flowering plants first appeared. New research suggests that many plants that have adapted well to a fiery landscape or indeed need fire to reproduce, such as some pines, eucalypts and proteas, first appeared around this time, some 90 million years ago. But it was the spread of grasses and grasslands such as the savannas of Africa, around 7 million years ago, that made a big impact, not only on the environment but also on the animals living there. Computer modeling suggests that savannas need regular fire, or else the vegetation may convert to scrub and forest. In this context, early humans living on the savannas would often have seen fire on the landscape, and the first “discovery” would have involved seeing and following the fire. Charred, dead animals and plants left in its wake may have been collected, and animals that were fleeing the fire ambushed and killed. Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter The first stage of human interaction with fire, perhaps as early as 1.5 million years ago in Africa, is likely to have been opportunistic. Fire may have simply been conserved by adding fuel, such as dung that is slow burning. A fire would have been useful not only for light and warmth at night, but to frighten off predatory animals, and the smoke would have been effective in keeping insects away. This ability to “stretch” fire was a novel feat, only developed by humans. So much we can reasonably speculate. But finding evidence of the earliest regular use of fire is fraught with difficulty, as identifying ancient hearths is not always straightforward. Individual occurrences are also of limited use; there needs to be evidence from multiple sites. There are claims for such evidence from sites in southern Africa that are over a million years old, such as the Wonderwerk Cave in Northern Cape Province. Clear evidence of habitual use of fire, though, comes from caves in Israel dating back between 400,000 and 300,000 years ago, and include the repeated use of a single hearth in Qesem Cave, and indications of roasting meat. The next stage was to gain the ability to start a fire. This would have enabled more regular and managed use, allowing the development of cooking, expanding our diet. According to British primatologist Richard Wrangham, cooking may have played a role in the expansion of our brains. The hearth would have probably formed a social focus, helping the development of language. The use of flints to start fire may have occurred as far back as 400,000 years ago, but concrete evidence only comes from as recently as 40,000 years ago. As the American archeologist Andrew Sorensen and his colleagues have put it, “we archaeologists have yet to ascertain, even in coarse chronological terms — when in our early prehistory fire became part of the human tool kit.” The British archeologist John Gowlett has described the discovery of fire by humans as a convoluted process that took place over a long period of time. The third stage, in which humans began to use and control fire on a regular and widespread basis, may have started only 7,000 years ago. This may have included the use of fire for land clearance for agriculture and even for warfare. But even when humans were controlling fire to the extent that it could be used to modify agriculture, we should not lose sight of the fact that wildfire is predominantly controlled by climate. Today we humans appear to be confident of our ability to control fire. But we should not become overconfident. The spread of non-native grasses such as Gamba grass in Australia and Cheat grass in North America, together with a warming climate, are having a severe impact on the nature, scale and frequency of wildfires. It would be well for us to take on board the fact that fire has been part of Earth’s story for the past 420 million years, and will continue to be so long after we are all gone. Andrew C. Scott is author of the new book Burning Planet published by Oxford University Press, co-author of Fire on Earth: An Introduction published by Wiley and co-editor of The Interaction of Fire and Mankind published by the Royal Society.",The exact timing of the discovery and use of fire by humans has been a subject of continuing research,2018-06-01T14:00:30Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",When Did Humans Discover Fire?

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Cosby became a global star in the 1980s Bill Cosby was once known to millions as ""America's Dad"", but the comedian now faces several jail terms after being convicted of sexual assault. His role as the benevolent, jumper-wearing Dr Cliff Huxtable in 1980s hit sitcom The Cosby Show made him a national treasure in the US. But more than a dozen women accused Cosby of misconduct, and one case made it to court. The jury failed to reach a verdict in June 2017, but a retrial led to his conviction less than a year later. How did this man, a household name for so long in America, rise and fall so far? How did his career begin? Born in 1937 in a housing project in Philadelphia to parents who were far from financially well-off, the young William Henry Crosby Jr shone shoes and worked at a local supermarket to help his family make ends meet. His early life was touched by tragedy when one of his four brothers died and he, the oldest, became a father figure. Accounts of his school years portray a joker and a storyteller who loved to entertain his classmates. After school he joined the US Navy, then went to university and had a part-time job as a bartender. It was here that he found his way in to comedy, filling in for a club comedian and laying the path for his future fame. His debut on NBC's The Tonight Show in 1963 led to a recording contract with Warner Brothers, and the release of a series of award-winning comedy albums. On one of those, 1968's To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With, he established the themes that would define his work - the father as a loving disciplinarian; siblings who could plot together one minute, then scream blue murder the next; and a confidence in the bonds of family. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cosby, shown here in 1973, began his career in the nightclubs of Greenwich Village The album sleeve noted: ""During his time on stage, Cosby never once told a joke. He didn't sing or dance or do tricks. All he did was talk"" - but the performer had the 10,000-strong audience in the palm of his hand throughout. By the time the album was released, Cosby was already a TV star. What boundaries did Cosby break as a black actor? In 1965, he had become the first black actor to star in a drama series, when he was cast in the espionage show I Spy. He played Alexander Scott, an undercover agent posing as a tennis instructor, alongside Robert Culp, who played fellow agent Kelly Robinson. Cosby wasn't originally in line for the role, which was intended for an older actor, but producer Sheldon Leonard had been wowed by the comedian's stand-up routine and decided to rewrite the show as a buddy comedy. Premiering during a time of great upheaval for race relations in the US, it was banned by some stations in the southern states. But Cosby went on to earn three consecutive best actor Emmys for his role - a record that still stands. Image copyright Rex Features Image caption Although black actors had appeared in TV comedies before, Cosby's role in the primetime drama I Spy was groundbreaking Despite his prominence on TV, Cosby made a conscious decision not to directly address race relations in his act - preferring a more subtle challenge to the status quo. ""A white person listens to my act, and he laughs, and he thinks: 'Yeah, that's the way I see it, too,'"" he once said. ""OK. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right? ""So I figure this way, I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next guy."" The Cosby Show, which was launched by NBC in 1984 and aired for eight seasons, was his biggest success and established him as a household name. Based on his stand-up routines, Cosby's portrayal of an educated, affluent doctor - Heathcliff ""Cliff"" Huxtable - and the trials of raising five young children drew parallels with his own life. His TV wife, Claire, was loosely based on his own wife Camille, whom he married in 1964. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Bill Cosby's wife Camille has stood by him One of the most popular shows of the 1980s, the sitcom was watched by about 30 million viewers each week. By 1989, its star was earning $4m (£2.5m) a month in syndication rights alone. When the show was cancelled in 1992, Cosby embarked on a number of projects including film roles, but was never able to emulate the success of his star vehicle. In 2013, he received rave reviews for his first TV stand-up show in 30 years, which led to a national tour. But his comeback fell apart as several women came forward with allegations of sexual assault going back almost 30 years. What were the allegations? The accusations first surfaced in 2005, when Andrea Constand, a staff member at Cosby's former university, said she had been drugged and molested by the star at his home a year earlier. Prosecutors declined to press charges, citing lack of evidence, but Ms Constand filed a civil case against the comedian. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Due to statute of limitations law, Andrea Constand was the only alleged sex assault victim who could bring charges against Cosby Thirteen women, 12 of whom remained anonymous, agreed to be witnesses, each with a similar account of sexual assault. Cosby denied the accusations, which his lawyer called ""preposterous"", and the case was settled out of court in 2006 for an undisclosed sum. In subsequent years, some of Ms Constand's fellow witnesses came forward and told their stories to the media. But the accusations were not comprehensively reported until Cosby's planned TV comeback thrust him back into the limelight. More than 50 women accused the star of sexual assault or rape, but due to time limits on cases in the US, only one - Andrea Constand - took the case to criminal court. Cosby's lawyers consistently denied the charges, calling them a ""media frenzy"" and asking why the women had not made legal complaints at the time when they said they were assaulted. In 2014 Cosby said he had not addressed the allegations in public because ""a guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos"". But shortly afterwards, previously unseen court papers from 2005 came to light and showed he had admitted obtaining sedatives to give to young women he wanted to have sex with. The sedatives, called Quaaludes, render people unable to move. The accusations disrupted his hopes of a return to show business. Cable station TV Land pulled repeats of The Cosby Show, some of his stand-up shows were called off and protesters showed up to the ones that he still put on. His statue was removed from the MGM Hollywood Studios park in Florida, and several colleges removed honorary degrees they had given him. Image copyright Don Murray/Getty Images Image caption Cosby addressing Temple University students at a commencement ceremony in 2003 His portraits were taken down from the walls in his alma mater, Temple University in Philadelphia, and he resigned from the board of trustees. What happened when the case came to criminal court? At first, it appeared unlikely that criminal action would be taken against Cosby for any of the alleged incidents, partly because the statute of limitations applies to cases of rape and sexual assault in most US states. That means there is a time limit on cases. However, one case came to criminal trial: that of Andrea Constand. The case was seen as one of the biggest US celebrity court case since the murder trial of former American football player OJ Simpson in 1995. In June 2017, Ms Constand told her story in court for the first time, having previously been barred from doing so due to a 2006 settlement. She said Cosby had given her pills that he claimed were herbal and said would ""take the edge off"", but which left her ""frozen"". ""In my head, I was trying to get my hands to move or my legs to move, but I was frozen"", she said. About 20 minutes later, she said, he put his hand on her genitals. ""I wasn't able to fight it in any way,"" she told the court. ""I wanted it to stop."" Cosby continued to deny the allegations. He did not give evidence in court but had one witness. In the end, with Cosby possibly facing the rest of his life in prison if found guilty, the jury was deadlocked, and a mistrial was declared in June 2017. How was the retrial different? The retrial, which began on 9 April, took place in a changed atmosphere. A flood of sexual misconduct accusations starting last October against powerful men in the entertainment industry such as Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey triggered the #MeToo movement. The Cosby trial became one of the first celebrity trials of the #MeToo era, and the decision by the judge to allow five more women to testify against him was seen as a key development. On this occasion, the jury of five women and seven men took two days to find the comedian guilty on all three counts of sexual assault. Now he faces up to 10 years in jail for each count.

MARGERY A. BECK / AP,"(OMAHA, Neb.) — Authorities were using boats and large vehicles on Saturday to rescue and evacuate residents in parts of the Midwest where a recent deluge of rainwater and snowmelt was sent pouring over frozen ground, overwhelming creeks and rivers, and killing at least one person.
Rescue efforts in eastern Nebraska were hampered by reports of levee breaches and washouts of bridges and roads, including part of Nebraska Highway 92, leading in and out of southwest Omaha. Authorities confirmed that a bridge on that highway that crosses the Elkhorn River had been washed out Saturday. In Freemont, west of Omaha, the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office issued a mandatory evacuation for some residents after floodwaters broke through a levee along the Platte River. And in Mills County, Iowa, authorities ordered people in some rural areas to evacuate after the Missouri River overtopped levees.
The flooding followed days of snow and rain — record-setting, in some places — that swept through the West and Midwest. The deluge pushed some waterways, including the Missouri River, to record levels in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota. The flooding was the worst in nearly a decade in places.
The family of farmer James Wilke, 50, of Columbus, Nebraska, said he was killed Thursday when a bridge collapsed as he was using his tractor to try to reach stranded motorists on Thursday. His body was found downstream, his cousin Paul Wilke told the Columbus Telegram. Gass Haney Funeral Home confirmed James Wilke’s death.
At least two other people were missing in floodwaters in Nebraska. Officials said a Norfolk man was seen on top of his flooded car late Thursday before being swept away in the water and another man was swept away by waters when a dam collapsed on the Niobrara River.
Officials in Sarpy County, south of Omaha, said Saturday that power may be shut off to communities along the Missouri, Platte and Elkhorn rivers for safety reasons. They warned those who choose to ignore calls to evacuate that rescues would be attempted only during daylight hours. Some cities and towns, such as North Bend on the banks of the Platte River, were submerged. Others, such as Waterloo and Freemont, were surrounded by floodwaters, stranding residents in virtual islands with no access in or out.
“There is no way out of here unless you’ve got a helicopter — or a boat,” the Rev. Mike Bitter, pastor of Christian Church of Waterloo, told the Omaha World-Herald.
Officials in western Iowa and eastern Nebraska were urging people not to drive unless necessary. In Iowa, a section of northbound Interstate 29 that runs parallel to the Missouri River was closed due to flooding. Authorities were rerouting motorists at Kansas City, Missouri, using a detour that took people almost 140 miles (225 kilometers) out of the way.
Farther east, the Mississippi River saw moderate flooding in Illinois from Rock Island south to Gladstone. Meteorologist Brian Pierce with the National Weather Service’s Quad Cities office in Davenport, Iowa, said flooding on the Mississippi could get worse a few weeks as more snow melts in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
“What we’re having now is the dress rehearsal for the main event that’s going to happen in early April,” he said of the flooding on the Mississippi.
Rising waters along the Pecatonica and Rock rivers flooded some homes in the northern Illinois cities of Freeport, Rockford and Machesney Park. The National Weather Service said record crests were possible along the rivers, with water levels forecast to continue to rise over the next several days and remain above flood stage through most of the weekend.
Freeport resident Mary Martin told the (Freeport) Journal-Standard that she went to the store to get milk and bread when she saw floodwaters were rising Friday.
“Within an hour of going to the store, I could not get back in. That’s how fast the water was coming up,” Martin said.

"USA TODAY, John Bacon, USA TODAY","A man pauses in front of a tombstone as volunteers lay holiday wreaths at graves in Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery on Wreaths Across America Day, in Arlington, Virginia, Dec. 15, 2018. (Photo: MICHAEL REYNOLDS, EPA-EFE) The latest round of persistent rain drenching the soggy East has triggered another annual record and brought fears of more flooding to the battered Carolinas. Washington's Reagan National Airport recorded more than 3 inches of rain since it began raining Friday. That pushed the annual total to more than 61.5 inches, breaking the record of 61.33 inches set in 1889, said Alan Reppert, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather. Charleston, WVa, broke a record set in 2003, totaling 63.29 inches. Baltimore, swamped by more than 2.8 inches of rain, tallied more than 68 inches for the year. The city had already broken its annual record set 15 years ago. Wilmington, North Carolina, which already smashed its record of 83.65 inches in 1877, reached new heights by crawling just over 100 inches. ""As Wilmington breaks the 100-inch milestone with this event, let's pray the new record stands for another 140 years, and for a much drier 2019,"" the local National Weather Service office tweeted. The December storms come on the heels of a record-setting November for the Northeast. Cornell University's Northeast Regional Climate Center reports that Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Atlantic City and Wilmington, Del., all had their wettest November on record this year. AccuWeather senior meteorologist Alan Reppert said the next few days should be dry in the region. But there is bad news rolling in behind the respite projections call for wetter-than-normal weather for the next few months. ""We've had a lot of flow from the southwest coming out of the Gulf of Mexico,"" Reppert said. ""We can attribute much of the moisture to that."" In the Southeast, residents living along many swollen rivers are bracing for flooding in coming days, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said. Rivers from northern Florida to North Carolina are at minor or moderate flood stage because of rain in the area Friday through Sunday. Many of the areas are still recovering from Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 storm that tore through the region in September. More than 50 people were killed; damage was in the billions. ""Areas in eastern North Carolina and northeastern South Carolina, which were hard hit a few months ago by Hurricane Florence, are among the communities dealing with flooded rivers,"" Pydynowski said.

Philip Marcelo / AP,"(BOSTON) — Over-pressurized natural gas lines were the source of deadly explosions and fires that rocked communities north of Boston last month, the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday. The five-page, preliminary report found that utility workers contracted by Columbia Gas had failed to account for critical pressure sensors as they replaced century-old cast-iron pipes in Lawrence on Sept. 13. That omission caused high-pressure gas to flood the neighborhood’s distribution system at excessive levels, triggering more than 80 explosions and fires across the city, as well as neighboring North Andover and Andover. One person was killed and about 25 others were injured in the ensuring chaos. The gas explosions also damaged 131 structures and destroyed five homes. Thousands of homes and businesses are still without natural gas service as Columbia Gas replaces some 50 miles of gas pipeline. The work is about one-third complete, and the company says all customers should have gas service by Nov. 19. Joe Hamrock, president of NiSource, Columbia Gas’ parent company, said in a statement that it is prohibited from comment or speculating on the cause of the incident until the federal investigation is complete. But he noted that in the hours immediately after the incident, the utility company suspended similar work elsewhere and improved its procedures around low-pressure gas systems like the one in Lawrence. “We saw these as responsible steps to take in the aftermath of the incident and while the facts were being gathered,” Hamrock said. U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said it’s still not clear how Columbia Gas could have allowed the disaster to happen, whether it could have been prevented and whether the company was adequately prepared to respond to a disaster on that scale. “The release of the preliminary report raises more questions than answers,” said Markey, who, along with Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has been reviewing the company’s internal procedures following the explosions. The National Transportation Safety Board, in its report, says the disaster was rooted in failures at the planning stages of the Lawrence pipeline project, which was developed and approved by Columbia Gas. The agency said the work package didn’t account for “regulator sensing lines,” which it says are used to detect pressure in the distribution system so that regulators can control system pressure. Federal investigators also noted that the utility’s monitoring center in Columbus, Ohio, received two alerts registering high pressure in the Lawrence system just minutes before the explosions. The Ohio facility isn’t able to close or open valves remotely but quickly relayed the high-pressure report to field technicians in Massachusetts, the report said. Local utility officials shut down the impacted regulator within about a half an hour, and closed the critical gas distribution values about three hours later, according to the report. The next stage of the federal investigation will look at coordination between the emergency responders and Columbia Gas and an analysis of the company’s engineering, design and construction plans, according to the report. Gov. Charlie Baker, meanwhile, said the state Department of Public Utilities will hire an independent evaluator to assess the safety of the state’s pipelines. It has ordered all natural gas pipeline operators in the state to review their procedures on “pressure regulation, overpressure protection, energizing new and replacement pipelines, and tie-ins involving high pressure to low pressure distribution systems.”",Over-pressurized natural gas lines were the source of the deadly explosions and fires that rocked communities north of Boston last month,2018-10-12T02:50:18Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Over-Pressurized Gas Lines Caused the Deadly Explosions Near Boston, Federal Report Says",http://time.com/5422846/boston-gas-explosions-pressurized-lines/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/gettyimages-1033115548.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Samuel Axon,"Apple Music on iOS 10, with Senior VP Eddy Cue. reader comments 1 Apple has always been known as a hardware company, and it still is, but services are more important to its strategy and bottom line than ever before. That point was driven home not just by the most recent Apple earnings report—in which CEO Tim Cook identified services as a division ripe for a doubling of revenue by 2020—but also by a talk by Apple SVP Eddy Cue at SXSW this week. Interviewed by CNN’s Dylan Byers, Cue talked about Apple News, the tensions between open and closed platforms, and the company's TV and video strategy. Many of the statements he made seemed carefully crafted to distinguish Apple from other tech giants that have been the subjects of criticism in recent months. Cue heads Apple's software and services efforts, and he took the stage in Austin moments after Apple announced it would acquire Texture, a magazine distribution app that has been repeatedly called the ""Netflix of magazines"" by numerous press outlets. Texture only has a few hundred thousand subscribers at last report. But Apple Music—born out of the Beats acquisition and iTunes—has reached 38 million subscribers, with two million added just last month. Cue also said that eight million people are currently participating in the three-month free trial Apple offers of the service. Chief competitor Spotify had 70 million as of January. Apple's services are growing, but what does the company have planned? Cue offered some insights. Doing TV like Pixar does movies With regards to the TV strategy, Cue said ""we're not after quantity; we're after quality,"" as Apple's team of 40 or so, led by former Sony execs, works to strategically spend more than $1 billion on original programming. Cue compared the company's approach to that of Pixar (another company with close ties to Steve Jobs). Meanwhile, Netflix is employing a strategy that increasingly looks like throwing everything it can grab at the wall of user taste and seeing what sticks—though some of what sticks is quite good. Netflix is reportedly spending as great as six times as much on original content as what Apple plans to spend in 2018. We still don't know exactly where Apple's TV efforts will fit into its services, though. Will they be offered as part of Apple Music or another service altogether? If the former, will Apple Music be rebranded? Cue didn't speak about any of that. However, he did say that Apple has no plans to buy either Netflix or Disney, specifying that the company prefers to focus on acquisitions of companies, products, and technologies that will be key in the future, not on expensive acquisitions of companies that are already well established. Apparently, Beats was an exception. The Guardian reported not long before the acquisition that Beats headphones accounted for about 64 percent of all headphones sold at prices above $100 in the United States. “A lot of the issues going around” The topic of the session was ""Curation in Media""—a subject that seems relevant given the Texture acquisition. As such, Cue also discussed Apple News, and again, he was careful to differentiate Apple's philosophy from those of Google or Facebook. When asked about competitors' strategies, Cue chose words that were polite and restrained while still carrying a critical subtext, saying, ""it's always hard to sit from the outside and talk about others"" and ""when you have a large platform, there's a lot of responsibility."" Of Apple News, he said, ""We want the best articles, we want them to look amazing, and we want them to be from trusted sources... so we don't have a lot of the issues going around."" Cue is likely alluding to a whole host of challenges Google and Facebook have recently faced, from unverified news reports appearing in users' feeds and search results to bots and algorithmically-driven echo chambers. That fits well with his choice of words in the Texture acquisition announcement: ""We are committed to quality journalism from trusted sources."" CNN's Byers asked Cue about his thoughts on the open platform philosophy espoused by Google and Facebook. Cue pointed to iTunes—specifically podcasts—as an example of Apple leading the way on curation efforts, seeking a middle ground. Advocates of open platforms often talk of democratization, but they also bring up concerns about free speech with regards to closely curated, closed platforms. This is sometimes framed in contrast to activists who have pressed Twitter and other companies to clamp down on hate speech. ""Hate speech is not free speech,"" Cue said. He added that nobody is completely free: ""There are no pornography on these sites. So people do draw lines on these sites. We do think free speech is very important, but we don't think white supremacy or hate speech is important speech to be out there."" Byers took a leap to press further by noting that the NRA has an app on Apple's App Store. Cue responded by explaining that the NRA app does not violate Apple's publicly available policies for app submissions, that there are pro-gun control apps, too, and that you can't buy guns through apps on the App Store. All of these statements painted a consistent picture: the leadership at Apple believes the company will close the flood gates and curate better video and better journalism, while other tech companies struggle with the challenges and contradictions deeply inherent in the ideals of the open Web. Apple has long sought to offer alternatives to the open Web for a variety of reasons, and as its focus on services grows over the next two years, that will still be the philosophy. This moment makes sense to drive that point home. Even Tim Berners-Lee, who is often credited as one of the founders of the World Wide Web, published an op-ed this week arguing that the dream of the open Web is already compromised by gatekeepers like Facebook and Google, even as he remains committed to ""making sure the Web is a free, open, creative space—for everyone."" It seems Cue is tapping into the current discussions and climate to differentiate Apple from its besieged competitors, at least when it comes to public opinion.","The talk covered news, music, App Store curation standards, and TV programming.",2018-03-14T11:15:10Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}","At SXSW, Apple’s Eddy Cue uses Google and Facebook’s struggles to set Apple apart",https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/03/at-sxsw-apples-eddy-cue-uses-google-and-facebooks-struggles-to-set-apple-apart/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/apple-music-ios-10-640x215.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major, fast-moving winter storm is racing across the country this weekend, bringing forecasts of heavy snow from California to New England and threats of heavy rain and severe thunderstorms along the 2,500-mile path.
The storm was poised to create major travel delays, including some flight cancellations, as it moves swiftly across the country.
In parts of the Midwest, the snow  falling at up to 1 or 2 inches per hour  could pile up fast enough to strand motorists along major highways, AccuWeather warns.   
Sections of  Pennsylvania, New York and northern and western New England could see up to a foot of snow.
The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings Saturday for parts of Colorado, northern New Mexico, southern Wyoming and much of Kansas. 
Snow was expected to move into the Central Rockies on Saturday and develop over parts of the Northern and Central Plains by Saturday evening, the NWS says. The snow will expand into parts of the Southern Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley overnight as it rolls eastward.
The National Weather Service map shows the probability of snow from a weekend storm March 2-3, 2019.

By Sunday morning, some parts of the northern Plains could see wind chills nearing 55 degrees below zero. A few spots could see all-time record cold temperatures for March, the weather service predicted.
The weather service calls the cold ""dangerous."" In portions of Montana, this will be the coldest temperatures of the entire winter season as actual temperatures dip to 40 below. The level of cold will also be more typical of late-January than early March.
Minneapolis could see a high temperature of only 2 degrees on Sunday.
Near-freezing temperatures will then spread as far south as Florida by early next week.

At least 7 people are dead from the storm, and early Saturday there are still 2.3 million customers without power in 12 states across the Northeast. Numerous roads were closed due to debris, fallen trees and power lines -- including lanes on I-95 outside of Washington, D.C. Rail service across the Northeast was impacted significantly with Amtrak suspending all service on the Northeast Corridor line. A pedestrian walks near the coastline Friday, March 2, 2018, in Newburyport, Mass. as a major nor'easter pounds the East Coast, packing heavy rain, intermittent snow and strong winds. The Eastern Seaboard is expected to be buffeted by wind gusts exce Several communities in Massachusetts are completely in the dark Saturday morning. There were 381,000 customers without power in the state as of 6 a.m. Widespread street flooding was reported in eastern Massachusetts with storm surge reported to be as high as 3 feet. Numerous water rescues were performed, especially in Quincy, Massachusetts, where the National Guard was performing rescues into the night. Top rainfall totals came in East Bridgewater, Massachusetts, which received 5.74 inches, while Cobleskill, New York, set the high mark with 39.3 inches of snow. Barnstable, Massachusetts, saw the highest wind gust on Friday at 93 mph, while Boston saw a 70 mph gust and New York's JFK Airport measured one at 67 mph. Coastal flood alerts are in place from Virginia Beach up to the Maine coast. As the storm slowly pulls away, the primary concern Saturday morning is more coastal flooding from Virginia to Maine during the high-tide cycles. The Boston Harbor rose to 14.67 feet on Friday, marking the third-highest on record there. Another high tide near 14.6 feet is forecast around noon today. Along Cape Cod, the high tide today will reach near major flood stage, and will once again be in the top-3 crests on record. The radar and satellite Saturday morning is showing precipitation has moved offshore with only a few showers and snow bands left over the Northeast. Gusts will reach 30 to 40 mph across much of the Northeast. While the storm is several hundred miles away, wind gusts could reach 30 to 50 mph through much of the day Saturday across the northeast U.S., including all the major cities along the I-95 corridor. The strong gusty winds will hamper recovery efforts -- especially in restoring power. On Sunday, the storm is gone and winds will be even calmer. Western storm dumping snow, rain In this photo provided by the Heavenly Mountain Resort, fresh snow covers most of a table and chairs Friday, March 2, 2018, in South Lake Tahoe, Calif. A blizzard warning was in effect for parts of the Sierra Nevada. A strong storm system riding a frontal boundary is moving through the western U.S. on Saturday morning. It will bring more rain to the California coast and more snow from the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the northern Rockies. Mammoth Mountain in California has recorded 48 inches of snow over the last three days. They could receive another foot before the storm moves out of the western U.S. Additional snow totals of 2 to 3 feet are expected in the southern Sierra Nevada today. In Southern California, heavy rain is still possible on the hillsides. This could cause some flooding on streets. Snowfall totals up to 18 inches are expected in the highest elevations of Los Angeles and Ventura counties through Saturday. Strong winds will move through Las Vegas today with gusts up to 65 mph. An additional 2 to 3 feet of snow is possible in the Sierra Nevada Mountains on Saturday. Locally 6 to 12 inches of snow is expected in the northern Rockies over the next few days. The storm will then move to the central U.S. and bring more snow to the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest, where locally over 6 inches of snow is possible on Monday. Heavy snow will fall in the northern Rockies and over to the Twin Cities through Monday.","The major nor'easter that brought intense rain, wind and snow to the Northeast on Friday is moving out to sea today.

Gita Jackson,"Watching other people play games can be just as fun as playing them, but finding a good Let’s Play can be hard. Here’s a few that are worth your time. Metal Gear Solid 3 — Chip and Ironicus These two have been playing games together on video since college. While Chip usually takes Ironicus on a kind of guided tour of a game, showing him secrets and sharing development info, the two often get lost on tangents and come up with running gags. You could basically watch anything they’ve done, but I really like their playthrough of Metal Gear Solid 3. Just like the game, their commentary is off-kilter, very silly, and blast from beginning to end. For example, early in the game they pick up a frog, name him Mission J. Frog, and tell the viewers that this frog has a special mission. That mission is to be used as a distraction in a late boss fight, where he is electrocuted to death. RIP Mission J. Frog. Sim City 4 — Strictoaster Strictoaster only players simulations games, and he especially likes city building games. In his non-YouTuber life he’s a graphic designer, so his approach to these games is more about making a beautiful city than a efficient one. There’s something mesmerizing about his process—he’ll sometimes make an entire intersection for 45 minutes, decide he hates it, and then rebuild it, like he eventually does in this Sim City 4 LP. What’s most satisfying about that is he always ends up being right about his design choices. Urban centers and suburbs really are prettier once you add trees and flowers, and intersections are worth slaving over. Assassin’s Creed II — Geop I tried to get into Assassin’s Creed, but I ended up wanting to know more about the history than about Assassins and Templars. Good thing Geop’s Assassin’s Creed LPs are full of facts. Although his LP of the first game is still really informative, his Assassin’s Creed II playthrough is really slick, with some edited inserts to highlight the architecture and culture of the Renaissance in Italy. I especially liked when he pointed out how the in-game maps were historically wrong. I guess the Animus can’t get everything right. Usually Let’s Plays involve watching hours upon hours of video footage with someone talking over the top. Not so with Boatmurdered, a Let’s Play of Dwarf Fortress. This comes from a thread on the Something Awful forums, where a series of users would take over a save file from Dwarf Fortress and play it for an in-game year. They all have wildly different approaches to playing, and also to presenting how they played their run. Some are straightforward diaries, others are written as dwarves, and another in character a Dungeons &amp; Dragons nerd that’s been kicked out of his mother’s basement. As is typical for games of Dwarf Fortress, they are plagued by rampaging elephants and die in a flood of magma. Oxygen Not Included — Brothgar When you learn a game’s systems inside and out, sometimes it’s fun to try and push it past its limits. That’s what Brothgar often does with Oxygen Not Included, one of the base building games he Let’s Plays. In this massive playlist of the different challenges and experiments he’s done in the game, he’ll throw you some science and engineering facts and pull out a spreadsheet or two. This massive knowledge base comes in handy when he starts the Mega Base Challenge, where he tries to make the biggest, most technologically impressive base in a game that’s mostly about resource management and failure. It’s a delight. MODE — Supergreatfriend Some Let’s Plays you watch because you like the personality of the player. Some you watch because the game is just weird. Supergreatfriend specializes in these kinds of games, and his playthrough of MODE is where he really shines. He gives a lot of context for this bizarre 1996 FMV game’s development and history. MODE bills itself as “an intriguing interactive drama on CD-ROM,” that takes place at a highfalutin art party. Throughout the playthrough, Supergreatfriend points out the technical limitations of the format that makes the interactions with other characters so strange, as well as some of the history of FMVs and their decline. He also has a wry, subtle sense of humor that gets a chuckle out of me. Superman64 — Proton Jon Superman64 is one of the worst games of all time, and at the beginning of this LP, Proton Jon admits to kind of liking it. Not because it’s good, of course, but because it’s fun to dive in and break it. This LP funny and informative, and there’s a bit of a mystique to it. It started in 2010, only hit stage four in 2011 when Kotaku editor in chief Stephen Totilo wrote about it, and last year finally made it to stage nine. There are 16 stages in this game. I can’t wait until he finishes this in the year 2087. Batman: Arkham Asylum — Batman9502 Batman9502 is a hidden gem on YouTube. He puts out a slow stream of high-quality LPs with great commentary, and a genuine mastery of the games he plays, along with real enthusiasm for them. Near the end of the Arkham Asylum, there’s a sequence where Batman walks through a crowd of applauding henchmen. One could feasibly ignore this and it wouldn’t affect anything, but Batman9502 chooses to fight—for the sole reason that it’s fun. “I gotta do it!” he says. The excitement in his voice is palpable. — Seung Park Metal Gear Solid 2 — James Howell James Howell is a writer and translator who wrote “ Driving Off The Map,” a critical essay about Metal Gear Solid 2 that I consider to be the best piece of games criticism ever written. He’s also really, really good at video games. This Big Boss rank playthrough of Metal Gear Solid 2 is astounding and James explains his strategies in detail while also taking time to provide off the cuff analysis. It’s the perfect combination and makes for one hell of a Let’s Play. —Heather Alexandra Pathologic — Marshall Dyer Thematically, I love horror games, but I am also a massive chicken when it comes to actually playing them. Let’s Plays are a nice way of softening the terror; everything is a little less scary when you have someone else freaked out with you. But, I don’t want said person hamming it up for the camera, yelling and screaming at every tipped coffee cup. Pathologic is a fascinating game that I will one day muster up the courage to play, but until then, Marshall Dyer’s series has been my way of seeing that game play out. I’m still working through his Let’s Play, but his soothing voice eases the dreariness of the world. Dyer is really good at offering in-the-moment critique, like you’re sitting on a couch watching a friend play and having a casual conversation about the game. He gets into character while reading the text as well, and with a voice made for radio, Dyer really draws you in with it. —Eric Van Allen","Watching other people play games can be just as fun as playing them, but finding a good Let’s Play can be hard.

Winni Zhou,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s central bank injected a record $83 billion into the country’s financial system on Wednesday, seeking to avoid a cash crunch that would put further pressure on the weakening economy. 
China’s policymakers are pledging to step up stimulus measures this year and do more to protect jobs as economic growth cools to 28-year lows. 
But a raft of measures last year from big rail projects to tax cuts seem to have had little impact so far, with recent data suggesting activity is cooling more quickly than expected. 
“The news is clear - the economy needs help,” said Trinh Nguyen, senior economist for emerging Asia at Natixis in Hong Kong. 
Wednesday’s open-market operation, the bank’s largest net single-day injection on record, came a day after China’s state planner, central bank and finance ministry all offered reassurances to investors, signaling more spending and other types of policy support. 
But shockingly weak December trade data released earlier this week, along with shrinking factory activity, are stirring speculation over whether more rapid and aggressive policy measures are needed to turn the world’s second-largest economy around. 
Authorities now agree the economy needs more decisive support “and today’s large injection reflects that,” Nguyen added. 
The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said Wednesday’s injection was aimed at ensuring there are ample funds in the financial system, which is facing strains as tax payments peak in mid-January, and as demand for cash picks up ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays starting in early February. 
“The banking system’s overall liquidity is falling rapidly,” it said in a statement. 
While sizable injections are common this time of year ahead of the long holidays, the addition was much heftier than usual and follows a large cut in banks’ reserve ratios announced this month, which will free up a total of $116 billion for new bank lending. 
The first stage, a 50-basis-point cut, came into effect on Tuesday. An equal-sized cut is scheduled for Jan. 25. 
The move also came a day after money supply data showed several of China’s key credit gauges continue to languish around record lows, despite government efforts to channel more funds to cash-starved companies and lower their financing costs. 
While authorities have urged banks to keep lending to struggling firms and even dangled incentives, banks are wary of bad loans after a long regulatory crackdown on riskier lending. 
Many businesses, facing slowing sales, are in no mood to make the fresh investments that Beijing is counting on. New medium- and long-term corporate loans last month fell to less than half of average December levels, Nomura noted. 
MORE HELP ON THE WAY 
Chinese officials have repeatedly pledged more support for the economy while vowing they will not resort to “flood-like” stimulus that Beijing has unleashed in the past, which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt. 
Asked if the PBOC needed to cut benchmark interest rates, a PBOC deputy said on Tuesday that existing policy measures should be improved. 
Analysts at OCBC said the comments suggest the PBOC is willing to give existing measures time to work, and is in no rush to switch to more aggressive tactics at this point. 
“I have never seen such huge amounts of reverse repos ... the central bank is making its attitude known,” said a trader at a brokerage house in Shanghai. 
“It’s saying, ‘don’t question my determination’” to stabilize market expectations, the trader said. 
Markets appear to agree that policymakers will stick with modest measures for some time yet. 
Chinese stocks and money market rates, sensitive to hints of policy shifts, were little changed on Wednesday. The seven-day repo rate, CN7DRP=CFXS, a closely watched measure of liquidity, was 2.6142 percent on Wednesday afternoon, slightly lower than the previous day’s close. 
“While the (PBOC’s) net injection is big, it’s little versus what a rate cut would release, which is what people in the market are watching for,” said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho in Hong Kong. 
WEAKEST GROWTH IN 3 DECADES 
In a rare encouraging sign, home prices remained buoyant in December, suggesting that at least some of Beijing’s efforts at support are beginning to have an effect. Construction also appears to be slowly picking up as regulators fast-track approvals of more infrastructure projects. 
But analysts agree steps so far will take some time to percolate through the broader economy, with most not expecting activity to convincingly bottom out until summer. 
On Monday, China is expected to report the economy grew 6.6 percent in 2018, cooling from 6.9 percent the previous year and the slowest rate of expansion the country has seen in 28 years. 
The pace is expected to slow further to around 6.2 percent this year. Some analysts’ in-house models suggesting activity is already much weaker than official data suggests.

Darkening the picture further, hopes are dimming once again that China will be able to reach a trade deal with the United States in current negotiations. U.S. tariffs have increasingly weighed on Chinese exports in recent months, disrupting its supply chains and dragging down business and consumer confidence. 
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer did not see any progress made on structural issues during U.S. talks with China last week, Republican U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley said on Tuesday.

Witness videos obtained by Reuters news agency showed heavy rain swelling the San Gabriel River in nearby Georgetown and overflowing into a park. Flooding was also seen upstream in Kingsland, Texas, where a bridge collapsed. At least one person has died from the flooding. Local authorities warned residents to evacuate promptly on Tuesday due to strong currents threatening homes and businesses in the area. Meanwhile forecasters told residents along the Llano River in central Texas to seek higher ground after more than 250mm of rain fell in only 36 hours. The National Weather Service warned that the river at Llano, about 105km northwest of Austin, rose to near record levels on Tuesday morning. In 24 hours, the river rose to 12 metres, some 10m higher than the day before, and around 5.5m above major flood stage. The record crest level is 12.6m set in June 1935. A flash flood warning was put into effect, and forecasters described it as a ""very dangerous situation"". It is not expected to drop below major flood stage until later on Wednesday.

Sunshine is expected for much of the nation through Sunday. Sunshine is expected for most of the nation, including the southwest, Southern Rockies and most of the central part of the country. A relatively weak frontal system will bring some increasing clouds to parts of the eastern U.S., but precipitation should remain light and confined to the interior Northeast. The only notable active weather pattern remains in the western part of the country. A pair of systems are making their way to the region this weekend -- arriving late Saturday and lasting into early Monday -- and it will bring the next round of rain, mountain snow and some wind from central California to Washington State. This is the only region of the country where there is a possibility of some travel delays over the weekend. In central and northern California, winds will increase out ahead of the systems. There is a potential for some accumulation in the mountain passes during this timeframe, which could hamper travel in some areas. These aforementioned patterns may also aggravate river flooding in some areas. The West Coast will experience a wet Monday. Sunday may be a stormy day along the West Coast of the U.S. The Skagit River in Washington State, which has been in flood stage the last several days, saw its banks in Lyman experience some erosion. The flooding threatened some homes in the area on Friday. The river hit its highest level since 2006 on Thanksgiving Day. Rivers in western Washington remain elevated this weekend due to the heavy rainfall the region has received over the last several weeks. In the Pacific Northwest, windy conditions will develop Saturday night, with gusts possibly over 45 mph. Another one to three inches of rain are expected through the weekend, which could continue to aggravate some of the river flooding. Given that the region has been hit with several wet storms over the last few weeks, the risk for possible landslides and hillsides will persist through the weekend. There may be up to one foot of snow in some parts of the country. Some of this moisture will make it down to Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo by Monday and Tuesday -- but precipitation accumulation is expected to be fairly light.

Chris Taylor,"It's Troll Week on Mashable. Join us as we explore the good, the bad, and the ugly of internet trolling. Fellow citizens of the internet, it's time to face facts: We are at war. An authoritarian nation state invaded our beloved platform with a shady shape-shifting army of paid writers, and did its best to populate it with highly divisive, truth-obscuring garbage. Now other authoritarian nation states are attempting to do the same. And because not enough of us are truly aware of this fact hey, who can blame us, it's really bizarre! we are losing the war. We aren't even using the right terminology to describe the problem, so how can we ever hope to fight back? Here's the issue in a nutshell: We seem to have collectively decided to call members of this shape-shifting army ""trolls."" That's exactly how they want us to think of them. The internet knows trolls: They annoy, they harass, they attack targets in swarms. They've always been with us, and always will be. What trolls don't do is systematically assume hundreds of fake identities or work toward a geopolitical goal on behalf of a foreign adversary. It would be more accurate to call these invaders undercover intelligence operatives. Or in a word, spies. Cold War Redux Because the nation state that started all this is Russia, we carry a set of historical assumptions that work against a clear-eyed assessment of the situation. We remember the Joseph McCarthy-led ""Red Scare"" of the 1950s as a shameful moment in American history, and rightly so. The bullying and blacklisting should never be forgotten. We also hear ""Russian spies"" and our minds go to James Bond, you know, campy undercover agents in tuxes and slinky dresses. Didn't we leave that all behind in the 1980s? Well, yes, we did. And then in 2000, a former East Berlin KGB agent named Vladimir Putin won a presidential election after a series of so-called terrorist bombings, about which intelligence experts remain dubious. Putin then made common cause with Russia's oil-rich oligarchs and thus began nearly two decades of murders, or assassination attempts, on opposition leaders and investigative journalists. The internet-based information warfare can be traced back to 2013. That's when the St. Petersburg Times first alerted the world to an entity in that city calling itself the Internet Research Agency, which was paying employees to flood the comments sections of stories about opposition leaders and Russia's rollback of rights for LGBT citizens. The IRA operatives ""react to certain news with torrents of mud and abuse,"" an activist named Vladimir Volokhonsky told the St. Petersburg Times. ""This makes it meaningless for a reasonable person to comment on anything there."" IRA activity ramped up in 2014, and crossed to U.S. shores for the first time that year where it made its first foray into fake news. This just so happened to coincide with the 2014 midterm elections for Congress. The IRA found every fresh wound in American society, stuck its finger in, and tugged. Via YouTube videos, tweets, and phone texts, the IRA convinced much of a Louisiana town that there had been an explosion in a nearby chemical factory. Seeing similar media three months later during the Ebola panic, Georgia voters believed that the flesh-eating virus had arrived in Atlanta. On the same day, a different fake video told of a black woman being gunned down by police. The IRA found every fresh wound in American society, stuck its finger in, and tugged. Via a fake account called Blacktivist, it encouraged a demonstration at the Confederate monument at Stone Mountain, Georgia. It created a Facebook group of ""2nd Amendment patriots"" and one called ""LGBT United;"" their Facebook ads received millions of impressions. The IRA designed hundreds of Twitter accounts to look like heartland newspapers, such as @KansasDailyNews, @JacksonCityPost, @MilwaukeeVoice and @StLouisOnline. To the IRA, the politics of these accounts didn't matter. All that mattered was the potential for havoc. SEE ALSO: An ad industry group nominated Russia's election hack for all the awards In 2015, the IRA faked a video of a U.S. soldier shooting a Qu'ran, likely hoping to cause an uproar in the Muslim world. It didn't even seem to matter that the video was disprovable when you looked closely the soldier's helmet was something you could buy online for $25, not Army issue. By the time viewers disproved it, the shape-shifting army of info-spies had moved on to its next issue. If you haven't heard of any of these greatest hits, it's because they have been drowned out by the controversy over the IRA's involvement in the 2016 presidential election. But the facts of each case are surprisingly clear. Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russia's role in the 2016 election, is famously silent on most things. But he has told us exactly what the IRA did next, in a damningly methodical indictment that named 12 major players his first and only Russia-related charges to date. (Separately, on Friday, the Justice Department indicted another IRA figure on information warfare charges related to the 2018 midterm elections showing clearly that the threat is not over yet.) Trolls provide cover While those first IRA forays were happening in the U.S., a parallel development was unwittingly helping to provide cover. Swarms of actual trolls (read: people, mostly men, with a grudge and too much time on their hands) emerged from sites such as 4Chan and Reddit. Spurred on by rising alt-right figures such as Milo Yiannopolous and Mike Cernovich, who were reportedly working to a playbook called Trust Me I'm Lying, these troll swarms saw diversity and feminism as the enemy. They brought us concentrated harassment campaigns such as GamerGate, ComicsGate, and the backlash against the all-female Ghostbusters reboot. The scale of the trolling was unprecedented, and it took some time for the internet to fully figure out what was going on. As the various hate-gates are studied and reassessed, there is a legitimate argument for defining their collective trolling as what Wired recently called ""domestic information terrorism."" But the Internet Research Agency activity is a different order of magnitude. We're talking international information terrorism: tens of thousands of accounts operated by paid individuals on every major web platform, each one given a quota of a hundred posts a day. We're talking hundreds of millions of users who saw these posts, thinking they were genuine. The full scale of the attack is still emerging, and the numbers keep going up. Last week alone, Twitter released a dataset with 10 million tweets and 2 million images from Russian-linked accounts going back to 2009. ""It is clear that information operations and coordinated inauthentic behavior will not cease,"" the company wrote. With an oligarch-funded budget of $1.25 million per month on one influence project alone, the thousand-strong IRA aimed ""to conduct what it called 'information warfare against the United States of America' through fictitious U.S. personas on social media platforms and other Internet-based media,"" the Mueller indictment says. Enter the Jedi Another reason to call this a spy campaign is the way that those fictitious personas tried to blend in. Last month, a study of a thousand Twitter accounts that attacked Star Wars director Rian Johnson concluded that 16 of them were IRA members. In January and February 2018, the accounts latched on to an early wave of criticism of Johnson's movie The Last Jedi, then ceded the stage to disgruntled fans. ""The KGB was pushing a specific ideology, and these guys aren't."" Those who noted that it was a small number of accounts, or claimed this was a way to smear everyone who disliked The Last Jedi as Russian operatives, missed the point. Which is that the shape-shifting army did not miss a single opportunity to jump into any debate that divided American society, even a debate about a movie. ""They're method acting,"" says Morton Bay, the Ph.D behind the Last Jedi study, who has been tracking what he calls ""Russian influence operatives"" since 2015. ""If the Grammys are on, these accounts will be commenting on it to give themselves a sense of legitimacy... they latch on to every cultural division, however small."" Such tactics, Bay concluded, were similar to those used by the infamous spy service where Putin cut his teeth. ""Their methods are very close to what the KGB was doing during the Cold War,"" Bay says. ""The only difference is the KGB was pushing a specific ideology, and these guys aren't."" Instead of ideology, the IRA aimed to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt. It consistently aimed to flood the zone with shit, to echo the infamous words of Steve Bannon. Fill the comments section of honest stories and harass their writers, and soon there'll be fewer honest stories. The same holds true for social media as a whole. They want to exhaust us to death. In a recent study, Hungarian security researcher Anatoly Reshetnikov described this process as ""neutrollization"" or ""creating conditions where political mobilization becomes absurd, so any risk to the regime is neutralized."" One of the few employees interviewed since leaving the IRA directly compared himself with Winston Smith in Nineteen Eighty-Four. Working there felt like ""you were in some kind of factory that turned lying, telling untruths, into an industrial assembly line."" Doesn't sound an awful lot like trolling, does it? Sounds like something worse. Sounds like information war. The internet strikes back Understandably, there is reluctance in the U.S. to describe any of these activities as acts of war. For one thing, many of us are employing a Cold War perspective: Don't antagonize the Russians! They're armed to the teeth! Do we really want to return to those dark decades of superpower conflict? To answer that question, we have to change our definition of what conflict actually is. And here we're dealing with another 20th century mindset: Aren't wars fought over physical territory ? Aren't they won with tanks and bombs? Propaganda's younger, hipper cousin, information terrorism, is now the most important weapon of war on the planet. Not since 9/11, no. As America learned painfully in Iraq, nation states are won and lost in the hearts and minds of the people. These days, the only wars that matter are in those minds, on the plain of ideas. Propaganda's younger, hipper cousin, information terrorism, is now the most important weapon of war on the planet. SEE ALSO: Twitter shuts down spambots spreading pro-Saudi hashtags related to Khashoggi disappearance We saw that clearly in the past week, as the kingdom of Saudi Arabia fought a desperate rear-guard action against reports that it had killed Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in its Turkish consulate. Twitter had to step in again to shut down bots that were flooding the online discussion with pro-Saudi hashtags. But it isn't just Russia and Saudi Arabia. Syria, Iran, China, North Korea: Everyone's getting into the info-war game. Of course, we shouldn't use the word ""war"" lightly. And thanks to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, the phrase ""info war"" is tainted but we also shouldn't shrink from using it. Allowing a state of war to exist in the shadows is exactly how Putin approached his invasion of Ukraine in 2014. The eastern half of the country came under assault from "" little green men "" Russian special forces that Russia denied belonged to them. The last thing he wanted was global economic sanctions, so that's exactly what we gave him. In the case of the IRA, no one is suggesting we ramp up tensions or rattle any nuclear sabers. This isn't a matter for the Pentagon. If this information war is being fought on the internet, then the internet is where we must fight back. If the object is to wear us down with lies, then we must not be worn down. If truth is under attack, then the truth is what we must protect. That means calling out bullshit whenever you see it, even if you see it all the time. It means maintaining skepticism about no-name news sources and oddly-named social media accounts. It means staying in touch with that crazy Trump-loving uncle who forwards the conspiracy theory emails; it means repeatedly speaking calmly and clearly about a Russian influence operation that is both ridiculous and demonstrably true. And it means that we stop using a cutesy word like ""trolling"" to describe a massive, coordinated, ongoing military-style affair. ""Don't feed the trolls"" is a piece of advice as old as the internet; to that truism we should add, ""Don't confuse the spies with trolls.""","It's Troll Week on Mashable.

(Photo: Gene J. Puskar, AP) A band of severe weather swept across the South on Friday evening, sprouting tornadoes, delivering golf-ball-sized hail in some areas and knocking out power to thousands of homes. The weather, attached to a strong cold front pushing from Texas to the Gulf Coast, was expected to continue early Saturday in the Southeast. One tornado reportedly touched down 8 miles north of Benton, La., just north of Shreveport, the Louisiana State Police told KSLA-TV, Shreveport. The Southwestern Electric Power Co., which serves western Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana and East Texas, reported nearly 11,000 customers without power Friday evening in areas such as Longview, Texas, and Shreveport. The National Weather Service issued several tornado warnings and at least one tornado emergency Friday evening as the storms moved through. A tornado emergency is a type of tornado warning that is only issued when there is a significant tornado threat to a highly populated area, according to AccuWeather.com. ► April 6: MLB serves up a frosty start to new season, more snow coming ► April 6: Weatherwise, it's already been a disastrous start to the year in the U.S. ► April 6: Snow could blanket Keeneland's spring opening weekend “This is a particularly dangerous situation. You are in a life-threatening situation,” the weather service said in the emergency alert issued for the area around Coushatta, La. Family members had to rescue one family from their home in Coushatta after a downed tree landed on the roof. Firefighters in that area needed a chainsaw to free their trucks from another downed tree, according to KSLA. “This storm’s packing a really big punch.” Jeff Castle, KSLA-TV, Shreveport, La. Meteorologists along the storm’s path urged residents to shelter from tornadoes and broadcast social-media video of hail pelting cars and homes. One area near Texarkana, Texas, saw 1,300 lightning strikes in 30 minutes, the TV station reported. “This storm’s packing a really big punch,” KSLA’s chief meteorologist Jeff Castle said Friday. Severe thunderstorms and possibly more tornadoes were expected overnight around New Orleans, southern Alabama and into the Florida panhandle, according to WeatherNation, a Web-based weather channel. In the West, businesses in Reno and Sparks, Nev., were piling up sandbags in anticipation of the Truckee River hitting about 1.5 feet over flood stage on Saturday morning. ► April 5: Record cold, snow for central, east U.S.; Pineapple Express soaks West ► April 5: Another busy, above average hurricane season, meteorologists say Northern California and Oregon are bracing for high winds Saturday after experiencing 2 inches of rain over 24 hours in some parts of Oregon, according to the National Weather Service.

Natasha Lomas,"Given all the hype and noise swirling around crypto and decentralized network projects, which runs the full gamut from scams and stupidity, to very clever and inspired ideas, the release of yet another whitepaper does not immediately set off an attention klaxon. But this whitepaper — which details a new protocol for achieving consensus within a decentralized network — is worth paying more attention to than most. MaidSafe, the team behind it, are also the literal opposite of fly-by-night crypto opportunists. They’ve been working on decentralized networking since long before the space became the hot, hyped thing it is now. Their overarching mission is to engineer an entirely decentralized Internet which bakes in privacy, security and freedom of expression by design — the ‘Safe’ in their planned ‘Safe Network’ stands for ‘Secure access for everyone’ — meaning it’s encrypted, autonomous, self-organizing, self-healing. And the new consensus protocol is just another piece towards fulfilling that grand vision. What’s consensus in decentralized networking terms? “Within decentralized networks you must have a way of the network agreeing on a state — such as can somebody access a file or confirming a coin transaction, for example — and the reason you need this is because you don’t have a central server to confirm all this to you,” explains MaidSafe’s COO Nick Lambert, discussing what the protocol is intended to achieve. “So you need all these decentralized nodes all reaching agreement somehow on a state within the network. Consensus occurs by each of these nodes on the network voting and letting the network as a whole know what it thinks of a transaction. “It’s almost like consensus could be considered the heart of the networks. It’s required for almost every event in the network.” We wrote about MaidSafe’s alternative, server-less Internet in 2014. But they actually began work on the project in stealth all the way back in 2006. So they’re over a decade into the R&amp;D at this point. The network is p2p because it’s being designed so that data is locally encrypted, broken up into pieces and then stored distributed and replicated across the network, relying on the users’ own compute resources to stand in and take the strain. No servers necessary. The prototype Safe Network is currently in an alpha testing stage ( they opened for alpha in 2016 ). Several more alpha test stages are planned, with a beta release still a distant, undated prospect at this stage. But rearchitecting the entire Internet was clearly never going to be a day’s work. MaidSafe also ran a multimillion dollar crowdsale in 2014 — for a proxy token of the coin that will eventually be baked into the network — and did so long before ICOs became a crypto-related bandwagon that all sorts of entities were jumping onto. The SafeCoin cryptocurrency is intended to operate as the inventive mechanism for developers to build apps for the Safe Network and users to contribute compute resource and thus bring MaidSafe’s distributed dream alive. Their timing on the token sale front, coupled with prudent hodling of some of the Bitcoins they’ve raised, means they’re essentially in a position of not having to worry about raising more funds to build the network, according to Lambert. A rough, back-of-an-envelope calculation on MaidSafe’s original crowdsale suggests, given they raised $2M in Bitcoin in April 2014 when the price for 1BTC was up to around $500, the Bitcoins they obtained then could be worth between ~$30M-$40M by today’s Bitcoin prices — though that would be assuming they held on to most of them. Bitcoin’s price also peaked far higher last year too. As well as the token sale they also did an equity raise in 2016, via the fintech investment platform bnktothefuture, pulling in around $1.7M from that — in a mixture of cash and “some Bitcoin”. “It’s gone both ways,” says Lambert, discussing the team’s luck with Bitcoin. “The crowdsale we were on the losing end of Bitcoin price decreasing. We did a raise from bnktothefuture in autumn of 2016… and fortunately we held on to quite a lot of the Bitcoin. So we rode the Bitcoin price up. So I feel like the universe paid us back a little bit for that. So it feels like we’re level now.” “Fundraising is exceedingly time consuming right through the organization, and it does take a lot of time away from what you wants to be focusing on, and so to be in a position where you’re not desperate for funding is a really nice one to be in,” he adds. “It allows us to focus on the technology and releasing the network.” The team’s headcount is now up to around 33, with founding members based at the HQ in Ayr, Scotland, and other engineers working remotely or distributed (including in a new dev office they opened in India at the start of this year), even though MaidSafe is still not taking in any revenue. This April they also made the decision to switch from a dual licensing approach for their software — previously offering both an open source license and a commercial license (which let people close source their code for a fee) — to going only open source, to encourage more developer engagement and contributions to the project, as Lambert tells it. “We always see the SafeNetwork a bit like a public utility,” he says. “In terms of once we’ve got this thing up and launched we don’t want to control it or own it because if we do nobody will want to use it — it needs to be seen as everyone contributing. So we felt it’s a much more encouraging sign for developers who want to contribute if they see everything is fully open sourced and cannot be closed source.” MaidSafe’s story so far is reason enough to take note of their whitepaper. But the consensus issue the paper addresses is also a key challenge for decentralized networks so any proposed solution is potentially a big deal — if indeed it pans out as promised. Protocol for Asynchronous, Reliable, Secure and Efficient Consensus MaidSafe reckons they’ve come up with a way of achieving consensus on decentralized networks that’s scalable, robust and efficient. Hence the name of the protocol — ‘ Parsec’ — being short for: ‘Protocol for Asynchronous, Reliable, Secure and Efficient Consensus’. They will be open sourcing the protocol under a GPL v3 license — with a rough timeframe of “months” for that release, according to Lambert. He says they’ve been working on Parsec for the last 18 months to two years — but also drawing on earlier research the team carried out into areas such as conflict-free replicated data types, synchronous and asynchronous consensus, and topics such as threshold signatures and common coin. More specifically, the research underpinning Parsec is based on the following five papers: 1. Baird L. The Swirlds Hashgraph Consensus Algorithm: Fair, Fast, Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Swirlds Tech Report SWIRLDS-TR-2016-01 (2016); 2. Mostefaoui A., Hamouna M., Raynal M. Signature-Free Asynchronous Byzantine Consensus with t &lt; n/3 and O(n 2 ) Messages, ACM PODC (2014); 3. Micali S. Byzantine Agreement, Made Trivial, (2018); 4. Miller A., Xia Y., Croman K., Shi E., Song D. T he Honey Badger of BFT Protocols, CCS (2016); 5. Team Rocket Snowflake to Avalanche: A Novel Metastable Consensus Protocol Family for Cryptocurrencies, (2018). One tweet responding to the protocol’s unveiling just over a week ago wonders whether it’s too good to be true. Time will tell — but the potential is certainly enticing. Bitcoin’s use of a drastically energy-inefficient ‘proof of work’ method to achieve consensus and write each transaction to its blockchain very clearly doesn’t scale. It’s slow, cumbersome and wasteful. And how to get blockchain-based networks to support the billions of transactions per second that might be needed to sustain the various envisaged applications remains an essential work in progress — with projects investigating various ideas and approaches to try to overcome the limitation. MaidSafe’s network is not blockchain-based. It’s engineered to function with asynchronous voting of nodes, rather than synchronous voting, which should avoid the bottleneck problems associated with blockchain. But it’s still decentralized. So it needs a consensus mechanism to enable operations and transactions to be carried out autonomously and robustly. That’s where Parsec is intended to slot in. The protocol does not use proof of work. And is able, so the whitepaper claims, to achieve consensus even if a third of the network is comprised of malicious nodes — i.e. nodes which are attempting to disrupt network operations or otherwise attack the network. Another claimed advantage is that decisions made via the protocol are both mathematically guaranteed and irreversible. “What Parsec does is it can reach consensus even with malicious nodes. And up to a third of the nodes being malicious is what the maths proofs suggest,” says Lambert. “This ability to provide mathematical guarantees that all parts of the network will come to the same agreement at a point in time, even with some fault in the network or bad actors — that’s what Byzantine Fault Tolerance is.” In theory a blockchain using proof of work could be hacked if any one entity controlled 51% of the nodes on the network (although in reality it’s likely that such a large amount of energy would be required it’s pretty much impractical). So on the surface MaidSafe’s decentralized network — which ‘only’ needs 33% of its nodes to be compromised for its consensus decisions to be attacked — sounds rather less robust. But Lambert says it’s more nuanced than the numbers suggest. And in fact the malicious third would also need to be nodes that have the authority to vote. “So it is a third but it’s a third of well reputed nodes,” as he puts it. So there’s an element of proof of stake involved too, bound up with additional planned characteristics of the Safe Network — related to dynamic membership and sharding (Lambert says MaidSafe has additional whitepapers on both those elements coming soon). “Those two papers, particularly the one around dynamic membership, will explain why having a third of malicious nodes is actually harder than just having 33% of malicious nodes. Because the nodes that can vote have to have a reputation as well. So it’s not just purely you can flood the Safe Network with lots and lots of malicious nodes and override it only using a third of the nodes. What we’re saying is the nodes that can vote and actually have a say must have a good reputation in the network,” he says. “The other thing is proof of stake… Everyone is desperate to move away from proof of work because of its environmental impact. So proof of stake — I liken it to the Scottish landowners, where people with a lot of power have more say. In the cryptocurrency field, proof of stake might be if you have, let’s say, 10 coins and I have one coin your vote might be worth 10x as much authority as what my one coin would be. So any of these mechanisms that they come up with it has that weighting to it… So the people with the most vested interests in the network are also given the more votes.” Sharding refers to closed groups that allow for consensus votes to be reached by a subset of nodes on a decentralized network. By splitting the network into small sections for consensus voting purposes the idea is you avoid the inefficiencies of having to poll all the nodes on the network — yet can still retain robustness, at least so long as subgroups are carefully structured and secured. “If you do that correctly you can make it more secure and you can make things much more efficient and faster,” says Lambert. “Because rather than polling, let’s say 6,000 nodes, you might be polling eight nodes. So you can get that information back quickly. “Obviously you need to be careful about how you do that because with much less nodes you can potentially game the network so you need to be careful how you secure those smaller closed groups or shards. So that will be quite a big thing because pretty much every crypto project is looking at sharding to make, certainly, blockchains more efficient. And so the fact that we’ll have something coming out in that, after we have the dynamic membership stuff coming out, is going to be quite exciting to see the reaction to that as well.” Voting authority on the Safe Network might be based on a node’s longevity, quality and historical activity — so a sort of ‘reputation’ score (or ledger) that can yield voting rights over time. “If you’re like that then you will have a vote in these closed groups. And so a third of those votes — and that then becomes quite hard to game because somebody who’s then trying to be malicious would need to have their nodes act as good corporate citizens for a time period. And then all of a sudden become malicious, by which time they’ve probably got a vested stake in the network. So it wouldn’t be possible for someone to just come and flood the network with new nodes and then be malicious because it would not impact upon the network,” Lambert suggests. The computing power that would be required to attack the Safe Network once it’s public and at scale would also be “really, really significant”, he adds. “Once it gets to scale it would be really hard to co-ordinate anything against it because you’re always having to be several hundred percent bigger than the network and then have a co-ordinated attack on it itself. And all of that work might get you to impact the decision within one closed group. So it’s not even network wide… And that decision could be on who accesses one piece of encrypted shard of data for example… Even the thing you might be able to steal is only an encrypted shard of something — it’s not even the whole thing.” Other distributed ledger projects are similarly working on Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (AFBT) consensus models, including those using directed acrylic graphs (DAGs) — another nascent decentralization technology that’s been suggested as an alternative to blockchain. And indeed AFBT techniques predate Bitcoin, though MaidSafe says these kind of models have only more recently become viable thanks to research and the relative maturing of decentralized computing and data types, itself as a consequence of increased interest and investment in the space. However in the case of Hashgraph — the DAG project which has probably attracted the most attention so far — it’s closed source, not open. So that’s one major difference with MaidSafe’s approach. Another difference that Lambert points to is that Parsec has been built to work in a dynamic, permissionless network environment (essential for the intended use-case, as the Safe Network is intended as a public network). W hereas he claims Hashgraph has only demonstrated its algorithms working on a permissioned (and therefore private) network “where all the nodes are known”. He also suggests there’s a question mark over whether Hashgraph’s algorithm can achieve consensus when there are malicious nodes operating on the network. Which — if true — would limit what it can be used for. “The Hashgraph algorithm is only proven to reach agreement if there’s no adversaries within the network,” Lambert claims. “So if everything’s running well then happy days, but if there’s any maliciousness or any failure within that network then — certainly on the basis of what’s been published — it would suggest that that algorithm was not going to hold up to that.” “I think being able to do all of these things asynchronously with all of the mathematical guarantees is very difficult,” he continues, returning to the core consensus challenge. “So at the moment we see that we have come out with something that is unique, that covers a lot of these bases, and is a very good use for our use-case. And I think will be useful for others — so I think we like to think that we’ve made a paradigm shift or a vast improvement over the state of the art.” Paradigm shift vs marginal innovation Despite the team’s conviction that, with Parsec, they’ve come up with something very notable, early feedback includes some very vocal Twitter doubters. For example there’s a lengthy back-and-forth between several MaidSafe engineers and Ethereum researcher Vlad Zamfir — who dubs the Parsec protocol “overhyped” and a “marginal innovation if that”… so, er, ouch. Well, I don't think asynchronous consensus on an order of events can be described as ""never been done before"" or ""a paradigm shift"". And it's not asynchronous, but ""very asynchronous"" or ""randomly synchronous"" [sic], and this synchrony assumption isn't very clearly documented — Vlad ''not giving away ETH'' Zamfir (@VladZamfir) May 31, 2018 Lambert is, if not entirely sanguine, then solidly phlegmatic in the face of a bit of initial Twitter blowback — saying he reckons it will take more time for more detailed responses to come, i.e. allowing for people to properly digest the whitepaper. “In the world of async BFT algorithms, any advance is huge,” MaidSafe CEO David Irvine also tells us when we ask for a response to Zamfir’s critique. “How huge is subjective, but any advance has to be great for the world. We hope others will advance Parsec like we have built on others (as we clearly state and thank them for their work). So even if it was a marginal development (which it certainly is not) then I would take that.” “All in all, though, nothing was said that took away from the fact Parsec moves the industry forward,” he adds. “I felt the comments were a bit juvenile at times and a bit defensive (probably due to us not agreeing with POS in our Medium post ) but in terms of the only part commented on (the coin flip) we as a team feel that part could be much more concrete in terms of defining exactly how small such random (finite) delays could be. We know they do not stop the network and a delaying node would be killed, but for completeness, it would be nice to be that detailed.” A developer source of our own in the crypto/blockchain space — who’s not connected to the MaidSafe or Ethereum projects — also points out that Parsec “getting objective review will take some time given that so many potential reviewers have vested interest in their own project/coin”. It’s certainly fair to say the space excels at public spats and disagreements. Researchers pouring effort into one project can be less than kind to rivals’ efforts. (And, well, given all the crypto Lambos at stake it’s not hard to see why there can be no love lost — and, ironically, zero trust — between competing champions of trustless tech.) Another fundamental truth of these projects is they’re all busily experimenting right now, with lots of ideas in play to try and fix core issues like scalability, efficiency and robustness — often having different ideas over implementation even if rival projects are circling and/or converging on similar approaches and techniques. “Certainly other projects are looking at sharding,” says Lambert. “So I know that Ethereum are looking at sharding. And I think Bitcoin are looking at that as well, but I think everyone probably has quite different ideas about how to implement it. And of course we’re not using a blockchain which makes that another different use-case where Ethereum and Bitcoin obviously are. But everyone has — as with anything — these different approaches and different ideas.” “Every network will have its own different ways of doing [consensus],” he adds when asked whether he believes Parsec could be adopted by other projects wrestling with the consensus challenge. “So it’s not like some could lift [Parsec] out and just put it in. Ethereum is blockchain-based — I think they’re looking at something around proof of stake, but maybe they could take some ideas or concepts from the work that we’re open sourcing for their specific case. “If you get other blockchain-less networks like IOTA, Byteball, I think POA is another one as well. These other projects it might be easier for them to implement something like Parsec with them because they’re not using blockchain. So maybe less of that adaption required.” Whether other projects will deem Parsec worthy of their attention remains to be seen at this point with so much still to play for. Some may prefer to expend effort trying to rubbish a rival approach, whose open source tech could, if it stands up to scrutiny and operational performance, reduce the commercial value of proprietary and patented mechanisms also intended to grease the wheels of decentralized networks — for a fee. And of course MaidSafe’s developed-in-stealth consensus protocol may also turn out to be a relatively minor development. But finding a non-vested expert to give an impartial assessment of complex network routing algorithms conjoined to such a self-interested and, frankly, anarchical industry is another characteristic challenge of the space. Irvine’s view is that DAG based projects which are using a centralized component will have to move on or adopt what he dubs “state of art” asynchronous consensus algorithms — as MaidSafe believes Parsec is — aka, algorithms which are “more widely accepted and proven”. “So these projects should contribute to the research, but more importantly, they will have to adopt better algorithms than they use,” he suggests. “So they can play an important part, upgrades! How to upgrade a running DAG based network? How to had fork a graph? etc. We know how to hard fork blockchains, but upgrading DAG based networks may not be so simple when they are used as ledgers. “Projects like Hashgraph, Algorand etc will probably use an ABFT algorithm like this as their whole network with a little work for a currency; IOTA, NANO, Bytball etc should. That is entirely possible with advances like Parsec. However adding dynamic membership, sharding, a data layer then a currency is a much larger proposition, which is why Parsec has been in stealth mode while it is being developed. “We hope that by being open about the algorithm, and making the code open source when complete, we will help all the other projects working on similar problems.” Of course MaidSafe’s team might be misguided in terms of the breakthrough they think they’ve made with Parsec. But it’s pretty hard to stand up the idea they’re being intentionally misleading. Because, well, what would be the point of that? While the exact depth of MaidSafe’s funding reserves isn’t clear, Lambert doesn’t sound like a startup guy with money worries. And the team’s staying power cannot be in doubt — over a decade into the R&amp;D needed to underpin their alt network. It’s true that being around for so long does have some downsides, though. Especially, perhaps, given how hyped the decentralized space has now become. “Because we’ve been working on it for so long, and it’s been such a big project, you can see some negative feedback about that,” as Lambert admits. And with such intense attention now on the space, injecting energy which in turn accelerates ideas and activity, there’s perhaps extra pressure on a veteran player like MaidSafe to be seen making a meaningful contribution — ergo, it might be tempting for the team to believe the consensus protocol they’ve engineered really is a big deal. To stand up and be counted amid all the noise, as it were. And to draw attention to their own project — which needs lots of external developers to buy into the vision if it’s to succeed, yet, here in 2018, it’s just one decentralization project among so many. The Safe Network roadmap Consensus aside, MaidSafe’s biggest challenge is still turning the sizable amount of funding and resources the team’s ideas have attracted to date into a bona fide alternative network that anyone really can use. And t here’s a very long road to travel still on that front, clearly. The Safe Network is in alpha 2 testing incarnation (which has been up and running since September last year) — consisting of around a hundred nodes that MaidSafe is maintaining itself. The core decentralization proposition of anyone being able to supply storage resource to the network via lending their own spare capacity is not yet live — and won’t come fully until alpha 4. “People are starting to create different apps against that network. So we’ve seen Jams — a decentralized music player… There are a couple of storage style apps… There is encrypted email running as well, and also that is running on Android,” says Lambert. “And we have a forked version of the Beaker browser — that’s the browser that we use right now. So if you can create websites on the Safe Network, which has its own protocol, and if you want to go and view those sites you need a Safe browser to do that, so we’ve also been working on our own browser from scratch that we’ll be releasing later this year… So there’s a number of apps that are running against that alpha 2 network. “What alpha 3 will bring is it will run in parallel with alpha 2 but it will effectively be a decentralized routing network. What that means is it will be one for more technical people to run, and it will enable data to be passed around a network where anyone can contribute their resources to it but it will not facilitate data storage. So it’ll be a command line app, which is probably why it’ll suit technical people more because there’ll be no user interface for it, and they will contribute their resources to enable messages to be passed around the network. So secure messaging would be a use-case for that. “And then alpha 4 is effectively bringing together alpha 2 and alpha 3. So it adds a storage layer on top of the alpha 3 network — and at that point it gives you the fully decentralized network where users are contributing their resources from home and they will be able to store data, send messages and things of that nature. Potentially during alpha 4, or a later alpha, we’ll introduce test SafeCoin. Which is the final piece of the initial puzzle to provide incentives for users to provide resources and for developers to make apps. So that’s probably what the immediate roadmap looks like.” On the timeline front Lambert won’t be coaxed into fixing any deadlines to all these planned alphas. They’ve long ago learnt not to try and predict the pace of progress, he says with a laugh. Though he does not question that progress is being made. “These big infrastructure projects are typically only government funded because the payback is too slow for venture capitalists,” he adds. “So in the past you had things like Arpanet, the precursor to the Internet — that was obviously a US government funded project — and so we’ve taken on a project which has, not grown arms and legs, but certainly there’s more to it than what was initially thought about. “So we are almost privately funding this infrastructure. Which is quite a big scope, and I will say why it’s taking a bit of time. But we definitely do seem to be making lots of progress.”","Given all the hype and noise swirling around crypto and decentralized network projects, which runs the full gamut from scams and stupidity, to very clever and inspired ideas, the release of yet another whitepaper does not immediately set off an attention klax…",2018-06-02T19:14:35Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Not just another decentralized web whitepaper?,http://techcrunch.com/2018/06/02/not-just-another-decentralized-web-whitepaper/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gettyimages-588616024.jpg?w=667,techcrunch,TechCrunch,flood-stage,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is well above May average rainfall of 115.6mm The Potomac River which forms part of the borders between Maryland and Washington DC is full to bursting in places. Water levels along the River could still crest at their highest levels in four years by Monday. The rain has been even heavier in Virginia. Richmond has had 209mm in the last four days. There was 95mm recorded on Saturday alone. That is just shy of the 95mm average May rainfall.

Jake Offenhartz,"First the historic flood. Then the noxious fumes. And while we'd braced ourselves for the next L train plague to be frog-related, according to one shaken commuter, we're now at the ""sky is literally falling"" stage of calamity.
Jumi, a Williamsburg resident who asked that we withhold her last name, tells Gothamist that she was inches away from being struck by a falling wooden board while waiting for the L train this morning. The board, which appeared to be emblazoned with the word ""hole,"" had apparently been separating the platform at Bedford Avenue from... some mystery space above. 
""I'm pretty shaken up,"" Jumi said. ""I feel I should buy a lotto ticket.""
Some #MTA workers were looking down the hole, didn’t say anything and disappeared. I waited several minutes for someone and no one came, so got on the next #Ltrain
— Jumi (@SrslyJumi) February 15, 2019
She added, ""It looked like a pretty solid piece of plywood. It made a huge bang. We all started running because there was a big dust cloud from the plaster. When the dust settled I was talking to people around me and they said it was maybe five inches from hitting me. I’m pretty sure a piece of rebar hit me but I was wearing a winter jacket.""
Other Twitter users corroborated Jumi's version of events.

Of course, this isn't the first time shit has crumbled and/or fallen dangerously onto subway platforms. This past summer, a partial ceiling collapse at the Borough Hall subway station rained debris down on one woman, leaving her with a concussion. 
But the distress of almost getting hit in the head by a falling board was compounded in this case, Jumi said, by the ongoing confusion L train riders have been forced to endure in recent months. 
""Day to day you can definitely feel like there’s dust in the air, so I guess the bigger frustration is that we don't know [what's happening] in terms of our safety,"" she said, referring both the recent mysterious odor situation and the ongoing fears about silica dust threatening riders under the new L train plan. ""I think I wouldn’t have been so angry if there had been more transparency coming from Cuomo’s office and the MTA.""
The MTA did not immediately respond to inquiries about this morning's incident. When asked last week about the air quality along the L line and dust at the Bedford Avenue station specifically, an MTA spokesperson said, ""air quality readings consistently have remained well within applicable safety guidelines.""
To cap off her Friday morning commute, Jumi soon found herself stuck underground on a different train. 
and now of course I have been stuck underground for the last 10mns on a stalled E train

Natashah Hitti,"British designer Es Devlin has transformed U2 's lead singer Bono into a giant avatar version of himself using augmented reality for the bands latest tour. The augmented reality (AR) spectacle forms part of the band's Experience + Innocence tour, which kicked off in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last Wednesday. A ""sculptural block of cinema screen,"" positioned at the centre of the arena plays a series of still images – charcoal drawings – that act as triggers for the AR technology. When audience members look through the custom-made U2 Experience app on their smartphone, the trigger drawings are transformed into a series of superimposed, AR images and videos. The first part of the AR display plays during the pre-show music, and sees the stage recast as an enormous iceberg that gradually melts into water, flooding the floor of the arena and ""engulfing the audience in the deluge,"" describes Devlin. The AR trigger image then splits and shifts to reveal U2's lead singer Bono embodied by a giant AR avatar that ""looms magically"" over the audience, and echoes the singer's movements as he sings the first song, Love Is All We Have Left. According to Devlin, the pre-show flood ""prefigures the cataclysm of the tsunami"" that comes at the mid-point of the show, visually enacted as a series of waves across the screen during the song The End of the World. This tsunami amalgamates all the projected elements already seen throughout the first half of the show in a ""chaotic"" collage of waves. U2's Experience + Innocence tour follows the band's 2015 Innocence + Experience tour. The two shows are grounded in the Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience albums. Devlin explains that these albums include much autobiographical and reflective material that spans the band's formative period in 1980's Dublin, through to their personal and political present. ""Like the 2015 Innocence + Experience tour, the new Experience + Innocence tour is grounded in the story of the void left by the death of the then-teenage singer's mother, and the subsequent shaping of the four band members by the visceral political turbulence and military violence of 1980's Ireland,"" Devlin told Dezeen. ""While much of Songs of Innocence was written as if reliving and revisiting in vivid detail the territory of 1980's Dublin – as if reinhabiting those characters in the first person – much of the material in Songs of Experience takes a more macro narrative stance, almost as if the narrator is writing from beyond life,"" continued Devlin. ""The urgency of the reinhabited turbulent, raging youth in innocence is seceded to an equally urgent but more distant stance in experience, as if the camera has shifted from extreme granular close up to all encompassing wide shot."" According to the designer, the new show takes a line from the track Love Is All We Have Left as its guiding principle: ""Now you're at the other end of the telescope."" ""The line refers to the shift in perspective that the narrator of some of the Songs of Experience has adopted,"" said Devlin. ""Events of the past are now seen through a futurist lens as the narrative is picked up where the 2015 tour left off."" The U2 Experience + Innocence app enables members of the audience to take photographs that simultaneously capture both live and AR elements. The app and the material within it were conceived by U2’s creative director Willie Williams, who has been working on innovative technology for the band for 30 years. Williams worked with Treatment Studio on the design of the avatar itself, and with Nexus Studios on the AR technology. The direction and design of the show is the result of a collaboration between U2, Willie Williams, Es Devlin and Stufish Studios, which began in 2014. Devlin recently also created a 30-foot-high cracked ""afrofuturist"" mask for The Weeknd's stage set at Coachella music festival, which is animated by projection-mapped lighting.","British designer Es Devlin has transformed U2's lead singer Bono into a giant avatar version of himself using augmented reality for the bands latest tour.

Scott Gerber,"Today’s consumers expect a fast, flawless and beautifully designed interface when they use a software product or browse a website. Slow page speeds, broken links, non-responsive page displays or simply poor design can turn users off from ever visiting your site again. That’s why it’s critical to make user experience and interface a top priority for your business’s development strategy. To get an idea of what not to do on your website, we asked a panel of Young Entrepreneur Council members the following question: What’s a common mistake you see companies make with their websites’ UX or UI? Their best answers are below: 1. Designing for desktop instead of mobile We are truly in a mobile-first world. Sixty percent or more of website visitors are checking out your site on their mobile devices. Focus on the vertical format first and foremost. – Ben Jabbawy, Privy 2. Too much content Your potential customers want videos, big pictures, less text and more fine print that they can just skip over. If your website is puncturing droves of useless content and information into the eyes of would-be buyers, you just gave them a clear sign that they shouldn’t be doing business with you. – Jason Criddle, Jason Criddle and Associates 3. Lack of online chat functionality It blows my mind how few companies have a nice online chat feature. The younger generation does not want to call your business and wait on hold then speak with someone. From a business perspective, one person on your team can handle up to 20 chats instead of one phone call. Chats are a win-win for everyone! – Brandon Stapper, Crown Growth 4. Trying to be cute and clever I see so many companies trying to be cute and clever while trying to communicate their core messages. When this happens, messaging gets lost in translation and users will often click off the site. Being clear and brief is so much more important than being cute and clever. – Kristin Marquet, Creative Development Agency, LLC 5. Not making your point upfront Companies love to flood their websites with text, stories, descriptions of their product or business. That’s useful as supportive information but get to the point. Are you selling a product or service? If so, really sell it: Briefly explain the benefits and features, but make this clear. Think ‘Cliff Notes’ for above the fold; in-depth explanation for secondary or below-the-fold content. – Shawn Schulze, Names.org 6. Not using strategic opt-in forms I’ve noticed a lot of websites either don’t use opt-in forms at all, which fails to convert visitors, or go the other extreme and bombard you with pop-ups as soon as you land on their site. Take a look at technologies where a pop-up only appears when the visitor is about to leave the site. – Syed Balkhi, OptinMonster 7. Random or inconsistent design elements The most common mistake I come across with a website’s UI is a haphazard design. A website should be orderly, with all layout elements coming together seamlessly, offering a similar look and feel. If design elements such as colors, styles, fonts, wording and hovering effects appear random, there’s a problem. – Derek Robinson, Top Notch Dezigns 8. Fixing what’s not broken I commonly see entrepreneurs making UI or UX changes for the sake of change. This leads to changing things without a real reason for the update. When preparing for a UI change, you should have one single goal. Then, hold each change up to that one single goal. If the update does not serve that purpose, it should be nixed. – Diego Orjuela, Cables &amp; Sensors 9. Failing to make the login function site-wide A lot of startups that have membership logins don’t make login available site wide. It happens to more early-stage companies than you may think. Your site will get a lot of traffic and homepage search hits for people who are going to go straight to the login button. Make sure you filter that data out when making design decisions about the site. – Nicole Munoz, Start Ranking Now 10. Overwhelming users with choices When you build a site that has too much happening, too many options and too many toggles, your end user gets paralyzed by choice. Less is more when it comes to interface design. UX/UI is about subtraction, not addition. – Eric Mathews, Start Co. 11. Not directing people to the next intended action On every page you create, ask yourself what you want the next step to be. You should never leave people to their own whims because they’ll almost never do what you expect. Instead, map out exactly where you want them to go, and why you want them to consume your site in a certain sequence. Just a bit of planning here will walk leads right into your funnel. – Peter Kozodoy, GEM Advertising 12. Below-the-fold calls to actions Calls to action should be easily accessible without scrolling. Look at a typical website heat map and you’ll see that the further a user has to scroll, the less likely a user will take action. To enhance the UX of a website, include a call to action in the hero image. Make it hard to ignore so that website visitors can be directed to the right place. – Brett Farmiloe, Markitors Website Development 13. Lack of testing and feedback There are many people and companies that are willing to test and provide feedback on UX or UI. However, there don’t seem to be as many companies actually taking them up on this offer, because their UX or UI isn’t actually working. It’s a simple and low-cost way to enhance either that is well worth the investment. – Angela Ruth, Calendar 14. Image overload Visual marketing is powerful, but can easily be overdone. Some website owners insert too many images, making their pages hard to load and overly stimulating for visitors. Be selective about the images you use to maximize impact without distracting customers from your main goal: conversions. – Firas Kittaneh, Amerisleep","Today’s consumers expect a fast, flawless and beautifully designed interface when they use a software product or browse a website.

The Associated Press,"Interested in Hurricane Florence? Add Hurricane Florence as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hurricane Florence news, video, and analysis from ABC News. With Wilmington still mostly an island surrounded by Hurricane Florence's floodwaters and people waiting for hours for handouts of necessities like food, North Carolina's governor is pleading with thousands of evacuees to be patient and not return home just yet. ""I know it was hard to leave home, and it is even harder to wait and wonder whether you even have a home to go back to,"" Gov. Roy Cooper said as officials began distributing supplies to residents of Wilmington, population 120,000. The death toll rose to at least 37 in three states Tuesday, with 27 fatalities in North Carolina, as Florence's remnants went in two directions: Water flowed downstream toward the Carolina coast, and storms raced through the Northeast, where flash floods hit New Hampshire and New York state. Cooper warned that the flooding set off by as much as 3 feet (1 meter) of rain from Florence is far from over and will get worse in places. ""I know for many people this feels like a nightmare that just won't end,"" he said. Addressing roughly 10,000 people who remain in shelters and ""countless more"" staying elsewhere, Cooper urged residents to stay put for now, particularly those from the hardest-hit coastal counties that include Wilmington, near where Florence blew ashore on Friday. A second shelter is opening in Carteret County. Roads remain treacherous, he said, and some are still being closed for the first time as rivers swelled by torrential rains inland drain toward the Atlantic. In South Carolina, two women died after a van was overtaken by rising flood waters near the Little Pee Dee River. Marion County Coroner Jerry Richardson told The Associated Press that the women, detainees being transported to a mental health facility, drowned at around 6 p.m. Tuesday when a van tried to cross a roadway and was overtaken by water. Their names have not been released. Two other people were sent to a hospital for observation. The White House said President Donald Trump will visit North Carolina on Wednesday to see the damage. Beforehand he boasted on Twitter: ""Right now, everybody is saying what a great job we are doing with Hurricane Florence — and they are 100% correct."" He warned that the Democrats will soon start criticizing the government response, and ""this will be a total lie, but that's what they do, and everybody knows it!"" In Wilmington, workers began handing out supplies using a system resembling a giant fast-food drive-thru: Drivers pulled up to a line of pallets, placed an order and left without having to get out. A woman blew a whistle each time drivers had to pull forward. Todd Tremain needed tarps to cover up spots where Florence's winds ripped shingles off his roof. Others got a case of bottled water or military MREs, or field rations. An olive-drab military forklift moved around huge pallets loaded with supplies. Brandon Echavarrieta struggled to stay composed as he described life post-Florence: no power for days, rotted meat in the freezer, no water or food and just one bath in a week. ""It's been pretty bad,"" said Echavarrieta, 34, his voice breaking. Nearby, about 200 people lined up to buy 40-pound (18-kilogram) bags of ice as quickly as a Rose Ice and Coal Co. could produce it. Supplies have been brought into the city by big military trucks and helicopters, which also were used to pluck hundreds of desperate people from homes and other structures. Mayor Bill Saffo said two routes were now open into Wilmington, which had been completely cut off by floodwaters, but those roads could close again as water swells the Cape Fear River on the city's west side. At Fayetteville, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) inland, near the Army's sprawling Fort Bragg, the Cape Fear River had risen about 50 feet (15 meters) toward a crest predicted to be more than 25 feet (7 meters) above flood level. On Tuesday, logs and other debris became trapped under a rail bridge as rushing brown water pushed against the span. The flooding got so bad that authorities closed a vehicle bridge in Fayetteville after the river began touching girders supporting the bridge's top deck. Fayetteville Mayor Mitch Colvin said it was unclear if the bridge was threatened. ""We've never had it at those levels before so we don't really know what the impact will be just yet,"" he said. The river swallowed trees, lamp posts and a parking lot near its banks. City officials warned still-rising water threatened some neighborhoods and businesses that seemed safe, but said the worst was nearly over and life was beginning to return to normal downtown. Businesses were re-opening and owners removed sandbags and plywood from storefronts. Human and animal waste is mixing with the swirling floodwaters, which have killed about 1.7 million chickens on poultry farms. More than 5 million gallons (18 million liters) of partially treated sewage spilled into the Cape Fear River after power went out at a treatment plant, officials said, and the earthen dam of a pond holding hog waste was breached, spilling its contents. The governor said 16 rivers statewide were at major flood stage and more than 1,100 roads were closed. Emergency workers reported rescuing and evacuating more than 2,200 people and around 575 animals, he said. In a bright spot, the Lumber River appeared to be falling in hard-hit Lumberton, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) inland. Power outages in the Southeast also were down, from a high of more than 910,000 to about 245,000, nearly all in North Carolina. ——— Waggoner reported from Raleigh, North Carolina.

Saahil Desai,"What We’re Following A few politicians who have yet to announce are looming over the 2020 Democratic field. Bernie Sanders, the democratic-socialist senator who caught fire in 2016, has long demurred on whether he’ll run for president again. Yet behind the scenes he is setting the stage for another run, under the premise that a crowded Democratic primary could give him a path to squeak through and unseat President Trump. Joe Biden, the former vice president, also looks to be heading toward a 2020 run, positioning himself as a more moderate foil to lefties like Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. A spate of yearbook photos have upended Virginia politics. The state is still reeling from racist images in Governor Ralph Northam’s med-school yearbook page and in yearbook pages edited by Tommy Norment, the majority leader of Virginia’s state Senate. Yearbooks are meant to serve as time capsules, and are by nature insular—the text can sometimes only be deciphered by those who are in its pages. That’s the defense that Brett Kavanaugh successfully marshaled when passages from his yearbook came under attack last year. But what makes the latest yearbook allegations so damning is that they are images that provide a stark reminder of how American culture has—or, rather, hasn’t— changed over the past decades. The U.S. has long stationed troops in South Korea to fend off North Korea. But the deal between the two countries expired at the end of 2018, with the U.S. requesting that South Korea contribute more money to fund the 28,500 troops deployed there. Now, a South Korean lawmaker has indicated that a one-year deal had been struck that only incrementally increased its share of the total cost. American allies are playing close attention to the negotiations, as they’re proving to be a petri dish for how the Trump administration will approach other contract negotiations being hammered out in Japan and elsewhere. The Supreme Court voted 5–4 to block a restrictive abortion law in Louisiana, with Chief Justice John Roberts siding with the court’s liberal block and Justice Kavanaugh writing a dissent. Here’s why Roberts just might be the most interesting conservative on the Court in recent history. —Saahil Desai Evening Read (David Williams) At the annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, the perfectly manicured canines get all the attention, but their handlers have to do all the dirty work to ensure that they’re in tip-top shape before getting in front of the judges. For one mother-daughter team, life revolves around their show dogs: “With four days to go before the prestigious 2019 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, Mara Flood is spending a good chunk of her waking hours keeping Poe, a two-year-old smooth collie (full name: Travler SugarNSpice Witches Do Come Blue), from impulsively humping the young female in heat who’s been staying in the next room over. Flood has been taking the two outside in shifts, making sure one or the other is always in a crate. It’s a hassle, but then again, it’s right on schedule for a dog of Poe’s age: “He’s my teenage boy,’ Flood laughs. ‘He doesn’t even eat. He’s like, Oooh, a girl! ’” → Read the rest. (Alex Brandon / AP) John Dingell, the longest-serving member of Congress, passed away Thursday night at the age of 92. The Majority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives Steny Hoyer writes: “On Wednesday, I traveled to Michigan to say goodbye. For two and a half hours, I sat by his bedside; Debbie sat nearby. Before I left, I leaned over and kissed John on his forehead and whispered: ‘I love you—that’s not just from me, but from all of your friends in the House.’” → Read the rest.

"feedback@businessinsider.com (Wolf Richter), Wolf Richter","A man walks outside a property agency featuring posters of the latest high-rise apartment buildings in Hong Kong February 13, 2015. Tyrone Siu/Reuters The ""waterbed effect"" of money flows. Top residential real estate brokerages in the US have been promoting US homes to investors in China for years. Brokerage firms in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries have done the same. Commissions are at stake! They have set up units in China and are partnering with Chinese real estate portals, such as Juwai.com. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, a subsidiary of HomeServices - the second largest residential brokerage in the US - entered the fray belatedly a year ago with a marketing agreement with Juwai.com ""to syndicate all of its franchisees' residential listings."" And not just in the trophy cities on the coasts, but all of Berkshire's listings, anywhere. One of the properties it offers on Juwai.com today is this mansion on 8387 Ford Road, Superior Township, Michigan: Wolf Street Scrolling down the page of any of these listings reveals four red buttons that lead to the crux of these deals for Chinese investors (so-so translations below): Wolf Street Top left: Guide on how to buy a house in the US. Top right: Guide with maps of school districts and housing around the ""top 100"" universities. Bottom left: Guide for obtaining a US investor immigrant visa EB-5 Bottom right: Guide on how to apply for study abroad. And these brokerage firms in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries are doing expos and conferences in China to lure investors to make the leap. This massive marketing effort in China by these firms has worked like a charm. Juwai.com predicts, according to the Wall Street Journal, that Chinese investors will plow $1.5 trillion into assets abroad over the next decade, with about half of that going into foreign property. The exact number of investors in China that have piled into these housing markets is still nebulous, despite some efforts locally to collect data on it. But home prices have soared under this buying pressure of foreign money, and now, after years of denying it, politicians are no longer denying it. At first, the inflow of Chinese investor money was great and awesome. But then it turned the local markets into full-blown housing bubbles that began threatening local economies. So various levels of governments in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and elsewhere - but notably not yet in the US - have created policies to tamp down on this incoming flood of money that distorts the market. Here's a flavor: June 2016: The Australian state of New South Wales, where Sydney is, unveiled a 4% tax on foreign home buyers. July 2016: The Australian state of Victoria, where Melbourne is, raised its tax on foreign home buyers from 3% to 7%. July 2016: The Canadian province of British Columbia, where Vancouver is, introduced a 15% tax on foreign home buyers. April 2017: The Canadian Province of Ontario, where Toronto is, announced a laundry list of measures, including a 15% tax on purchases by non-resident foreign investors. July 2017: Disappointed with the results, New South Wales doubled its foreign buyers tax to 8%. October 2017: New Zealand's government unveiled plans to block foreigners from buying existing homes. February 2018: Disappointed with the results, British Columbia raised its foreign buyers tax from 15% to 20%. It also imposed a levy of 0.5% of the property value (which will increase to 2% in 2019) on homeowners who don't pay income tax in Canada, thus targeting non-resident investors. All these measures produced very mixed results. Home prices are now sinking in Toronto and Sydney, but continue to rise in Vancouver and other cities. If there are ways to get around some of these policies, local facilitators will help Chinese investors find those ways. These governments ""are still at the trial-and-error stage,"" Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at Zillow, told the Wall Street Journal. ""They are trying to figure what works and what doesn't."" And there is what Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson - who, after 10 years in office, announced that he won't seek reelection - calls the ""waterbed effect of capital flooding wherever taxes are lowest and regulation is weak."" When one area tries to tamp down on the influx of foreign money, the flow simply goes somewhere else. In Canada, this is partly due to the lack of coordination between federal, provincial, and municipal governments, he told The Journal. ""It's a complex challenge between regulating offshore investment, local real-estate practices and addressing housing supply within cities, all in sync,"" he said. ""The reality is that interventions take time and aren't wholly predictable."" House price bubbles aren't like stock market bubbles. People don't have to live in stocks. But they do need to live in homes. When homes get perverted into a global asset class, all kinds of things happen, including that new supply from construction can't meet the sudden surge of financial demand from investors who might never live on those homes. Just like stock market bubbles, housing bubbles deflate. But unlike stock-market downturns, housing-market downturns wreak havoc on the real economy on a very local basis. In Australia, foreign buyers accounted for 10% to 15% of homes under construction and account for about 5% of total residential sales. But the share of foreign buyers reached about a quarter of new-built condos in Sydney and Melbourne, according to estimates by the Reserve Bank of Australia. ""Many foreign buyers come from China, seemingly around three-quarters,"" explained RBA's head of financial stability, Jonathan Kearns, to an Australia-China property conference last November. The package of policies were starting to have a visible effect by last November: ""Purchases of new properties by foreign buyers have eased over the past year, reportedly because of stricter enforcement of Chinese capital controls and tighter access to finance for foreign buyers,"" Kearns said. In terms of new developments, investors in China purchased about $1.5 billion in residential building sites in 2017, amounting to about a third of Australia's total building sites, according to real-estate company Knight Frank, cited by The Journal. Among signs that Chinese investors have backed off in Australia, there's the ""waterbed effect,"" with foreign money flowing to where there is less regulation: Juwai.com found, according to The Journal, that the US and Canada have lost their spots at the top of the list for Chinese buyer inquiries, replaced by Malaysia and Thailand. In Toronto, the average selling price of a single-family house plunged 13% in May, or by C$160,000, from the peak in 2017. Sales of homes priced over C$1.5 million collapsed by 63%.","Tyrone Siu/Reuters Chinese investors will put $1.5 trillion into assets abroad over the next decade.

Michael Mothner,"Amazon introduced Prime Day in 2015 as a way to celebrate its 20th anniversary as a one-day sale with the aim of overshadowing Black Friday. The sale was available only to Prime members and over the years has become a premier shopping day that grabs media attention and drives competitive brands to launch side-by-side sales. This year, Prime Day had several added elements to drive buzz like a concert and extended hours. The ultimate aim of Prime day is to boost sales, recruit Prime members and promote products. Blockchain and cryptocurrency news minus the bullshit. Visit Hard Fork. But, is Prime Day sending the right brand message for Amazon? My argument is no for the following reasons. Customer expectations are heightened beyond reach Amazon drives customer expectations to new heights with two-day delivery promises and now yearly sales bonanzas. These expectations impact retail businesses across the board and are arguably even beyond Amazon’s own reach at this stage. With record traffic flooding the Amazon site during the beginning of the Prime Day sales, Amazon experienced a crash that lasted nearly two hours. The impact of this outage left customers looking to shop leaving Amazon to head to competitors’ sites. Target, for example, shared that Prime Day was the highest single traffic and sales day for their website for the year so far. Additionally, the retail behemoth’s warehouses are struggling to keep pace with demand. This is impacting bottom line costs and worker satisfaction. This year, a three-day strike took place in Spain, Germany, and Poland coinciding with Prime Day. Workers went on strike to demonstrate against working environment, low compensation and conditions placed on time off. Discounts and deals attract the wrong customers Prime Day is built around discounts similar to those that drive shoppers to flood local malls on Black Friday. The problem these deals present is that they attract subscribers to the Prime program, Amazon’s ultimate aim, who are seeking deals. This may be a good take-off point in bolstering initial numbers but the churn rate, I imagine, is quite high. The yearly membership rate of $119 with the first 30-days free and the ability to cancel at anytime likely invites deal seekers in to take advantage of the sales who then drop off after the fact. The everything store or the Amazon products store? Part of Amazon’s mission is to work with brands and retailers to onboard them to selling their products via Amazon. This includes products and brands that fit into the luxury sector and are not a fit for a deal-hungry crowd. This factor, which cheapens products, may simultaneously cheapen the brand promise. On top of this, Amazon’s own products are always the most deeply discounted and popular. This year, the FireTV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote and the Echo Dot were the top sellers. Amazon is a marketplace and the at the core, this should mean bolstering the brands and companies within, not just their own products. So what should Amazon Prime Day focus on? To avoid the pitfall of one-size-fits-all marketing, Amazon needs to think more critically about the Prime Day approach. Something we often see with one-day shopping holidays, like Black Friday, is mediocre products, massive discounts, and a false sense of urgency or call to action. These factors of course drive sales but not customer engagement or loyalty overall. Review the timing Even the fact that Black Friday, for example, used to fall on the Friday after Thanksgiving as a way to kick-off the holiday shopping season has now extended to midnight Thursday, then some retailers began preempting this with Wednesday and so on shows a necessity to revisit timing. This year, Amazon used this same tactic with Prime Day, allowing for 36-hours of shopping further cheapening the experience and effectively reminding customers of the marketing charade of the whole event. I think this loses authenticity and feels like a cheap ploy in the end. Personalize the experience Instead of broad sweeping sales, what if Amazon offered targeted promotions or deals based on individual shopping habits? A promotion such as “Prime is Personal” would embrace retail trends shifting towards a more personalized online shopping experience and could leverage Amazon shopping data to better the customer experience. This would likely still include popular Amazon products, but would also drive sales of marketplace brands that customers love and continue to look for on the Amazon platform. Go beyond the discount or deal At my company, my team and I test everything we do from a marketing perspective to provide data on overall performance. But what becomes important in addition to the success metrics is the context and weight we give to those metrics — and Amazon should be doing the same thing. For one of our clients, we were A/B testing email creative and social advertisements and to no one’s surprise the one with the highest deal or discount won. If we took this at face value, we’d be driving only discounts through to customers and effectively training them to only take action when they see a deal come through. Ultimately, this reduces the perceived value of a brand, which impacts the brand’s growth and customer loyalty over time. Ultimately, Amazon Prime Day can not be classified as a failure based on the strength of sales alone, but I argue that the long term view necessitates an upgrade to align more closely with the brand and drive continued success in the future.",Amazon introduced Prime Day in 2015 as a way to celebrate its 20th anniversary as a one-day sale with the aim of overshadowing Black Friday.

"USA TODAY, John Bacon, USA TODAY","People waited in long lines for ice, gas and other supplies after their electricity was knocked out by tropical storm Florence. The city of Wilmington, North Carolina, was essentially cut off from the world. USA TODAY People look on at trees pushed up against a railroad trestle crossing the Cape Fear river as it crests from the rains caused by Hurricane Florence as it passed through the area on Sept.18, 2018 in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The area was inundated with rain that caused concern for large scale flooding in the North Carolina and South Carolina area. (Photo: Joe Raedle, Getty Images) Prosperous, vibrant Wilmington was opening three sites for food and water distribution Tuesday as officials in the North Carolina city struggled to feed a population cut off by the historic floods of once-mighty Hurricane Florence. The Cape Fear River, normally a tourist attraction and economic boon, has brought the city of 120,000 to its knees. Residents who didn't flee before Florence hit last week are now reliant on essentials rolling in on high-water trucks and helicopters. The river, expected to crest in Wilmington on Tuesday, set a record Monday when it reached 22.54 feet in the town of Burgaw, 25 miles to the north. ""The river will continue to rise in the coming days,"" the National Weather Service said. ""Stay safe, river flooding is still a major concern!"" The storm has been blamed for at least 32 deaths since it rolled up on the coast of North Carolina last week. More than 300,000 utility customers across the state remained without power Tuesday. More: Wilmington cut off as flooding overwhelms North Carolina; 32 dead More: Flooding from Florence to swamp Carolinas for days – or even weeks Last Slide Next Slide More than a dozen North Carolina rivers are expected to crest in major flood stage this week. Some areas saw up to 36 inches of rain. Wilmington's total was about two feet. The combination of high winds and surge from the initial impact of the storm, plus the rain, has paralyzed the city. Most homes and businesses have no power, and most traffic lights aren't working. The city welcomed 20 high-water trucks from Fort Bragg, packed with enough food and water for 60,000 people for four days. But access to the city remained limited. Stores and gas stations are running out of essentials. Desperate for gas to run a generator at home, Nick Monroe waited in a half-mile-long line at a local station that ran out. His power went off Thursday before Florence hit the coast, but he couldn’t recall exactly when. “It’s all kind of a blur,” Monroe said. Flash flooding was a concern across much of the Carolinas and parts of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York and into southern New England. In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster warned it would be days until rivers crest along the state’s border with North Carolina. President Donald Trump said Monday he remains committed to the recovery of states hit by Hurricane Florence. ""We will not rest until that job is done and done perfectly,"" Trump said.

Sadanand Dhume,"Can India find a way to stanch attacks by terrorist groups based in Pakistan? For the past three weeks, the question has taken national centre stage as we process the Valentines Day suicide car bombing in Pulwama in Kashmir and Indian air strikes in Balakot in Pakistan that followed 12 days later.
Much of the debate so far has focused on the bare facts: who did what and to what effect? These are important questions, and sifting fact from fiction amidst a flood of fake news, motivated leaks and wilful exaggeration can be a full time job. But the outpouring of grief and anger in recent weeks also suggests somet hing conclusive: Many Indians are fed up with the old national habit of turning the other cheek to cross-border violence. They expect their elected leaders to protect them, and to punish their attackers.
As national aspirations go, this is perfectly reasonable. Who wouldnt want to junk the sordid moral calculus behind Indias supine response to the 2008 Mumbai attacks? India essentially forswore retaliation against the murderous Lashkar-e-Taiba in return for a pat on the back from Washington and a few empty promises from Islamabad. India all but announced that Indian life was cheap.
In one important way this restraint served India well. In the worlds eyes it cemented a contrast between Indias sense of responsibility and Pakistani adventurism that first emerged nine years earlier, during the Kargil conflict. But for India this was merely the silver lining in a cloud of humiliation, an attempt to wring a measure of consolation from an exercise in cowardice.
Twenty years after Kargil, and more than a decade after the carnage in Mumbai, the Bollywood blockbuster Uri: The Surgical Strike vividly captures the quest for a more muscular India.
In the movie, a politically resolute government decides that the aftermath of a terrorist groups attack on an army camp is no time to worry about what the United States or the United Nations think. The national security adviser approvingly cites Israels Wrath of God operation, in which crack Mossad agents methodically hunted down the terrorists responsible for killing 11 members of the Israeli team at the 1972 Munich Olympics. When they attack, buff and bearded Indian army warriors slay their enemies almost at will. The message: Indian blood is no longer cheap.
The movie also suggests a longing for a government that reveres the countrys ancient culture while embracing cutting edge technology. An intern in a government lab invents a high-tech drone that resembles an eagle. Of course he names it after Lord Vishnus mount Garuda. An intelligence officer secretly geotags the heros mothers clothes to keep her safe. Giant screens in a war room allow the national security adviser to monitor the destruction of terrorist launch pads across Kashmirs line of control in real time.
How do these celluloid heroics affect the grim real life drama currently playing out in India and Pakistan?
For starters, the films strong box office collections more than Rs 2.4 billion in India alone according to Bollywood expert Taran Adarsh suggest that the story of flawlessly executed vengeance has struck a chord with millions of people. Many of them will no doubt view the movie simply as a factual account of a reported raid across the line of control the original surgical strikes that India made much of in 2016.
The movies flattering portrayal of a resolute and unflappable Prime Minister Narendra Modi only raises pressure on him to live up to his on screen persona. Modi himself has tacitly encouraged this by publicly using the movies catch phrase: Hows the josh? or hows the enthusiasm?
The movie boasts of a new India, which not only punishes terrorists but, in the words of the national security adviser in the film, will enter their homes and kill them. Modis tough talk since the Pulwama bombing such as his promise in Tamil Nadu to pay back terrorism with interest would not be one bit out of place in the movie.
Unfortunately for politicians, reality does not usually mimic the movies. In the screen version, counter-terrorism operations unfold with clockwork precision. Ingenious Indian spies procure the most accurate and up-to-date information from Pakistan. Human error scarcely troubles soldiers or (helicopter) pilots. Only the bad guys are captured or killed.
Nobody needs to worry about pesky foreign experts treating the governments claims with skepticism, senior ruling party leaders touting without evidence casualty figures that defy logic, or ministers publicly hectoring journalists for the temerity to question the official account of events. In the Bollywood version, Indians of all faiths work harmoniously together against a common foe. Nobody need fret about governors appointed by the ruling party whipping up suspicion toward fellow Indians, or troll armies that appear more consumed by unearthing enemies within than with countering enemies abroad.

Weve reached the end of our week, Short Listers, and the end of President Trump and Kim Jong Un's not-so-bromantic getaway in Vietnam. It's Ashley with the news to know today. 
But first: A pharmacy professor accused of student ""slave labor"" secretly sold a student's research as his own. He made $1.5 million. 
'Sometimes you have to walk'
That's what President Donald Trump said after he and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un abruptly ended their Vietnam summit early Thursday without a deal to denuclearize the North Korea. Kim wanted the U.S. to end all economic sanctions on North Korea before it committed to a specific denuclearization plan, Trump said, a deal he was not willing to accept. Will they meet again? ""We'll see if it happens,"" said Trump, who expects Kim will hold off on the missile testing for now. 
Two big quotes: 
""Our proposal will never be changed"": North Koreas foreign minister contradicted Trump's story on the failed talks, casting doubt on further negotiations.
Trump said he did not hold Kim Jong Un responsible for the death of American Otto Warmbier, the college student who died after imprisonment in North Korea. ""He tells me that he didn't know about it, and I will take him at his word,"" Trump said of Kim.

A deadly flood turned towns into 'islands'
Residents are using kayaks and canoes instead of cars in two Northern California towns after the raging Russian River flooded 2,000 homes, killing one person and turning parts of the towns into ""islands"" this week. The town of Guerneville ""is officially an island,"" the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office said. After reaching its crest of 45.3 feet late Wednesday about 15 feet above flood stage  the river slowly receded Thursday. On Wednesday, a man in Ferndale tragically died after he was carried away by a fast-moving current while walking through high waters to reach children trapped in his home, authorities said Thursday. The children were later rescued by deputies.

Real quick
His son was killed by the Mexican cartel. He faced a decision: Move or die.
For decades, people came from the southwestern Mexican state of Guerrero to the U.S. for economic reasons. Now many are fleeing drug violence and seeking asylum. The Desert Sun traced the footsteps of one family from Chilapa to Oregon to tell what it's like to live in Guerrero and what causes people to migrate. 
Chilapa has become one of the most violent cities in the world. Many young people have been the casualties of organized crime and ultimately end up in the municipal cemetery. On Day of the Dead, family member visit the grave of a young man who was murdered along with his cousin by cartel members.

More checks for gun sales? Doubt it
The House passed a gun control bill Thursday would extend how long dealers must wait for background checks before a gun is sold. Currently, if a background check on a customer isnt wrapped up by autorities in three days, a sale can go forward. The new bill ups this to 10 days. The Democrat-led House passed another gun-control bill Wednesday extending background checks to private sales at gun shows and online. But both are unlikely to be passed by the GOP-controlled Senate, and Trump has threatened to veto them if they do pass. Todays vote marked the 25th anniversary of federal background checks going into effect, an effort to keep guns from criminals and the mentally ill.

Maura Brannigan,"Reformation's Melrose Ave. vintage store. Photo: @reformation /Instagram Since launching its sustainably manufactured cool-girl wares via e-commerce in 2009, Reformation has opened eight brick-and-mortar locations — three in New York City, four across California and as of September, one in Dallas. But the Los Angeles-based direct-to-consumer stalwart is making it clear that it has even more IRL stores on its mind, and now, it has the resources to go about making it happen. As luck would have it, Reformation just received a brand-new flood of cash: The retailer announced on Thursday that it has raised a $25 million Series B funding round led by investment company Stripes Group, with participation from venture capital group 14W and, interestingly, Imaginary Ventures, Natalie Massenet and Nick Brown 's year-old firm that specializes in early-stage investments. But as compared to Massenet and Brown's previous investments (including in HUM Nutrition and Daily Harvest), Reformation isn't quite fledgling — at least not in a traditional retail sense. The company has achieved a seemingly impossible statistic per the broader retail market, which is consistent, stable growth; Reformation has seen an average of 60 percent year-over-year since 2014, clocking in at an estimated revenue of just more than $100 million in 2017, reports Business of Fashion. And though BoF also reports that 80 percent of sales come through the website, Reformation's brick-and-mortar strategy remains top of mind: Five of those aforementioned eight stores opened this year, plus two pop-ups in Miami and Chicago, with a similar pace expected for 2018. In addition to building up its brick-and-mortar presence, Reformation's founder and Chief Executive Yael Aflalo told BoF that the brand also plans to invest an undisclosed portion of this $25 million in manufacturing and sustainability programs at the company's bright, shiny Los Angeles factory, which is famously open to the public. Will Reformation be hitting your city next? (If you don't live in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco or Dallas, that is.)

Ben Paynter,"Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg both quit Harvard and went on found companies that made them billions. Both have pledged to use their vast fortunes–the former via Microsoft money, the latter from Facebook–to improve humanity. But their approaches to acting philanthropically definitely differ, so much so that Gates appeared to recently knock the approach his younger counterpart has taken in his charity work. “There are aspirations and then there are plans,” he told the New Yorker regarding the very broad mission of Zuckerberg’s Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited liability company that was founded in 2015 and, according to its website, looks for “bold ideas–regardless of structure and stage” to scale. The group’s two biggest stated priorities are biomedical research and education. It is also working on criminal justice reform and affordable housing. When the initiative launched, Zuckerberg drew criticism for stating a seemingly both impossible and reductive goal to “help cure all disease in our children’s lifetime,” the story notes. The tech titan has since amended that to finding a way to prevent, cure, or manage all diseases within the same time frame. Then Gates added: “And plans vary in terms of their degree of realism and concreteness.” He also pointed out that Zuckerberg’s seemingly lofty goals are “very safe” because they’re so future-oriented. That doesn’t mean that they’ll succeed so much as defer criticism for a long time. “[Y]ou will not be around to write the article saying that he overcommitted,” Gates told the New Yorker reporter. That’s a lesson that Zuckerberg may have learned from his earlier dalliances in charitable change making. In 2010, he gave $100 million to the Newark public school district. It was a huge windfall that, the story notes, is “generally considered a failure.” High school graduation rates there have since improved some, but the money might have had greater impact if Zuckerberg had worked harder to understand what was really needed on a community level and worked to address that. Gates, who has had his own mixed results in education reform, also operates globally in a more community-driven way through The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a $50.7 billion nonprofit grant-maker that, since 2000, has worked with existing charities that specialize in different fields. For example, the group has donated to World Vision, which delivers bed nets to immediately protect against malaria, while simultaneously funding research into larger breakthroughs, like new vaccines. Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan funded their effort by committing 99% of their Facebook stock, and recently gave $12.5 million to an “ Imaging Scientists ” program aimed at advancing cellular biology by improving the tools that researchers use to understand and identify diseases. But that’s the sort of broad investment that lacks the urgency and built-in benchmarking of many of Gates’s commitments. The Gates Foundation declined Fast Company’s request for comment. However, a spokesperson for CZI noted, in part, that “our mission at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) is ambitious because we believe that in order to chip away at big challenges, we need to focus both on the here and now and the long-game. Collaboration is key, and we are thrilled to be bringing technology to the table in new ways as well as working alongside people impacted by these challenges, and other philanthropies — like the Gates and Rockefeller Foundations — to accelerate change.” All told, CZI has made $1.4 billion in grants and $100 million in venture investments so far. On the science front, that includes attempts to build what’s been dubbed The Human Cell Atlas, and an AI tool called Meta to help researchers sort through the flood scientific papers sharing discoveries. Earlier this year, CZI and the Gates Foundation joined forces to solicit more information from teachers, universities, and entrepreneurs about educational tactics that might increase student success. To be fair, when CZI first launched, Gates certainly appears to have endorsed its grand ambitions. “Priscilla and Mark are curious. Ambitious. Thoughtful. Open-minded and bighearted. Willing to learn and grow. And they care deeply about fixing the inequities they see in the world… We can’t wait to see what they’ll do in the decades to come,” he and Melinda wrote for Time magazine in April 2016 as a novel way to pay homage to the charitable sector’s latest power couple. Gates backed up that position social media a few months later, when CZI pledged to committed $3 billion over the next decade, including funding Biohub, a $600 million health research center with nearby university partners in San Francisco. “Investing in research is at the root of important innovations,” he tweeted. “Incredible news from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.” To that end, Gates’s shade might also serve as fair warning. In the philanthropic world, most organizations that want continued funding must often show steady benchmarks toward successes. That includes noting what’s working (or not) and adjusting accordingly. Just because CZI’s carte blanche checkbook makes that less of an immediate priority for the groups its working with, doesn’t mean it’s not important for maintaining a sense among the public that the money is actually going to good use. The group is still ramping up, so it’s too early to tell how much Zuckerberg has considered that. It’s definitely something Gates thinks about a lot. “Somebody who is smart, and rich, and ends up not acknowledging problems as quickly as they should will be attacked as arrogant,” Gates noted elsewhere in the New Yorker story. That comment is ostensibly related to how Facebook’s focus on growth may have blinded its founder to how the platform would be used to affect political mood or influence elections. “I wouldn’t say that Mark’s an arrogant individual,” he added. But Zuckerberg may be the kind of leader who, without proper guidance, only learns through big mistakes.","“There are aspirations and then there are plans.” Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg both quit Harvard and went on found companies that made them billions.

Flooding still possible in Midwest, days after 'bomb cyclone'
Last week's ""bomb cyclone"" storm that hit the Midwest may be in the past, but the aftermath created a ""slow-moving natural disaster"" with damages due to flooding totaling at least $3 billion. Water draining downstream is causing the Missouri River to rise across northeastern Kansas and Missouri, AccuWeather said. The river's water levels are forecast to challenge the crest record of 31.63 feet in Kansas by the weekend. The flooding stems from a storm that hammered more than a dozen states with heavy snow and rain. Since much of the region was already saturated or the ground frozen, the stormwater could not be absorbed. The result has been the current damage and the Mississippi River possibly remaining above flood stage ""into the first part of the summer,"" AccuWeather said.

New Zealand mosque reopens for first time since deadly shootings
Worshippers returned to a New Zealand mosque Saturday when it reopened for the first time since a terrorist killed dozens of people there last week. Hundreds of people stopped at the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, to lay flowers or pray after police removed a cordon and those running the mosque decided to reopen.  The gunman killed a total of 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15, in the nations worst terrorist attack. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern declared a ban on military-style rifles, which includes assault rifles, high-capacity magazines and military-like semi-automatic rifles.

Jairek Robbins,"October 9, 2018 8 min read Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. For the past 16 years, I have had the privilege of working with entrepreneurs on two things. First, optimizing human performance; helping them to be the happiest, healthiest, strongest and most fulfilled versions of themselves. Second, business growth strategies ; assisting them in growing their revenue and profits while cutting costs and optimizing their company culture. Related: Crushing It? More Like Crushing Me. How One Missed Flight Stopped Me From Burning Out. Over the years, I have noticed a trend that has caused many men to lose the most important parts of their life while striving to grow or scale their business. The justification was always, ""If I can just invest a few more minutes, hours, days into this with 100 percent focus, I really feel like the ROI will be worth it."" The sad part was when they finally turned off work and headed home... there was no one there waiting for them. Their partner had filed for divorce, their kids hated them and they were left unhealthy, unhappy and trying to figure out how to put their life back together. Here are four tips to make sure you don't lose what is most important to you while starting or growing your business. 1. Know the strength and weaknesses of the life stage you are in. In the audio book The Amazing Development of Men, relationship expert Alison Armstrong says that men go through stages of development (Page, Knight, Prince, King and Elder). Women have stages as well... I will save those for another article. Problem: The Knight (18-30 years old) and Prince (30-45 years old) are more prone to having blinders on and losing track of the most important parts of their life. Men in these stages work 24/7 only to find themselves losing their health, marriage and even relationship with their kids. If you are in one of these stages, just be aware that it is highly likely that your strength is the ability to be focused on your business. Your weakness is that you are easily carried away and can lose track of the most important parts of your life. Antidote: Make time to check in every week or month and self asses on each major category of your life. Give yourself a score on a 0-10 scale and then make sure you have a clearly defined plan of the minimum investment you can make for the maximum ROI in each major category of your life. Related: Why Setting Rules Can Help You Balance Your Work and Personal Lives 2. Become a master of relationships versus a disaster. According to therapist and relationship researcher John Gottman, there are seven simple things you can do daily to ensure you become a ""master"" of relationships versus a disaster. These tips are based on Gottman's study of 3,000 couples for over 30 years in what he referred to as the ""love lab."" Here are a few to practice with your partner (or future partner): Turn toward your partner. This is one of the hardest tips. It involves being able to stop what you are doing, take a deep breath and lovingly turn toward your partner each and every time he or she makes a bid for your attention. Gottman found that couples who regularly practiced turning toward each other versus ignoring each other had a much higher chance of a loving relationship versus those who ignored their partner. Make your partner's life dreams come true. Each year I strive to turn one of my wife's bucket list items into reality. This has included holding a koala in Australia, swimming with pigs in the Bahamas and even snuggling a panda in Chengdu, China. The good news is you don't have to take your partner around the world and it doesn't need to involve animals. Just take time to learn what is on his or her bucket list and each year make it a goal to help turn one of the items on the list into reality. It's not the size of list item that matters, it is the fact that you are invested in your partner's dreams and care enough to help make it happen. Share fondness and admiration. I often tell my clients to ""turn on the appreciation faucet, break the handle and leave it that way."" This is my way of letting them know they need to practice complimenting their partner 24/7/365. An easy way to do this is to just take a breath and ask yourself, ""What do I love or appreciate about my partner right now?"" -- wait for your brain to come up with an answer and then share it with him or her. Related: 3 Ways to Balance Your Business, Family and Everything Else 3. Use your breath to reset. Oftentimes we can become emotionally hijacked. The reptilian part of our brain takes over and causes us to go into ""fight or flight"" as reacting to something our partner did versus staying logical and responding to our partner. Reacting oftentimes is the cause of fights and responding oftentimes leads to constructive conversations and growth. Your breath can save you in moments where you are emotionally hijacked. Here is a simple breathing technique from breathing expert Dan Brulé that he shared with me in an interview on our podcast, that can help you let go of all that is on your mind and quickly reset your entire nervous system. Step 1: Take a deep breath. The best way to do this is to breathe in through your nose slowly like you are enjoying the rich fragrance of a freshly picked rose. Count to 10 as you breathe in to ensure you are going slowly enough. Step 2: Once you feel like you have maxed out every inch of space in your body with this breath... take one last gulp of air through your mouth to top it off. Step 3: As you are counting to five in your head squeeze every part of your body including your face, hands, shoulders, legs, abs,etc. Squeeze as tight as you can. Step 4: Open your mouth and drop out 100 percent of the air all at once. While you are dumping out all the air, you want to drop your head and shoulders down while squeezing your diaphragm to ensure you push out every last bit of air that you can. Step 5: Repeat steps 1-4 three more times. You will find that your head is tingling and that you are ready to take on the next task with full mental clarity.

I was invited to do some training for the United States Air Force Special Operations Pararescue group. These brave men are some of the toughest, strongest and brightest men you will ever cross paths with in the armed forces. They asked me to help them increase their overall performance. As I poked around, it was extremely difficult to identify anything that would help them perform any better than they already were. Until I noticed one small area that they could improve upon: their family life. The tip I shared with them has been one that many of my other entrepreneur clients have found extremely useful as well. On your way home, make a quick pit stop. It can be at a park, around a lake or even just pulling into an empty parking lot for a few minutes. Once you are in a safe place, do three quick reset breaths (mentioned above). Once you have cleared your mind, do what we call an ""emotional flood."" Step 1: Think back to your earliest and favorite moments with you and your partner (the day you met, the day you knew he or she was the one, the day you fell in love or even your very first date). Step 2: Focus on your favorite parts of those moments and begin to stack them. Meaning as soon as you fully feel one favorite moment immediately bring up another and another and another. Step 3: Continue this process for 10 minutes or until you feel that you have a giant smile on your face and warm and fuzzy feeling in your heart. Step 4: When you head home and connect with your partner or family, make sure to keep these magic moments in your mind; it's good to even share a few with them. I hope these tips help to ensure you are able to keep what is most important to you, while you are on your journey to build your startup and scale your business.

Umbrellas and snow shovels would have been wise investments over the past three months.
The winter of 2018-19 was the wettest winter ever recorded in the United States, according to a report federal scientists released Wednesday. (Climate scientists define winter as the months of December, January and February.)
In all, 43 of the ""Lower 48"" states had above-average levels of rain and snow from December to February, the report said. Tennessee was record wet while Wisconsin had its second-wettest winter.  
In Tennessee, the colossal rains caused deadly flooding across the state in February. The floods killed four people, washed out homes, buried two stretches of interstate highway under tons of mud and rock, and led to a statewide declaration of emergency.
""There were no areas of Knoxville that weren't affected,"" Knox County Commissioner Larsen Jay said.
According to the National Weather Service, the incessant precipitation was due to a steady onslaught of coast-to-coast storms, many of which dumped heavy snow across the western mountains and portions of the northern U.S., and heavy rain across the southern tier.
The national average precipitation, which includes both rain and melted snow, was 9.01 inches.
The endless snow was a boon for ski resorts in the Sierra Nevada. The 42 feet of snow that's fallen so far at the Sugar Bowl ski resort in northern California made for ""the type of season that dreams are made of,"" the ski resort said.
In all, 19 states from the Great Plains to the East Coast and south to the Gulf of Mexico ranked in the top 10 wettest on record for winter. Not a single state ranked below-average for winter rain and snow.
The plethora of precipitation practically knocked the drought off the map:  At Februarys end, the U.S. Drought Monitor showed 11.9 percent of the contiguous U.S. to be in drought, down from 16.5 percent at the end of January.
The soggy winter could be a sign of things to come as human-caused climate change continues. ""Since 1900, average annual precipitation over the U.S. has increased by roughly 5 percent,"" according to the National Climate Assessment, a federal report released in 2018.
Looking ahead to future climates, the northern U.S. should see more precipitation in the winter, the assessment said. This could be in the form of rain or snow. In addition, there ""has been an increase in the amount of precipitation falling in heavy events, and this is projected to continue,"" the assessment reported.
And as for winter temperatures, despite a couple of invasions from the Polar Vortex, the U.S. average winter temperature was above average nationwide for the winter of 2018-19. In fact, it ranked among the warmest third of winters on record, with warmer-than-average temperatures across the Deep South, the Southeast and parts of New England.
U.S. weather records go back to 1895.

Kevin Begos,"When Hurricane Michael barreled into the Florida Panhandle last October, the punishing waves whipped up by its winds blasted a 900-foot-wide gap in the sands of Cape San Blas, a narrow peninsula just a few miles east of where the storm made landfall. Much of a popular state park there was turned into an island overnight.
The transformation left officials with the potentially costly dilemma of whether—and how—to bridge the gap to restore access; it also exposed a weakness in the computer models that warn coastal communities about impending storms. Those simulations can predict how much ocean water will inundate a broad area, but are missing the small-scale details of coastal geography and wave physics that are needed to predict localized damage such as the washout of Cape San Blas.
New, more detailed data and improved computing power are allowing scientists to revamp their models to give coastal communities more precise information on which areas will be most vulnerable during a storm. Beyond forecasts, scientists also want to link models to a vast network of beach cameras that could provide real-time alerts. “This is really going to help communities understand what roads might go underwater, what bridge access could be cut off and where to stage equipment,” says Kara Doran, an oceanographer with the U.S. Geological Survey in Florida. “That’s going to help protect lives and property.”
Missing Pieces
Coastal storm models do a good job of predicting how high storm surge will be based on the power of the storm and the broad shape of the coastline. But due to a combination of a lack of detailed data, limited funding and slower computers, the models have been missing several other key pieces that determine more localized flooding levels—from specific coastal geographies to the timing of storms.
One important missing piece is accounting for the waves that act on top of the storm surge—the rising water the storm pushes ahead of it. The strength of those waves can have a big impact on coastal flooding. “It’s really important, because that’s the energy that really moves the waves up the beach” and causes major erosion, says USGS oceanographer Hilary Stockdon. The grade of the coastal seabed and the terrain of the coast—such as sandy beaches, marsh or rocky cliffs—influence wave strength. Marshes, for example, attenuate waves, providing natural protection against flooding, compared with sandy beaches. Today’s models assume all coasts consist of sandy beaches because that landscape was of most interest to the U.S. Navy, which provided much of the funding for early model development. Higher-resolution coastal surveys done from planes have now given researchers the detailed data they need to include more shoreline types in models, Doran says.
The data can capture even small coastal features research has shown may create opportunities for serious erosion. The breach at Cape San Blas happened at a spot with a large, unpaved parking lot, where water could rush in unimpeded. “Had that parking lot been a tall, vegetated dune, things might have been different,” Doran says. Having such fine-grained details in flooding models might have tipped officials off to the major flood damage that would ensue.
Current models also do not account for the duration of storms, a shortcoming that became apparent in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence last September: Even though it did not have a massive storm surge, “it pounded the coast for days with large waves,” Doran says. At one spot beach sand was moved more than 650 feet inland by the persistent surge, increasing the coast’s vulnerability to future storms. Improved models will seek to factor in storm speed and duration, using National Hurricane Center forecasts to capture this interplay.
In addition to the flooding threat coming from the sea, rains and swollen rivers can add tremendous amounts of water to a region and combine with storm surge, an event called compound flooding. The deluge Florence unleashed over the Carolinas set at least 28 flood records there and helped keep floodwaters elevated for days. Now scientists are adding salinity readings—which show whether fresh- or salt-water is impacting a particular area—to the models so they can better predict compound flooding. The USGS is also working with the National Weather Service to combine river flooding and weather models to better capture the added flood impact from rain during a hurricane.
Looking to the Dutch and Surfers
High-resolution coastal models that feature these factors already exist—pioneered in the Netherlands, a nation that has to contend with a low-lying coastline, Doran says. “They have models that nearly track grains of sand moving in the water,” she says, and use them to proactively decide where seawalls or flood tidal barriers are needed. The U.S. is currently playing catch-up to that work, and must overcome several scientific, computing and policy hurdles to make models that can be useful as storms hit.
For one thing, the more details that are packed into models, the more costly and time-consuming they are in terms of the computing power needed to run them. So although the added detail could make simulations more useful for planning for various types of storms, “we can’t run them in a real-time mode for an approaching storm,” Doran says. That means scientists need to find a way to balance the wealth of available data with the need for quick answers during storms.
One way to incorporate more real-time information is via the growing network of private surfer, beach and weather cameras that have cropped up along U.S. coasts and have already generated viral clips of gnarly crashing waves around the Web. A public–private partnership called SECOORA is sharing real-time information, including video, along the east coast that can be used to, for example, make sure surge models reflect actual storm damage, says Joe Long, an associate professor of oceanography at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. The cameras could also be useful in providing real-time warnings as they gather data on conditions in the thick of storms. Long envisions a system that integrates these with weather models within the next five to 10 years.
Another challenge is putting all the pieces together in a form that local officials can use to prepare residents. “We're still in this learning period of trying to get the right information out, to the right person, at the right time,” Stockdon says. “It’s going to involve a lot of conversations between the scientists and the people in the communities who need that information.”
The hope is that eventually forecasts and warnings will improve enough to anticipate—and potentially even prevent—damage like the breach at Cape San Blas that has taken communities by surprise. Doran, for one, is optimistic: “I think there’s not really a reason that we can’t improve our models to reflect those small areas that turn into a big problem.”","Scientists are crafting clearer, faster ways to warn of serious damage from flooding -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com",2019-02-28T11:45:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",Local Flood Forecasting Has Been Dangerously Imprecise—That's About to Change,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/local-flood-forecasting-has-been-dangerously-imprecise-mdash-thats-about-to-change1/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/83F016BB-88DB-4E56-9C62A21748ACC772.jpg,,Scientificamerican.com,flood-stage,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stephen L. Macknik, Susana Martinez-Conde","We were very sad to learn that Johnny Thompson (aka The Great Tomsoni) passed away on March 9, 2019, at the age of 84. We first met Johnny in 2007, when he spoke at the ‘Magic of Consciousness’ Symposium that we organized at the annual meeting of the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness, in Las Vegas. Johnny Thompson, along with Mac King, Teller, Apollo Robbins, and James Randi, talked to an academic audience of neuroscientists, psychologists and philosophers about his impressions about the psychologically puzzling aspects of magic, and helped jumpstart ‘neuromagic’ as a field of scientific enquiry. Johnny Thomson and his co-presenters inspired us, among many other investigators, to conduct research into the neuroscientific bases of magic. Dozens of papers by labs around the world have been published in the intervening decade as a result. Johnny himself co-authored an academic review with us, on the intersection of magic and neuroscience, published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience in 2008. Our later book Sleights of Mind: What the Neuroscience of Magic Reveals About Our Everyday Deceptions, drew significantly from our extensive conversations with Johnny and his keen insights.
Thompson was regarded as a deeply knowledgeable magician's magician and magic theorist. He was generous and kind with his wisdom and is widely recognized for having served as consultant to numerous world-renowned magic acts. Though his contributions to the neuroscience of magic are less well known than his magic artistry, they have led to significant advances in the science of attention and misdirection, too. Among the magic aphorisms we have heard over the years, one of our favorites is Johnny’s assertion that “when the audience laughs, time stops,” allowing the magician, at that precise moment, to get away with magical murder.
To remember Johnny Thompson, we excerpt here a description of one of Johnny's premiere tricks, the color changing dress trick.
Excerpt from our 2008 Scientific American article on ‘Magic and the Brain:’
The spotlight shines on the magician’s assistant. The woman in the tiny white dress is a luminous beacon of beauty radiating from the stage to the audience. The Great Tomsoni announces he will change her dress from white to red. On the edge of their seats, the spectators strain to focus on the woman, burning her image deep into their retinas. Tomsoni claps his hands, and the spotlight dims ever so briefly before reflaring in a blaze of red. The woman is awash in a flood of redness. 
Whoa, just a moment there! Switching color with the spotlight is not exactly what the audience had in mind. The magician stands at the side of the stage, looking pleased at his little joke. Yes, he admits, it was a cheap trick; his favorite kind, he explains devilishly. But you have to agree, he did turn her dress red—along with the rest of her. Please, indulge him and direct your attention once more to his beautiful assistant as he switches the lights back on for the next trick. He claps his hands, and the lights dim again; then the stage explodes in a supernova of whiteness. But wait! Her dress really has turned red.
The Great Tomsoni has done it again! 
The trick and its explanation by John Thompson (aka the Great Tomsoni) reveal a deep intuitive understanding of the neural processes taking place in the spectators’ brains—the kind of understanding that we neuroscientists can appropriate for our own scientific benefit. Here’s how the trick works. As Thompson introduces his assistant, her skintight white dress wordlessly lures the spectators into assuming that nothing—certainly not another dress—could possibly be hiding under the white one. That reasonable assumption, of course, is wrong. The attractive woman in her tight dress also helps to focus people’s attention right where Thompson wants it— on the woman’s body. The more they stare at her, the less they notice the hidden devices in the floor, and the better adapted their retinal neurons become to the brightness of the light and the color they perceive. 
All during Thompson’s patter after his little “joke,” each spectator’s visual system is undergoing a brain process called neural adaptation. The responsiveness of a neural system to a constant stimulus (as measured by the firing rate of the relevant neurons) decreases with time. It is as if neurons actively ignore a constant stimulus to save their strength for signaling that a stimulus is changing. When the constant stimulus is turned off, the adapted neurons fire a “rebound” response known as an afterdischarge. 
In this case, the adapting stimulus is the red-lit dress, and Thompson knows that the spectators’ retinal neurons will rebound for a fraction of a second after the lights are dimmed. The audience will continue to see a red afterimage in the shape of the woman. During that split second, a trap door in the stage opens briefly, and the white dress, held only lightly in place with Velcro and attached to invisible cables leading under the stage, is ripped from her body. Then the lights come back up.
Two other factors help to make the trick work. First, the lighting is so bright just before the dress comes off that when it dims, the spectators cannot see the rapid motions of the cables and the white dress as they disappear underneath the stage. The same temporary blindness can overtake you when you walk from a sunny street into a dimly lit shop. Second, Thompson performs the real trick only after the audience thinks it is already over. That gains him an important cognitive advantage—the spectators are not looking for a trick at the critical moment, and so they slightly relax their scrutiny.
Thompson’s trick nicely illustrates the essence of stage magic. Magicians are, first and foremost, artists of attention and awareness. They manipulate the focus and intensity of human attention, controlling, at any given instant, what we are aware of and what we are not. With those tools at their disposal, well-practiced magicians make it virtually impossible to follow the physics of what is actually happening—leaving the impression that the only explanation for the events is magic.

Joshua Calixto,"Yesterday, Blizzard dropped a Hearthstone balance update that could easily qualify as the most significant set of nerfs the game has ever seen. The Druid class, which from Hearthstones launch has been defined by the ability to ramp up its Mana pool and play more expensive cards at a faster rate than the opponent, will see changes to two of the most important tools in its arsenal. Along with changes to a few deck-defining Rogue, Paladin, and Shaman cards, these updates are flipping the metagame on its head, especially considering that prior to the changes, Druid was one of the strongest and most consistent classes in the game.
According to Blizzard, the nerfs will focus on improving the long-term health of the game by decreasing the power of cards that have been considered must-include in certain classes from the games launch.
The timing of these changes is also worth noting, as Blizzard usually telegraphs upcoming balance changes by at least a week. They dropped the patch notes for these changes at 11pm the night before they went live. Here they are in their entirety, so you know what to expect:
Wild Growth Will cost 3 mana. (Up from 2)
Nourish Will cost 6 mana. (Up from 5)
These are, by a longshot, the most significant nerfs to launch with this patch. Since the release of Hearthstone, Wild Growth has been Druids most defining card. By playing it on turn 2 and pairing it with an early Nourish, players could quickly fill up their Mana pools and leave opponents struggling to catch up. Paired with expensive and powerful spells like Ultimate Infestation, which lets a player draw 5 cards when played, Druids didnt even need to sacrifice the amount of cards in their hand to gain that mana advantage.
Now, Blizzard has finally decided that these cards are too strong. In the patch notes words, When cards from the Basic and Classic set are too powerful, they can have negative long-term effects on the game. Continuously playing against these cards can start to feel repetitive, and they can feel so mandatory that they stifle creative deckbuilding decisions.
Level Up! Will cost 6 mana. (Up from 5)
One of the stronger decks in Hearthstone is Odd Paladin, a deck that can flood the board with cheap minions and then buff their power with other cards in order to aggressively damage the opponent. Chief among those cards was Level Up, a 5-mana card that turned all of your 1-attack 1-health Silver Hand Recruit minions into 3/3s. The card allowed for massive unexpected burst damage combos, and according to Blizzard, nerfing the card will give Odd Paladin decks more consistent damage output that should be easier to play around.
Saronite Chain Gang Now reads: Taunt. Battlecry: Summon another Saronite Chain Gang.
Since its introduction in the Knights of the Frozen Throne sert, Saronite Chain Gang has been one of the strongest cards in Hearthstone. Not only did the cards combined 4/6 stat line with Taunt make it automatically better than most other 4-cost minions, its ability to copy itself made it a great synergy card. If you buffed it while it was in your hand or deck, that buff effect would essentially double when you played the card. Worse still was the cards synergy with Shudderwock - a game-winning card that repeats all of the previous Battlecry effects youve played in the game. Shudderwock decks would use the Saronite Chain Gang effect to create copies of their Shudderwocks, then replay them ad infinitum until the opponent died. Its been a terror of ranked play for quite some time now, and Blizzard has finally acknowledged that with this nerf.
For those looking for extra clarification, the second Chain Gang is a straight-up 2/3 that doesnt get any of the buffs from the first - so be sure to take that into account if you still plan on running the card.
Leeching Poison Will cost 1 mana. (Down from 2). Now reads: Give your weapon Lifesteal this turn.
Kingsbane Rogue is a deck that relies on a Legendary weapon called Kingsbane. When you use the weapon up, it gets shuffled back into your deck and keeps all the buffs youve given it, leaving players with an extremely powerful endgame weapon that can kill the opponent on its own. The worst part of this weapon was that it could be buffed with a Lifesteal effect when paired with a card called Leeching Poison - meaning that every time you attacked with the weapon, itd heal your hero for the same amount youd attacked with. As an unparalleled defensive tool in a deck that was supposed to be offensive, it was one of the most annoying things to play against in the game, and Blizzard finally gave it the axe with this change: We love the fantasy of building a powerful weapon over the course of a game with Kingsbane, but granting it a permanent Lifesteal effect with Leeching Poison resulted in an endgame with few weaknesses, as well as conflicting with our philosophy that Rogues should not have persistent self-healing effects.
Arena changes
Alongside these huge nerfs, Blizzard also announced some changes to the games Arena mode, which go live today. Essentially, theyre adjusting some of the card options during the draft stage of Arena, bringing back some old cards that theyd removed from the mode due to their previously-difficult-to-use synergies, and getting rid of some other cards that are now considered too powerful for the mode. Chief among those is Mind Control Tech, a 3-mana 3/3 minion that takes control of a random enemy minion if your opponent has four minions on the board or more. Its been an issue in the mode for a long time, and its removal is one of the most exciting Arena changes weve seen in a while. See the full list of Arena changes here.","Yesterday, Blizzard dropped a Hearthstone balance update that could easily qualify as the most significant set of nerfs the game has ever seen.

"Robin George Andrews on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Our addiction to fossil fuels is unrelenting, which means that the skies will continue to fill with carbon dioxide for the foreseeable future. Efforts to scale back coal and oil consumption are underway, but once the trigger has been pulled, it’s hard to put the bullet back into the chamber: conventional wisdom states that the CO2 up there isn’t going anywhere. Some scientists, however, beg to differ. They imagine a future wherein colossal network of machines scrub the sky of CO2. It sounds science fictional, but prototypes of these machines exist, and recently, the idea received a flurry of media attention when a team of researchers announced they might be scaled up more cheaply than we thought. Whether or not that’s true is now a multi-trillion dollar question. Like other so-called geoengineering schemes, this one makes big promises that will require major investments before it can be realized. And whether or not the technology can be scaled up, it’s no panacea for climate change. At its core, though, the idea is alluring for its simplicity. “It’s a waste management problem,” Klaus Lackner, the Director of the Center for Negative Carbon Emissions (CNCE) at Arizona State University, told Earther. “It’s about picking up the litter we have left in the street.” Cleaning up the thin blue line above fast enough to, say, meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, would require nothing less than quickly mass-producing devices that can capture all of the human-emitted CO2 and stop it escaping back into the atmosphere. It’s a daunting task, but at this very moment, there are field tests and pilot schemes for carbon-sucking machines taking place across the world. All of them utilize a technique known as Direct Air Capture, or DAC. DAC machines are essentially artificial trees that rely on the fact that CO2 isn’t immune to the magic of chemistry. All you need is a chamber that lets air enter, and a substance that reacts with the CO2 to form a stable compound, typically a type of carbonate. Carbon Engineering (CE), the British Columbia-based research institute behind the hyped new paper, has a pilot scheme up and running that continuously captures CO2 in a contraption about the size of a small one-floor house. First, it uses a liquid hydroxide solution to turn the greenhouse gas into a dissolved carbonate salt. A “pellet reactor” then forces small bits of calcium carbonate to precipitate out of solution, which is then dried and heated, releasing the CO2 and creating calcium oxide. The CO2 is then compressed and stored, while the oxide, once rehydrated by steam, is sent back to the pellet reactor, forming calcium carbonate anew and closing the loop. Climeworks, a Zurich-based engineering company that’s also building small-scale prototypes of DAC units, opts for a slightly different design. It uses porous filters coated in CO2-scrubbing amines, chemical relatives of ammonia, the compound that gives cat pee its characteristic odor. Allen Wright, the Executive Director of CNCE, told Earther that because these CO2-absorbing materials tend to be liquid, energy is required to pump them around a column of air in order to effectively scrub it of CO2. CNCE, however, is testing out a solid scrubbing system that can be simply placed in a tower, where the passive motion of the air does the work for it. “The sorbent we’ve developed over the years has a strong affinity for CO2 when it’s dry, but all you have to do to remove the CO2 it is to make it wet—either using a flood of water or mist. That’s it.” Wright explained. “All you need to do to re-dry it is place it back in the air stream.” Wet or dry, DAC plants still need electricity to power their carbon capture processes. Clearly, it defeats the purpose of cleaning up the atmosphere to attach these plants to high-carbon grids, which is why most proponents cite solar, wind, or nuclear power as the way to go. CE’s pilot plant relies on hydroelectricity. (Its design also partly relies on natural gas, although the company says the machine’s configuration avoids any accidental emissions of CO2 generated on-site.) At present, all pilot schemes are small. Climeworks operates the most extensive operation to date, and it removes just 1,000 tons of CO2 per year, equivalent to around 60 average Americans’ yearly carbon footprints. But there’s some evidence that these machines are scalable. CE ’s recent carbon capture study, which is based partly based on the company’s pilot scheme, suggests that in theory it’s feasible to design a plant that captures one million tons of CO2 per year—equal to the emissions of 250,000 average cars. It’s been previously suggested that such a plant would take up one square kilometer of space. “It’s a waste management problem.” The commercialized cost of running such a DAC plant remains very difficult to ascertain. A recent National Research Council study put the cost at $60 per ton CO2 for capture only, to $1,000 per ton of CO2 for both capture and reuse. An influential 2011 study by the American Physical Society puts it at around $600, and pretty much dismissed the scheme as too expensive. This new CE paper puts the cost at between $94 and $232 per ton, citing a more efficient design. “Sure, the cost is probably still a little high—but it can come down,” Lackner said, recalling how the car engine got cheap through ruthless mass production and that solar panels now cost around one percent of what they did in the 1960s. But we can’t just scrub the sky of CO2—what do we do with all the CO2 we’ve captured with our machines? If we want to permanently reverse climate change, then we’ll have no choice but to bury plenty of it. One option would be to store the offending greenhouse gas back in the place from whence it came—the Earth itself. CarbFix, an internationally funded scheme based in Iceland, is currently working to demonstrate this technology, which takes waste CO2 from a geothermal plant, dilutes it in water, and pipes it underground into basaltic rock where it interacts with calcium, magnesium, and iron to transform into stable calcareous rocks. There are other possibilities too. Why not, for example, stick the CO2 back in the oil and gas reservoirs that we’ve already depleted? You’ve also got deep saline aquifers, those that aren’t contributing to the world’s drinkable water supply. Noting that the Icelandic system isn’t widely applicable, CE’s founder and Acting Chief Scientist David Keith told Earther that “saline formations are more likely long-term large-scale locations for storage.” In theory, leakage shouldn’t be an issue if the storage sites are well selected and managed. An IPCC report concluded that more than 99 percent of the sequestered CO2 likely to remain down there for at least 1,000 years. The latest study to investigate this, published earlier this week, found that there’s a 50-50 chance that 98 percent of the sequestered CO2 will stay in the subsurface for 10,000 years. Even under a scenario where such sites are poorly regulated, 78 percent of CO2 was expected to stay down there, according to the study’s models. There’s also the possibility that we could do other things aside from just storing CO2. An oft-discussed idea would be turning it into a carbon neutral hydrocarbon fuel—something that CE, for one, is able to do already on a very small scale. At this stage, though, that’s putting the cart before the horse: first and foremost comes the colossal drawdown of atmospheric CO2. DAC is arguably the more optimistic cousin to the technological Pandora’s Box that is solar radiation management, which aims to blanket the sky with reflective dust and shield us from the Sun. That might slow down global warming, but it’s covering up a pervasive problem with a brand-new one, complete with unpredictable and potentially catastrophic outcomes. The worst outcome of DAC is that it doesn’t work, or that it becomes a distraction from other important climate mitigation efforts. That said, even its staunchest proponents wouldn’t call DAC a deus ex machina solution. When discussing how many CE plants it would take to cancel out the world’s 2016 carbon footprint, Keith said: “It doesn’t make sense to think about capturing all the world’s CO2 with a single technology.” Especially when there remain major hurdles and uncertainties. Despite the rapidly-lowering cost estimates for ensnaring atmospheric CO2, the cost of constructing a full-size DAC plant remains unknown. Companies like CNCE and CE likely won’t be able to build full-sized DAC plants by themselves—they may need massive investments from outside sources. The same goes for burying the carbon, which Vox’s David Roberts compared to “lighting money on fire.” “In the free enterprise, capitalistic world we live in, it won’t be invested in until they can think of a way to make it profitable,” Allen said. That’s perhaps why so much fuss is made about the promise of carbon neutral fuel: to lure in the energy industry looking to its future profit margins. It shouldn’t be surprising that one of CE’s investors is Norman Murray Edwards, an oil sands financier. There’s also the sheer scale of DAC required to capture a meaningful fraction of the world’s emissions, which reached 36.2 billion tons of CO2-equivalent in 2016. Assuming all the CO2 captured by DAC systems is permanently stored, we would need roughly 36,200 of the plants described by CE to make the planet carbon neutral each year, should no other climate mitigation action be taken. And other mitigation action is important. “In the free enterprise, capitalistic world we live in, it won’t be invested in until they can think of a way to make it profitable.” Some DAC critics worry we may too much faith in a technology that has yet to prove itself on a large scale, one that ultimately may wind up being a climate mitigation side-show. Michael Norton, the environment program director at the European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC), told Earther that the IPCC models that say negative emissions technologies (NETs) are required to meet the Paris Agreement targets are merely that: models, based on optimistic speculations that the tech will be readily available in the near-future. Norton was the co-author of a 2018 EASAC report that looked at what various types of NETs, including DAC, natural carbon capture via reforestation, and even biomass-driven capture-and-burial schemes may offer to the world. The report does not dismiss NETs out of hand, but it points out serious issues with them, including that based on current data, DAC won’t make a significant difference to the climate fast enough. DAC clearly isn’t a silver bullet to climate change, but there may come a point when the world decides these machines are necessary. Lackner suspects that as soon as one major player adopts DAC, others will fall into line. There will be major governance issues to work out, and at some point, adding more CO2 into the atmosphere may be need to be outlawed unless companies can prove they’re taking the same amount back out of the sky. Embracing DAC—any serious climate mitigation effort, really—will also require a significant shift in public opinion. “We spend half our effort talking to people and explaining why the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere is an important thing to think about,” Wright said. “There are a lot of people that don’t want to have to consider changing their lifestyle or paying more for products because of someone’s concern about some gas in the atmosphere.” Saying that, Wright said that he’s “optimistic in a funny kind of way.” “Humans are very good at adapting to different problems, and we’re really good at building stuff,” he said.

Under the Swaraksha project, teachers and students of the schools in the constituency collected plastic bottles from October 2 to October 10. They collected 1.5 lakh bottles and sold them to earn around 45,000. Kerala Scrap Association took the collected bottles for 23.75 a kg. Of the money, we will buy the book Pralayaksharangal, published by Kerala Sahitya Akademi as part of rebuilding the flood-hit State, for schools and libraries. The rest of the money will be donated to the CMDRF, said local MLA E.T. Tyson Master. The students will receive the copy of the book from the Chief Minister. Suraksha is one of the 11 subcommittees formed as part of the Public Education Protection Mission in the Kaipamangalam constituency. It is aimed at making students self-sufficient. Suraksha had distributed 40,000 notebooks to schools after the floods. Drug-free campus is another project under the mission. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate a one-day seminar organised by the district administration and the Kerala Sahitya Akademi as part of rebuilding the flood-hit State.

The point is, after making some extremely appropriate and well-tuned jokes about our dumb administration and media apparatus, Wolf has been under siege by faux-outraged Republicans, leading to 1) a completely spineless railroading by the White House Correspondents Association itself, and 2) a flood of support from fellow comedians. Last night her old boss Seth Meyers went to the mat for her, Dave Chappelle has said she “nailed it,” and Jimmy Kimmel and Kathy Griffin have also offered words of support. Wolf has also, of course, ably “defended” herself, as much as a comedian who did comedy things needs to be defended. But Stephen Colbert, sensing a fellow comedian in need, had to call in the big guns. While others merely said words, Colbert went one step further, and brought out... Stephen Colbert. With eyebrow arched, glasses on, and falcons of liberty screaming overhead, the acclaimed host of the 2006 Correspondents Dinner decided to “pump it down the truth hole,” fitting in some Kanye jokes while he “stevesplained” everything Wolf did wrong. “How dare you besmirch the okay name of Sarah Huckabee Sanders?” Colbert’s rightwing avatar cried, before ending things with a well-timed plug for Wolf’s new Netflix show ( The Break With Michelle Wolf, premiering May 27) When it was all over, the real Colbert reemerged as if from a fugue state.

Ray Parker,"Technology has disrupted every industry including healthcare, business, finance and others. Healthcare remains the fastest to adopt technological changes to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of the body. When we talk about the Internet of Things (IoT), it offers a multitude of benefits such as improving the effectiveness and quality of services by deploying it in medical devices. Have a look at few of the statistics revealing the use of IoT in healthcare and the overall impact on the industry. Nearly 60% of healthcare organizations have introduced IoT devices into their facilities 73% of healthcare organizations use IoT for maintenance and monitoring 87% of healthcare organizations plan to implement IoT technology by 2019 which is slightly higher than the 85% of businesses across various industries Nearly 64% use of IoT in the healthcare industry is patient monitors 89% of healthcare organizations have suffered from IOT related security breach It has a widely known that interconnected devices are being used in such ways as gathering data from fetal monitors, blood glucose levels, electrocardiograms and temperature monitors. However, some of these tools require follow up communication with a healthcare specialist. Moreover, the majority of hospitals have invested in introducing smart beds to determine whether it’s occupied or not. When we talk about the Internet of Things, there are concerns regarding the data privacy and security. However, it doesn’t matter as far everyone is getting the right treatment, and the patients and doctors work in complete harmony. How healthcare industry can harness the power of IoT and set the stage for highly accessible, personalized and on-time healthcare services for everyone. Have a look at it. Cutting Cost through Remote Health Monitoring The number one benefit of adopting IoT in a healthcare organization is cost reduction. Healthcare specialists can take advantage of remote health monitoring without the patient being present in the hospital. No matter, whether the patient is at home, in the office or some other part of the world, healthcare specialists can monitor the patient’s health and provide recommended treatments. Thus, it can reduce the workload of healthcare providers who can’t bear the flooding of patients each day. Moreover, the shortage of staff at medical health centers would never disrupt the checkup of patients. IoT can also be helpful in third world countries where health facilities are inaccessible. It can also be useful in areas hit by flood, earthquake, tsunami or hurricane. Overall, the impact of this technology will offer better health facilities, no longer specific to particular regions but globally. Collecting and Understanding Medical Data During a patient’s stay, they are tangled in medical devices including heart monitors, blood pumps, respirators, and IVs. However, the operation and recording of information from these devices take a lot of time and are prone to errors on behalf of caregivers. Today, with IoT a patient’s data can be conveyed through Electronic Health Record systems automatically. This method helps in increasing the accuracy of data and allows nurses to spend more time providing care. On the other hand, doctors have to interpret data to decide the cure for patients. Due to the increase of medical devices, it can be challenging for doctors to come up with a proper diagnosis. For this, an IoT solution can be used to support health practitioners while combining IoT data from a multitude of medical devices and gain insights about patient’s health, without scattering the information. Patient Monitoring The evolution of wearable health gadgets like the Apple iWatch has begun playing a pivotal role in the monitoring of an individual’s health. Still, these products are sometimes not as accurate compared to general medical equipment. On the other hand, wearable IoT devices can analyze and detect different health points such as blood pressure, heartbeat, brainwaves, temperature, physical position, footsteps and breathing patterns. With the help of data collected through IoT devices, doctors can share their feedback and give general suggestions in the case of an emergency. Although, the IoT is revolutionary in the healthcare sector, there are few challenges as well that needs to be kept in mind. Have a look at them. Challenges of IoT in Healthcare Security Threats The primary concern for regulatory bodies is the security of Personal Health Information, stored and conveyed through connected devices. While many healthcare organizations make sure that the sensitive data is stored in a secure and encrypted manner, they do not have control over the safety and security of the data access points being used to transmit the data. This creates a significant threat that increases gradually based on the number of new devices connected to the network. Multiple Device Integration Multiple device integrations is also an obstacle to the successful deployment of IoT in healthcare. Today most health devices and equipment within hospitals need to be connected to collect data of the patient. For instance, if a person is suffering from heart disease, he/she may be suffering from high blood pressure as well. The most prominent challenge is that device manufacturers have not agreed upon set of protocols and standards. As various mobile devices are connected to the network for the collection of data, the difference in protocols results in complicating the process of grouping the information. The lack of homogeneity among the medical devices reduces the successful implementation of IoT in healthcare. Inferring Results from Immense Data The process of aggregating and collecting data is attached to many complexities. Though the combined data results can help in deriving new conclusions inferred from the patient’s record. However, coming up with the results from such a significant amount of data is quite challenging, without refined analytics program and data experts. Identifying valuable and actionable data is critical as most of the medical specialists and physicians find it difficult to conclude with the growth of data. The decision-making process with rapidly increasing data lacks quality. Moreover, the concerns are becoming bigger and bigger with the growth of some connected devices that continuously collect and generate big data. Conclusion IoT will undoubtedly transform the health industry and the way patients are treated. Not only will it benefit doctors and other specialists, but people who have no access to the basic health facilities. Addressing few problems such as data security will revolutionize the health industry without breaching the privacy. Let’s embrace technology as a blessing instead of a curse and see what happens in the coming years.","<!-- Featured image --> <!-- /Featured image-->Technology has disrupted every industry including healthcare, business, finance and others.

Terry Smith,"The National Weather Service Saturday afternoon was projecting that the Hocking River in Athens would crest at slightly more than two feet above flood stage, probably early Monday morning, as periods of heavy rain were forecast to continue hitting the area through Saturday and into Sunday. The NOAA/NWS flood projections are adjusted as different variables change such as rain forecasts and what's happening upstream and downstream. Earlier Saturday, the agency was projecting a flood crest in Athens exceeding 24 feet around midnight Sunday. As of 9 p.m. Saturday, that projected crest had been reduced to 22.1 feet in the early morning Monday. Flood stage is 20 feet. That crest projection (which still is subject to adjustment) placed the prediction outside the top 10 flood events for the city of Athens in recorded history, according to the Hocking Conservancy District. The earlier projection of 24.2 feet would have tied the third-highest crest in records. A flood warning was in effect for southeastern Athens County through 2:30 this afternoon for small streams and urban areas. Meanwhile, a flood watch continues for Athens County through 4 p.m. Sunday, though the NOAA/NWS Saturday was predicting the river would continue rising into early Monday morning, cresting around 6 a.m. Monday. Gov. John Kasich included Athens County in a 17-county emergency declaration. The declaration allows activation of the National Guard if needed and eases the way for other state aid, should damage be great. The last major flood event in Athens occurred in January 2005 when the Hocking River crested at 23.68 feet. That was the fifth-highest reported crest, according to the Hocking Conservancy District. Those flood levels aren’t as potentially devastating as in the past, since the Hocking River rechannelization project in the late 1960s. Because of the channel, the river has a higher level to reach before endangering life and property. In a post on his personal Facebook page late Friday evening, Athens Mayor Steve Patterson wrote: “Dear Friends, I want to be sure you know that from Sunday to Monday, Athens is tracking a significant weather event in which we may see moderate to severe flooding throughout the county."" In the post, which the mayor asked people to circulate ( T he NEWS posted it on its Facebook page early Saturday morning), Patterson said he has authorized Athens Public Transit to provide free transit service Saturday (today) for people to access needs and services. “As we monitor the weather,” he continued, “the Middle School is prepared to serve as a shelter if needed.” In an interview Saturday morning, Patterson said his concerns had not been alleviated overnight. Patterson and Ron Lucas, deputy service-safety director for Athens, both emphasized the importance of people not driving into flooded areas and obeying signage closing roads. “I caution anybody to not be fooled, if it looks like the actuals (flood levels) are dropping,” he said. “We expect to see a slight decrease today (Saturday) in river levels, but the rain that’s coming is going to start getting worse and then we’ll start seeing a rapid ramping of the river gauge (near Stimson Avenue and Rock Riffle Road) through Monday morning…” He acknowledged that the weather “could flip” and nullify the flood predictions, but that it’s better to take caution now than be sorry later. Ohio University took the unusual step Friday afternoon of canceling classes for Monday, in anticipation of flooding and other bad weather. Patterson said that the city of Athens met with university officials in a joint Critical Incident Response Team meeting on Friday, and that’s when officials made a joint decision to close OU’s classes. The decision was based on the flood crest projection at the time (4-plus feet over flood stage) and reports from AEP that high winds connected to forecast thunderstorms would occur late Saturday/early Sunday. (Other functions of the university are remaining open, including dorms and residence halls, though some low-lying parking lots have been closed. See related story.) Patterson said that in addition to the flooding worries, he and other offiicials were concerned about forecasts of potential high winds between now and Sunday, which could blow down trees whose root systems aren’t firmly anchored in the “soggy, soupy” ground. The mayor warned cyclists and pedestrians to avoid using the bike path’s new spur between the main bike path and Columbus Road, with a new bridge connecting the two. The Hocking has been eating away at the embankment of the bike-path approach to the bridge (not the bridge itself), placing the path in danger of being undermined at some point. “If the river rises as high as they say, or even half of what they say, my fear is that it will continue to scour that approach to the new bridge (not the bridge), in between Columbus Road and (the other side of the bridge).",Athens NEWS NWS projects Hocking River in Athens will crest above flood stage early Monday Athens NEWS The Hocking River at White's Mill Saturday morning was so swollen that the drop-off there barely registered on the surface.

Watch for water near the Route 72 bridge as well. Water will be possible in Beach Haven West, Eagleswood and Mystic Islands. South Green Street in Tuckerton may have issues as well. Atlantic Ocean Flooding begins on the north end of Brigantine. Margate may begin to experience flooding, too. Atlantic City and Ventnor can anticipate flooding blocks inland at some points. Connecting between the shore and mainland, flooding begins on the White Horse Pike between Absecon and Atlantic City, the Black Horse Pike between Atlantic City and Egg Harbor Township. The Longport - Somers Point bridge will start to see water, too. On the mainland, Bay Avenue in Somers Point, as well as Absecon will have water on the roads, too. Cape May County In Ocean City, flooding begins between 24th to 55th street. Flooding also begins on Ocean Drive between Ocean City and Strathmere. Near the bridges, flooding begins on the access roads to the 9th street and 34th bridges into Ocean City. The bridge from Ocean City to Longport will begin to have issues. Further south, access roads to the Ocean Drive bridge (Cape May and Wildwood Crest) and the Learning Avenue - Elmira Street bridge (West Cape May and Cape May) will see some water, too. Cumberland County Issues will be limited. Just anticipate on water right along the water in the bayside communities. Road closures will be unlikely. After it ends South Jersey's second storm in 3 days will pass through. The risk for a rain shower will begin as early as 7 a.m. However, the bulk of the rain will arrive in the afternoon. While only between 0.50 to 1.00 of rain will fall, the extremely heavy rain on Saturday has kept streams and creeks running high. Therefore, Monday's rain will aggravate issues. A flood watch will be in effect from 10 a.m. until Monday night to cover this threat. No coastal flooding will be expected for the rest of the week, as strong northwesterly winds blow.","Press of Atlantic City Coastal flood alert for South Jersey Monday morning Press of Atlantic City Another morning of southeast winds, the lingering effect of Friday's full moon and runoff from Saturday's storm will bring a round of coastal flooding on Monday.…",2018-11-26T12:33:10Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Pressofatlanticcity.com'}",Coastal flood alert for South Jersey Monday morning - Press of Atlantic City,https://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/coastal-flood-alert-for-south-jersey-monday-morning/article_e92ce52c-5907-5c22-945c-8f3130a4a83e.html,https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/pressofatlanticcity.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/75/4755ed06-1d3b-5d76-ba3a-3b18269e5503/5ab2bc2010198.image.jpg?crop=1020%2C765%2C130%2C0&resize=840%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,,Pressofatlanticcity.com,flood-stage,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, many a time natural calamities such as landslips could be predicted with the help of those images, he said. “The land cover changes after heavy rain, including land subsidence and fissures on land in Wayanad, is a natural process,” Mr. Thummarukudy said, adding that these had no connection with structural change. However it should be studied, he said. “A core change should take place in the mindset of Malayalees on development. Land and houses are considered by the people in the State as an investment and it should be controlled,” Mr. Thummarukudy said. If the government was able to control the way of thinking, there would be possibilities for sustainable development in the State, he said. However, the concept of ‘New Kerala’ should not be the reconstruction of the old State, he said. Keralites had been quite indifferent to climate change and its impacts till a few years ago, but the flood might set the stage for scientific studies and scientific construction at least for a brief period, he said.",Chief of Disaster Mitigation and Operations at the United Nations Environment Programme Muralee Thummarukudy has said that scientific studies are the,2018-09-06T17:38:46Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}",Studies needed to assess post-flood eco impact: expert,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/studies-needed-to-assess-post-flood-eco-impact-expert/article24885598.ece,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,the-hindu,The Hindu,flood-stage,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There's so much I want to say about the Galaxy Fold, the foldable phone Samsung launched on Wednesday in San Francisco, that I don't know where to begin. I guess I'll start with the fact that Samsung only demoed the Galaxy Fold on stage, but didn't give journalists a chance to see, touch or even breathe on the phone-tablet hybrid up close, not even behind a protective glass barrier. So I can only base my first impressions on Samsung's stage demo and what I know of the Fold's specs (cruise to the end for all of those). Regardless, it made a huge splash.
Galaxy Fold in action.
Samsung
The Galaxy Fold feels like a moonshot, and that's Samsung's masterstroke here. We were given just enough information to be intrigued, but not enough to ruin the mystique. Even if the Galaxy Fold falls short of the hype, Samsung -- the world's largestGalaxy Fold phonemaker -- has successfully grabbed everyone's attention. The Fold may not be a device everyone owns, but from what I can tell so far, it's a viable example of a brand new type of phone.  
At $1,980, the Fold costs twice the starting price of the Galaxy Note 9 or iPhone XS. When Samsung Mobile SVO Justin Denison announced the Galaxy Fold's price, the presentation hall rippled with audible gasps and groans (but really, I'm not surprised.) Denison didn't sugar-coat it, but he did prime the pump by calling it a ""luxury device."" 
In the US, the Galaxy Fold will sell with AT&amp;T and T-Mobile starting April 26. Global colors are Martian Green, Astro Blue, Cosmos Black and Space Silver. There will be 4G LTE and 5G versions.
 Galaxy Fold design: Two screens and a magic hinge 
The Galaxy Fold is made up of two screens: a 4.6-incher on the outside of the device as it's closed like a book, and the other, a 7.3-inch display that stretches across the ""inside"" when you open it up to become a tablet. 
We're still not sure if that smaller screen is made of glass or plastic, but we do know that the screen inside is the first example of the Infinity Flex Display, an ultrathin polymer (plastic) that uses a new adhesive that Samsung developed to laminate the phone's many display layers so they can flex and fold hundreds of thousands of times.
Samsung also needed to make the Infinity Flex Display thinner than any other mobile display. It cut the thickness of the polarizer layer, which helps make the screen legible, by 45 percent. 
I'm interested in trying this out since glass is typically more premium material than plastic -- will it feel just as responsive and smooth? CNET was the first to report that the company behind Gorilla Glass, Corning, has been working on creating superthin glass that can bend, but that's still in development.
Now we need to talk about the fold itself. Samsung said it made a hinge with interlocking gears, which is hidden away in the casing. ""Samsung"" is etched on the hinge. It's hard to tell exactly how flat the Fold folds, but from what we can see, there's at least a small gap at the hinge end -- stay tuned.
 Google software is key, and we don't meant Android Pie
The Galaxy Fold runs on Android Pie with Samsung's new One UI interface on top. But what you really need to care about is Google's specific support foldable Android devices, which it announced in November 2018.  
It would be disastrous to close or open the Galaxy Fold and see your apps lag or judder when you picked them up again on the other screen. Google's task is to make sure there's a smooth handoff between the two, so that apps move instantaneously between the expanded view you see on the 7.3-inch display and the 4.6-inch screen.
To make the most of a larger screen, you can open up to three separate apps at once, so an article, a video and your text messenger app. We were also told last November that any app could also give you up to three active windows when you're full screen. We've seen this demoes for Flipboard, but the feature will only catch hold if Samsung can successfully lure the developers of today's top killer apps.
Six cameras total
Samsung has placed six cameras around the Galaxy Fold: three in the back, two on the inside and one on the cover. These are the same sensors we see on the Galaxy S10 phones (the Galaxy S10 5G has six as well, in a slightly different configuration). But it's clear which are for selfies and which for taking portraits, landscapes, food shots and everything else. 
I'm curious what the photo flow will be like on the Galaxy Fold, because the camera arrangement on the ZTE Axon M phone of 2017 had you flipping and repositioning that two-screen device to take pictures. It was a hassle, and one that Samsung has hopefully figured out.

Galaxy Fold's battery doesn't fold
The thing about batteries is that they don't bend so well. But if you don't balance out the load, you wind up with a side-heavy phone like the ZTE Axon M. Samsung said it's solved the problem by putting a typically rigid lithium-ion battery on each side. The two lobes work together, like your brain, to give the Galaxy Fold 4,380mAh of power.
Is a folding phone a recipe for camera confusion? We'll find out.
Samsung
Who's the $2,000 Galaxy Fold really for? 
I'm still not over a $1,000 phone, and my guess is that you aren't either. Samsung knows that most people aren't going to run out and buy one. But some will. The Galaxy Fold will appeal to wealthy early adopters who want to be on the bleeding edge of technology. 
A phone that can open into a book is the ultimate status symbol because it's immediately recognizable, especially if you buy it in Martian Green.
Samsung
There's another population that the Fold would also interest, and those are the app developers that want to test their programs on a folding device. Say you're making a camera app that takes advantage of all 6 of the phone's lenses. You'd need to perfect that on a foldable phone with all the icing and sprinkles.
Foldable phones are the next wave
Samsung may have been the first major brand to announce a foldable phone, but the Galaxy Fold isn't in a field all its own. Unlike the Note family with its large screen and stylus, competing foldable phones is about to flood in. 
Xiaomi and Huawei are working on one, and Alcatel, and Motorola are said to as well. Even Apple has filed patent applications for a foldable iPhone design. 
Even if the foldable phone trend doesn't join the mainstream, they're poised to lay the groundwork for more to come. Samsung already told us last November about the next challenge it set for itself: rollable and stretchable displays. 
Most industry analysts agree that foldable phones will become an inevitable part of the smartphone landscape in 2019 and beyond. 
""This will be the best way to deliver on that consumer demand but it is likely a multiyear process before pricing, software, apps and the product itself have the kinks worked out,"" said Stephen Baker, VP of industry analysis at NPD Group. 
There's also a sense, however, that something else is yet to come.""It is essential that we move beyond devices with folding screens being a solution looking for a problem,"" said Ben Wood, chief researcher at CCS Insight.
Samsung's Galaxy Fold is the first solid step in that direction, and sink or swim, that's exciting stuff.

Al Jazeera,"Flood waters continue to rise across the United States and there are fears that many parts of the Mississippi River will remain above flood stage for a further two or three months.
Many waterways across the Great Plains into the Midwest have been hit by heavy spring rains. That accompanied by rapid snowmelt and ice jams have led to a massive and destructive rise in water levels.
The Mayor of Atchison, Kansas, Shawn Rizza, monitored the increased water level of the Missouri River from a Kansas Highway Patrol aircraft on Friday.
Rizza encouraged residents of Atchison to volunteer for cleanup activities as the water recedes.
The flood crest was expected to reach the Kansas towns of Atchison and Leavenworth, about 55 kilometres further downstream, on Saturday, and Kansas City as early as Sunday, officials said.
Missouri River flooding was triggered by last week's ''bomb cyclone'' storm, which killed at least four people in Nebraska and Iowa, left a man missing below Nebraska's collapsed Spencer Dam, and inflicted an estimated $1.5bn in damages in Nebraska.
On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued their spring outlook. They report that the situation for the central US is soon going to get much, much worse.
""The extensive flooding we've seen in the past two weeks will continue through May and become more dire and may be exacerbated in the coming weeks as the water flows downstream,"" said Ed Clark, director of NOAA's National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in a statement. 
""This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities.""

"The (Bergen County, N.J.) Record, The (Bergen County, N.J.) Record","For years Katie Krausz has been finding a nude photo of herself online without ever haven taken nude photos, because someone used a photo of her from social media and turned it into a nude image. Tariq Zehawi/NorthJersey.com Katie Krausz found that a photo of her taken from social media was placed on a nude body and posted online. The man she suspects in the incident has not been charged in her case. (Photo: Tariq Zehawi, The (Bergen County, N.J.) Record) PARAMUS, N.J. — For the last eight years, a 27-year-old woman felt compelled to disclose when starting a new job or a new relationship that fake nude photos of herself existed on the Internet. Though she never put up or posed for explicit photos, Katie Krausz said she had to be upfront about the digitally altered images out there — even with family. “To have to tell your parents that there are naked pictures of you online is a terrifying experience, especially considering I know I never had a naked picture,” said Krausz. “So the only thing I was able to find comfort in this whole time was that I knew that I was telling the truth.” After the Nov. 27 arrest of Daniel Pfeiffer, 28, on charges including invasion of privacy of a different woman, Krausz said she wanted to share her story publicly. Krausz said photos that first surfaced in April 2011 were posted to the Internet by Pfeiffer, who has not been charged with any crime in the Krausz case. More: Randy Travis' naked arrest video made public The Bergen County (N.J.) Prosecutor’s Office told her no criminality could be proved, Krausz said. The Prosecutor's Office said they could not comment on Krausz's situation because it did not lead to criminal conviction. “When I say I went into job interviews and had them know everything that was on the table, nine times out of 10, they pull up a computer and look"" at the photos while she was sitting there, said Krausz, who works in the health care field. “So it’s an embarrassing thing to happen, but it’s something that I’ve tried taking in stride and using it to make sure something gets done about it.” Pfeiffer’s lawyer, Raymond Flood, would only say his client has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. In April 2011, Krausz said, she received ""lewd comments"" on Facebook and figured her account was hacked. She then saw her face plastered online with a nude body. Daniel Pfeiffer, 28, of Old Tappan, N.J., was arrested and charged by the Bergen County (N.J.) Prosecutor's Office in November. His charges include invasion of privacy of a different woman. He has not been charged in Katie Krausz's case. (Photo: Provided by the Bergen County (N.J.) Prosecutor's Office via The (Bergen County, N.J.) Record) ""I reached out to a mutual friend on the Old Tappan (N.J.) Fire Department and I said, ‘Listen, I don’t know where this came from.' I’m shocked as it is,"" Krausz said. ""And he turned around and said, ‘This is something Dan has been doing for years.' "" The photos allegedly posted by Pfeiffer of Krausz came as a surprise to her, she said. Their fathers knew each other. Krausz's father is a volunteer firefighter. Krausz said Pfeiffer was a family friend and it never went beyond that. Reached by phone, Pfeiffer's mother declined to comment. Krausz said she went to the Prosecutor’s Office in the hope of removing the photos, but they remained. “It’s disgusting,” said Krausz’s mother, Kathy Krausz. “You want to get physical. How could you not when it’s your own daughter?” The New Jersey State Police investigates identity theft cases. In a statement, state police said it is an invasion of privacy if someone uses photos without the consent of the subject. More: Account takeover fraud is rising fast: How to protect yourself “It’s different for my work life and my family life versus more of new friends, like the group of friends that I was hanging out with from Old Tappan,"" Krausz said about the experience. ""They disappeared as soon as this all started happening, for one reason or another. I wasn’t talking to a lot of people about it at the time, because, again, we were always hoping that something would be done on the legal end of it.” Arrest history According to jail records, Pfeiffer remained in the Bergen County Jail after his November arrest. His arrest marked the third time since December 2015 that he was charged with stalking and invasion of privacy. His next court hearing is scheduled for Jan. 4 in Superior Court. On Jan. 5, Pfeiffer has a hearing on violation of probation. More: Prosecutor: Victim in Snapchat sexual assault case needed 2 surgeries Pfeiffer was first charged Dec. 14, 2015, with stalking and invasion of privacy. In that instance, Pfeiffer and another man allegedly made social media accounts in a woman's name without her knowledge or consent. They also allegedly uploaded sexually explicit images of the woman to those accounts. He pleaded guilty to stalking Feb. 6, 2017. On June 10, 2016, Pfeiffer was arrested again and faced charges including invasion of privacy, identity crime impersonation and cyber harassment, according to court records. Pfeiffer pleaded guilty to stalking Sept. 15, 2017. His Internet use was restricted. “It's something I've always been upfront about, and it's finally at a stage where I'm not embarrassed to have this conversation with people, because I know I didn't do anything wrong.” Katie Krausz While Pfeiffer was charged, he worked as a volunteer firefighter in Old Tappan. Old Tappan Mayor John Kramer said in November that Pfeiffer had not been with the department since his arrest. According to public records, Pfeiffer's separation from the department happened Nov. 29. The reason for the separation was that he resigned. “There were certain aspects of the entire situation that led me to believe he was not part of the department at that time,” Kramer said in a brief phone interview. “At that time, I didn’t know he resumed activities at the Fire Department.” When asked whether he was surprised about Pfeiffer’s involvement with the Fire Department after his arrest, Kramer had no comment. Old Tappan Fire Chief of Department Dave Keil did not respond to a request for comment. Krausz said she hopes that sharing her experience will encourage others who went through what happened to her to come forward. “It’s something I’ve always been upfront about, and it’s finally at a stage where I’m not embarrassed to have this conversation with people, because I know I didn’t do anything wrong,” she said.

Rachel Greco / Lansing State Journal Police and firefighters are laying sandbags off Main Street along the Springbrook, a portion of the Grand River that runs through Eaton Rapids, on Wednesday morning. (Photo: Rachel Greco / Lansing State Journal) Buy Photo EATON RAPIDS - Areas along the Grand River in Lansing are now expected to see flooding that exceeds that not seen since 1985 because of three days of steady rain. The Grand River was at nearly two feet over flood stage at 12.59 feet on Wednesday morning in Lansing and is expected to crest at 14.14 feet by Thursday night, according to the National Weather Service. Flood stage for the river in Lansing is 11 feet and river levels are typically 3 to 4 feet in Lansing this time of year, said National Weather Service Meterologist Jared Maples. The river peaked at 14.12 feet in 1985, and 15.43 feet in 1975, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. About 800 families were evacuated from their homes in 1975. Buy Photo Firefighters and police in Eaton Rapids placed three feet high sandbag barriers along the Grand River Wednesday morning. (Photo: Rachel Greco/Lansing State Journal) Weather Service officials said earlier this week flooding could approach the 1985 levels. Maples said moderate flooding is possible in parts of Lansing. Dozens of streets and roads are closed across the Lansing area as the water continues to rise. Lansing Mayor Andy Schor said officials will have several alerts coming throughout the day regarding further road closures, updates to the city's phone system which is down, and further information as it develops. He added no city buildings have been closed due to the weather and there are no reports of residents stranded in their homes. Schor said there appears to be no need for evacuations at this time, but officials are prepared. ""If the waters are high enough that we have to bring in boats for rescue, then we will do that,"" Schor said. ""We’re prepared for the worst and hope for the best."" Amid some of the highest water levels recorded in decades on the Grand River, police and firefighters in Eaton Rapids, dubbed the ""Island City"" because it's surrounded by water, installed up to 90 feet of sandbags in at least three areas off Main and Hall street and along a portion of the Grand River this morning. Eaton Rapids Mayor Paul Malewski said about 25 people started laying sandbags at 5:30 a.m. and finished by 9 a.m. Sandbags weighing 45 to 50 pounds each were stacked three feet high near the Knight Street bridge, off Hall Street and just off Main Street on the banks of the Springbrook north of downtown Eaton Rapids. Springbrook is a portion of the Grand River that runs through the city. ""We've got a lot of water,"" he said. ""We had all hands on deck and got it barricaded in the low spots."" Malewski said crews laid sandbags along the river in various spots as recent as last spring. They'll add another layer of sandbags if water levels continue to rise this week, he said. ""We have no way of knowing what the river's going to do,"" Malewski said. ""If the river goes up more we'll have to put another course of bags on it. We've got another course we can lay that's ready to go."" Eaton Rapids Police Chief Larry Weeks worked with a crew laying sandbags just off Main Street shortly after 8 a.m. ""Any time the river rises these are all areas of concern that we monitor,"" he said. ""The plan here is to stack up the sandbags high enough to prevent the water overflow. It's more a prevention measure at this point."" Wednesday morning Howe Field in Eaton Rapids was nearly completely flooded. Water surrounded the field's concession stand and ball fields. Linda Putnam, who owns Rooster Hill Country Shop at the corner of Hall and Hamlin streets, watched Wednesday morning as a crew laid down more bags off Main Street. ""If it (water) comes over, it comes into the street and I'm right there,"" she said. ""I am concerned. I have a business there with a lot of product."" Maples said Wednesday morning water levels on the Grand River in Eaton Rapids are expected to rise to 6.3 feet by Thursday morning. Flooding can be expected at 6 feet, he said. Malewski said by Wednesday morning levels had reached 6 feet in the city. The Red Cedar River stood at 8.51 feet in East Lansing Wednesday morning, said Maples, and is expected to crest at 9.9 feet by Thursday evening. The levels could prompt flooding at Michigan State University's Jension Field House, he said. Water continues to rise in Meridian Township. Matthew Dae Smith / Lansing State Journal In Williamston river levels stood at 8.67 feet Wednesday morning, and are forecast to reach 9.5 feet by Thursday afternoon, Maples. ""I think it's best to be vigilant about the river levels and keep up to date with the forecast as well,"" Maples said. Maples said rain totals in Eaton and Ingham counties have reached just over three inches. Portions of southern Kent, Allegan and Calhoun counties have seen as much as four inches of rain, he said. No more rain is expected to fall in the greater Lansing area through Thursday, Maples said. Less than a tenth of an inch is forecast to fall Friday. Over the weekend another system is expected to add a quarter of an inch of rainfall, he said. Temperatures are expected to reach the upper 30s Thursday, and the low to mid 40s over the weekend, Maples said. Check back for updates. River water covers a portion of the stairs at the Grand River Access area on Tuesday, Feb. 20, 2018, in Old Town Lansing.

Chris Paukert,"It's not often that a new car debuts at a music festival, but that's exactly the case with this 2020 Nissan Versa. The all-new entry-level sedan is taking to the stage at Fort Lauderdale's Tortuga Music Festival this weekend alongside artists such as Jason Aldean, Kenny Chesney and Sheryl Crow. 
Exactly what this small four-door has in common with Flo Rida or Elle King isn't quite clear, but apparently the Nissan will be unveiled in middle of a surprise performance from an unnamed country music star before it heads to next week's New York Auto Show.
On sale since 2012, It's fair to say that today's Nissan Versa sedan has sold primarily on the strength of its low sticker price and a surprisingly capacious cabin and trunk -- not on virtues such as its appearance or tech. Indeed, any model that manages to earn the title of ""Least Expensive New Car In America"" is highly unlikely to sell based on desirability or features -- it's often simply the choice of consumers looking for the most affordable ride they can get with a new-car warranty. 
One look at this new 2020 Versa, however, suggests that Nissan is feeling much more ambitious about this third-generation model's fortunes. Not only is it packed with significantly more technology than before, it looks altogether more dynamic than its homely predecessor.
Where the outgoing Versa appeared lumpen and looked like it was standing on tiptoes, the new Versa's design fits right into the company's lineup, sitting lower, wider and spanning longer than its forebear. Indeed, with its more angular headlamps bookending a stronger V-Motion grille, as well as its floating C-pillar treatment, the 2020 Versa looks a lot like a shrunken Altima. In other words, the Versa now looks substantially better proportioned and upscale.
These days, automakers have been finding selling new sedans to be increasingly tough sledding. More and more consumers are defecting from traditional three-box four-doors in favor of crossover SUVs, regardless of size and price. At a time when companies such as Ford are abandoning many traditional passenger-car sales segments, Nissan appears to be doubling down on new sedan models like this Versa, as well as the aforementioned Altima and forthcoming Sentra replacement. 
""As other nameplates exit the field, we see a real opportunity to build our segment-leading market share and nurture this crucial group of new-car buyers,"" said Claudia Marquez, Nissan North America's vice president of sales, in a statement. 
The 2020 Versa should be a better performer, too. The new model is powered by a 1.6-liter, naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine delivering 122 horsepower and 114 pound-feet of torque (that compares favorably to today's car's 109 hp and 107 pound-feet out of the same-size powerplant). A five-speed manual transmission is standard, and Nissan's Xtronic continuously variable transmission will be available.
It looks like the Versa's interior has significantly stepped up its game. High time.
Nissan
Company officials have reportedly already revealed that the automaker will no longer offer the Versa Note model going forward, so if you're looking for an inexpensive Nissan with a hatchback, dealers are likely to point you to the company's surprisingly fun-to-drive Kicks crossover. Hopefully some of that model's dynamic DNA is encoded in this new Versa, too, as both are built atop the same V platform.
Given this Versa's slinkier proportions, it will be interesting to see how successfully Nissan has managed to package the interior and cargo area of the new model. The departing Versa has a positively massive back seat and trunk for its class -- larger than many class-above vehicles -- and preserving those values could be key to its success. 
Based purely on these first pictures, the Versa's cabin may benefit from a total overhaul most of all, both aesthetically and technologically. There's a new ""Gliding Wing"" instrument panel like the Versa's Altima and Maxima big brothers, and standard features will include keyless entry, push-button ignition and power windows. A 7-inch touchscreen audio system is also standard. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility will be available, alongside niceties such as heated front seats and automatic climate control.
The old Versa had weird funhouse-mirror proportions, but this new one is sleeker and straight ahead.
Nissan
Another big focus for the 2020 Nissan Versa appears to be upgraded safety equipment -- particularly advanced driver assist systems. All models will receive standard automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection and rear automatic braking, as well as lane departure warning and high-beam assist. Intelligent cruise control, blind-spot warning, rear cross-traffic alert and a basic driver alertness monitoring system will be optional. LED headlights will accompany higher trim levels, as well.
The new V Platform that underpins this Versa should help improve its crash-test performance, too. While the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rates the current model at four stars overall, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and its tougher battery of crash tests rate today's model's small overlap front driver-side performance as Poor. (The model's passenger-side performance has not been rated.)
Everyone's garage is this clean and uncluttered, right?
Nissan
If all of the new equipment on this new 2020 model sounds difficult to reconcile with the Versa's historic title as the lowest price new car sold in the US, you're on the same page with Roadshow's braintrust. The outgoing 2019 Versa starts at $12,360 plus $895 for delivery, substantially undercutting even Mitsubishi's hapless Mirage hatchback ($13,795 plus $995 delivery). Simply put, it seems unlikely that this much more richly contented Versa will be able to be priced so aggressively. In fact, we think it seems unlikely to hold onto its most-affordable pricing crown. That said, the 2020 Nissan Versa does look to be a much better vehicle, and likely a better overall value.
The new Versa goes on sale this summer. In the meantime, be sure to bookmark Roadshow in your browser -- we'll have in-person coverage of this new Nissan as well as a flood of other interesting new models, beginning next week, from the New York Auto Show floor.",Nissan's suddenly unfrumpy sedan is set to party at a Florida music festival before heading to the New York Auto Show.,2019-04-12T20:52:21Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Cnet.com'}",2020 Nissan Versa: Still America's least expensive new car? - Roadshow,https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2020-nissan-versa-new-york-auto-show-least-expensive-cheapest-new-car/,https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/4gxSVoAZWNIMXbWG5VCP79SEQoI=/2019/04/12/f1efb9b2-efe2-43f9-ac4e-560c1068b595/2020-nissan-versa-new-york-auto-show-ogi-1.jpg,,Cnet.com,flood-stage,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kelsey Campbell-Dollaghan,"“We were a little bit behind the rest of the world in realizing that we do have a very unique culture, and how spectacularly central it is to our way of working,” says Sheela Maini Søgaard, the CEO of Bjarke Ingels Group and the company’s only woman partner. Søgaard was talking about the creative DNA of the firm, which has grown rapidly in the decade since she joined it. A few numbers, for context: In 2008, BIG was an office of about 50 people. Today, it numbers around 470. It’s a kind of growth that’s more recognizable in the tech industry, and perhaps it’s no surprise that some of the company’s recent clients come from that world: An immense, million-square-foot headquarters for Google in London and a 600,000 square foot campus for it in Mountain View, California. A Mars simulation city in the United Arab Emirates. A Hyperloop transit system. At the Fast Company Innovation Festival, Søgaard described balancing the company’s creative culture and its business health amid rapid growth–and shared a few insights from which any company can learn. Sheela Maini Søgaard [Photo: Leitorp] Build Something Scalable Søgaard has been responsible for managing BIG’s growth sustainably and for shepherding the company into its next phase of life. When she first joined the company as its CFO, after working for McKinsey &amp; Company and NOMA cofounder Claus Meyer, that meant establishing the most foundational rules–things as simple as not handing over work until the firm had been paid. Today it means managing the firm’s finances and business development, but also the on-boarding of each influx of new talent and everything in between. Perhaps even more importantly, it means managing the business side of the firm while enabling its creative culture. At the Innovation Festival, Søgaard explained the key has been finding a division of labor that lets the design team do what they do best, whatever the scale and scope of the project. “If everyone actually spends the majority of their time doing what they’re best at, instead of just half of their time, then you end up just essentially lifting the skill set of the firm,” she told the audience. “You have a chance of doing something pretty spectacular if project managers for design processes don’t have to send out invoices, and hire people, and discuss with clients about whether, you know, we should be doing this at this timeline–but that they actually have the support to do that from their operations.” [Image: BIG] Broaden The Definition Of Your Business While BIG cut its teeth on residential developments, in recent years the company has taken on an increasing number of infrastructure, urban planning, and engineering projects. In 2014, the firm won $540 million to build the so-called “Big U,” a system that would ring 10 miles of Manhattan in flood-mitigating berms woven with public programs like recreation areas and walking trails. In 2016 it unveiled designs for Hyperloop One, the California company commercializing Elon Musk’s conceptual proposal and working to build a track connecting Dubai and Abu Dhabi. In retrospect, it’s easy to see how the firm’s design process led naturally to a broader interpretation of “architecture” as an industry. “We’ve come to realize that if we really want to ensure the design integrity of the projects that we do, and we want to really ensure that the experience the users get when they step into a design... the best way of ensuring that is to engage in more areas of the value chain, and engage in more areas of the disciplines that actually end up in the end product,” Søgaard said. That increasingly includes infrastructure, transit, and planning, and this summer BIG formalized a new division–BIG Engineering–dedicated to “breaking down the traditional barriers that have existed between architects and engineers,” as BIG Engineering leader Duncan Horswill said it at the time. This fall, the company released a project that embodies the shift taking place in its work: the Mars Science City. This complex, built in the deserts outside of Dubai, will serve as a research center and place to stage simulations of technology meant for Mars exploration. That includes Martian building technologies, which may be used to build out the city as it grows. The complex will be a kind of testing lab for planetary building–an urban-scale piece of design that also seeks to develop an entirely new kind of “regional” architecture for Mars. “Ten years ago, I’m not sure that we would have imagined that we now are the go-to architect for space,” Søgaard added. “It’s so exciting, because that is at least the next frontier–if not the last.” [Image: BIG/Heatherwick Studio] Foster Culture Through Creativity Forty percent of BIG’s workforce is below 30 years of age, and half of it joined within the past two years. That means fostering culture is an important part of managing the business–from the on-boarding process to happy hours to costume contests and periodic trips the entire firm takes together. At her talk, Søgaard described the firm’s partners as being driven by a positivity inherent to the firm’s design methodology–after all, this is the company that coined the Miesien punchline “yes is more,” and the notion of hedonistic sustainability. “Creativity thrives in positivity,” Søgaard added. “You need positivity to be innovative and to be creative.” Despite its rapid expansion, “we’re doing a lot of it the same way that we were before,” Søgaard added. “So the inherent way of working, the inherent culture, the inherent approach to our employees, is founded on those same principles as it always was.”","At the Fast Company Innovation Festival, Bjarke Ingels Group CEO Sheela Maini Søgaard discussed scaling up while maintaining the firm’s creative culture. “We were a little bit behind the rest of the world in realizing that we do have a very unique culture, an…",2017-11-14T07:00:35Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Fastcodesign.com'}","3 Insights From The CEO Of BIG, A 21st-Century Superfirm",https://www.fastcodesign.com/90147135/3-insights-from-the-ceo-of-big-a-21st-century-superfirm,"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/sites/4/2017/11/p-2-big-ceo-sheela-maini-sogaard-on-growing-a-super-firm.jpg",,Fastcodesign.com,flood-stage,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Should We Give Cars to the Poor?
David Bernhardt Was the Brains Behind Ryan Zinke. Now Hes in Charge.
Why Your Phone Dies in the Cold Weather, and What You Can Do About It
Every Friday since the beginning of this year, bundled in a burnt-orange puffy jacket, 12-year-old Haven Coleman has protested climate change in front of government buildings and business storefronts in Denver. The reactions are mixed. Last week, a man flipped her off through his rolled-down window; other times, people shout words of encouragement or give a thumbs-up. At one of her strikes this month, I find her sitting cross-legged on the cold, hard cement steps leading to the entrance of the Denver City Council building, two posters propped up next to her. One sign has four hashtagged words: #ClimateBreakdown #FridaysforFuture, #ClimateStrike, and #GreenNewDeal written in large skinny black letters. The other proclaims School Strike for Climate.
After about half an hour, an older gentleman in a neon-yellow T-shirt and worn blue jeans pauses to read Colemans signs. He doesnt like what they say. Thats to your disadvantage, he tells her matter-of-factly. You need school. Coleman, a seventh-grader with long brown hair and expressive hand gestures, tries to come up with a quick response, but by the time shes pulled her thoughts together, hes already gone up the City Hall steps.
Around the country, other young climate activists have gone on similar solo strikes, cheering each other on from afar through Instagram and Twitter. They find encouragement from teens in other countries, like England and Belgium, where the youth climate movement has inspired a vast wave of students to ditch class on Fridays and flood into the streets to protest. Like many adults, they are energized by the eloquent, powerful, and at times frightening speeches of Swedish 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, who has been protesting in front of the Swedish Parliament since August.
With a future that looks increasingly perilousa recent U.N. climate report gave world leaders just 12 years to act to avoid the worst effects of climate changeColeman and her peers feel a sense of urgency. Us kids, we are the only ones who are doing anything recognizing that our future is at stake, Coleman said, with a hint of exasperation in her voice. The reason why we are climate striking is to try and get the attention of the adults, because we cant votebut we can influence senators.
The reason why we are climate striking is to try and get the attention of the adults, because we cant votebut we can influence senators.
 Haven Coleman
And grabbing the attention of adults is Colemans strong suit. She made headlines over a year ago, when she spoke at a town hall hosted in August 2017 by Republican Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, who has received more than $1.2 million dollars in campaign funding from oil and gas industries. The senator listened to Colemans heartfelt speech that day from the stage. Through tears, she pleaded with him to take action against climate change. She even offered to help. If the carbon polluters money is holding you back, I can organize kids, adults, and money, and we can use social media and do grassroots, she told him, as people in the crowd flashed green cards and cheered.
Gardner didnt take her up on her offer, but the videos that surfaced of Colemans speeches to Republican Rep. Doug Lamborn, a known climate change denier, garnered the attention of another prominent figure: Al Gore. She had met him briefly once before at a training event. But months later, after hearing about her climate activism in Colorado, he invited her to be a part of his 24 Hours of Reality project, a day of television programming centered on climate change. Coleman says her activism has been going up from there.
These days, all of her energy is going into planning the U.S. Youth Climate Strike, a national event organized by Coleman and two other young climate activists, Alexandria Villasenor and Isra Hirsi. It will take place in solidarity with a global school strike for climate action on the same day, in which students plan to urge U.S. politicians to adopt the Green New Deal and to stem the effects of the climate crisis. Over 300 people have already signed on to lead strikes in their cities. With less than a month to go, events have been confirmed in 28 states. Coleman is confident that the movement will reach every part of the country.
Balancing school and planning a national strike can be challenging, to say the least, for a seventh-grader. She caught some flak from a teacher when she missed a math-tutoring session; shed gotten stranded on a planning phone call with her climate strike co-leaders. When she tried to explain that she had just started the U.S. version of a European climate action movement, her teacher responded by telling her, You better get your priorities together. Coleman has missed several days of school to attend rallies in D.C. and speak at climate change events, but for the most part, she tries to balance school with her activism. On her Friday strikes, she squeezes in her protests early in the mornings or during lunch, though sometimes she ends up a little late for her classes.
School and activism have never harmonized for Coleman, anyway. When she lived in politically conservative Colorado Springs, she says the other kids hated my guts and shoved her into lockers. It got pretty intense, and I ended up doing home school. At her current school in Denver, she says her classmates dont really get this climate activism thing, so she tries not to bring it up too often. It is just hard because when people dont really understand it is sort of like Im hunting for dragons or something, she says.
Its difficult not having people her age to turn to when she feels overwhelmed by climate change, Coleman said. When you are dealing with such a heavy issue at such a young age, sometimes it just brings you down, she says. In those moments, her parents help her through itespecially because you dont see a lot of kids being activists. The strike on March 15 just might change that. I hope that a ton of kids will flood into the streets, Coleman says.
At one point, I ask Coleman what motivates her to turn her feelings about climate change into real action, something many adults have failed to do. I feel like I need to do something, she says, because why wouldnt you want to save your future?
We can stop the worst effects, so why shouldnt I try and save all you adults?","Following the examples of young European protesters, climate activists like 12-year-old Haven Coleman are trying to plan climate rallies across the U.S.",2019-02-25T19:42:08Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slate.com'}",Will Kid-Run Climate Strikes Take Off in America?,https://slate.com/technology/2019/02/children-climate-activists-america-haven-coleman.html,https://compote.slate.com/images/cc11bf0f-975c-4c69-a116-4b429decf4e7.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=5311x3541&offset=0x0,,Slate.com,flood-stage,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
G. Venkataramana RaoAmaravati,"The hopes of the environmental activists trying to protect the floodplains of Krishna river and the fertile lands within the area earmarked for construction of Amaravati, the name given to the new capital of Andhra Pradesh, were dashed by the directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The least they expected was a slap on the wrist of the Andhra Pradesh government in the form of a fine or penalty. The Tribunal, instead of rising up to the expectations of the green activists, did not cancel the Environmental Clearance given to the unique project by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&amp;CC). The Tribunal, in its order and direction, added nine stringent conditions of its own to the 192 conditions already stipulated in the Environmental Clearance issued by the Environment Ministry. The Tribunal stating the brief facts of case justified its decision saying that it took into consideration three principles of environmental jurisprudence —Principal of Sustainable Development, Precautionary Principle and the Polluter Pays Principal. The Tribunal said the “execution of the present project, if carried out with due care, precaution and in consonance with the conditions imposed for environmental and ecological protection, would not be prejudicial to environment and ecology. The Tribunal has to balance the various factors which itself is an essential feature of Principle of Sustainable Development.” The Tribunal clearly stated that the Amaravati City project was being undertaken as a necessity of executive and legislative decisions. The State of Andhra Pradesh. has to have its capital and no better site than the present one has been brought on record of the Tribunal. The Tribunal also put on record that “large-scale works of the project have already been executed as huge public expense and any prohibitory order at this stage would not only jeopardise the financial interest of the State, but also become a serious environmental issue, capable of degrading the environment and ecology of the area to the disadvantage of the public interest as well.” Floodplains The important issues raised by the complainants and examined thoroughly by the Tribunal are environment clearance to the project, included floodplains of both Krishna river and Kondaveeti Vagu, a rivulet that flows in the capital area, high flood discharge, rich agricultural land, shifting of bunds (flood banks) and other issues that are not directly related to environment like land pooling and Sivarama Krishna Committee recommendations. Though the NGT discussed the issue of floodplains extensively in the order, environmentalists are not in agreement with the order. The Tribunal discussed the different meanings of the words ‘floodplain’ as used in the different documents submitted to it. Geomorphological signifies the term and nature of the surface and sub-surface deposit which are due to interaction of the elements in the area for millions of years. But this did not mean that the said area consists of active flood plains. A committee consisting of Dr V.V. Srinivas which made a study in June 2016 said that the floodplains do not go beyond the flood embankments (bunds) and the tribunal rejected that flood plains of Krishna River extend into the capital area. The complainants have contended that a large area on which the capital was being constructed was the flood plains of Krishna flood plains shown in an Environmental Impact Study (EIA) prior to 2009. Confusion River Conservation activists and Delhi Jal Board member Vikram Soni said that NGT got completely confused about the floodplains. According to him, floodpalins were sand aquifers that have formed on either side of the river over millions of years and not the area within the recent flood lines or the recently constructed embankments build to protect areas from floods. Floodplains were sand aquifers which were “natural infrastructure for storing water”. The flood plains of Yamuna were now providing water to a population of one million. The same could be done at Amaravati, he explained. Another contention by the complainants is that the capital area is agriculturally rich. The total area sown in the capital area during Kharif 2014 was 11,242 hectares. When compared to the 41,01,000 hectares the total area sown in the state it was 0.027% the Tribunal pointed out. Monitoring panel Not stopping with laying down the nine quite stringent conditions, the NGT stipulated the constitution of a supervisory committee and an implementation committee to ensure that all the conditions in the environmental clearance were implemented and reports sent to it every six months. State Government officials say that between the conditions laid by the NGT and the MoEF&amp;CC it would be a formidable task to build a capital. It was as good as cancelling the environmental clearance for the project. Minister for Municipal Administation P. Narayana, however, welcomed the NGT order. Speaking to the media on the day NGT issued the order, he said the Andhra Pradesh government would follow all the conditions stipulated in the Environmental Clearance. Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) general secretary and advocate V. Gurunadham said the NGT order was a “defeat that appeared like a victory” for the Andhra Pradesh Government. The State Government could not put a brick in the capital without taking the permission of the Centre, he said. Matter for infobox Though NGT differs with the complainants with the definition of the flood plains it has included in the order nine conditions it wanted to go with the conditions included in the Environment Clearance for the project. While thoroughly discussing the dispute between floodplains and flood studies, the Tribunal asked the A.P. Government to conduct a comprehensive study on hydrogeomorphology (science that focusses on the interaction and linkage of hydrological processes with landforms) or the area with a view to effectively plan water retention ponds, reservoirs, storm water drains and their interconnectivity, so as to optimise water conservation, both surface and sub-surface. In another condition the Tribunal specified that any alteration of the flood plains by construction of storm water drains, retention ponds and related development within the capital should be done only after conducting the hydrogeomorphology study. No alteration of the river or natural storm water morphology, flow pattern and location by way of straightening shall be permitted. No alteration to the pre-existing embankments except for strengthening for flood protection of the proposed city. Even such an exercise should be undertaken after detailed study of the flood pattern and hydraulics of the river or the storm water drains. All bulk generators of municipal solid waste in the proposed constructions, both residential and non-residential, must necessarily segregate water at the source and process entire biodegradable waste by composting or bio-methanation within the premises itself. The State should notify building bye-laws for rain water harvesting, use of solar energy, to have water saving fittings and fixtures in buildings, including use of treated grey water for non-consumptive uses like flushing and gardening and other horticultural and agricultural uses.

Tammy Webber & Jeff Karoub / AP,"(HICAGO) — The bitter cold that gripped the Midwest forced commuters to bundle up like polar explorers. By early next week, many of those same people might get by with a light jacket.
Just days after the arctic conditions, forecasts say, the region will seemingly swing into another season, with temperatures climbing by as much as 80 degrees. Experts say the rapid thaw is unprecedented, and it could create problems of its own — bursting pipes, flooding rivers and crumbling roads.
“I don’t think there’s ever been a case where we’ve seen (such a big) shift in temperatures” in the winter, said Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the Weather Underground firm. “Past record-cold waves have not dissipated this quickly. … Here we are going right into spring-like temperatures.”
Although many places remained painfully cold Thursday, the deep freeze eased somewhat, and the system marched east. Frigid weather descended on an area spanning from Buffalo to Brooklyn.
In western New York, a storm that dumped up to 20 inches of snow (51 centimeters) gave way to subzero temperatures and face-stinging wind chills. In New York City, about 200 firefighters battling a blaze in a commercial building took turns getting warm on buses. The number of deaths that could be blamed on the cold climbed to at least 15.
For the nation’s midsection, relief was as close as the weekend.
Rockford, Illinois, was at a record-breaking minus 31 (minus 35 Celsius) on Thursday morning but should be around 50 (10 Celsius) on Monday. Other previously frozen areas could see temperatures of 55 (13 Celsius) or higher.
The dramatic warm-up will offer a respite from the bone-chilling cold that canceled school, closed businesses and halted trains. But potholes will appear on roads and bridges weakened by the freeze-thaw cycle. The same cycle can crack water mains and homeowners’ pipes. Scores of vehicles will be left with flat tires and bent rims.
Joe Buck, who manages Schmit Towing in Minneapolis and spent about 20 hours a day outdoors this week responding to stranded vehicle calls, said he’s already taking calls for Monday to deal with a backlog of hundreds of stalled vehicles.
“Sunday is going to be 39 degrees ABOVE zero,” said Buck, who has had 18 trucks running around the clock in wind chills that dropped to minus 50.
In Detroit, where some water mains are almost 150 years old, city workers were dealing with dozens of breaks, said Palencia Mobley, deputy director of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department.
The thawing of the pipes can sometimes inflict greater damage than the initial freeze. Bursts can occur when ice inside starts to melt and water rushes through the pipe or when water in the pipe is pushed to a closed faucet by expanding ice.
Elsewhere, a bridge in the western Michigan community of Newaygo, 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of Grand Rapids was closed as the ice-jammed Muskegon River rose above flood stage. Officials in Buffalo, New York, watched for flooding on the Upper Niagara River because of ice.
In other signs that the worst of the deep freeze was ending, Xcel Energy on Thursday lifted a request to its Minnesota natural gas customers to temporarily lower their thermostats to ease concerns about the fuel supply.
Earlier in the day, several cities set record lows. Rockford saw a record low temperature of minus 31 (minus 35 Celsius), on Thursday. Cedar Rapids, Iowa, set a daily record low of minus 30 degrees (minus 34 Celsius).
Chicago’s temperature dropped to a low of around minus 21 degrees (minus 30 Celsius) on Thursday, slightly above the city’s lowest-ever reading of minus 27 degrees (minus 32 Celsius) in January 1985. Milwaukee’s low was minus 25 degrees (minus 31 Celsius), and Minneapolis recorded minus 24 degrees (minus 31 Celsius). Wind chills were lower still.
Masters, from Weather Underground, said the polar vortex was “rotating up into Canada” and not expected to return in the next couple of weeks. If it does return in late February, “it won’t be as intense.”
Still, memories of the dangerous cold were bound to linger.
In Illinois, at least 144 people visited hospital emergency rooms for cold-related injuries over two days. Most of the injuries were hypothermia or frostbite, according to a spokesman for the state Department of Public Health.
The effect on the overall economy was not expected to be that great.
“It only shows up marginally in the economic data,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, who ended up working from home because her offices in Chicago were shut because of weather.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said one reason the severe cold weather will have less impact is that, unlike a hurricane, people did not lose electric power.
“People may be in their homes, but they can do things such as online shopping,” Zandi said. “Life goes on. It is a disruption to daily life, but it is not a big hit to the economy.”

"Tessa Berenson / Pensacola, Fla.","Throughout his political career, from his own run for president in 2016 to stumping for down-ballot Republican candidates in 2018, Donald Trump has often used fear to motivate his supporters. In Montana on Saturday, he offered a glimpse into why. “I can only go for four of five minutes with that stuff,” Trump told a crowd at the Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport of the strong economy and jobs numbers. “When you’re fixing the problem, there’s no reason to go on about it for 45 minutes.” Later, in Pensacola, Florida, at his second rally of the day, Trump echoed the sentiment. “I’m looking to solve problems,” he said, “not to talk to the fact that we have done a great job.” At his midterm rallies, Trump does tout Republican successes. He read the same basic script at four rallies in four different states on Nov. 2 and 3, which included mention of tax cuts, designating Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and confirming record numbers of conservative judges to federal courts, with particular mention of new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. But he spent most of his time at the rallies, each of which lasted roughly an hour, describing the hypothetical horrors of Democratic rule to the audiences. He told the crowds in West Virginia, Indiana, Montana and Florida that Democrats would enact a “socialist takeover of the American healthcare system,” making the United States function more like Venezuela. He put the upcoming election in these terms at his appearance in Florida: “A Republican Congress means more jobs and less crime. A Democrat Congress means more crime and less jobs.” Trump paused, pleased with the slogan. “It’s pretty simple,” he said. “That’s cute.” As it has been since the day he announced his candidacy for president in 2015, Trump’s favorite issue to return to on this theme is immigration. For whatever Republican candidate he’s campaigning for, he tells the crowd that the Democratic opponent wants open borders and will let undocumented immigrants and criminals pour into the country. Talking about Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for governor of Florida, Trump said, “He wants to flood your cities with criminal aliens, because that’s what’s going to happen. … So when you have people camping out on your front lawn, remember Gillum.” He even suggested without evidence that Democrats had organized the migrant caravan making its way towards the United States. “They want to invite caravan after caravan, and it is a little suspicious how those caravans are started,” he said. But he noted explicitly that he thinks using the caravan as a political issue will help Republicans: “I think it’s a good thing, maybe, that they did it. Did they energize our base or what?” But Trump’s dark warnings about border crossings and undocumented immigrants are an uneasy match for Florida Governor Rick Scott, who appeared with Trump in Pensacola Saturday evening and hopes to unseat the Democratic Senator Bill Nelson. Hispanic voters make up 25% of Florida’s population and 17% of its registered voters, and Scott has been working hard to win them over. “Practicing Spanish every day is important,” Scott told TIME in a recent interview. “Twenty percent of those voting in this state speak Spanish.” Hillary Clinton carried 62% of Latinos in Florida as the Democratic nominee for President in 2016, but local polls show Scott could be making gains. Read More: Inside the Republican Plan to Win Hispanic Voters—And Battleground States “Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our sovereignty, overrun our borders and destroy our nation in so many ways,” Trump said in Florida. “We can’t let it happen.” The assembled crowd in the airport hangar cheered. When Scott took the stage, he didn’t mention immigration at all. Many in Trump’s base remain enthusiastic about the president, as evidenced by the crowds at his rallies throughout the country during his final, aggressive campaign swing ahead of Election Day. But for Republican candidates like Scott who are trying to broaden their support to counter the swelling activation on the left, Tuesday’s results could reveal whether Trump bringing his message of looming problems and a militarized border to their states helped, or whether the president perhaps should have spent more than “four or five minutes,” as he said, flaunting the economy and Republican accomplishments. It wasn’t all doom and gloom at Trump’s weekend events. He praised his supporters for being “the greatest political movement in the history of our country” and promised to deliver more tax cuts, more conservative judges and to build his signature border wall. “I’m a happy person,” Trump assured the crowd in Montana. “I’m a much happier person than you would believe.” But he believes talking about the problems, not the solutions, is the winning strategy.

LOUIS (AP) — The remnants of Tropical Depression Gordon are expected to drop heavy rain across much of Missouri through the weekend, creating a risk of flooding and flash-flooding. The National Weather Service says south-central Missouri and the St. Louis area could get up to 6 inches of rain by Sunday with more in some spots. With a flash flood watch covering the eastern three-quarters of the state, rivers are rising too. The Mississippi River is above flood stage at the Missouri towns of Canton, Hannibal, and Louisiana. The river is expected to crest in the coming days about 4 to 6 feet above flood stage. No major damage is expected but Hannibal has installed its flood wall to protect its downtown, including the Mark Twain sites. Portions of the Missouri River also are near or at technical flood stage, though only partially due to rain. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Thursday that higher-than-normal water releases from dams northwest of Missouri will continue through the fall season. The Corps said the water release is necessary because high amounts of runoff caused a large amount of water to be stored in reservoirs. The bigger concern being flash flooding, the Missouri State Highway Patrol urged drivers to avoid flooded roadways, noting that even one foot of water can move swiftly and prove deadly. The patrol also encouraged boaters to take extra precautions because rain-swollen waterways can make for faster currents and unpredictable conditions. It's unclear how much of the water will help farmers severely impacted by the summer-long drought. The U.S. Drought Monitor map shows that conditions have eased across much of the state due to rain over the past couple of weeks. Currently, 21 percent of Missouri is now listed in severe drought or worse, compared to 37 percent a week earlier. The wet weather is bringing relief from hot, steamy weather. After several consecutive days of temperatures in the 90s and high humidity, St. Louis is expected to see highs only in the low 70s Saturday and Sunday.","ST.

Sonoma County emergency officials have created an interactive map to track flooding, road and school closures, sandbag locations and power outages. 
The map shows the depth of flooding along Sonoma rivers, including the Russian River, which flooded earlier Tuesday night. 
Flood levels are at 46 feet at some of the worst areas along the Russian River. Flooding worsens as the river gets closer to the coast, near Jenner and Monte Rio. 
Guerneville is seeing moderate flooding at the Russian River, according to the map. 
Southern Sonoma County is also seeing flooding near Penngrove and Pealuma. Penngrove Park is experiencing 'major flooding' with water levels at the Willow Brook just over 60 feet.

"Adam Aton, Daniel Cusick, E&E News","A few inches separate turgid floodwater from everything Mona Houser owns. Some rooms in her trailer already dip below the water, and her family’s scared to flush the toilet for fear of what might come back up. She has no insurance and feels like nobody’s coming to help. “Us poor people, we’re screwed,” she said. The severity of Hurricane Florence’s destruction caught some residents here by surprise, and they said local officials are overwhelmed, too. The storm’s devastating flooding is a sign that coastal states should prepare for future hurricanes to hit harder—and differently—than they have in the past, according to experts who study climate change. For now, few cities or counties have begun adapting to storms that promise to be wetter, from rain and higher seas, because it’s hard to believe such extreme conditions could be common enough to plan for, said Sarah Watson of the Carolinas Integrated Science &amp; Assessments and the South Carolina Sea Grant Consortium. Florence’s rainfall hit especially hard because the region was already saturated by an unusually wet summer. North and South Carolina broke their annual rainfall records, joining Texas and Hawaii to make four new state records in the past year, according to The Washington Post. “Our challenge is trying to manage the everyday [weather] that suddenly seems completely out of character,” Watson said. “The afternoon thunderstorm that sits over a localized area and drops 6 inches of rain in two hours—you can’t adapt to that. You can’t build infrastructure to manage that. Even if you could, you couldn’t afford it.” ‘Not really our fault’ The Cape Fear River rose yesterday to 63 feet. That’s enough to discharge 33 times its average amount of water, according to preliminary measurements by the U.S. Geological Survey at Lillington, N.C. More than 72 hours after landfall, people hit by Florence are still desperate for help. The storm has killed at least 32 people and caused billions of dollars in damage. Tens of thousands of residents remained separated from their homes, especially in inland flood zones. Many of the areas underwater also flooded in 2016 during Hurricane Matthew. Some residents wondered why the region wasn’t better prepared for this one. The Cape Fear River has swelled to almost twice the height of its flood stage. Adapting to more frequent conditions like that will be slow, hard work, said Kirstin Dow, a University of South Carolina geographer who researches climate change decisionmaking. “I know people have been talking about this,” she said, “but it takes a very long time to make that kind of large-scale shift in thinking.” Cash-strapped rural communities sometimes need years to address problems. And in North Carolina, much of the state’s adaptation dollars have gone to wealthier cities like Raleigh and Charlotte, said Jessica Whitehead, a hazards adaptation specialist at North Carolina Sea Grant. “It’s been a luxury for communities that have the ability to think beyond the next year or five years,” Whitehead said. But for much of the rest of the state, she said, “the focus is on right now, today, maybe tomorrow.” ‘We have no choice’ Still, some residents didn’t have to think very hard about what adaptation would look like. They just pointed at what Florence broke. Laura Davis was angry that buildings constructed in the last decade fared so poorly in the storm. Her future sister-in-law’s new house lost its roof, and it felt like they’d been swindled, she said. “Every home in North Carolina should be covered for hurricanes. And we shouldn’t have to pay for it, because it’s not really our fault,” she said over the sound of a pump sucking out floodwater covering her backyard. Davis’ family moved to the Carolina coast from Virginia’s Tangier Island, one of the most vulnerable places in the country to climate change. Unlike that spot in the Chesapeake Bay, she sees plenty of opportunities to harden her town: drainage areas, more resilient cell towers, buried power lines. The problem is how to pay for those things in rural communities where the tax base is narrow and local government’s footprint is small. “A lot of people are still asking themselves, ‘What does this even look like in a small town in North Carolina?’” said Whitehead, whose program is headquartered at North Carolina State University. The damage from Florence adds up to a bigger problem for Davis’ family: “Our biggest concern is we’re not going to work this week. We’re not going to have money,” she said. Back in Houser’s trailer park, the water pooling around her home didn’t strike her as a mystery. The 53-year-old waved a Newport cigarette as she talked about how melting ice caps are affecting the weather. “I’m just a poor country girl, and I know about the environment,” she said, mentioning that nobody could miss how the beach waters had stayed so warm or how many summer days had cracked 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

"By Devin Rodriguez, Times Staff Writer","Flood warnings have been extended for the Alafia River in Lithia and the Little Manatee River at Wimauma as the National Weather Service continues to monitor a broad area of low pressure that has a building chance of developing into a tropical system. And with more rain expected the next few days, even more rivers could be at risk, forecasters said. The area of low pressure is drifting in the northwest Caribbean and could develop tropical conditions while it travels into the Gulf of Mexico by the end of the week, according to the National Hurricane Center. Forecasters place the chance of development around 40 percent in the next five days. But even if it did not develop into a tropical system, an already drenched region can expect even more showers and thunderstorms. RELATED: Less than one year after historic flooding, Alafia River spills its banks again ""At best, it will be spreading a lot of rain our way by the end of the week,"" said Paul Close, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service.. ""Most of the rain will fall on Friday and Saturday, its possible to continue into Sunday."" Close said this weekend will be very cloudy with off-and-on rain that will be very heavy in some areas. According to Close, the gulf waters are not warm enough for a low-pressure system to sustain tropical conditions. Chances for development will be higher later in the year when Gulf waters warm over the summer. But, Close warns, flooding could be a significant problem this week. ""Flooding will be a problem in general, especially urban flooding and low-lying areas,"" Close said. ""Weve had two or three days last week where we had 2-3 inches of rain within a few hours that flooded roads. That could happen this weekend."" A flood warning remains in effect for the Alafia River until Wednesday night. Flood stage is 13 feet, but as of Monday night at 9 p.m., it had reached 14.2 feet and is expected to rise to 14.5 feet on Tuesday before subsiding Wednesday afternoon. The Manatee River reached 11½ feet Monday night, a half-foot above flood stage. EXTENDED FORECAST: The 10-day outlook for the Tampa Bay area Over the next two days, the Tampa Bay area will see that familiar summertime rain pattern of scattered showers and thunderstorms firing up primarily in the afternoon, forecasters said. Tuesday morning temperatures sit in the low 70s with a lot of high humidity. By the afternoon, temperatures will rise to around 86 with a 60 percent chance of rain. High rain fall has caused some minor flooding in the area and caused four sinkholes to form at the Villages retirement community in Central Florida. As the week grinds on, folks should plan their morning and evening commutes with rain in mind. Rain chances will be at 60 percent throughout the week, and Memorial Day weekend could be a washout, forecasters said. 730 PM Special Tropical Weather Outlook. Medium chance (40%) of development of a broad low pressure system is possible late this week over the central or eastern Gulf of Mexico.

Oliver Cragg,"LG reveals Google Assistant-powered ThinQ Speaker ahead of CES 2018 Touted as LG’s “first premium smart AI audio product” LG says it worked with Google to deliver the full Assistant experience LG recently announced that it would be pooling together all of its AI-powered smart products under one sub-brand called ThinQ. Ahead of a broader reveal at CES 2018, LG has now revealed one of the first products that will carry the ThinQ name. The appropriately named ThinQ Speaker is being touted as LG’s “first premium smart AI audio product” that doubles up as a nifty smart home hub. The LG ThinQ Speaker is powered by Google Assistant and LG says it teamed up with Google directly to deliver the full Assistant experience. Read: What is Google Assistant? How can you use it? Google announced at IFA 2017 that more third-party smart speakers with Assistant would be hitting the market in the near future, but it sounds like LG’s will be one of the very few that supports Assistant’s complete AI repertoire, much like Google’s own Home devices. With rival devices from Sony, Panasonic, and JBL already vying for attention, not to mention the flood of Assistant-powered speakers expected to debut at CES 2018, LG appears to be targeting the relatively uncompetitive upper-end of the market by focusing on audio quality as well as AI smarts. In a press release (via 9to5Google ), LG talked up its new partnership with British firm, Meridian Audio. LG says that Meridian’s “advanced high-performance audio technology” ensures that products such as the ThinQ Speaker are capable of delivering “more natural and warm sound.” While Google is now offering a top-tier Home for audiophiles with the Home Max, LG’s ThinQ Speaker could fill a gap in the market between the regular Home and its $399 bigger brother. As such, the ThinQ Speaker’s price-tag will be very important. Unfortunately, LG hasn’t released any pricing details at this stage (or a release date), but we’ll keep an eye out for any details at CES 2018 where the company is expected to debut a handful of ThinQ products in its so-called ThinQ Zone from January 9-12th. What do you think of the LG ThinQ Speaker? Will it fare better than the SmartThinQ Hub ? Let us know in the comments.","LG's new AI-focused sub-brand, ThinQ, will kick off with the ThinQ Speaker - a premium Google Assistant-powered device for audio connoisseurs.",2017-12-28T12:39:05Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Androidauthority.com'}",LG reveals smart ThinQ Speaker with Google Assistant ahead of CES 2018,https://www.androidauthority.com/lg-thinq-smart-speaker-google-assistant-ces-2018-826098/,https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lg-thinq-speaker.jpg,,Androidauthority.com,flood-stage,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
MARY ANN KEARNS mary.kearns@lee.net,"The projected flood stage for the Ohio River at Maysville has gone up since Friday, according to information from the National Weather Service Ohio River Forecast Center. Forecasters are now predicting a crest on Tuesday at 54.5 feet, nearly two feet above Friday's forecast. Flood stage is 50 feet. Those numbers do not take into consideration any rainfall after Saturday, according to Scott Hickman of the NWS. Maysville officials planned to installed flood closures in the city's floodwall on Saturday. The wall protects the city to a river stage of 79 feet. In other communities along the Ohio River in our area, from Augusta to Vanceburg, flood waters were creeping upward and were expected to reach flood stage late Sunday or early Monday. In Augusta, the Riverwalk along Riverside Drive had mostly disappeared beneath the flood water by Sunday afternoon and the city river park was also flooded. In a post to its Facebook page, the Augusta Police Department said ""We expect the west end of the city to have water on Second Street by Monday. If you have any family or friends in this area please check on them and make sure they are aware of the forecast. If anyone needs help moving property please call Bracken County Dispatch 735-2700 and APD officers will try to come help."" According to the NWS, the river was expected to reach flood stage on Sunday afternoon and continue to rise to nearly 55 feet by early Tuesday afternoon. The river will fall below flood stage late Thursday morning. At stages near 55 feet, widespread backwater flooding can be expected and roads near the river become flooded, especially on the Ohio side of the river, according to NWS. Portions of U.S. 52 and Ohio 221 in Brown County flood, as well as secondary roads along Eagle Creek and Straight Creek, the NWS posted. Other communities which will be affected include Foster, Dover, Vanceburg, and Garrison in Kentucky and Ripley, Aberdeen and Manchester in Ohio. According to the Ohio River Forecast Center, flooding at the following stages will result in: -- 53.5 feet, Flooding occurs in low areas of Ripley and Aberdeen, Ohio. Areas within the floodplain are increasingly inundated. Backwater and lowland flooding can be expected along the river. The city of Maysville itself is protected to a stage just above 79 feet. -- 52 feet, Backwater flooding traveling up Red Oak Creek near Ripley, Ohio results in flooding along and east of Cherry Street, with water also approaching the Ripley Post Office. -- 51 feet, Water enters Huntington Park Power Plant and backwater and lowland flooding begins along creeks near Maysville. Backwater flooding also begins in Brown County, especially along Eagle and Straight Creeks. The City of Maysville itself is protected by flood walls to a stage just above 79 feet. -- 50 feet, Flooding of lowland areas near the river occurs in Mason County.

Andrew Martonik,"For Android and Google enthusiasts, there's no better time of year than Google I/O. This year's ""festival"" starts on May 8 and runs for three days in the sun of Northern California, and will be the stage for Google to make announcements of all sizes about its products, projects and initiatives. We'll hear about Android, Google Assistant, Chromebooks, Google Play and just about every other big Google product or service. But I/O isn't all about the flashy announcements and user-facing products — you could argue that isn't even a majority of what the conference is for. There's also all of the developer-focused announcements, talks, workshops and office hours available to let people learn more about how to interface with Google's technologies. This is, after all, a developer conference. Whether you're following along for the consumer or developer announcements, here's what you can expect from Google I/O 2018 when it kicks off on May 8. Android P Google has already dropped the Android P Developer Preview to give us an early look at the next operating system release. But it isn't until Google I/O that we start to get details on what Google's vision for these new features and changes is. Across a variety of sessions, we'll learn about how developers will be able to leverage the new APIs in Android P, including indoor positioning, richer notifications, improved fingerprint authentication, multi-camera support, and yes... display notches. The ""What's new in Android P"" session ( 2 p.m. May 8 ) will have hundreds of people watching in person and thousands catching the stream online. Google I/O is also our best opportunity yet to see what Google's thinking about with the design of Android P. The best we have right now is a cobbled-together testing interface in the Dev Preview, and a couple leaked screenshots — but we're almost guaranteed to see more up-to-date versions in use across I/O, even in areas where you wouldn't normally be looking for it. We could also catch glimpses of this purported new ""gesture"" navigation interface, a better look at the color palette and more changes in store for Google's own Pixels. Getting a new version of the Android P Developer Preview, potentially marked as the first ""Beta"" release, during I/O is completely expected. Google apps / Google Play In the Google I/O schedule, ""Android &amp; Play"" are grouped together — and that makes sense, because without Google Play and all of Google's great apps, Android isn't of much use to any of us. The main keynote ( 10:00 a.m. May 8 ) typically has a rundown of the big customer-facing updates to all of Google's big apps like YouTube, Photos, Gmail, Maps and more. Given the importance of Assistant in the last year, we should see an emphasis on AI throughout these big app updates. Unfortunately Google has this habit of announcing great new features for its flagship apps at I/O... only to release them months later, if at all. We may not actually get to see these updates in action at I/O, and have to wait for updates in the weeks and months after. We're unsure about the specifics, but are expecting updates to Google's strategy around Instant Apps and Progressive Web Apps (PWA). There's lots of overlap in capabilities here, and Google seems to be more interested in Instant Apps than PWAs — hopefully we can get more clarity on what's happening here based on Google's announcements. In either case, it's all about offering you native app-like experiences without necessarily going through the process of downloading, installing and launching a full app in the traditional sense. Android TV / Chromecast Google announced a new Android TV interface alongside Oreo, but unfortunately the rollout has seen all sorts of issues and hasn't actually made it to devices. That comes from a whole host of issues, but the underlying current of all of this is that Android TV just doesn't have a feeling of strong direction. We'll see Google's plans starting with the ""What's new in Android TV"" session ( 3 p.m. May 8 ) — and this update may even be large enough to warrant some time at the main keynote. The Android TV interface may actually get another refresh to focus more on Google's handful of content strengths (YouTube, Play Movies, key partner apps) and less so on the main interface and navigation — because it's clear that developers aren't flocking to Android TV. In short, Google may make Android TV a bit more like a Chromecast. We've seen leaks of a new compact HDMI dongle from Google that purportedly runs Android TV, which could be a clue as to the direction for the platform. Rumors have also swirled that Android TV could be in for a rebranding, much like Android Wear just changed to Wear OS, to reflect this move. As for Chromecast itself, we don't expect anything new to replace the current Chromecast Ultra — but depending on what happens with this potential Android TV dongle, there could be a shift in pricing of the current Chromecast lineup. Google Assistant / Google Home Google showed off about a dozen different Assistant-enabled Smart Displays at CES 2018, and four months later it's time we heard more about their availability. The only functional units we saw back in January were from Lenovo, and those were prototypes with limited features — at I/O, we should expect to see fully-functional devices with a finished interface that shows off how Google expects users to interact with these screens. Considering the fact that Google Home, Home Mini and Home Max are all relatively new and don't need to have their hardware refreshed on a regular basis, don't expect to hear anything new on those devices. I/O will be all about Smart Displays and the Assistant improvements that are applicable across the entire range. On the backend, Google's talking all about what it calls ""Actions"" — basically the way that you make your app or service available through Google Assistant across every device (i.e. calling an Uber from your Home using voice). There are a whopping 12 sessions about creating Actions for Google Assistant this year, which just shows how important Google feels it is. This isn't something that will manifest itself in a customer-facing change right away, but will hopefully increase the usability of third-party apps and services in Google Assistant in the year to come. Chrome / Chromebooks After Apple took a swing at Google with its recent education-focused event, expect Google to express its dominance in education with Chromebooks. We should get updates on Google's position in the education market, as well as a slew of updates on how Chromebooks continue to be a great choice for schools and children. After the announcement of the first Chrome OS tablet, the Acer Chromebook Tab 10, the flood gates for these types of devices should open at I/O. We'll learn more about changes to Chrome OS aimed at making it more friendly to tablet-like devices, including information on the state of the Android app framework on Chrome OS. More to that point, don't expect to see anything about tablets running Android — the emphasis will be on Chrome OS. VR / AR On the AR side, we'll see an update to Google's ARCore platform — bumping up to version 1.2. It's expected to offer better surface handling, better correction for light and shadows, and most importantly support for even more phones. That will extend to Google's ""AR Stickers"" as well, which should expand to more people soon. We just saw Oculus unveil its standalone Oculus Go VR headset, and now it's time for Google to show what it has going on in virtual reality. We should see a refreshed interface for Daydream, available whether you're using your phone or a standalone headset. And on that second point, we expect Google to focus on Daydream Standalone rather than the ""regular"" Daydream headsets that require a phone — these Standalone units are cheaper, fully contained and address a wider market than just people who have new high-end phones. VR is nothing without content, and Google should be showing off a lot — both from VR180 camera projects and with partnerships for educational content. Security I/O is the perfect time for the top security people at Google to review 2017's security goals and what the landscape of Android and Chrome looks like. The ""What's new in Android security"" session ( 9:30 a.m. May 10 ) is one of the most popular every year, because we get to hear the nitty-gritty about what Google's doing to keep our data safe when using Android. Typically that'll include talk about Google Play's security measures, what's worked well in Android Oreo, and what the impact is expected to be from the further security enhancements in Android P. This also typically offers up a few nuggets about the security practices of Android users as a whole, such as how many are using a secure lock screen or apps and services that use encryption. Rumors are pointing to Google announcing a new system that would certify specific devices to run certain apps, for security reasons, and make those apps unable to run if side-loaded to other devices. Developer tools Google's support for the Kotlin programming language was an applause-worthy announcement at I/O 2017, and we'll see even more on the language this year. We won't see a bunch of announcements around Kotlin, but there are several technical sessions focused on helping developers work with this new language now that it's been available for several months. You'll notice a distinct lack of discussion about writing in Java — that's because Kotlin is the new hotness. Kotlin will be the main language talked about at I/O, but you'll also hear about Flutter. It's a lightweight development language designed for quickly creating and launching apps across various platforms while hooking in natively to the platform's APIs. Flutter will also be discussed in reference to using Material Design across different platforms rather than just Android. We'll also hear about updates to Android Studio, as well as the Firebase console and many of Google's other developer tools. These aren't sexy changes, but they're ones that will be repaid in higher-quality apps across the board. Get ready for the show Google I/O runs May 8-10, and gets started in earnest with the opening keynote at 10:00 a.m. PT on May 8. The Android Central team will be on the ground in Mountain View to cover it all, so be sure to follow our coverage all week long!","Here's what you can expect to see at Google's annual developer conference.

ABC News,"More than 2 million households and businesses in 13 states across the Northeast were without power Saturday morning after a powerful storm flooded streets, toppled trees and knocked out electricity. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. The nor'easter led to the deaths of at least seven people in several states. Most were killed by falling trees or branches, according to ABC affiliates. Among the victims was a 6-year-old boy who died early Friday morning when a tree fell onto his family’s home while he was asleep in Chester, Virginia, according to ABC affiliate WRIC in Richmond, Virginia. The fierce storm brought heavy rain, wind and snow to the region, causing rough seas and coastal flooding. The storm strengthened rapidly Friday, undergoing what's known as bombogenesis or ""bombing out,"" when a low-pressure system drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. Numerous roads remained closed Saturday morning due to debris, fallen trees and downed power lines. Air and Rail service across the Northeast was impacted significantly with delays and cancellations. Amtrak began to restore service Saturday morning, after it suspended all service on its Northeast Corridor Line on Friday amid the height of the storm. There were still 2,089,349 customers without power in states across the Northeast as of Saturday 10 a.m. ET. Several communities in Massachusetts were in complete darkness. Emergency workers in Duxbury, Massachusetts, work to rescue a horse under a structure that collapsed during storm. In eastern Massachusetts, a storm surge reported to be as high as 3 feet caused widespread street flooding. Numerous people had to be rescued from the rising waters, particularly in the city of Quincy, where the National Guard performed rescues overnight. Boston Harbor saw historic flooding as the nor’easter coincided with high tide on Friday. The current record at Boston Harbor was set just in January at 15.16 feet. Friday morning's high tide fell just short of that, peaking at 14.67 feet, for the city's third-highest flooding on record, according to the National Weather Service. Later Friday, just before midnight, the high tide peaked at 13.83 feet, with a 2.9-foot storm surge, according to the National Weather Service. Another high tide near 14.6 feet is forecast around noon Saturday. Along Cape Cod, the high tide on Saturday will reach near major flood stage, and will once again be in the top three crests on record. A firefighter instructs a pedestrian to keep back from an uprooted tree blocking a residential street and downed power line, March 2, 2018, in Swampscott, Mass. Top rainfall totals came in East Bridgewater, Massachusetts, which received 5.74 inches of rain, while Cobleskill, New York, set the high mark with 39.3 inches of snow. Barnstable, Massachusetts, saw the highest wind gust on Friday at 93 mph, while Boston saw a 70 mph gust and New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport measured one at 67 mph. Nor’easters along the East Coast get their name because the winds over the coastal area are typically from the northeast. The weather radar and satellite Saturday morning showed precipitation has moved offshore with only a few rain showers and snow bands remaining over the Northeast. With the storm moving slowly out to sea, there could be more coastal flooding from Virginia to Maine during the high-tide cycles Saturday. People stand at the entrance to a pizza shop as water floods a street, in Scituate, Mass., March 2, 2018. While the storm is several hundred miles away, wind gusts could reach 30 to 50 mph through much of the day Saturday across the Northeast, including in all major cities along the Interstate 95 corridor. The strong gusty winds will hamper recovery efforts, especially in restoring power. Waves crash against a seawall near the Scituate Lighthouse, March 2, 2018, in Scituate, Mass.

Joe Rossignol,"With the year quickly drawing to a close, now is an opportune time to reflect on the biggest Apple rumors and leaks of 2017. Many new products released by Apple this year were widely rumored in the months leading up to their introductions, including the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, Apple Watch Series 3, Apple TV 4K, HomePod, and new iPads. We even had an advanced look at software features like Animoji. 2017 was a particularly interesting year for Apple rumors given leaked or prematurely released versions of iOS 11 and HomePod firmware contained references to several products that had yet to be announced. While not every rumor proved true, much of Apple's roadmap this year was revealed ahead of time. We've rounded up some of the most notable rumors and leaks of the year, primarily focusing on information that proved to be accurate. 2017 in Rumors iPhone X iPhone X is so radically different that rumors about the device began to surface all the way back in early 2016, so we'll start with a primer. The first report about Apple's plans to release a high-end iPhone with an OLED display this year came from Japan's Nikkei Asian Review in March 2016, roughly a year and a half before the iPhone X was unveiled. In the same month, DigiTimes revealed the device would have a 5.8-inch display, and KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said it would have glass on both the front and back sides, a metal frame, wireless charging, and facial or iris recognition. By April 2016, the device was being called the iPhone 8. Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz said it wouldn't have a home button. iPhone X renders from June 2017 via iDrop News In May 2016, Daring Fireball 's John Gruber heard early scuttlebutt suggesting the device would have an edge-to-edge display, with the front-facing camera, Touch ID, and other sensors hidden under the display. The information provided to Gruber wasn't entirely accurate, but he was on the right track. Rumors continued to surface about Apple removing the home button and adopting facial or iris recognition in lieu of Touch ID. In September 2016, Kuo said stainless steel would likely be Apple's metal of choice for the iPhone X's frame, with slightly curved 2.5D cover glass on top of the display, as used since the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Rumors also began picking up about the iPhone X having a vertically-aligned dual-lens camera with dual optical image stabilization. iPhone X part leak in June 2017 reveals vertically-aligned dual-lens camera By the end of 2016, several reports had claimed Apple would release a trio of new iPhones in 2017, including the all-new 5.8-inch model and updated 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models to replace the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The first iPhone X rumors of 2017 lent credence to the device having a stainless steel frame, facial recognition, and support for inductive charging, rather than RF-based over-the-air wireless charging from Energous. February was a busy month for iPhone X rumors, with the device said to have 64GB and 256GB storage options, 3GB of RAM, no Touch ID, a higher-capacity two-cell L-shaped battery pack, and a ""revolutionary"" front camera with 3D facial recognition that we now know as the TrueDepth system. Around that time, we also learned the device would have a starting price of at least $1,000 in the United States. In March, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dismissed a rumor about the iPhone X having a USB-C connector, noting that it would still have a Lightning connector with support for fast charging via USB-C Power Delivery. In late March, analysts at Barclays said the iPhone X would have a True Tone display that shifts colors based on ambient lighting. In April, we saw the first schematic of the iPhone X's sensor housing, more commonly known as the notch. The notch houses the front camera, an infrared camera, a flood illuminator, a dot projector, a microphone, an ambient light sensor, a proximity sensor, and an earpiece that doubles as a speaker. Rumors about Apple placing Touch ID on the back of the iPhone X persisted into May, but they ultimately proved to be inaccurate. Also in May, we learned the device would have louder stereo speakers. June was filled with the first iPhone X part leaks, mockups, screen protectors, and dummy units that all pointed towards the device having an all-screen design except for the notch. MacRumors also saw hints of the iPhone 8 showing up in web analytics, suggesting Apple was testing the device internally. July saw both KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Bloomberg confirm that Face ID would fully replace Touch ID on the iPhone X. Perhaps the biggest iPhone X leak to date came in late July courtesy of Apple itself. Shortly after the company accidentally released an internal version of firmware for its upcoming HomePod speaker, developers uncovered a glyph of an iPhone with an all-screen design except for a notch at the top. iPhone X glyph from leaked iOS 11 golden master The HomePod firmware proved to be a gold mine for iPhone X leaks, revealing the device's infrared face detection, tap to wake function, split-up status bar, 4K video recording at up to 60 FPS, Face ID compatibility with Apple Pay, suppressed notification sounds when looking at the screen, and much more. Despite so much of the iPhone X being revealed in the HomePod firmware, August still saw some fresh leaks, including a photo of the device's A11 Bionic chip. Japanese website Mac Otakara also reported that the iPhone X's inductive charging ability would support transmission of up to 7.5 watts of power. As if the HomePod firmware leaks weren't bad enough for Apple, MacRumors was anonymously provided with download links to a final version of iOS 11 in early September. The software update contained several unredacted references to unannounced iPhone X hardware and software features. MacRumors uncovered iPhone X screenshots within the iOS 11 filesystem that showed off the new gesture-based home screen indicator. There were also hints that the elongated side button, previously known as the sleep-wake button, could be held to activate Siri or double tapped to bring up the Apple Pay wallet. The golden master of iOS 11 also referenced the Face ID name for Apple's facial recognition system, True Tone support, a collection of new iPhone X wallpapers, and Apple's new Portrait Lighting feature, including the Contour Light, Natural Light, Stage Light, Stage Light Mono, and Studio Light options. Within the iOS 11 filesystem, we also found a video file showing four different Animoji characters, including a monkey, cat, dog, and robot. The discovery made it clear that Apple had been working on animated emoji that could presumably be controlled with the iPhone X's then-rumored facial recognition system. The iOS 11 golden master soon made its way into the hands of some developers, who continued to make discoveries, including technical details about the A11 Bionic being a six-core chip with two high power cores and four low power cores. The golden master also contained a device tree that confirmed the iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus names of Apple's latest smartphones. iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus Originally dubbed the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, rumors about the new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models first surfaced in March 2016. At the time, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple could launch new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sized iPhones with LCDs in 2017, with the iPhone X serving as a high-end option. Japan's Nikkei Asian Review said likewise in August 2016. Kuo followed up with a research note in September 2016 claiming the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus would feature aluminum frames sandwiched between glass on both the front and back sides, with stainless steel limited to the high-end iPhone X. Two more research notes from Kuo in November 2016 specified that the iPhone 8 would have a single-lens camera, while the iPhone 8 Plus would have a dual-lens camera, and that both devices would support inductive charging. In late March 2017, analysts at Barclays said the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus would have a True Tone display. Kuo was back at it in March as well, claiming that the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus would retain Lightning connectors, but with newly added fast charging capabilities via the USB-C Power Delivery specification. In April, Apple's manufacturing partner TSMC reportedly began production of the A11 Bionic chip for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. In August, leaker Benjamin Geskin shared a photo of a bare logic board for the iPhone 8 Plus with pads etched on it for the A11 chip and an Intel modem for Wi-Fi and LTE. Apple Watch Series 3 Heading into the Apple Watch's third year, speculation continued about the potential for the device's first major redesign. Just three days into 2017, however, Taiwanese publication Economic Daily News reported that Series 3 models wouldn't feature any significant design changes, with a focus on internal battery and performance improvements. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also ruled out any obvious form factor changes. Meanwhile, in March, Wall Street analyst Christopher Rolland said Series 3 models would likely include a SIM card for LTE connectivity. He shared his information following a trip to Asia, where many of Apple's suppliers are located. Bloomberg also said Series 3 models would be available with a cellular connection in a report in August, nearly one year after it reported that Apple had hit a roadblock in adding LTE support to Series 2 models. Apple allegedly chose to delay adding the functionality due to battery life considerations. These rumors were essentially confirmed in late July, when Apple accidentally released firmware for its upcoming HomePod speaker that contained a reference to a codenamed Apple Watch with an embedded SIM card. Then, just days before Apple's event, a final version of iOS 11 leaked to MacRumors revealed an image of an Apple Watch with signal bars and a red Digital Crown, which essentially confirmed that Series 3 models would have cellular connectivity. The image also lent credence to a lack of design changes. Beyond this year, we learned that future Apple Watch models could feature an EKG heart monitor, self-adjusting watch bands, and a wearable battery. Apple TV 4K Bloomberg revealed that Apple was working on a new Apple TV with support for 4K and HDR video playback in February 2017. Apple TV rumors then quieted down until July, when MacRumors reader Tomas Jackson and some other customers realized that Apple had labeled select movies as 4K and HDR in their iTunes purchase history. 4K HDR movies in iTunes naturally foreshadowed an Apple TV with 4K HDR support. Just a week later, developer Guilherme Rambo discovered a reference to a 4K HDR display mode with support for both the Dolby Vision and HDR10 color formats in an accidentally released HomePod firmware file. Both pic.twitter.com/bsuxptLWd1 — Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) August 5, 2017 Rambo also discovered a few HDR references in a tvOS 11 beta later in August. The assets were attributed to model number J105, which Bloomberg had identified as the new Apple TV's codename back in February. MacRumors also uncovered the J105 codename in the accidentally released HomePod firmware. Apple's software mishaps were the gift that kept giving, as developer Steven Troughton-Smith dug through the leaked version of iOS 11 and discovered the new Apple TV would feature an A10X Fusion chip and 3GB of RAM. HomePod The initial report about Apple developing a Siri-based smart speaker was actually back in May 2016 by The Information. 2017's first rumor came in April, when Australian leaker Sonny Dickson told MacRumors that Apple's speaker would resemble the shape of the latest Mac Pro and have a meshed design across much of its exterior. Dickson also said the speaker was codenamed B238 and would run a variant of iOS, both of which are true. Dickson, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and Bloomberg all said there was a strong likelihood the speaker would debut at WWDC 2017 in June, and Apple introduced the HomePod at the event accordingly. In July, developers Steven Troughton-Smith and Avery Magnotti dug through accidentally released HomePod firmware files and discovered the speaker runs a full iOS software stack, has accessibility features like VoiceOver, has 1GB of RAM, and has a visible LED waveform for Siri that measures in at 272x340 pixels. So the #HomePod probably has a screen like this. If it's the right density could easily show basic things like temperature &amp; weather icons pic.twitter.com/l5f16EkddV — Alan Miller (@rosewoodat5th) July 28, 2017 In August, developer Guilherme Rambo shared a video that revealed the setup process for the HomePod using an iPhone. There's an option to choose a Siri voice followed by an authentication process, an option to share settings from other devices, and a menu to select the room where the speaker is located. Apple has delayed the HomePod's launch until early 2018, so we might find out even more details about the speaker between now and then. 10.5-inch iPad Pro The first word of a 10.5-inch iPad Pro was actually back in August 2016 and it came from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. In January 2017, Kuo reiterated that Apple would release an all-new 10.5-inch iPad Pro with a faster A10X Fusion chip in 2017 alongside an updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro and a low-cost 9.7-inch iPad. Japanese website Mac Otakara, Taiwanese website DigiTimes, and analysts at investment bank Barclays generally agreed Apple would release a new iPad Pro in the 10-inch range at some point in 2017, but the reports were conflicting about details such as the exact display size and release date. In February, IHS Markit revealed the 10.5-inch display would be surrounded by narrower bezels and have a resolution of 2,224×1,668 pixels. While there were initially rumors about Apple unveiling the 10.5-inch iPad Pro at March or April events, the tablet was ultimately announced alongside a second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro at WWDC 2017 in June. Kuo expects more revolutionary changes to the iPad Pro in 2018, perhaps including an OLED display. What's Next? Heading into 2018, rumors will now shift towards the so-called iPhone X Plus, iPad Pro models with Face ID, HomePod, and more. Apple is also working on a modular Mac Pro with no specific release date. A busy year lays ahead, so keep it locked on MacRumors for the latest Apple news and rumors.","With the year quickly drawing to a close, now is an opportune time to reflect on the biggest Apple rumors and leaks of 2017.

Julie Sprankles,"I don't know about you, but I'm a big fan of money. Scratch that—I do know about you, because let's be real, we're all big fans of money. Alas, cash isn't the easiest of things to hold onto, especially when the cost of housing seems to increase exponentially each year. All hope is not lost, however. If you can work up the nerve, you can negotiate your rent. And while haggling with your landlord won't make you a millionaire overnight, it could help you knock $100 off your monthly rent. Over time, that kind of cash adds up, my friend. So if you're looking to save a few bucks to put toward something worthwhile (like investing in your future), give the following ideas a try. Offer to put money down upfront It's an unfortunate reality that, occasionally, tenants skip out on their rent. It makes sense then that your landlord would find it appealing to get a large portion of the lease contract paid for upfront. If you can swing, let's say, three to six months of rent in advance, there's a good chance your landlord would be amenable to lowering your monthly payment a bit. It's basically a discount for buying in bulk. Bring something to the table Everyone has something they can use as a bargaining chip. Think about your strengths as they pertain to your apartment building. Could you help stage model apartments prior to walk-throughs? Maybe marketing is more in your wheelhouse and your landlord needs help establishing a social media presence for the complex. Get creative! You possess some skill or talent you can likely barter for a lower rent. (Really, you do!) Point out comps If you feel like your apartment is over-priced, do some market research. Find out how much other apartments in the area that are comparable to yours are charging per month. Do they include any utilities? Do they have a clubhouse? If you can make a solid case that you could pay less to live somewhere else that offers everything your apartment does, your landlord might just play ball so as not to lose your lease altogether. Sign an extended lease Good renters can be hard to come by, and having to find new trustworthy tenants every year can be a major hassle for a landlord. If you don't plan on leaving the area anyway, offer to sign an extended lease agreement contingent upon your landlord reducing your rent. Guaranteeing consistent rent from responsible tenants for a longer time span is pretty good incentive for a landlord faced with finding new tenants or, worse, dealing with undesirable vacancy. Agree to an earlier move-out notice The logic here is very similar to the logic of signing an extended lease — since finding good new tenants can be a long and tedious process, it's in your landlord's best interest to have more than the standard one month's notice when a tenant moves out. This gives them ample time to vet all applications and conduct interviews, if so desired. Put in some elbow grease You've been looking at those overgrown shrubs in front of your apartment complex for a hot minute, so why not do something about it? By offering to do odd jobs for your landlord or apartment manager you get to kill two birds with one stone: beautifying your apartment and adding tangible value to your tenancy. Just make sure you set parameters ahead of time to ensure no one gets taken advantage of. Pick the right time As with most things in life, timing is everything. If you approach your landlord about dropping your rental rate during the middle of summer when they are slammed with inquiries, they probably won't budge much. After all, that flood of potential tenants knows the rent and is still interested. Instead, broach the convo in the ""off-season,"" which generally runs from around November to April. Ask for their opinion My quintessentially Southern grandma was quite fond of the idiom, ""You'll catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."" The gist of the sentiment is that people are much more receptive when the person they're dealing with is polite. One way to apply this logic in real life is to frame the rate reduction as though you're asking for advice, i.e. ""I'd hate to leave, but I don't know if I can swing the rent as is. What do you think I should do?"" People love to feel like their opinion is valued. Re-edited from a post originally published 10.26.2016 - TW","I don't know about you, but I'm a big fan of money.

Brought to you by Marijuana VentureFor roughly 20 years the getting was good in Northern California. From the legalization of medical marijuana in 1996 to beginning the transition into adult-use sales in 2016, cannabis growers in the remote, northern forestland enjoyed an idyllic life, earning a small share of fame and fortune at the constant risk of being raided by the DEA.
Those days are over.
The surrounding communities of Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity counties, long abandoned by the logging industry, were in many ways saved by medical marijuana, but those legacy growers now face new challenges. Legalization may have brought legitimacy to the northern guerilla growers, but the price of operating in the adult-use market has increased dramatically, forcing many longtime growers into early retirement or back into the black market.
Those who remained in the game had to get a license and struggle against deep-pocketed competition.
“It’s sad to see some of the best growers I know decide to retire and bow out to what’s happening,” says Ryan Zuccaro, the founder and co-owner of Fresh Off the Hill in Humboldt County. “I’m all about change, but some people can’t handle that change.”
Recognition for the world-famous growing region remains high, but many advantages of the Emerald Triangle have become hindrances for commercial commerce. Meanwhile, with the introduction of cannabis to the agricultural hub of central California, Emerald Triangle growers are turning to new business models, opportunities for expansion and cost-saving techniques to stay out of its monolithic shadow.

Cost Competitive
The Emerald Triangle’s small, family farms can’t compete in terms of scale with the giant commercial producers in the Salinas Valley and other agricultural hubs. But in terms of overhead and focus, farms such as Shepherd’s Meadow in Mendocino County have a distinct advantage.
“At Shepherd’s Meadow, it’s really only me and my wife,” co-owner and head cultivator Brandon Waluk says. “I get a little bit of help from friends, but basically, it’s just me.”
Waluk aims to preserve his serene family life by focusing on flower quality and economic and environmental sustainability. The majority of his farm’s operating costs are offset by solar panels, and while the farm only has approximately 7,000 square feet in production, every plant at every stage gets personal care from Waluk.
“It’s from a desire to grow the best herb possible by any means,” Waluk says. “We’re conscientious of everything.”
After growing cannabis for nearly 20 years, Waluk is always tinkering with his formulas to produce better flower. The farm utilizes indoor, outdoor and greenhouse production techniques as well as home-brewed compost teas, integrated pest management, Korean natural farming practices, reusable soil and fine-tuned nutrient regimens.
“I love being able to bang something out and try something new. I love that,” Waluk says. “But what I like about outdoor is that I get all the time to build the soil and do all the cool stuff you can do with living dirt. It comes back to sustainability. When you turn off the light as you leave the room, it’s not just saving you money, it’s also that oil isn’t burning somewhere for that power. It’s common sense.”
Growers like Waluk also have an advantage over their southern competition with the branding and legacy of the Emerald Triangle cannabis community. But maintaining a premium price for niche, hand-grown and hand-trimmed cannabis, isn’t sold on just a zip code. Waluk and his wife are constantly updating their social media feeds, giving consumers and vendors an inside look at the farm’s beautiful scenery and organic cultivation practices.

Clone Wars
At Humboldt Highline, co-owner Josh Monschke doesn’t mince words when it comes to the company’s new focus on clone sales over flower.
“For us, it was that the price of flower has gone to s--t,” he says. “The nursery was a revenue generator.”
To be fair, the colorful price Monschke is referring to is $1,100 a pound; enough to validate the farms’ hilltop property, but not reliable enough to continue building the company.
“The farms, for me, they’re really great and they’re up in the hills and really pretty,” Monschke says. “But logistically, it’s challenging.”
Humboldt Highline straddles the line between farm and nursery. For Monschke and a small group of other farms in the area, clone sales have been mostly a side business. Nearly every farm focuses on flower and little else, he says. But as competition has driven the price of flower down, the value of clones remained roughly the same. Although Humboldt Highline’s clone operation is roughly one-third the size of its flower site, it has become the company’s leading source of revenue.
Monschke says the clone nursery is not the romanticized Humboldt farm people tend to expect, which can be frustrating during a time when companies are actively seeking new partners.
“With investors, the clones aren’t exciting to them,” he says, “but you show them the numbers and they get more excited.”
Humboldt Highline’s asking price for a single clone is $8. The average order the company receives is between 1,000 and 1,500 cuttings. Clones take 14 to 18 days to be ready for sale, and the company staggers its production schedule so its next wave of inventory is always just days away. Humboldt Highline is in the process of tripling the size of its nursery from 7,000 square feet to 21,000.
“I thought there would be more people producing clones, but people seem to focus more on flower,” Monschke says. “It pays better than flower, that’s why I don’t get it.”

King of the Hill
While most Emerald Triangle growers are buckling down or transitioning to a specific niche, Ryan Zuccaro is gearing up to compete directly against commercial farms in central California. Zuccaro owns roughly 250 acres in Humboldt County, and the company he founded, Fresh Off the Hill, is adding another 363 acres and 23 greenhouses, as well as a distribution license he hopes will make his company a logistical hub for California.
“We were getting murdered on distribution,” he says. “Everyone has got their own motives and it’s not usually in my favor. When my weed gets white-labeled I know it goes straight down to San Diego and my brand recognition is not going to be there.”
Like the majority of Emerald Triangle cultivators, Fresh Off the Hill benefits from its Humboldt location and its packed Instagram account of charming hillside plots overlooking Northern California. But that’s mostly for branding. The real production happens further down the hill at its 363-acre plot where the land is flatter.
“We got test results that came in at 33 percent (total cannabinoids) yesterday. It was all full sun, all outdoor, seed starts,” Zucarro says. “I am going to safely say that we’re going to get our 2,000 pounds (of flower) and hopefully some more.”
Despite Fresh Off the Hill more than doubling its size over the next year, Zuccaro says the focus remains on sustainability.
“It’s been exploding right now,” Zuccaro says. “But we’re cutting our costs and putting our money into places that we see it come back to us. We’re just trying to grow the best pot we can for as cheap as possible.”
Fresh Off the Hill, Humboldt Highline and Shepherd’s Meadow are just a handful of the farmers striving to continue the Emerald Triangle’s legacy of world-famous cannabis. With the right management and business practices, Northern California’s savvy cannabis businesses can remain high enough on their hillsides to keep dry during the oncoming flood of flower.
“Things change. Manufacturers here cannot make 600 percent over what they put in,” Zuccaro says. “You have to be realistic and look at a good 5-10 percent margin and be okay with that.”","Growers no longer have to hide their crop from cops in helicopters, which was the one real advantage the Emerald Triangle had for growing weed.",2019-04-10T13:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Greenentrepreneur.com'}",The Emerald Triangle's Brutal Pivot From Black Market to Legal,https://www.greenentrepreneur.com/article/331768,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20190404182228-GettyImages-863940682-crop.jpeg,,Greenentrepreneur.com,flood-stage,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Natashah Hitti,"British designer Es Devlin and U2 's creative director Willie Williams have Bono into a giant avatar version of himself using augmented reality for the band's latest tour. The augmented reality (AR) spectacle forms part of the band's Experience + Innocence tour, which kicked off in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last Wednesday. A ""sculptural block of cinema screen,"" positioned at the centre of the arena plays a series of still images – charcoal drawings – that act as triggers for the AR technology. When audience members look through the custom-made U2 Experience app on their smartphone, the trigger drawings are transformed into a series of superimposed, AR images and videos. The first part of the AR display plays during the pre-show music, and sees the stage recast as an enormous iceberg that gradually melts into water, flooding the floor of the arena and ""engulfing the audience in the deluge,"" describes Devlin. The AR trigger image then splits and shifts to reveal U2's lead singer Bono embodied by a giant AR avatar that ""looms magically"" over the audience, and echoes the singer's movements as he sings the first song, Love Is All We Have Left. According to Devlin, the pre-show flood ""prefigures the cataclysm of the tsunami"" that comes at the mid-point of the show, visually enacted as a series of waves across the screen during the song The End of the World. This tsunami amalgamates all the projected elements already seen throughout the first half of the show in a ""chaotic"" collage of waves. U2's Experience + Innocence tour follows the band's 2015 Innocence + Experience tour. The two shows are grounded in the Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience albums. Devlin explains that these albums include much autobiographical and reflective material that spans the band's formative period in 1980's Dublin, through to their personal and political present. ""Like the 2015 Innocence + Experience tour, the new Experience + Innocence tour is grounded in the story of the void left by the death of the then-teenage singer's mother, and the subsequent shaping of the four band members by the visceral political turbulence and military violence of 1980's Ireland,"" Devlin told Dezeen. ""While much of Songs of Innocence was written as if reliving and revisiting in vivid detail the territory of 1980's Dublin – as if reinhabiting those characters in the first person – much of the material in Songs of Experience takes a more macro narrative stance, almost as if the narrator is writing from beyond life,"" continued Devlin. ""The urgency of the reinhabited turbulent, raging youth in innocence is seceded to an equally urgent but more distant stance in experience, as if the camera has shifted from extreme granular close up to all encompassing wide shot."" According to the designer, the new show takes a line from the track Love Is All We Have Left as its guiding principle: ""Now you're at the other end of the telescope."" ""The line refers to the shift in perspective that the narrator of some of the Songs of Experience has adopted,"" said Devlin. ""Events of the past are now seen through a futurist lens as the narrative is picked up where the 2015 tour left off."" The U2 Experience + Innocence app enables members of the audience to take photographs that simultaneously capture both live and AR elements. The app and the material within it were conceived by U2’s creative director Williams, who has been working on innovative technology for the band for 30 years. Williams worked with Treatment Studio on the design of the avatar itself, and with Nexus Studios on the AR technology. The direction and design of the show is the result of a collaboration between U2, Willie Williams, Es Devlin and Stufish Studios, which began in 2014. Devlin recently also created a 30-foot-high cracked ""afrofuturist"" mask for The Weeknd's stage set at Coachella music festival, which is animated by projection-mapped lighting.",British designer Es Devlin and U2's creative director Willie Williams have Bono into a giant avatar version of himself using augmented reality for the band's latest tour.

Just two months ago, I kicked off something I've never done before: a speaking tour.
Based on my book Her Big Idea, my talk wrestles with big questions surrounding the self-doubt we all feel when considering action upon our ideas, with the ultimate message as the encouragement to just go for it and start before you're ready.
Related: 7 Powerful Public Speaking Tips From One of the Most-Watched TED Talks Speakers
So, taking my own advice, I embarked on my speaking tour. I started before I was ready, and launched my tour with a speech at Harvard, and expanded to Columbia, Yale, Northeastern and the University of Colorado at Boulder in the past two months. Here's what I learned from the six speeches I gave as a new speaker.
1. Be 100 percent, totally yourself in front of a crowd.
I know this sounds cliche, but it's hard to get up in front of a room of people and feel like you can act authentically, like the way you'd talk to your best friend. You may feel that you have to mold yourself to a specific crowd or act more ""professional"" or ""professor-like"" to be taken seriously. Audiences don't want that.
At one of the first talks I gave, I could sense that the energy in the room was low. It was around 4 p.m., and the audience had been in conference since the early morning. Since it was my third talk, I felt comfortable enough with myself that I simply eased into my content, cracking jokes, making fun of myself and injecting energy with my bubbly personality. The audience immediately loosened up, laughed at my jokes and I noticed how many in the audience physically leaned in because I approached them as a room full of friends rather than as a ""class"" or audience.
Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx, exercises this same authentic approach in her talks ... and actually broke Instagram momentarily during her talk at the MA Conference for Women. In her talk, she made fun of herself and her early days rather than keeping it serious or boasting about her success. It resonated so much with the audience that she earned 2,000 followers in 10 minutes, which momentarily overwhelmed Instagram.
Being truly yourself is naturally magnetizing for an audience. They want to be entertained.

2. Add something new to your speech every time you give it.
By the fourth time I gave my speech, I was bored with my own content, so I rushed through. It's great to have your speech memorized for the first and second time you give it, but by the third time, you run the risk of sounding monotone. The audience can tell if you aren't excited by what you're saying, so rather than feigning enthusiasm, add something new every time.
You can choose what to add based on new epiphanies, your answers to audience questions from past speeches or from something you impromptu added the last time you spoke. Whatever it is ... shake it up. If you aren't on your toes, the audience isn't on theirs.
3. But, practice the first three slides many, many times.
If you're prone to stage fright, make sure that the first three slides of your talk are second nature. The anxiety is at its worst when you first start talking, before you find your rhythm and start making eye contact with individual audience members. Marjorie North consults with politicians on public speaking, and she shared in an article for Harvard Extension School that the best way to beat the nerves is to prepare, prepare, prepare some more ... as much as it takes. By leaning on perfect memorization of the very beginning of your talk, you'll be able to allocate more intellectual energy to calming yourself down and stepping into control and ownership.
4. Engage the audience frequently.
The first time that I gave the speech, I stared into a sea of neutral faces. I thought, undoubtedly, that I had just given the most boring speech of all time, so was I truly surprised by the flood of positive response afterward. It made me realize: Very few people actually make facial expressions when listening to and processing information, because they're in a crowd.

Jesse Scinto teaches public speaking at Columbia, and in an article for Fast Company, he recommended asking for a ""show of hands"" as a way of engaging the audience, because it helps audience members know where they stand within the crowd. So, ask for a ""show of hands"" for a relatable topic (for example: I talk about Paul McCartney's song ""Yesterday"" in my speech, and ask for a show of hands for who knows it). Exercise this tactic of engagement three or four times during a talk. It will prove to you that the audience is listening (thus, giving you the assurance that you're doing a good job), and make them feel more involved.
5. Offer real help beyond the talk.
Some of the best speaking advice I've ever received is to find a way for your audience to engage with you long after the talk is over, and the best way to do this is to offer continuous value. At first, I thought that asking them to follow me on Instagram would do the trick. While this works, it didn't have quite the effect I was hoping for.
One of Tony Robbins' top three public speaking tips is ""add more value than anyone expects."" Go deeper than they expect and give more than they expect.
One of my talks was in front of 300 high school girls, and I was asked to incorporate some advice on college admissions into my personal branding topic. At the end of the talk, I offered to look at every single one of their college essays and offer my edits. Let me tell you, the energy in the room was electric after I said that. 
I knew that it may be crazy of me, busy as I am, to take on the editing role for 300 girls ... but I also knew that I wanted to ""put my money where my mouth is"" and prove that I support them beyond my talk. Only four girls sent me their essays, but dozens told me how much it meant to them that I offered.
If there's some way that you can offer real help -- providing legal resources, 15-minute coaching sessions, connections within your industry -- offer it. Giving a talk should be about helping an audience, and forging a real, sustainable connection with every audience member.

Morgan Sung,"The internet has changed how kids learn about sex, but sex ed in the classroom still sucks. In Sex Ed 2.0, Mashable explores the state of sex ed and imagines a future where digital innovations are used to teach consent, sex positivity, respect, and responsibility. There are few things more mortifying than being a preteen and needing to ask someone about good old Aunt Flo. Thanks to The Care and Keeping of You: The Body Book for Girls, millions of young women didn't have to. American Girl's seminal book about getting our periods, dealing with acne, and finding healthy friendships provided answers to questions we were all too embarrassed to ask. Packed with informative, anatomical illustrations and simple, matter-of-fact details, the book was a staple for prepubescent girls before we all started googling. Instead of offering cringeworthy euphemisms like ""sacred flower"" or ""first moon,"" it got straight to the point: You have a vagina, and here are the changes you might experience. If maxi pads and salicylic acid made up our armor for the battle against puberty, The Care and Keeping of You was our sacred text that led the way. The book turned 20 years old this month. Since its publication in 1998, it has been updated and divided to include a second book specifically for older girls. How did it come about, and what made it so popular and powerful? We caught up with Valorie Schaefer, who wrote the original book, to find out. SEE ALSO: Period tracking apps taught me more about my flow than sex ed ever did You mention in a piece in the Atlantic that the book was inspired by nationwide discussions about how puberty was happening earlier and earlier. Can you tell me a little more about how it came to be? Pleasant Rowland was the founder and CEO of American Girl, and she'd been on some airplane and there was an article in the Times on the early onset of puberty. And she ripped the page out, and she put a sticky note on it for Michelle [Watkins, the editor of the book], and she wrote, ""WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS NOW."" They decided that one of the things they did best was education. I was a copywriter, writing for the catalogs about all the cute doll accessories, and somehow Pleasant was just determined that I was the best person to write this book. They wanted to talk to girls with a particular voice. There were girls who were 9, 10... who were getting their periods, and they were so confused and scared. When you're a 9- or 10-year-old girl you don't want the whole discussion about reproduction and sexuality even if your mom is awesome. So a book just seemed like the way to go. How would you describe the tone of the book? Well, we always said, ""This is the voice of your cool aunt."" Someone you could view as older and trustworthy, but not your mom and dad. Just a little younger, and maybe she's a little cooler, but you trust her. She's not the crazy wingnut, haha. So she's not the vodka aunt. She's the cool aunt! That's sort of exactly how we wanted to talk to girls, because we wanted them to feel heard. We wanted to speak to them in a way that is respectful and kind and warm. Here's just the information you need. We're not going to give you stuff you're not ready for. It's just like, ""What's going on with my breasts??"" ""Am I going to get any?"" ""Will it hurt?"" These are the questions you have at that age. It's hard for you to think of yourself as a 10-year-old, knowing what you know now, and say, ""Wow, how could I not know that?"" And not only did you not know it, but you didn't want to ask anybody, you know? Yes! What was your research process like when writing this? How did you come up with that cool aunt persona, while also being informative? Pleasant, Michelle, and I have all been 10-year-old girls. We started by asking ourselves the question, ""What did we want to know?"" ""Ten-year-old girls are like truth-seeking missiles."" We just talked to people. We talked to girls, we talked to moms, I think we had a lot of confidence that fits ""who"" she was. I think the information to us as adults is not tricky, but when you're 10... 10-year-old girls are like truth-seeking missiles. It's not that they distrust adults, but they're not babies. They don't buy everything hook, line, and sinker, so you have to talk to them in a way that's very truthful. But you also can't overwhelm them with information they can't possibly digest yet. So going back to your question, we talked to pediatricians, but more importantly, we talked to 10-year-old girls. There's a stigma about any discussion of a reproductive body part being inherently sexual. How do you think The Care and Keeping of You dispelled that myth? I don't think the book dispelled the myth, but the book steered a course right down the middle of that discussion. And I think if you want to talk to a girl about getting her period, you really have to talk about reproductive organs. You have to answer the question, ""Why do I get a period?"" In the past 20 years, the book has become a staple for girls of my generation. When I mentioned it, everyone was like, ""Oh my god! I remember that!"" Why do you think there's so much nostalgia surrounding The Care and Keeping of You? I'm just gonna guess that it has much to do with who you were at that time, and a real affection for that girl. You can look back and go, ""Man, I was a sweet-ass 10-year-old!"" You miss some things about being that age. You're smart, you're super-curious, you're not completely frightened, you're not overwhelmed by the concerns of the world like an 18- or 19-year-old. My daughters are 18 and 20, and they get, like, choked up about being that girl. It arrived at a time in that girl's life when they're realizing they're transitioning to the next stage. In this internet age, you can pretty much Google anything. Why do you think that, in this flood of information, the book is still so relevant? When you Google things, you don't have a lot of control over what you receive. Even a 10-year-old knows not to trust everything that's out there. You might Google something about getting your period and be like ""Whoa! Too much information!"" ""You might Google something about getting your period and be like 'Whoa! Too much information!'"" I also think there's something about the format of the book that's so private and personal, it's like the person is talking just to you. This book arrives at a time in your life when you really like to hang out in your bedroom, on your bed, with your friends. There's something really great about being in a quiet place that's private with a book that's talking just to you. Right. And I think in an age when everything can be handed to you with a mouse, there's something really nice about that experience. Yeah, I totally get that! Do you think it's dangerous for little kids to be flooded with information that they don't have context for? I don't know if it's dangerous, but it's overwhelming, and way confusing! Even as well-meaning adults, we want to treat young people respectfully, and we think treating them respectfully is giving them as much information as possible. But it's really important to be age appropriate. Not because we're trying to hide anything, or we're trying to be dishonest, but because a 10-year-old doesn't have the same concerns that a 16-year-old does. There are definitely times you can be scarred, your memory becomes seared by something you see that you definitely did not hope to see, but I think it's mostly just overwhelming. A few years ago the book was split up and modified, and the second book includes chapters about tampons and mental health... Can you talk about that process and why there was a decision to divide the books? When we first wrote The Care and Keeping of You, we were really thinking about a 10-year-old girl. And we said on the back of the book, for girls eight and up. That's really a readership level, and what we found was that younger and younger girls were reading it. Young girls are super-aspirational. If your older sister's reading it, then you want to read it too. And some of the contents of the book maybe body image and eating disorders and stuff like that are really not so appropriate for that younger girl. American Girl thought, we can just make the split and keep The Care and Keeping of You 1 more appropriate for the younger girl, and then in the second book be able to provide more information for that older girl who is asking harder questions. The second book was written by an absolutely wonderful Harvard pediatrician named Cara Natterson. She has really built a reputation for knowing how to talk to preteens. It's 2018 now, and updates have been made, but some people have pointed out that the book is still very straight, very cisgender, and very able-bodied. Do you see it being modified to be more inclusive? You know, I've been thinking about that. I remember when I read the book years ago, there were parts like, ""Sometimes you might feel this way about a boy!"" Right, totally! I don't know if the publisher right now is thinking about revisiting that. As a parent myself, what I would do is explain to my child, ""Every book isn't written, sadly, for every single person. So we're gonna take what serves us, and take what we can find."" My 18-year-old is gay; she's been out since she was 12, and she considers herself a female-bodied gay person. My conversation with her is, ""Look, you're female-bodied. The information in this book mostly applies to you. Sorry about the area of interest."" In my circle of young people I care about, I would buy them The Care and Keeping of You, I would buy them The Body Book for Boys. I would put them both on the shelf and say, ""There is fantastic information in both of these books; you should know about them no matter what gender you embody and no matter what kind of person you might be attracted to."" I wish we didn't create such a hard division between what each gendered child should know and understand. But without the references to who you might be interested in, I think the rest of the books really stand. For sure. If you are a male-bodied child, but you identify as female, most of the information is still going to be useful to you. You're not gonna get breasts, you're not gonna bleed, but all the other information about skincare and exercise and how to feel about stuff is going to be the same. If you're a parent of a child who is not strictly binary, you're be putting together a custom program for them no matter what. In the past 20 years, you've raised two girls. Did you read them the books? Ha! I wrote the book when I was pregnant with my daughter, so she never knew a world without that book sitting on the bookshelf. But it's really funny because it doesn't matter who you are you could be the person who wrote the book, and your kid does not want to talk to you about it. It was on our shelves, and I was like, ""Hey gals! Do you want to talk about anything in the book? Do you have any questions?"" And they were like, ""No, Mom. Thanks. No."" My high school sex ed class was pretty comprehensive, but it was really matter-of-fact. It was like, ""Here's a cucumber. Here's a condom. That's it. Go. Be free."" But there's so much nuance involved in sex education that just isn't discussed, in schools or in general, you know? I think we do a really poor job of recognizing transitions. There are a lot of cultures where there are specific and beautiful rituals about going from becoming a young girl to becoming a woman. In the U.S., we just do a shitty job, honestly. One of the things we tried to do with the book without getting into like, rites of passage ceremonies and I know girls whose mothers would have first moon parties which was mostly mortifying I was mortified just getting a pack of pads and The Care and Keeping of You. Right, right! One of the things we tried to do with the book is to say, ""Hey. Girl. This is a moment for you when you are making a transition. You're going from being a person who relied on your parents to take care of you physically and emotionally, and you are stepping into this new space where you are responsible for you."" And I hope we did that in a way that is reassuring and empowering, without getting into anything spiritual or cultural. We wanted to say, ""We see you! You got this, girl!""","The internet has changed how kids learn about sex, but sex ed in the classroom still sucks.

Kent German,"CES 2018 began with a bang today, or should I say a flood. The first rain to fall on Las Vegas in 116 days swept into the city yesterday, drenching crews who were rushing to open the show. By this morning, the convention center was leaking, Google had to shut its splashy pavilion and rivers were flowing through a hotel car park. Of course, that all made the abysmal traffic that marks the first day of CES even worse. The show, however, always goes on, and plenty happened to keep us busy.

Jessica says don't be surprised if this technology shows up in some high-end phones this year, like the yet-to-be-announced Samsung Galaxy S9. Honda skipped over cars and demonstrated four robot concepts instead. They included the 3E-D18, which is an autonomous off-road workhorse that looks like an ATV chassis without the handlebars or seat (it uses a customizable rail system instead). There's also the 3R-B18, which is a robotic wheelchair that you can use indoors or outdoors. With additional attachments it can transform from a seated mobility solution into a motorized luggage cart or a stroller. And those aren't even the adorable ones. Sony showed its newest Aibo robot dog at the CNET Stage (after highlighting it at its press conference the previous evening). Cuter and more dog-like than ever before, it has OLED screen eyes, a camera in its nose and one on its back for learning the layout of your home. You pet it in three different places to show your love. It's available only in Japan right now with a price that translates to roughly $1,758, £1,299, AU$2,248.

Staff Reporter,"Social activist Pandalaneni Srimannarayana, who pleaded with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to halt the construction of the capital city at the chosen place in Guntur district on environmental grounds, said on Sunday he would file a review petition and seek redress by the Supreme Court if the NGT brushed aside his concerns. He denied that the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) initiated by him, retired bureaucrat E.A.S. Sarma and others had been dismissed and stated that the NGT had imposed 150 conditions over and above the 191 original ones, each one of which should be fulfilled by the State government. “The NGT’s refusal to intervene at this stage does not tantamount to giving the final go-ahead,” he asserted. Addressing media persons here, Mr. Srimannarayana said the State Environment Impact Authority (SEIA) was basically incompetent to give clearance for projects spanning more than 120 sq. km. whereas the capital city was planned in 217 sq. km. The NGT ruled that the Kondaveetivagu, which posed flood threat to the capital, should not be touched in view of its ecological sensitivity but the State government appeared to be going ahead with its plans to alter its course. Mr. Srimannarayana said the NGT had constituted supervisory and implementation committees which would do a macro-study of the issues at stake and the government was accountable to these panels. “As the Chief Minister of the State and Chairman of Capital Region Development Authority, N. Chandrababu Naidu has a great degree of accountability which he cannot shrug off,” he said.","Will approach Supreme Court if needed, says activist",2017-11-19T19:18:57Z,"{'id': 'the-hindu', 'name': 'The Hindu'}",‘Will file review plea on Amaravati before NGT’,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/will-file-review-plea-on-amaravati-before-ngt/article20557397.ece,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/article20557396.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20VJPG4-NGT,the-hindu,The Hindu,flood-stage,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Robin Fitzgerald,"A raincoat or umbrella may not be enough this weekend if South Mississippi sees the severe thunderstorms and tornadoes forecast for Saturday. The National Weather Service says there is an enhanced risk of severe weather Saturday, which is the third of five risk levels. Most severe weather forecasts on the Coast stay at the first or second level, which is marginal risk and slight risk, respectively. Enhanced risk means numerous severe storms are likely with a possibility of tornadoes, hail and damaging winds of 75 mph or more. So whether you will be out and about for Black Spring Break or staying home, you can expect heavy rain and strong winds Saturday. Thunderstorms are likely to start after 2 p.m., the weather service says, and continue through at least 1 a.m. Sunday. The heaviest rain is expected to reach the Coast in the evening, when many people will be trying to attend the fourth annual Spring Fest concert featuring Lil Wayne and others. Flash flooding is possible during the afternoon and evening on U.S. 90 and other low-lying roads. The weather service has issued a flash flood watch from 1 a.m. Saturday to 1 a.m. Sunday. Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected over the weekend, but some areas could see as much as 8 inches. River flooding The weather service also issued a flood warning Friday for the Wolf River north of Gulfport and the Biloxi River. The warning is in effect through Monday night. The Wolf River's stage was at 2 feet Friday morning, Lacy said. Flood stage is 8 feet. The river is expected to rise about flood stage by Sunday morning and to keep rising until Monday night. Bells Ferry Road will start to flood when the Wolf River reaches 8 feet, Lacy said. ""There will be water over the access road just upstream of the bridge and the road will become impassable very quickly,"" Lacy said. At 9 feet, the road will be impassable, Lacy said, due to deep water on the east bridge approach. The Biloxi River will crest at 14 feet Monday, he said. Flood stage is 12 feet. Temperatures on Saturday may reach 75 with an overnight low around 52, the weather service says. Sunday should be cooler and sunny, with high of 66 and overnight low of 40. Monday is forecast to be sunny, with high of 69 and a low of 51. Warmer weather is expected for the rest of the week. The severe weather threat comes from a powerful spring storm that will cause snow and blizzard conditions in other parts of the nation, the weather service says.",The Sun Herald Dangerous weather is possible Saturday in South Mississippi The Sun Herald A raincoat or umbrella may not be enough this weekend if South Mississippi sees the severe thunderstorms and tornadoes forecast for Saturday.

"Allison Wong, KCRG-TV9","EAST DUBUQUE, Illinois (KCRG-TV9) -- As the Mississippi River continues to rise, business and home owners in East Dubuque are either surrounded by water or preparing to be. 
Water is just feet away from Midtown Marina, owned by Jeremy McDowell. On Tuesday, the river sat at about 21.5 feet, with predictions of hitting 22.5 feet on Friday. McDowell said that will be really close to flooding his business.
He said, ""22.6 (feet) is when it gets right to the edge of the restaurant. About 23 (feet) and well actually have water on the floor of the restaurant."" 
McDowell is prepared if the water gets high enough to threaten his building. 
We shrink wrap the doors and then we put two layers of sandbags in front of them and essentially plug the drains and run some squeegees on the floor and were able to keep the water out,"" he explained.
However, some in East Dubuque aren't as fortunate at McDowell. Homes and businesses in the Shore Acre area of town are already surrounded by water. The owners of Splinter Heating said they removed everything they could from their building before the waters got too high. 
That area of town is also without running water due to a water main break. Public works director Mark Fluhr says the city can't fix it until the water recedes. 
The City of East Dubuque continues to monitor the floodwall and flood pumps. Fluhr says things should be alright as long as it doesn't rain. 
""Its the rainfall that we would get that we have to pump out outside the levy,"" he said. ""It all gathers down in our lower lying areas and thats the part where if we get in trouble its stormwater. Its not actually the river, the levy is good for up 26 feet.
He set up some portable water pumps in the low-lying areas of the town in case water begins to pool. 
People say it's just a waiting game.

CBS/AP,"North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper says ""treacherous"" floodwaters are still threatening the state more than a week after Hurricane Florence made landfall there. Cooper said Saturday that nine of the state's river gauges are at major flood stage and four others are at moderate flood stage. Cooper said the flooding continues to make travel dangerous in hard-hit areas. He told residents to avoid driving east of Interstate 95 and south of US-70. He said certain areas of Interstates 95 and 40 are still underwater. Cooper also urged residents of southeastern North Carolina to stay alert for flood warnings and evacuation orders. Jim Trogdon, the state's transportation secretary, said 114 primary roads are closed and there are 547 total statewide road closures. Emergency officials don't expect the water on those highways to recede fully for another week or more. At least 43 people have died since the hurricane slammed into the coast more than a week ago.

jgerstein@politico.com (Josh Gerstein),"President Donald Trump is shifting to war footing in the Russia investigation. On Wednesday, the White House announced that it had hired a veteran lawyer who helped President Bill Clinton weather impeachment, while Trump’s personal legal team sent its strongest signal yet that it would fight special counsel Robert Mueller over any attempt to question the president without first setting up strict limits for the interview. Story Continued Below Combined, the two moves represent a sharp turn away from the cooperation-minded days of 2017 when Trump said publicly that he was eager to sit down with the lead Russia investigator. At that time, his White House lawyers also showed no resistance to handing over documents and assisted in lining up interviews with more than two dozen current and former aides. Now, amid the prospect of a widening Mueller inquiry that has already ensnared several top Trump aides, along with a potential Democratic wave in the November midterm elections that could give way to impeachment proceedings, Trump and his lawyers are showing signs that they intend to fight back. By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who is now the president’s new personal attorney, told The Washington Post that the president and his White House needed a “more aggressive” approach when dealing with the special counsel’s attempts to line up a Trump interview. “Some people have talked about a possible 12-hour interview,” Giuliani said, adding: “That’s not going to happen — I’ll tell you that. It’d be, max, two to three hours around a narrow set of questions.” The president himself also previewed the legal arguments his attorneys could make in opposition to sitting down with Mueller. Writing on Twitter, Trump posted several partial quotes from Joe diGenova, the former federal prosecutor who nearly joined his personal legal team earlier this spring and had argued in a recent radio interview that the president had the “unfettered power to fire anyone.” DiGenova, whose comments were rebroadcast on Tuesday night on Sean Hannity’s Fox News program, a show the president is known to watch, also said that a series of questions purported to come from Mueller’s office were an “intrusion” on the president’s constitutional right to “fire any executive branch employee.” Mueller’s office has repeatedly declined comment about a potential Trump interview, which is widely seen as one of the final moves the special counsel will make in giving the president an opportunity to explain himself in his own words about his reasons for firing FBI Director James Comey last May, as well as what he knew about Russia’s attempts to help him win the 2016 election. That information could go a long way for the special counsel as he weighs making landmark decisions, such as whether to indict a sitting president, or when he writes a final report that could be used to launch impeachment proceedings in Congress. But Trump’s legal team is now sending signals that it is prepared to fight if Mueller issues a subpoena, a topic that The Washington Post reported on Tuesday was actually broached by the special counsel back in March. Increasingly, Trump’s team appears willing to have that all-out legal fight with Mueller, even if it lasted months while it winds its way to the Supreme Court. “I think he’s going to pursue his legal options,” said Alan Dershowitz, the retired Harvard law professor who recently met with Trump and his staffers at the White House. “That’s why he enhanced his legal team. He wants to be ready for all contingencies.” Trump’s more aggressive posture was also reflected on Wednesday with the retirement of Ty Cobb, the embattled White House lawyer who since last fall has been angering conservatives and the president’s allies by suggesting that the Russia investigation could be brought to a close through cooperation with Mueller. Cobb, whose departure had been expected, was frequently called in for clean-up duty by putting his name on public statements insisting that the president had no plans to fire the special counsel even as Trump was making private pleadings to do just that. Now he’s being replaced by Emmet Flood, a defense lawyer who helped Clinton during his cutthroat 1998-99 impeachment battle in Congress and later served under George W. Bush as the Republican president faced an onslaught of congressional-oversight investigations after Democrats won control of Congress in the 2006 midterms. Flood brings to Trump’s White House a reputation as a seasoned lawyer known for being assertive, and occasionally combative. His background on battles over executive privilege is also likely to be one of the central lines of any legal battles with Mueller and Congress if either the House of Senate ends up in Democratic control. “He knows how to advance the interests of the president even in a chaotic situation,” said Shannen Coffin, a former counsel to Vice President Dick Cheney who worked with Flood in the Bush White House. “You have to say that when we lost control of the House and Senate in 2006, it was sort of the worst nightmare of any administration. He was the point guy on all of that.” “He’s a Williams &amp; Connolly lawyer,” Coffin added, referring to one of the nation’s top litigation firms. “They’re aggressive. …That’s what he was trained in. I’ve seen that side of Emmet. It’s not personal. He’s a man who has a passion for what he’s doing.” Elliot Mincberg, a former Democratic counsel on the House Judiciary Committee who squared off against Flood during the Bush-era investigations into the firing of U.S. attorneys, said Flood was rarely accommodating. “He was a very strong, some would say stubborn, defender of executive prerogative there,” Mincberg said. “Very smart guy. Very able, but he really was not willing to give an inch in terms of negotiation.” The Trump White House’s decision to hire Flood reflects a decision not just to deal aggressively with Mueller. It also looks as if the administration is bracing for an impeachment fight. “I’m sure they have an eye on both,” said Scott Coffina, a former Flood colleague from the Bush White House. “They have to have an eye on impeachment. They’d be foolish not to have an eye on that, and Emmet would be a very good guy to deal with that.” Mueller is approaching the one-year anniversary leading the Russia investigation as special counsel. He faces no deadlines for completing his work — a point of frustration to the White House and allies who have been clamoring for any signal that the president is going to be cleared of legal wrongdoing. “I think there’s a reasonable argument to make that there are so many things on the plate of the president of the United States that after a year it’s time to bring this to an end,” said Jon Sale, a former federal prosecutor who had dinner with Giuliani, his former law school classmate, last weekend in New York. Steve Bannon, the former senior Trump White House strategist and 2016 campaign manager, called Giuliani and Flood the new “wartime consiglieres” around the president. “This doesn't mean obstruction — just tough lawyers up against tough lawyers,” Bannon said in a text message. A frequent critic of Cobb’s conciliatory approach, Bannon added that Trump was “finally getting the first-rate representation that has been missing to date for him as an individual and the office of the presidency.“ But Samuel Buell, a Duke University law professor and former federal prosecutor, said the Trump team’s push for a more aggressive pushback wouldn’t faze Mueller. “Once they are onto something, federal criminal investigations have a way of inexorably grinding the gears and the momentum is almost impossible to stop,” Buell said. “The defense in such cases turns, at a certain point, to trench warfare.“ “We may have reached the stage where even this White House is coming to recognize that reality,“ he added, “in spite of the president’s public pronouncements.” This article tagged under: Missing out on the latest scoops?

Shaju Philip,"Written by Shaju Philip | Thiruvananthapuram | Published: September 12, 2018 3:07:30 am Periyar river in Aluva turns dry. Though Kerala got 33% excess rain in three monsoon months, there is a deficiency of 86% in first week of September. (Photo: Prashanth Chandran) An unusual dry spell coupled with the reported fall in the groundwater level in flood-hit areas of Kerala has emerged as a cause of concern. IMD, Thiruvananthapuram, director S Sudevan said the state has received hardly any rain since the beginning of this month. Weekly rainfall for the whole of Kerala from August 30 to September 5 was a mere 7.9 mm as against 56 mm, the normal figure during the same period. Although Kerala has got 33 per cent excess rainfall in the three months of monsoon, there is a deficiency of 86 per cent in the first week of September. “As per our extended forecast, rain would pick up only after September 17. The present dry period is unusual. Due to no rain, the temperature has also increased, mainly in southern parts of the state,’’ said Sudevan. The IMD, however, said the dry spell was not limited to Kerala but was spread to most parts of the country, except the north-eastern region and some parts of north India. D Sivananda Pai, head of climate prediction department at IMD, said this dry spell could, in part at least, be attributed to an “evolving El Nino-like condition” in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. “The El Nino has not reached a maturity stage, but we are seeing some warming in the Pacific Ocean. This is having an indirect impact on the monsoon rainfall over India, as the moisture is being pulled out,” Pai said. Kerala Groundwater Department director Justine Mohan said the department has come across incidents of fall in groundwater level in flood-affected areas. “We have started collecting data from sample wells of the department for analysing the situation,’’ he said. Mohan said surface soil is the most important factor that enables groundwater recharge or infiltration of water into the earth. The flood has caused large-scale soil erosion in some places and in such areas, water infiltration would not be at the expected normal level, leading to a dip in groundwater level, he said. However, in areas where soil got deposited in flood, water infiltration would increase, leading to better groundwater storage, he said. Groundwater department sources in Pathanamthitta said there is an unusual fall in water level in wells in flood-hit areas. The department has received a complaint from one village, where water level in wells have gone down after the flood. The issue is mainly in wells where water has been flushed out as part of cleaning of drinking water sources after the floods. In such wells, water level hasn’t recovered to a level that is expected in the monsoon. In Ernakulam, another flood-hit region, a similar trend was reported, but officials said a conclusion cannot be arrived at this stage as water level has to be monitored in phases. Centre for Water Resources Development and Management’s executive director Dr A B Anitha said people have started informing them about the sudden fall in water level in rivers, which were flooded a month back. “We have to study in detail the situation in every river. The flow of water is fast after the flood has cleared all obstacles. In such a situation, the depth may be affected, leading to an impression that water level has come down. Another factor is that regulators in certain rivers have been kept up to drain water after the flood. That would also contribute to the sudden dip in water level. No rain in the last two weeks might be another factor,’’ she said.

David Kaiser,"As Congress this week struggles to deal with the immigration program known as DACA in the face of a potential government shutdown, it faces the monumental task of reconciling utterly opposing views of the proper role and status of millions of immigrants now living in the United States. But, while this task is huge, it is not without precedent. In fact, the current debate is part of an ongoing pattern in American history. Writing in the 1990s, William Strauss and Neil Howe showed that the nation’s history could be viewed through the lens of an 80-year cycle, each time punctuated by a great political crisis that created a new order: the American Revolution, the Civil War, and the Depression and Second World War. They also predicted, correctly as it turned out, that the nation would be in such a crisis by 2010 or 2015. ( Steve Bannon was drawn to their view.) Arguments about immigration have always been part of that cycle. The question of who belongs in the national community is a hot one when crises begin, and every great time of American turmoil has found new answers to the question of who gets to be an American. The question now is how the U.S. can possibly find a solution to the current debate, as it has done in the past. Even the era of the first such crisis—the American Revolution—saw conflicts over immigration. As early as 1751, an obscure Pennsylvania newspaper editor named Benjamin Franklin (!) railed against a flood of German immigrants: “Why should the Palatine Boors [Germans] be suffered to swarm into our Settlements, and by herding together establish their Language and Manners to the Exclusion of ours? Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the English, become a Colony of Aliens, who will shortly be so numerous as to Germanize us instead of our Anglifying them, and will never adopt our Language or Customs, any more than they can acquire our Complexion.” But when the revolution began, political conflicts moved ethnic ones off center stage, and the minority that was driven out of the colonies when the war was over were Tories—supporters of George III—not ethnic minorities. The same holds true for the next great moment of crisis, around the Civil War. Slavery, of course, emerged as the nation’s leading political issue in the 1850s, but it was not the only one. Immigration, particularly from Ireland after the potato famine of the early 1840s and Germany after the failed revolutions of 1848, had taken off in the new nation, and it had provoked a backlash. Some Americans of British descent hated and feared the new immigrants, and they formed a whole new political party, the American or Know Nothing Party, to combat it. A list of its policy proposals that has survived in the Duke University library calls for the repeal of all naturalization laws, “more stringent and effective Emigration laws,” “war to the hilt on political Romanism”—that is, Catholicism—“eternal enmity to all those who attempt to carry out the principles of a foreign Church or State,” and “American Laws and American legislation and death to all foreign influences, whether in high places or low.” Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter The Know Nothings were strong enough actually to win many local elections and gain control of the state government of Massachusetts—a center of Irish immigration—in 1854. But the party, being anti-slavery as well as anti-immigrant, was largely absorbed into the Republican Party after 1856. For the new party, the spread of slavery, rather than the growth of immigration, was the main threat to free laborers in the North. What really solved the immigration crisis, however, was the war itself. Both Irish- and German-Americans fought in great numbers in the Union Army, and the war created a new national loyalty that largely transcended the old ethnic one. By the early 20th century, millions of new immigrants were arriving from southern Europe—mainly Italy—and from Eastern Europe. As the New York Times recently noted, this led in 1924 to the passage of a very restrictive immigration act that brought this migration almost to a halt. That act, which remained in force for 41 years, restricted immigration drastically and set up quotas that reflected the percentages of various national groups within the population in 1890. This nativist reaction also helped lead to the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the South and much of the Midwest, and made the 1920s a very bad decade in the history of race relations. It also largely closed the United States to refugees, just as Fascism came to power in Italy, and made it much more difficult for refugees from Nazism to reach the United States as well. The act took the immigration debate off the table before the crisis of the Great Depression struck five years later, right on schedule, and practically speaking it would have been much more difficult for Roosevelt to implement his New Deal politics if new waves of immigrants were continuing to arrive in the U.S. But the real resolution came when the crisis continued with the Second World War, which promoted assimilation in the same way that the Civil War had 80 years earlier. Italian, Polish, Jewish and black Americans were drafted into the military along with others, fought and died, and emerged with the respect of most of their countrymen, an overriding national loyalty, and a new sense of citizenship. By 1965, the nation had granted full legal equality to black Americans and was feeling inclusive enough to let immigration barriers down again. Like the 1840s-50s and the 1890s-1920s, the last few decades have combined massive new immigration with political polarization. Now the controversial immigrants come from Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, but the feelings they have aroused mirror those that have greeted newcomers from new lands in every era of American history. The bipartisan U.S. political elite, including both Ronald Reagan (who signed a law giving legal status to millions of immigrants in 1986) and George W. Bush (who tried and failed to pass a similar one), has favored the new wave of immigration, which, like the others, has met very real demand for labor, and enriched America. Many voters, however, do not agree. Congress has repeatedly failed to pass laws that would allow those who have entered illegally to become citizens. That failure to act—one without precedent in earlier periods—has left us with more than ten million undocumented immigrants within American borders, a vulnerable population who lack the rights of citizens even as they play essential roles in the nation’s economy. A solution parallel to those of past eras would involve all Americans in some great national task that would mobilize our manpower and resources and, when successfully accomplished, would leave us with a new sense of unity and citizenship. No huge foreign war seems likely to do so, but dealing with global warming could fill the bill, as could the rebuilding of our infrastructure and measures to solve our growing housing crisis. Our political class, however, has failed to mobilize us behind any such task. That makes our immigration crisis a critical part of our attempt to make our constitutional order, once again, work as the founders intended. It will not simply go away.

Jay Barmann,"Much of the town of Guerneville is submerged today thanks to a rising Russian River, and it's only going to get worse by nighttime. 
Those who are sticking it out in town and who are now cut off from the rest of Sonoma County have been posting photos and video to social media of what the flooding looks like.
The river is expected to crest at around 46 feet at 10 p.m. tonight, and if it doesn't climb any higher than it will not break the record high crests of 48.56 feet set in February 1986, or 49.7 feet, which it hit in December 1955. This will be the highest crest the river has seen since 1997, however.
Fans of the popular LGBT-centric R3 Resort are going to be sad to see that the whole place is under 6 feet of muddy water right now, and that mess is going to be a lot to clean up. The hotel, which is no stranger to scenes like this, was closed for over a year in the last decade thanks to a previous flood.
During a particularly wet December back in 2015, the Chronicle ran a piece about how Guerneville always revives and comes back from its flood devastation. But this looks like it will be a tough one.
Below, the documentation so far.

AP,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) Authorities were using boats and large vehicles on Saturday to rescue and evacuate residents in parts of the Midwest where a recent deluge of rainwater and snowmelt was sent pouring over frozen ground, overwhelming creeks and rivers, and killing at least one person.
Rescue efforts in eastern Nebraska were hampered by reports of levee breaches and washouts of bridges and roads, including part of Nebraska Highway 92, leading in and out of southwest Omaha. Authorities confirmed that a bridge on that highway that crosses the Elkhorn River had been washed out Saturday. In Freemont, west of Omaha, the Dodge County Sheriffs Office issued a mandatory evacuation for some residents after floodwaters broke through a levee along the Platte River. And in Mills County, Iowa, authorities ordered people in some rural areas to evacuate after the Missouri River overtopped levees.
The flooding followed days of snow and rain record-setting, in some places that swept through the West and Midwest. The deluge pushed some waterways, including the Missouri River, to record levels in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota. The flooding was the worst in nearly a decade in places.
The family of farmer James Wilke, 50, of Columbus, Nebraska, said he was killed Thursday when a bridge collapsed as he was using his tractor to try to reach stranded motorists on Thursday. His body was found downstream, his cousin Paul Wilke told the Columbus Telegram. Gass Haney Funeral Home confirmed James Wilkes death.
At least two other people were missing in floodwaters in Nebraska. Officials said a Norfolk man was seen on top of his flooded car late Thursday before being swept away in the water and another man was swept away by waters when a dam collapsed on the Niobrara River.
Officials in Sarpy County, south of Omaha, said Saturday that power may be shut off to communities along the Missouri, Platte and Elkhorn rivers for safety reasons. They warned those who choose to ignore calls to evacuate that rescues would be attempted only during daylight hours. Some cities and towns, such as North Bend on the banks of the Platte River, were submerged. Others, such as Waterloo and Freemont, were surrounded by floodwaters, stranding residents in virtual islands with no access in or out.
There is no way out of here unless youve got a helicopter or a boat, the Rev. Mike Bitter, pastor of Christian Church of Waterloo, told the Omaha World-Herald.
Officials in western Iowa and eastern Nebraska were urging people not to drive unless necessary. In Iowa, a section of northbound Interstate 29 that runs parallel to the Missouri River was closed due to flooding. Authorities were rerouting motorists at Kansas City, Missouri, using a detour that took people almost 140 miles (225 kilometers) out of the way.
Farther east, the Mississippi River saw moderate flooding in Illinois from Rock Island south to Gladstone. Meteorologist Brian Pierce with the National Weather Services Quad Cities office in Davenport, Iowa, said flooding on the Mississippi could get worse a few weeks as more snow melts in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
What were having now is the dress rehearsal for the main event thats going to happen in early April, he said of the flooding on the Mississippi.
Rising waters along the Pecatonica and Rock rivers flooded some homes in the northern Illinois cities of Freeport, Rockford and Machesney Park. The National Weather Service said record crests were possible along the rivers, with water levels forecast to continue to rise over the next several days and remain above flood stage through most of the weekend.
Freeport resident Mary Martin told the (Freeport) Journal-Standard that she went to the store to get milk and bread when she saw floodwaters were rising Friday.
Within an hour of going to the store, I could not get back in. Thats how fast the water was coming up, Martin said.

Mike Wehner,"Back on March 30th, SpaceX sent yet another of its Falcon 9 rockets skyward, delivering a payload of 10 satellites into orbit for communications company Iridium. Everything went pretty much according to plan — aside from SpaceX failing to catch the nosecone piece it was aiming for — but one thing stuck out to viewers of the company’s launch live stream. Before all of the separations and deployments were completed, SpaceX had to cut its stream short, citing the fact that it didn’t have permission from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to broadcast the rest of the mission. As one would expect, this caused a lot of theories to flood forth. SpaceX has been forced to cut its broadcasts short in the past, but normally only when they are delivering a government payload into orbit. NOAA issued a statement saying that it was indeed responsible for SpaceX halting its stream halfway through, and pointed to a licensing guideline as the reason. As CNET reports, this licensing fiasco seems to have come out of absolutely nowhere. NOAA has had the restriction in place for some time, and it requires anyone who wants to broadcast from space, and show images of Earth, to have permission to do so. However, it’s a law that’s been sparsely enforced since its inception, and SpaceX has done plenty of space launch broadcasts without worrying about a license in the past. So, what’s different now? “The National and Commercial Space Program Act requires a commercial remote sensing license for companies having the capacity to take an image of Earth while on orbit,” NOAA explained in its statement. “Now that launch companies are putting video cameras on stage 2 rockets that reach an on-orbit status, all such launches will be held to the requirements of the law and its conditions.” NOAA says that the law exists because broadcasting from space has significant national security implications, and it needs to make sure no vital information is compromised when a company decided to start streaming from orbit. Going forward, it seems as though SpaceX’s popularity has given the law new life, and you can bet that all future launches will need NOAA broadcasting clearance.","Back on March 30th, SpaceX sent yet another of its Falcon 9 rockets skyward, delivering a payload of 10 satellites into orbit for communications company Iridium.

James H. S. MacGregor,"Venice, Italy, has been flooding for centuries. Once just a symptom of the city’s location on a series of islands, and its maze of canals, frequent inundation has turned Venice into a cautionary tale of environmental degradation and inevitable submersion. Climate change will assuredly bring similar risk to U.S. coastal communities. Venice offers an early warning: Some fear that the city will inevitably succumb to drowning. Venice continued its slide toward that grim finale this year, on October 29, when the worst flooding since 1966 submerged most of the city under five feet of water. Though that cataclysm seemed to confirm fears that the city is doomed, Venice’s story is more nuanced—and hopeful. Over the past 20 years, Venice has quietly transformed itself and its surrounding lagoon into a laboratory. Technology and ecology projects still in the planning stages in the United States have been successfully realized here. American coastal cities have a lot to learn from them. Much of climate change’s destruction is uncertain and hypothetical—more hurricanes could strike New York City, for example, or a mega-drought might overtake the desert Southwest. But Venetians have known forever that their city lies in the path of monster storms powered by offshore winds. [ Read: Preparing for the inevitable sea-level rise ] From its earliest days, Venetian history has been punctuated by the grim, high-water marks of such storms. The Adriatic coast is littered with the sites of communities that did not survive those events. Armed with this certainty, Venetians undertook a massive engineering project—the MOSE barriers (Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico, or “Experimental Electromechanical Module”; the acronym was chosen to sound like Moses, who divided the Red Sea.) The MOSE system is intended to block the channels connecting Venice’s lagoon with the Adriatic Sea in times of exceptionally high water. They’re essentially giant water gates on a hinge, which can open and close to act as floodgates. The barriers failed to work when the October storm struck, not because they were ill-conceived but because they were incomplete. After 30 years of planning, and 15 since ground was first broken, the project, initially slated to open in 2011, is running 11 years behind. The delays can be chalked up to political and social problems. The MOSE system was conceived in the aftermath of the 1966 floods, and its urgency waned as memory of that event faded. From its inception, the project faced bitter opposition from a wide spectrum of critics, from Greenpeace to the Communist Refoundation Party. Some opponents feared that closing off the channels might damage the lagoon’s ecology; others opposed continued large boat access to the city, which MOSE ’s design permits. Still, others were dismayed by its cost, along with the financial corruption that followed. And yet the October flooding proves that without the MOSE barriers, there is no hope that Venice will survive. But Venetian climate adaptation has many faces, and not all of them are tragic. The towering shadow of the MOSE failure stands to overshadow smaller initiatives put in place in the barrier islands; the Venetian Lagoon, which surrounds the city; and the city itself. A satellite view of Venice showing the city, lagoon, and barrier islands. The MOSE barriers are to be installed in the three inlets that connect the lagoon to the Adriatic Sea. (NASA) The Venetian climate-adaptation repertoire is staged in four settings. The barrier islands that separate the Adriatic from the lagoon are the first line of defense against high water. The three inlets that cut through the islands where the tides surge and ebb constitute the second: Here, when completed, the MOSE barriers will shut when needed. Then comes the lagoon and, finally, the city. Large-scale engineering, which tends to get more attention, is confined to the MOSE barriers. Projects on the islands and within the lagoon focus on restoring damaged landforms and the habitats they offer to indigenous plants and animals. Meanwhile, urban adaptation campaigns are focused on dredging city canals and bolstering individual buildings. Professionals in Miami, San Diego, Boston, and other coastal U.S. cities sometimes portray local flood-control plans as groundbreaking and well ahead of the curve. They have good reason: The Fourth National Climate Assessment, just released by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, underscores the urgent need for climate-adaptation initiatives nationwide. American flooding plans draw on a common source, protocols laid down by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management. Multiple American cities are deep into active planning for rising waters, but enactment is years away for all of them. Boston is one of a few cities that have studied the feasibility of fixed and movable barriers. A report released last May found that the cost and negative ecological impacts of a system of barriers to protect the Boston Harbor and waterfront far outweighed the benefits. As Venice shows, barriers can be an essential part of a complete defense, but they are only useful where natural features do most of the work. Instead, U.S. cities rely on landform restoration. The reason for this is simple: In their natural state, coastal wetlands, dunes, and beaches limit the damage that torrential rain and storm surges cause. Island barriers block high waves; wetlands sequester stormwater. America’s coasts, however, are among the most damaged ecosystems in the nation. Natural erosion and subsidence, combined with coastal development, pollution, deforestation, energy production, and recreational abuse, are key factors identified by the NOAA as coastal stressors. These conditions hamstring coastal environments’ natural ability to counter flooding. Restoring natural features recovers and enhances their role as storage basins and defensive barriers. Restoration projects in the Venetian barrier islands prove that the theory underlying U.S. coastal-remediation plans is sound. Seawalls take the full thrust of tidal surges—they are sure to be overwhelmed or undermined in time. But the long slopes of restored beaches absorb the impact more gradually. Replanted grasses, trees, and shrubs secure restored dunes, binding them together so that storm surges cannot beat down or break through them. Pollution from industry, agriculture, and coastal development have compromised the Venetian Lagoon just as they have the U.S. coast. The lagoon’s topography is so unusual that its landforms—a bewildering variety of mudflats—have names only in Venetian dialect. That gives the lagoon many ways to absorb flood waters. But neglect over the past century has caused the mudflats to melt away and clog the channels that feed and drain the lagoon. Hardening the boundaries and dredging the channels have helped restore the lagoon’s flood-absorption capacity. Adding aquatic vegetation also helps absorb harmful chemicals in polluted waters and sequester atmospheric carbon effectively. [ Read: Can the San Francisco Bay be saved from the sea? ] When UNESCO recognized Venice as a World Heritage site, the designation embraced not just the city but the lagoon as well. Venice is honored as a unique urban area that has partnered with an equally unique ecosystem throughout its history. Projects in the lagoon have recognized that dual designation, consistently resisting the impulse to treat the lagoon as a means to an urban end. By contrast, most coastal American cities have not restored their natural, environmental features, which over time have lost much of their identity, purpose, and integrity. Flood-control restorations on the Venetian barrier islands have also brought back resident and transient birds, fish, and mammals that rely on the resources of the intertidal zone and the dunes for food, shelter, and reproduction. Within the lagoon, restoration has provided nesting sites for more than half of the bird species indigenous to the Italian peninsula. During fall and winter migrations, the lagoon is a reliable and rich refueling station for trans-Mediterranean wildlife. And like the shoreline that edges them, coastal fishing grounds are deeply impacted by onshore development and pollution. When coastal waters are degraded, nutrients essential to ocean dwellers are diminished, and ecosystems that fish rely on during their growth cycle are compromised. In America, restoring coastal habitats is not a hot-button issue like climate-change adaptation is. But the NOAA argues that climate-adaptation projects go hand in hand with coastal habitat restoration. Through landform reclamation, one problem, in effect, solves the other. In a just-released study called “Coastal Resilience Solutions for South Boston,” planners laid out a multifaceted program that parallels interventions projected in Venice. The South Boston plan also includes the development of open spaces, dunes, and a “living shoreline” that promise social benefits in addition to flood control. The Boston plan emphasizes public recreation and urban amenity rather than habitat restoration, but experience in the lagoon suggests that wildlife and water quality will be positively impacted as well. On the other side of the country, San Diego Bay shares many of the Venetian Lagoon’s characteristics. Storm surges and El Niño events already anticipate what will happen as climate change raises sea levels in the United States. The San Diego Regional Climate Collaborative is the major coordinator of responses in the area, and like many similar organizations in America—the Chesapeake Bay Program, the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, and others—it has been focused on collecting data, convening stakeholders, and informing the public about what to expect as waters rise. The San Diego Bay is vulnerable to a whole host of problems—with stormwater clearance, with shoreline access, with floodplains, and with the fish and bird species that depend on the bay—that will only worsen with climate change. Here, Venice’s achievements are especially pertinent and encouraging. Successes in the lagoon are clearer and more complete than in any other part of the Venetian climate-adaptation program. [ Read: A California mayor wants his beach town to retreat from the shore ] Climate adaptation in Venice’s urban center lags far behind accomplishments in the lagoon. The MOSE project, and to a lesser extent reclamation efforts in the barrier islands and lagoon, has consumed resources and occupied center stage for decades, while urban adaptation has stalled. This has created a public-relations nightmare. Condemned to wade their city in rubber boots while billions of euros evaporate in a construction ordeal with no result, Venetians are understandably enraged. The city’s continued vulnerability to flooding, despite decades of work, underscores the importance of coordination in any climate-adaptation program—along with the material and psychological damage that follows when coordination fails. The MOSE barriers were never intended to combat the low-level flooding that constantly annoys Venetians, but to protect Venice only from catastrophic flooding. Projects in the lagoon and the city are meant to fine-tune an integrated system; MOSE cannot respond to surges higher than one meter without damaging the lagoon ecology. On October 29, the system was literally out of its depth. The barrier project not only preempted funds for urban adaptation, but its delayed completion destroyed the coordination of the climate-adaptation system. From the start, work in Venice suffered from jurisdictional infighting. The complexities of creating an entity that was adequate to oversee multiple projects confounded politicians. Work commenced only after a region-wide authority was formed. A similar problem persists in the United States. Individual states have the primary responsibility to address climate adaptation under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972. When a natural area occurs at state boundaries, as in the Chesapeake Bay, for example, interstate coordination becomes essential. Even projects confined to a single state face jurisdictional conflicts. Municipal, county, and state governments have to work together to combat coastal flooding effectively, and different constituencies have contrasting views and agendas. While most American cities have regional cooperatives only loosely coordinating climate-adaptation projects, the San Francisco Bay Area was among the first to take a Venice-like step toward the creation of a government agency with significant legal muscle. The San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, which has overseen the bay since 1965, added an important, though contested, duty in 2009: controlling land use and to coordinating initiatives that specifically target climate adaptation. As the catastrophic October flooding in Venice shows, climate-adaptation programs only work if all the pieces mesh. Marshaling the will to act quickly, communally, and with adequate authority in the blustery American political climate is a significant challenge, but the means are there. In both positive and negative directions, Venice points the way.",The city of canals has been flooding for centuries.

Editors,"Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court, now at risk over 36-year-old allegations of sexual misconduct, has risks and rewards for Republicans and Democrats. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY) Kavanaugh and his accuser will testify. But first: The 'uncontrollable male passion' A Senate showdown Monday would pit testimonies of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against Christine Blasey Ford, the California professor who says Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a suburban D.C. party when the two were teenagers. Kavanaugh denies the sexual harassment claim, which has produced a fallout that will delay a vote for the Supreme Court nominee. Sound familiar? Ask Anita Hill, another professor who says senators ""failed"" her in confirming now-Justice Clarence Thomas, whom she accused of sexual harassment 27 years ago. Here are the key Republicans who could upend Kavanaugh's bid today. In the meantime, can we talk about Mark Judge ? According to Ford, he's Kavanaugh's old classmate who allegedly laughed and watched as Kavanaugh held a girl down and tried to remove her clothes at the party. And he's got some gross thoughts about women. Judge, a columnist, has extolled ""the wonderful beauty, of uncontrollable male passion,"" and quoted playwright Noel Coward on his high school yearbook page: ""Certain women should be struck regularly, like gongs."" According to the Washington Post, Christine Blasey Ford...who is now a 51-year-old college professor made the allegations against Kavanaugh in a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein. Susana Victoria Perez has more. Buzz60 Her husband ran CBS. He was fired. Now Julie Chen says a goodbye, too Julie Chen, longtime co-host of CBS' ""The Talk,"" skipped the show the day after her husband, CBS CEO Leslie Moonves, was fired amid sexual harassment allegations and a corporate battle. Now she won't return. Chen, 48, announced via a video Tuesday on the CBS daytime show that she needs ""to spend more time at home with my husband and our young son."" Chen smiled broadly during the video, choking up only once slightly. She also co-hosts CBS' ""Big Brother."" It appears Julie Chen’s talk show days are over and she will be leaving her role as host on ‘The Talk.’ Susana Victoria Perez has more. Buzz60 A 'senseless loss' on an Iowa golf course A deserted golf bag Monday on an Iowa course led to police finding the body, ""some distance away,"" of Celia Barquin Arozamena, a 22-year-old former Iowa State University student-athlete. She had been assaulted, police said, with ""several"" wounds to her torso. Police charged Collin Daniel Richards for the murder, a man believed to be homeless who potentially committed "" a random act of violence,"" one county attorney said. The university's community mourned the loss of Arozamena, the 2018 Big 12 champion and Iowa State Female Athlete of the Year. President Wendy Wintersteen called it ""a terrible, tragic, senseless loss."" Finally, an air flight boarding process that won’t stress you out Tired of the struggle that is the airline boarding process? United has got it figured out. The airline is tweaking the way it calls passengers to board its planes. Gone are the five boarding lines used in the previous process. In is a new two-lane, color-coded process that will handle a staggered boarding call.

The high winds and surge from the initial impact of the storm, plus the rain, have paralyzed cities including Wilmington. More than 300,000 utility customers across the state remained without power, more than a dozen North Carolina rivers are likely to crest in major flood stage this week, and damage is widespread. In Morehead City, almost 100 miles northwest of Wilmington, the owners of Seaport Antiques returned from a trip to Europe to discover the store they've owned for 32 years in shambles. Relief groups, which pre-staged on the ground in North and South Carolina, say they are ready to help. North Carolina officials say even though the sun is shining in parts of the state, major flooding is continuing in the aftermath of Florence and is expected to worsen in some areas.

The visit comes as the region struggles with catastrophic flooding from the massive storm, which claimed at least 32 lives and has left some 300,000 utility customers without power. The historic flooding has cut access to many communities and paralyzed cities like Wilmington, North Carolina, where officials have opened distribution centers for food, water and tarps. Trump had previously said he planned to visit the region once the recovery was in hand. Last Slide Next Slide Kim Jong Un, Moon Jae-in sign 'peace' agreement at Korean summit South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced a broad agreement after their second day of talks in Pyongyang Wednesday that both said would usher in a new era of peace on the Korean Peninsula. At a news conference, Moon said that North Korea will permanently dismantle its Donchang-ri missile engine test site and would allow international inspectors to observe. The agreement comes after President Donald Trump canceled a visit to North Korea by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month, expressing concern that there had not been enough progress on denuclearization. During the conference, Moon said that Kim had agreed to visit Seoul in the near future and that the two Koreas would bid to jointly host the 2032 Summer Olympics.

Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 24, is set to appear in Poweshiek County District in Montezuma, Iowa, on a charge of first-degree murder. Tibbetts was found dead in a cornfield Aug. 21 after going missing more than a month. The arrest of Rivera, an undocumented immigrant farmhand, served as a rallying cry for some officials and political groups seeking tougher immigration laws. But Mollie's father, Rob Tibbetts, urged them to stop, accusing them in an op-ed column of trying to ""callously distort and corrupt Mollie’s tragic death to advance a cause she vehemently opposed."" Border Patrol to inspect facilities housing minors Head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Kevin McAleenan will travel to the southwestern border in Texas on Wednesday to see how the agency's facilities can be modified to better care for waves of families and minors as the images of migrant children detained in chain-linked cages still plague the Trump administration. McAleenan said he will meet with his agents, nongovernmental organizations and others to figure out ways to improve conditions for the growing number of children coming across the border. The Trump administration instituted a ""zero tolerance"" immigration enforcement policy this year that led to the separation of more than 2,600 families seeking asylum. A federal judge halted those separations and ordered the administration to reunify all those families, a process that is ongoing.

dvinik@politico.com (Danny Vinik),"HOUSTON — Nine months after Hurricane Harvey dumped more than 50 inches of rain on the Gulf Coast, green grass has returned to plush Houston developments and the city’s downtown hums with millennial workers choosing a favorite food truck. But just a short drive away, Kashmere Gardens has not recovered. Nearly every street of the 10,000-person neighborhood has homes that are gutted. Empty window panes reveal sparse interiors without walls, doors or carpets. Doors hang ajar and mold consumes living rooms and kitchens. Signs dot the lawns, promising homeowners that they can quickly sell out and avoid the messy process of rebuilding. One family lives in a tent in their driveway where mangy dogs circle around, shedding fur and leaving a rotten stench hanging in the air. Inside their wrecked home, two 4-year-old children sleep just feet away from open electric wires. Story Continued Below The challenges in Kashmere Gardens — where two-thirds of the residents are black and the median income is $23,000 per year — are not the result of any one policy or agency. They’re the consequence of a complicated, bureaucratic disaster-response system built up over decades that experts nearly universally agree is failing to provide critical support to low-income, minority communities when catastrophe strikes. “People just give up,” said Keith Downey, president of a local organization called Kashmere Gardens Super Neighborhood, which has been helping local residents recover. A POLITICO investigation found that numerous low-income families were denied funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency because much of Kashmere Gardens was in a flood zone, and homeowners were thus required to carry flood insurance — a law that many of them were unaware of. Other families, struggling with language issues and inexperienced with the federal bureaucracy, simply couldn’t cope with a system that even FEMA officials agree is too complicated. Still others fell victim to shoddy contractors who took their money and failed to make repairs. Those who were lucky enough to navigate the bureaucracy got an average payout from FEMA of $4,300 — too little for some to make even the minimal repairs necessary to make their house habitable. And while more federal money is on the way to Texas, it may take a year or more after Harvey to reach communities like Kashmere Gardens, which are desperately trying to rebuild. The problems in Houston aren’t surprising to FEMA experts and others familiar with the complicated quilt of programs designed to help those in need of disaster assistance. “This is a recurring and systemic problem that we find with the delivery of federal recovery dollars,” said Fred Tombar, the senior adviser for disaster recovery at the Department of Housing and Urban Development from 2009 to 2013. FEMA officials acknowledged that some relief applications took longer to process because of high demand, and some pointed the finger at Congress, suggesting the agency is hemmed in by a baroque series of rules. Indeed, even Administrator Brock Long has said that policymakers need to re-examine the system. “We’ve got to streamline a very fragmented recovery process,” he said at a congressional hearing on April 11. “Recovery funding comes from 17 different federal government agencies and it's too difficult to understand what you’re entitled to and how to put it to work.” But now, as much of the South and Southwest begin preparing for a 2018 hurricane season that’s predicted to be even worse than 2017, there’s no sense that anything will change to protect politically powerless neighborhoods like Kashmere Gardens — or, for that matter, the many Puerto Rican neighborhoods still reeling after Hurricane Maria, or low-income areas in the path of some as-yet-unnamed storm. Aaron Wright, 55, said his rental home in the Kashmere Gardens neighborhood of Houston suffered catastrophic damage during Harvey. Nearly every street of the 10,000-person community has gutted homes. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO “No one inside of the government has taken the time to really sit down long-term and say what is the permanent solution to the challenges we are facing,” said Marion McFadden, vice president for policy at Enterprise Community Partners, an affordable-housing nonprofit. Experts are increasingly aware that the current system, designed with conflicting goals and often under-funded, is failing those who need the most help after a disaster. “It’s not a safety net,” said Craig Fugate, who served as the head of FEMA for all eight years of the Obama administration and, like other FEMA veterans, believes the current system is too confusing. “The system is really designed for the middle class. It’s not designed to take care of the pre-existing conditions.” *** Kimberly Williams, 49, knows the Kashmere Gardens area well. She grew up in the same house in which she currently lives. When Harvey struck, she waited indoors for more than two days until she was finally rescued via helicopter. Things haven’t gotten much better in the months since. She applied to FEMA for assistance, hoping to jump-start her repairs, and received a response by the end of September: Denied. Williams was rejected for help under FEMA’s individual assistance program for a familiar reason: She lived in a flood zone but never purchased flood insurance. Under the law, any homeowner who lives in a flood zone and previously received FEMA assistance must purchase insurance in order to be eligible for FEMA assistance in the future. Her dad received aid from FEMA after Hurricane Ike struck their property in 2008. But flood insurance was expensive — for families in a flood zone, the average annual cost is nearly $1,100 — and Williams, who was working as a contract bus driver at a nearby chemical plant, couldn’t afford it. When Harvey hit, FEMA denied her aid. “It’s all a bunch of smoke and mirrors,” she said. Gloria Doby, 67, faced a similar problem. Doby’s mother, who had lived in the house since 1957, received FEMA aid after Hurricane Allison struck the region in 2001. When her mom was moved to a nursing home in 2011, Doby moved into the house — but she didn’t know she lived in a flood zone or that she had to purchase insurance. “I had no idea,” she said. After Harvey pushed her entire house off its 3-foot-tall blocks, Doby, a police-department retiree on a fixed income, applied to FEMA but received the same response as Williams: denial because she hadn’t purchased flood insurance. Citing federal privacy law, FEMA declined to discuss the details of Williams’ or Doby’s cases, or those of any other Houston residents. But more than a half-year after Harvey, Doby remains furious over the denial of benefits. “The government doesn’t care about you at all, especially in a black neighborhood, especially in a poor neighborhood,” she said, standing outside the entrance to her home on a Tuesday evening in mid-April. After Harvey pushed her entire house off its 3-foot-tall blocks, Gloria Doby, 67, applied for FEMA aid but was denied. She was told that homeowners who live in flood zones and previously received FEMA assistance must buy insurance in order to be eligible for aid in the future. It turned out her mother, who moved out of the house in 2011, had received aid in 2001. “I had no idea,” Doby said. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Downey, the neighborhood leader, said in extremely poor neighborhoods like Kashmere Gardens, few residents purchase insurance, which costs more than 5 percent of the average family’s budget. Houston was hit hard by the drop in the price of oil, which led mining firms to close rigs and cut nearly 100,000 jobs. The Houston economy has rebounded in recent months, but many families remain in a precarious financial position. Purchasing flood insurance, even for those who are far from the bottom of the ladder, simply isn’t a priority. “If you are worried about feeding your kids every week, buying flood insurance is not on your radar,” acknowledged Fugate, the former FEMA administrator. A first-of-its-kind study, released by FEMA in mid-April, found that low-income homeowners are disproportionately likely to live in flood-prone areas but that those who purchase flood insurance have a median income of $82,000, compared with $55,000 for non-policyholders, suggesting that lower-income families simply choose to do without it. Roy Wright, director of the National Flood Insurance Program, told reporters that the results were “startling.” In Texas, the numbers are even starker. Texas homeowners with flood insurance have a median income of $94,049, compared with $54,085 for those without insurance. Looking just within flood zones in Texas, the median income of families with flood insurance is $82,184, while families without insurance have a median income of just $36,056. Moreover, flood insurance is projected to become more expensive as climate change increases the frequency of catastrophic storms. Houston, for instance, has been hit by three 500-year floods in the past three years. In its study, FEMA offered four proposals to make flood insurance more affordable by subsidizing the premiums of low-income homeowners. The changes all require legislative action. But while Congress has expressed concern about the affordability of the flood insurance program, lawmakers have not proposed specific legislation to fix the issue. “Congress gave FEMA the authority to study the program but not address it,” said McFadden of Enterprise Community Partners. “Congress needs to do something so homeowners can afford to stay in their homes.” Meanwhile, FEMA’s study also touched on a tension at the heart of the federal disaster recovery framework: Larger flood insurance subsidies encourage people to live in flood zones, exacerbating the financial challenges within the National Flood Insurance Program, which is $20 billion in debt, even after Congress wiped away $16 billion of its debt last fall. Any new subsidies for low-income households, the agency noted, would “work against creating a sound financial framework for the NFIP.” Lawmakers are considering making more changes to put the federal flood insurance program on better financial footing, but that would likely mean shifting to a more risk-based approach, which would further raise premiums and make it that much harder for poor residents to afford insurance. *** To many families in Kashmere Gardens, one of the worst nightmares of Hurricane Harvey came after the waters receded. Inspectors showed up at their homes, tablets in hand, and spent a half-hour asking questions and collecting documents on the damage to their homes. Soon after came the bad news: A letter explaining how much assistance, if any, FEMA would give to the homeowner or renter. In most cases, residents found the amounts shockingly low. “Those who have received something from FEMA, it wasn’t enough,” said Downey. Pamela Warren, 56, was one such resident. Warren, who is disabled and uses a wheelchair, was forced to ride out Harvey with her husband, who is blind, in the house they had rented for the past eight years. They stayed in their bedroom, away from their porch where the water was quickly rising. But rain began to come through their roof, so the disabled couple struggled to pull their mattress into the dining room to avoid the waters. “I’ve never been as scared of anything before,” she said. Shortly after Harvey passed, Warren applied for FEMA aid. As renters, Warren and her husband weren’t eligible for damage to the home. But she and her husband could receive compensation for their personal belongings. The total was $900, which Warren thought was far below the actual cost of her lost furniture, clothes and other household items. Pamela Warren, 56, said she still has nightmares and gets anxious when hearing rain after she and her blind husband were forced to ride out Harvey in their rented home. “I’ve never been as scared of anything before,” said Warren, who uses a wheelchair. They received $900 from FEMA for all their lost personal belongings – furniture, clothes and other household items. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Lawyers for local residents said Warren is not alone in her dismay. FEMA’s individual assistance program is something of a “black box,” they said, and rarely gives applicants what they need to repair their homes or replace their belongings. The process of determining how much each victim receives is built around the in-person inspection, in which a federal contractor spends roughly 30 minutes documenting the damage and reviewing paperwork. (When a home is difficult to reach or unsafe to visit, FEMA relies on satellite photos and other information to conduct a geospatial inspection.) Denials are fast and furious: In Texas, roughly half of the 741,000 applicants were rejected for any aid at all. The most common reason is that the “home is habitable,” according to FEMA data. Asked how FEMA decides how much money each family will get, Jenny Burke, FEMA’s press secretary, directed POLITICO to the agency’s 144-page guidebook on its individual assistance program, which provides details on everything from the requirements for receiving aid to the appeals process to how FEMA will recoup overpayments. Yet it says little about how FEMA determines a monetary figure. Burke, in an email, explained that FEMA maintains a database of prices for damaged property — from common household goods to structural components of the home — which determines how much a family receives for its losses. The prices are updated quarterly but FEMA does not publish them “because they can be vastly different for each county/state.” Often, residents come away with little or nothing. That’s because Congress never intended for FEMA to make people whole after a disaster. In fact, the underlying law — the Stafford Act — allows FEMA to provide assistance to restore a house only to “a safe and sanitary living or functioning condition.” In its guidance document, FEMA explains that assistance is available only for certain repairs, including structural components of the home, critical utilities and other hazards, such as wet or moldy drywall and carpet. “It is not intended to return the home to its pre-disaster conditions,” the document says. As a result, even heavily damaged households usually don’t receive anything close to the maximum FEMA assistance of $34,000. In Houston, the average grant is roughly $4,300. “Congress wants to have their cake and eat it too,” said a former FEMA official. “They want to help everyone after a disaster — but not too much.” These limitations frustrate advocates for the poor, who argue that, unlike the middle and upper classes, low-income homeowners don’t have the savings to make repairs not covered by FEMA. And while middle- and upper-class neighborhoods tend to rebound quickly after disasters — helped along by flood insurance that can restore homes to mint condition — lower-income neighborhoods can be scarred for decades. “When it comes to some of the most challenging needs, it’s like no one wants to be stuck holding the hot potato,” said Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “Congress says its FEMA’s job. And FEMA says it a state’s job. And states are often now saying it’s the local government’s job. No one wants to be left saying we hold the responsibility for making sure the lowest-income people are at least made whole after a disaster.” Yentel and other advocates say FEMA’s appeals process is particularly difficult for low-income residents. On the surface, it seems straightforward: Applicants who believe they were wrongly denied assistance may submit a form explaining their dispute and providing supporting documentation. But applicants often do not know the reason behind their rejection, making it difficult to know what information to include. Rejection letters typically provide very brief explanations that can be interpreted in multiple ways. Tracy Figueroa, a lawyer at Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, said that when FEMA rejects applicants because of insufficient damage, it could mean any of three things: that the inspector determined that the home wasn’t damaged by the disaster; that the home was damaged but is safe to live in; or that the home is unsafe to live in but the applicant can afford to fix it. “There’s three separate concepts and that cryptic notice doesn’t tell you which of the three,” said Figueroa. “You have to basically respond to each of those three concepts to cover your bases.” To improve their clients’ chances, lawyers often request the full inspection files from FEMA, allowing them to better target their appeal. After Harvey, however, an overburdened FEMA was slow to deliver the inspection files, delaying the appeals. In any case, most poor households don’t have access to lawyers like Figueroa to assist with their appeals. As a result, many don’t appeal their rejections at all. Greg Holden, 52, is shown April 18 outside his Houston home, which was heavily damaged following Hurricane Harvey. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO “When there is so much burden on the homeowner to collect everything that might possibly be an obstacle to getting assistance, it just discourages them from appealing altogether,” Figueroa said. “It’s a lot of work. … All those things pick away at somebody’s persistence.” Burke, the FEMA press secretary, said the agency held focus groups with disaster survivors to “provide feedback on their clarity” and revised the letters in 2016 and 2017. The agency plans to “further refine” the letters in late 2018, she added. “FEMA is committed to making communications with survivors as clear and concise as possible,” she said. Burke also acknowledged that the agency faced challenges responding quickly to requests for inspection files last fall. “Due to the historic nature of the 2017 disaster season, FEMA experienced a backlog of over 5,000 requests from survivors to receive their inspection files,” she said. “Additional staff was allocated to this area and the backlog was completed in early April.” At a congressional hearing in April, FEMA Administrator Long said the agency is considering whether to speed up the assistance process by reducing the number of in-person inspections and replacing them with geospatial inspections. “[An in-home inspection] is an arduous bureaucratic process when we have technology that can say ‘Yes, it’s damaged,’” Long said. “But it puts me in a tough spot because we have to protect the taxpaying dollar against fraud but we also have to move at lightning speed.” *** For much of America’s history, Congress funded disasters individually, creating an inconsistent, ad-hoc system that angered victims of those catastrophes that failed to evoke congressional action. In 1950, Congress decided to formalize the system, giving the president broad authority to respond to disasters. Over the next few decades, lawmakers slowly expanded those powers, giving numerous agencies a role in disaster recovery. With no lead agency coordinating those efforts, state officials grew frustrated at overlapping duties and worried that resources were being misused. To address those concerns, President Jimmy Carter signed an executive order on March 31, 1979, that officially established FEMA as the lead agency coordinating federal response and preparedness efforts. Soon afterward, Congress undertook its own study and passed the Stafford Act in 1988 to further empower FEMA. The law was meant to simplify the system, but many agencies continue to have roles in responding to emergencies, from the Department of Labor to the Department of Agriculture. And the Stafford Act itself is a study in contradictions. Lawmakers wanted to help communities recover, minimize fraud and preserve incentives for households to prepare for future disasters. But those goals are in tension: The more money FEMA provides disaster victims, the less incentive they have to prepare for a storm, and the faster FEMA doles out that money, the greater risk that some of it will fall into fraudulent hands. As a result, 30 years after President Ronald Reagan signed the Stafford Act into law, the disaster recovery system is anything but simple, with overlapping funding schemes and an alphabet soup of federal agencies involved in any response. The result, according to current and former officials, community advocates, and other disaster recovery experts, is a bureaucracy that is tough for even seasoned experts to follow, much less people with language problems or without access to computers. For them, the system can be almost entirely unnavigable. “Inequities and problems, particularly for low-income people, and especially for low-income people of color, are built inherently into each stage of the disaster recovery process,” said John Henneberger, co-director of Texas Housers, a nonprofit focused on low-income housing issues in Texas. In Texas, homeowners theoretically have many options. They can apply for FEMA’s individual assistance program as well as for federal loans — up to $200,000 for home repairs and an additional $40,000 for personal property damage — from the Small Business Administration. Unemployed workers can apply to the Department of Labor for disaster unemployment insurance while farmers can request disaster assistance from the USDA. Congress has also funded a disaster grant program at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, although that money takes months to become available. Then there are the state-level options: Texas has established two main programs to help homeowners recover. The Partial Repairs and Essential Power for Sheltering (PREPS) program is available only to homeowners with less than $17,000 in damage and will only fund temporary repairs. It is designed to get homeowners quickly back to functioning, if not exactly comfortable, homes. The second program, Direct Assistance for Limited Home Repair (DALHR), provides permanent repairs to homes with more than $17,000 in damage. However, repairs cannot exceed either $60,000 or 50 percent of the home’s value. The range of options — and the rules and requirements that come with each of them — leaves low-income victims confused and frustrated at some of the most challenging moments of their lives. Unlike middle- and upper-income homeowners, they often have little experience with government bureaucracy and don’t have the resources or capacity to figure it out. “My impression is that low-income homeowners in Northeast Houston really have no idea what the hell is going on at all. They are very confused,” said Ben Hirsch, a relief worker with West Street Recovery. “There’s your FEMA grant and your SBA loan, and PREPS and DALHR.” There are also myriad charitable groups, Hirsch added. “Then, there are also a bunch of scams.” Even taken together, the programs represent something of a Swiss cheese approach to disaster recovery, providing some support but leaving big holes. FEMA, for instance, offers a moderate amount of assistance to qualified applicants but relies on other programs, which are often underfunded and slow to launch, to fill in the cracks. “People who qualify for FEMA grant dollars are not in good financial situations in the first place,” said Fugate, the former FEMA administrator. “It’s a bridge, but sometimes it’s a bridge to nowhere if you aren’t able to find other programs to meet your needs.” After flood insurance and FEMA assistance, the next tier of federal disaster assistance comes from SBA, which offers low-rate loans to disaster victims. Despite its name, SBA lends out far more money to individuals after a disaster than to businesses. In fact, as of early January, SBA had lent more than $3 billion to Harvey victims— and 90 percent of that had gone to residents. For many middle- and high-income families without flood insurance, an SBA loan is attractive because the terms are better than those from private lenders. But many low-income families do not have enough income to qualify for an SBA loan; if they do, many are unable to take on the debt. The state-level programs help some homeowners but are available only for specific people. Homeowners with more than $17,000 in damage are ineligible for PREPS, for instance, while DALHR has such specific guidelines that, according to data released by the Texas government, repairs had been completed on just 214 homes as of May 4. *** GUTTED: Holden‘s Houston home is shown seven months after Hurricane Harvey hit. In Texas, roughly half of the 741,000 FEMA applicants were rejected for any aid at all. The most common reason is that the “home is habitable,” according to FEMA data. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO For low-income disaster victims, the final and most important pot of money comes from HUD in the form of its Community Development Block Grant program. The CDBG program typically funds local projects for a variety of reasons, from retaining businesses to increasing the supply of affordable housing. When a disaster hits, the program also, sometimes, provides disaster grants to states, cities and local governments, which then can distribute that money to their residents. Most importantly, the money is earmarked for the poor. As a rule, at least 70 percent of the money must principally help low- and middle-income homeowners. But the CDBG disaster recovery program has major problems as well. Grants often take more than a year to reach disaster victims. Unlike FEMA, HUD doesn’t have an existing fund to make grants when a disaster strikes. Instead, Congress must approve additional spending, a process that sometimes takes months. Smaller disasters rarely receive CDBG disaster grants. Once Congress passes new funding, HUD must issue new rules in the Federal Register for how a state can use the grants. The state must then draft and seek public comment on a spending plan before submitting it to HUD for approval. “It’s a challenge,” said Yentel. “Every disaster, the rules are reconsidered and sometimes rewritten. That certainly slows things down.” Tombar, the former HUD official, put it this way: “[The process] takes a whole lot of time and effort. Unfortunately, on the back end of all that, you have more human suffering and misery because people who have the greatest need are waiting for those resources.” In early September, after Hurricane Harvey struck the Gulf Coast, Congress quickly passed a $15 billion disaster spending bill, including $7.4 billion for CDBG disaster grants. In February, lawmakers approved an additional $28 billion in CDBG disaster grants. Community advocates are eager to put that money to use. Huey Wilson, the president of a local community organization near Kashmere Gardens called Trinity Gardens Super Neighborhood, said nonprofit groups desperately need new resources to continue repairing people’s homes. “Donations for supplies are drying up,” she said. But Wilson doesn’t expect that money to reach communities like hers until August or September. In early February, HUD announced that just over $5 billion of the first bloc of CDBG money was earmarked for Texas, which quickly began working on its state plan. That plan, unveiled in mid-April, was available for comment until May 1. The state’s General Land Office submitted its final plan to HUD for approval on May 8. That money is more than three times the $1.6 billion that FEMA has distributed to Harvey victims through its individual assistance program. But on the ground in Houston, few residents are even aware of it. “The homeowners we work with have never even heard of CDBG money,” said Hirsch, the relief worker. Even when the HUD dollars begin flowing, though, they are all but guaranteed to fall short. For one, Congress almost always underfunds the program. In Texas, the General Land Office, which is responsible for drafting its action plan, estimates that even after the $5 billion in CDBG money, the state will still need roughly $100 billion to rebuild, including more than $10 billion in housing assistance. “There’s never enough money,” said Pete Phillips, the staff lead on the program in Texas. He added that a permanent CDBG disaster grant program “would be beneficial across the board.” Meanwhile, advocates for the poor say Texas has chosen to use a faulty formula to allocate the CDBG money among different priorities, such as housing, infrastructure and other state goals, and among different counties. According to the formula, which was developed by HUD to determine “serious unmet needs” after a disaster, homeowners with less than $8,000 in damage or whose home had less than 1 foot of flooding do not have a “serious unmet need.” Renters with less than $2,000 in property damage are also excluded. Many low-income homeowners fall beneath those thresholds, simply because their homes or belongings aren’t worth much on the open market. Charlie Duncan, research director at Texas Housers, said Texas’ decision to use the formula causes money to be disproportionately shifted from poor, minority neighborhoods like Kashmere Gardens to more affluent areas. “About two-thirds of very low-income households are being cut out of ‘unmet needs,’” said Duncan. “You have entire communities across the state who are at or below 30 percent of the median income. These entire communities stand to not receive what they can to recover. This is a major problem.” MOTEL LIVING: Displaced by Harvey, Jacqueline Pope stays in a one-bedroom motel room with her husband and three kids. To pay for expenses, Pope said she had to pawn her wedding ring. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Duncan recommends that Texas adopt a different formula, assessing damages relative to a resident’s income level. Under such a system, the unmet needs of low and moderate-income homeowners would increase by more than $1 billion when compared to the formula Texas is using. Low-income areas like Kashmere Gardens would be a major beneficiary. “We [would be] providing a proportional recovery,” he said, “and making sure that everyone at these income levels is being assisted as fairly as possible.” Phillips, the state official, disputed Duncan’s comment, saying the state agency must use the HUD formula. “We’re limited by the data that HUD provides us,” he said. Texas did include additional factors to account for certain neighborhood challenges, like an inability to raise funds, he said. Still, Phillips said, he wouldn’t object to an HUD formula that better estimated unmet needs. “More accurate data is always a good thing,” he said. “If they want to provide us with more granularity, we aren’t going to complain.” However, Duncan, in an official comment submitted to the state land office, pointed to language in the Federal Register notice directing the state to “develop a needs assessment” without requiring the state to adopt HUD’s specific formula. Asked about the formula, a HUD spokesperson declined to comment. *** Petra Cervantes, a Mexican emigrant, lives in northeast Houston with her husband, Raul, who doesn’t speak English, and their two kids and two grandkids. FEMA gave the family a grant of $25,000 after the storm to help with repairs. The money covered less than half the total damages, which exceeded $50,000. But by spring, Cervantes said, nearly 80 percent of their home had been rebuilt. Soon after, a member of Pastor’s Army, an informal group founded after Harvey to assist families in rebuilding, visited their home, telling Cervantes that it still had mold and recommending that they start the rebuilding from scratch. The pastor, Cervantes recalled, said the family would be able to move back in within weeks, telling her, “We are professionals and know what we are doing.” She agreed to have her nearly rebuilt house gutted.

Nearly a month-and-a-half later, that rebuilding hadn’t begun.

ge tent in their driveway. On a recent visit, Cervantes’ two 4-year-old grandchildren were asleep on cots inside the hollowed-out home, lying just feet away from exposed electrical wires. Flies buzzed around the backyard where the family keeps chickens and rabbits. More than a dozen dogs, many unkempt with a powerful odor, ran around the home. Navigating a web of nonprofit organizations, private companies and home-repair contractors is yet another challenge facing low-income disaster victims. Often, these groups are well-intentioned, but they may lack the knowledge or experience to help with rebuilding, potentially providing bad advice or raising expectations about how quickly a family can move back into their home. Sometimes, these groups have more malicious motives, seeking to rip off homeowners. Scams proliferate widely in the aftermath of a disaster,0, and low-income disaster victims, particularly people of color and immigrants, might have more trouble distinguishing credible organizations from fraudulent ones, making them easy marks. Stories abound of people impersonating FEMA inspectors, looking to steal a disaster victim’s personal information, or fake contractors taking payment for a proposed job and never performing the work. In Cervantes’ case, she said that Pastor’s Army abandoned the project. Rick Aldridge, who founded Pastor’s Army and worked on emergency management issues for the Air Force, disputed Cervantes’ story, saying that he never gave her a timeline for completing the project. He also said he offered her the option of either gutting the house or making a less-extensive repair that risked leaving some mold. She chose to rebuild the whole house, he said. Pastor’s Army worked on the home until Cervantes said a relative would replace the electrical wiring. The project, Aldridge said, is now paused until Cervantes completes the rewiring and obtains a permit for further work. Once that happens, he said, Pastor’s Army will be happy to finish rebuilding her home. “We have offered to go back and finish her home, but she hasn’t called us,” he said. In fact, Aldridge said, the real problem stems from the initial work that was done on Cervantes’ home, which he called “not very good” and left considerable amounts of mold. That wasn’t a huge surprise. Subpar work is often a problem after disasters. Aldridge explained that volunteer contractors are desperately needed but often have little experience rebuilding homes. Even well-intentioned groups make mistakes that have serious consequences for homeowners. “We know [young volunteers] probably aren’t very experienced at rebuilding, but they do bring adult supervision and leadership that know how to do it. And we tend to supervise each of the houses,” he said. “Not every group has that ability. They go in, they literally watch a video about how to gut a house out and go do it. It may not necessarily be right.” Aldridge acknowledged, “There is some shoddy work, unfortunately. We may even do some shoddy work ourselves once in a while because there are so many homes and it goes so fast. We try not to. That’s why our group is slower than most.” The job of policing these organizations falls largely to state and local governments, but they rarely have the resources or manpower necessary to oversee the thousands of contractors that flood into a state seeking work after a disaster. Heather Way, a law professor at the University of Texas, released a report recently finding that the city of Houston had more than 420,000 rental units before Harvey but just two inspectors to check for problems like mold and sewage leaks. The city has recently hired a few more, but that still makes it nearly impossible to police housing-code violations. “With Harvey hitting and damaging thousands of units, the problems are only amplified,” said Way. A similar lack of oversight exists for homeowners. Mary Benton, the press secretary for Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, wrote in an email that the city “does not investigate potential scams.” She added, “We do not have oversight over nonprofits not funded by us, private foundations, other governmental entities (unless they are funded by us), or private homeowner investments.” Victor Senties, a spokesman for the Houston Police Department, said the department has a special unit called the “swindle squad” to investigate scams like impersonating a government official, but the squad is not focused solely on disaster-related incidents. The Texas attorney general has been more active policing such scams, setting up a toll-free line for residents to report such activities and providing advice for dealing with door-to-door salespeople. A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said the agency has received 181 complaints related to contractor fraud after Harvey. At the federal level, FEMA works with the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, an umbrella organization of private and nonprofit groups that help disaster victims. But the agency has no role regulating or overseeing groups that contact homeowners. The Justice Department also seeks to protect victims from fraud. In September, it issued departmentwide guidance to coordinate investigations and prosecutions for disaster-related fraud. DOJ’s National Center for Disaster Fraud also operates a call center to receive complaints and directs callers to the proper jurisdiction. However, it’s unclear whether homeowners use the agency to report potential fraudulent contractors and other malicious salespeople. Nicole Navas, a DOJ spokeswoman, said, “The vast majority of Harvey complaints to the NCDF relate to alleged identity theft affecting FEMA and Red Cross disbursements and alleged false information submitted by applicants in their FEMA assistance applications.” Nonetheless, more than eight months after Harvey, the Cervantes family has made little progress rebuilding their home. The $25,000 FEMA grant has all been spent. And the 2018 hurricane season begins on June 1. *** SAVINGS HIT: Angie Boykin,83, and her husband, Ray, who has early-stage dementia, paid $27,000 of their own money to cover home repairs after using up the funds from their flood insurance policy | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO In northeast Houston, residents and community leaders alike know that they aren’t ready for another Hurricane Harvey, or even a smaller storm. Angie Boykin,83, recently moved back into her home with her husband, Ray, who suffers from early-stage dementia. The Boykins used $40,000 from their flood-insurance policy and $27,000 of their own money to cover repairs. Her walls and floors have been fixed, unlike those of many of her neighbors. She’s waiting on a contractor to finish up a few stray items, but the rebuilding is nearly complete. If another storm strikes, she could be back to square one. At the end of her driveway, crucial drainage ditches dug before Harvey remain filled with debris, trash and other objects, blocking the path for water to escape to a nearby bayou. Downey and Wilson, the local community leaders, implore residents to remove the debris but progress is slow — and the negligence of even a few could result in another disaster for many. “We’re very, very concerned about the next storm season,” Downey said. “People are so fragile from the last storm.” In Washington, policymakers also express concern about the next hurricane season. Yet changes are coming slowly. In December, the House approved a disaster spending bill that included a requirement to begin simplifying the recovery system, but it never received a vote in the Senate. More recently, the House attached the same requirement to the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration. It’s unclear whether the Senate will take up the changes. While many experts support those reforms, they don’t represent a major redesign of the current system: Among other changes, the bill merely directs FEMA, HUD, SBA and other relevant agencies to submit reports to Congress within a year outlining ways to streamline the process. “After [Superstorm] Sandy, it was incredibly complicated for victims of the storm,” Rep. Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.), chairman of the House Homeland Security subcommittee on emergency preparedness, told POLITICO. “It was very cumbersome. People didn’t know which aid they were eligible for.” He added, “We’re hoping for one portal that people can go to in future disasters rather than having to mine the Internet to find out where they can get help.” In Texas, Puerto Rico and other areas struck by catastrophic disasters last year, people are still trying to navigate the current system and start rebuilding their lives. In Kashmere Gardens, many have lost their jobs, homes and precious belongings. Some have lost loved ones. Doby, the retiree who received no FEMA assistance to help rebuild her home, is in such a situation. She knows that her home is vulnerable and now understands that she’s required by FEMA to purchase flood insurance. But the insurance could cost her more than $800 a year, she said, so she’s unsure whether if she’s going to buy it — even as the 2018 hurricane season fast approaches.
