Eric Holthaus,"This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. In a remote region of Antarctica known as Pine Island Bay, 2,500 miles from the tip of South America, two glaciers hold human civilization hostage. Stretching across a frozen plain more than 150 miles long, these glaciers, named Pine Island and Thwaites, have marched steadily for millennia toward the Amundsen Sea, part of the vast Southern Ocean. Further inland, the glaciers widen into a two-mile-thick reserve of ice covering an area the size of Texas. There’s no doubt this ice will melt as the world warms. The vital question is when. The glaciers of Pine Island Bay are two of the largest and fastest-melting in Antarctica. (A Rolling Stone feature earlier this year dubbed Thwaites “ The Doomsday Glacier.”) Together, they act as a plug holding back enough ice to pour 11 feet of sea-level rise into the world’s oceans—an amount that would submerge every coastal city on the planet. For that reason, finding out how fast these glaciers will collapse is one of the most important scientific questions in the world today. To figure that out, scientists have been looking back to the end of the last ice age, about 11,000 years ago, when global temperatures stood at roughly their current levels. The bad news? There’s growing evidence that the Pine Island Bay glaciers collapsed rapidly back then, flooding the world’s coastlines—partially the result of something called “marine ice-cliff instability.” The ocean floor gets deeper toward the center of this part of Antarctica, so each new iceberg that breaks away exposes taller and taller cliffs. Ice gets so heavy that these taller cliffs can’t support their own weight. Once they start to crumble, the destruction would be unstoppable. “Ice is only so strong, so it will collapse if these cliffs reach a certain height,” explains Kristin Poinar, a glaciologist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. “We need to know how fast it’s going to happen.” In the past few years, scientists have identified marine ice-cliff instability as a feedback loop that could kickstart the disintegration of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet this century—much more quickly than previously thought. Minute-by-minute, huge skyscraper-sized shards of ice cliffs would crumble into the sea, as tall as the Statue of Liberty and as deep underwater as the height of the Empire State Building. The result: a global catastrophe the likes of which we’ve never seen. Ice comes in many forms, with different consequences when it melts. Floating ice, like the kind that covers the Arctic Ocean in wintertime and comprises ice shelves, doesn’t raise sea levels. (Think of a melting ice cube, which won’t cause a drink to spill over.) Land-based ice, on the other hand, is much more troublesome. When it falls into the ocean, it adds to the overall volume of liquid in the seas. Thus, sea-level rise. Antarctica is a giant landmass—about half the size of Africa—and the ice that covers it averages more than a mile thick. Before human burning of fossil fuels triggered global warming, the continent’s ice was in relative balance: The snows in the interior of the continent roughly matched the icebergs that broke away from glaciers at its edges. Now, as carbon dioxide traps more heat in the atmosphere and warms the planet, the scales have tipped. A wholesale collapse of Pine Island and Thwaites would set off a catastrophe. Giant icebergs would stream away from Antarctica like a parade of frozen soldiers. All over the world, high tides would creep higher, slowly burying every shoreline on the planet, flooding coastal cities and creating hundreds of millions of climate refugees. All this could play out in a mere 20 to 50 years—much too quickly for humanity to adapt. “With marine ice cliff instability, sea-level rise for the next century is potentially much larger than we thought it might be five or 10 years ago,” Poinar says. A lot of this newfound concern is driven by the research of two climatologists: Rob DeConto at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and David Pollard at Penn State University. A study they published last year was the first to incorporate the latest understanding of marine ice-cliff instability into a continent-scale model of Antarctica. Their results drove estimates for how high the seas could rise this century sharply higher. “Antarctic model raises prospect of unstoppable ice collapse,” read the headline in the scientific journal Nature, a publication not known for hyperbole. Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings. But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario, the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up, their study showed. Three feet of sea-level rise would be bad, leading to more frequent flooding of US cities such as New Orleans, Houston, New York, and Miami. Pacific Island nations, like the Marshall Islands, would lose most of their territory. Unfortunately, it now seems like three feet is possible only under the rosiest of scenarios. At six feet, though, around 12 million people in the United States would be displaced, and the world’s most vulnerable megacities, like Shanghai, Mumbai, and Ho Chi Minh City, could be wiped off the map. At 11 feet, land currently inhabited by hundreds of millions of people worldwide would wind up underwater. South Florida would be largely uninhabitable; floods on the scale of Hurricane Sandy would strike twice a month in New York and New Jersey, as the tug of the moon alone would be enough to send tidewaters into homes and buildings. DeConto and Pollard’s breakthrough came from trying to match observations of ancient sea levels at shorelines around the world with current ice sheet behavior. Around 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were about as warm as they’re expected to be later this century, oceans were dozens of feet higher than today. Previous models suggested that it would take hundreds or thousands of years for sea-level rise of that magnitude to occur. But once they accounted for marine ice-cliff instability, DeConto and Pollard’s model pointed toward a catastrophe if the world maintains a “business as usual” path—meaning we don’t dramatically reduce carbon emissions. Rapid cuts in greenhouse gases, however, showed Antarctica remaining almost completely intact for hundreds of years. Pollard and DeConto are the first to admit that their model is still crude, but its results have pushed the entire scientific community into emergency mode. “It could happen faster or slower, I don’t think we really know yet,” says Jeremy Bassis, a leading ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan. “But it’s within the realm of possibility, and that’s kind of a scary thing.” Scientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates. These are, after all, mile-thick chunks of ice. The new evidence, though, says that once a certain temperature threshold is reached, ice shelves of glaciers that extend into the sea, like those near Pine Island Bay, will begin to melt from both above and below, weakening their structure and hastening their demise, and paving the way for ice-cliff instability to kick in. In a new study out last month in the journal Nature, a team of scientists from Cambridge and Sweden point to evidence from thousands of scratches left by ancient icebergs on the ocean floor, indicating that Pine Island’s glaciers shattered in a relatively short amount of time at the end of the last ice age. The only place in the world where you can see ice-cliff instability in action today is at Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland, one of the fastest-collapsing glaciers in the world. DeConto says that to construct their model, they took the collapse rate of Jakobshavn, cut it in half to be extra conservative, then applied it to Thwaites and Pine Island. But there’s reason to think Thwaites and Pine Island could go even faster than Jakobshavn. Right now, there’s a floating ice shelf protecting the two glaciers, helping to hold back the flow of ice into the sea. But recent examples from other regions, like the rapidly collapsing Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, show that once ice shelves break apart as a result of warming, their parent glaciers start to flow faster toward the sea, an effect that can weaken the stability of ice further inland, too. “If you remove the ice shelf, there’s a potential that not just ice-cliff instabilities will start occurring, but a process called marine ice-sheet instabilities,” says Matthew Wise, a polar scientist at the University of Cambridge. This signals the possible rapid destabilization of the entire West Antarctic ice sheet in this century. “Once the stresses exceed the strength of the ice,” Wise says, “it just falls off.” And, it’s not just Pine Island Bay. On our current course, other glaciers around Antarctica will be similarly vulnerable. And then there’s Greenland, which could contribute as much as 20 feet of sea-level rise if it melts. Next to a meteor strike, rapid sea-level rise from collapsing ice cliffs is one of the quickest ways our world can remake itself. This is about as fast as climate change gets. Still, some scientists aren’t fully convinced the alarm is warranted. Ted Scambos, lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado, says the new research by Wise and his colleagues, which identified ice-cliff instabilities in Pine Island Bay 11,000 years ago, is “tantalizing evidence.” But he says that research doesn’t establish how quickly it happened. “There’s a whole lot more to understand if we’re going to use this mechanism to predict how far Thwaites glacier and the other glaciers are going to retreat,” he says. “The question boils down to, what are the brakes on this process?” Scambos thinks it is unlikely that Thwaites or Pine Island would collapse all at once. For one thing, if rapid collapse did happen, it would produce a pile of icebergs that could act like a temporary ice shelf, slowing down the rate of retreat. Despite the differences of opinion, however, there’s growing agreement within the scientific community that we need to do much more to determine the risk of rapid sea-level rise. In 2015, the US and UK governments began to plan a rare and urgent joint research program to study Thwaites glacier. Called “How much, how fast?,” the effort is set to begin early next year and run for five years. Seeing the two governments pooling their resources is “really a sign of the importance of research like this,” NASA’s Poinar says. Given what’s at stake, the research program at Thwaites isn’t enough, but it might be the most researchers can get. “Realistically, it’s probably all that can be done in the next five years in the current funding environment,” says Pollard. He’s referring, of course, to the Trump administration’s disregard for science and adequate scientific funding; the White House’s 2018 budget proposal includes the first-ever cut to the National Science Foundation, which typically funds research in Antarctica. “It would be sensible to put a huge effort into this, from my perspective,” Pollard says. Structural engineers need to study Antarctica’s key glaciers as though they were analyzing a building, he says, probing for weak spots and understanding how exactly they might fail. “If you vastly increase the research now, [the cost] would still be trivial compared to the losses that might happen.” Bassis, the ice sheet scientist at the University of Michigan, first described the theoretical process of marine ice-cliff instability in research published only a few years ago. He’s 40 years old, but his field has already changed enormously over the course of his career. In 2002, when Bassis was conducting his PhD research in a different region of Antarctica, he was shocked to return to his base camp and learn that the Larsen B ice shelf had vanished practically overnight. “Every revision to our understanding has said that ice sheets can change faster than we thought,” he says. “We didn’t predict that Pine Island was going to retreat, we didn’t predict that Larsen B was going to disintegrate. We tend to look at these things after they’ve happened.” There’s a recurring theme throughout these scientists’ findings in Antarctica: What we do now will determine how quickly Pine Island and Thwaites collapse. A fast transition away from fossil fuels in the next few decades could be enough to put off rapid sea-level rise for centuries. That’s a decision worth countless trillions of dollars and millions of lives. “The range of outcomes,” Bassis says, “is really going to depend on choices that people make.”",Rapid collapse of Antarctic glaciers could flood coastal cities by the end of this century.,2017-11-30T14:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Two Melting Antarctic Glaciers Could Decide the Fate of Our Coastlines,https://www.wired.com/story/two-melting-glaciers-could-decide-the-fate-of-our-coastlines/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a1f4e7f0cb1f52c24d06716/191:100/pass/glacier-TAFA.jpg,wired,Wired,flood,0

Mike Butcher,"The flood underinsurance problem is arguably the largest unsolved problem in insurance. Over the last ten years, an average of $41bn per year of flood damage has gone uncovered by insurance, leaving people, businesses and governments to pay the bill. It’s estimated that there are $50bn of losses caused by floods around the world. Currently, only $9bn of these are covered by insurance. FloodFlash, an insurtech startup that offers a way for customers to insure their property for flood risk, even in high risk areas, by employing an internet-connected water-sensor has raised £1.9m in seed funding from LocalGlobe, Pentech Ventures and InsurTech Gateway. They previously secured a pre-seed/Angel round in 2017 (Hambro Perks Insurtech Gateway and one private investor). When a flood happens, it triggers an internet-connected water-sensor and the payment is made immediately to the policy holder. A FloodFlash policy pays out a pre-agreed, fixed sum as soon as a pre-defined level of flooding occurs. A slice of the premium goes to FloodFlash in return for installing the sensor, plus automated underwriting and claims services. Founders, Adam Rimmer and Ian Bartholomew, created the company after looking at “parametric catastrophe bonds”. These are typically used by large corporations or governments to recover large sums in the event of a catastrophe, but many of the benefits they confer were previously unavailable to small- and medium-sized enterprises. Rimmer says: “Every year tens of thousands of business owners lose their livelihoods because they have been unable to take out an affordable policy that protects their business. In the immediate aftermath of a catastrophic flood, people care less about dollar-for-dollar reimbursement for damages and more about whether their business will survive at all. We believe FloodFlash’s event-based insurance is absolutely the best way for insurers to cover higher-risk areas.” FloodFlash is regulated by the FCA and is currently carrying out a live pilot for its policies with a select group of SMEs in parts of the UK with significant flood risk, including Carlisle. Insurance capacity for FloodFlash policies is provided by Everest Re through their syndicate at Lloyd’s of London. The startup has been working as part of the InsurTech Gateway, the InsurTech focused incubator since mid 2017. Tara Reeves, partner at LocalGlobe, said: “Climate change is leading to more extreme weather events, but these are often hard to insure. Parametric insurance dramatically reduces underwriting and loss adjustment costs, and those savings can be passed on to the consumer. Adam and Ian’s background in risk modelling and hydrology is uniquely suited to this challenge.” Eddie Anderson, partner at Pentech Ventures, said: “FloodFlash is a business that has global potential. There is no country on the planet where severe or freak weather does not cause havoc, whether it is flood or hurricane. We think markets around the world will welcome this innovative, cost-effective way to sell insurance that has been adapted to take into account the way we live today.”","The flood underinsurance problem is arguably the largest unsolved problem in insurance.

Marcello Rossi,"This story originally appeared on CityLab and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. On a gray, late-winter day, a converted chapel in the Arsenal, the city’s medieval boatyard, hummed with 21st-century activity. Engineers were looking at screens that displayed tables, maps, and charts on the conditions of the Venetian Lagoon. This was the MOSE control center: the operational heart of a megaproject to protect Venice, one of the world’s most beautiful cities, from threatening waters. For nearly seven years, the engineers here have raised and lowered virtual doors, gathering a series of data to be conveyed into a sophisticated forecasting model. Spread across dozens of islands and known as “the floating city” for its ubiquitous canals and bridges, Venice has grappled with inundation for centuries. But due to natural subsidence and the higher tides caused by global warming, the city is more vulnerable to flooding than ever before. So a flood barrier seemed like the obvious way to thwart future disasters. MOSE (an acronym for Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico, or “Experimental Electromechanical Module”) is one of the world’s largest and highest-profile civil-engineering works. It consists of a series of retractable floodgates stretching across the mouths of the lagoon’s three inlets. These gates can be raised on command to create a temporary wall against the sea in the event of a high tide. Work on MOSE began in 2003, but after countless delays (caused by a corruption scandal and financial and structural issues), the barrier has yet to be completed. The hard part is done, however, and most of the engineers at the control center were confident that the system will become fully operational soon. Since the final leg of construction has been stalled for months, though, no one could say exactly when. Some said later this year; others said 2020 was closer to reality. Whatever the date, it still remains unclear whether MOSE will adequately protect the city. And if so, for how long? MOSE operates on the principle of tidal gates. In calm weather, the gates fill with water and sit on the seabed. But when a high tide threatens, the water is pushed out by compressed air that’s pumped in. This allows the gates to surface and prevent the tide from entering the lagoon. When the surge subsides, the gates again fill with water and sink back to the bottom. “The idea is quite old,” said Paola Malanotte-Rizzoli, a physical oceanographer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was among the panel of experts enlisted by the Italian government to come up with a solution. “We have evidence that Venetian engineers drafted mechanical contraptions to hold back the sea as long ago as in the 18th century.” Nevertheless, a barrage of criticism has accompanied the project since its beginning. Environmental groups said that construction of the barrier would jeopardize the marine ecosystem beyond repair, while some politicians opposed the idea, stating that there were too many unknowns and that a cheaper solution was needed. Many experts agree, however, that when the seas rise, there aren’t many alternatives to building a barrier to stop it—especially in a one-of-a-kind city like Venice. “The concept behind MOSE is good,” said Jörg Imberger, an environmental engineer who teaches ocean sciences at the University of Miami. “But it all depends on what is meant by protection.” According to Imberger, if everything goes as planned, MOSE will protect Venice from floods like the catastrophic one in 1966 for the next three decades or so. “But since the gates are raised only when the tide reaches 110 centimeters [roughly 43 inches], MOSE won’t avoid the flooding phenomenon that already takes place in low-lying sites like Saint Mark’s Square, which inundates when the tide gets above 80 centimeters [about 32 inches],” he said. “This could be potentially fixed by lifting the barrier at lower tides. But that would have some adverse effects on the health of the lagoon.” The outlook gets foggier when it comes to the long run. Like much else in this world, MOSE’s effectiveness depends on how much carbon dioxide is pumped into the atmosphere over coming decades, and hence how fast sea levels rise during the barrier’s 50-year lifespan. Furthermore, conflicting statements on its engineering parameters do little to clarify. According to a 2011 UNESCO report, three sea-level-rise scenarios for 2100 were considered during the planning phase: 16 centimeters (about 6 inches), 22 centimeters (about 9 inches), and 31.4 centimeters (approximately one foot). Planners suggested using the second one, labeled as “prudent.” But today, even the third scenario seems over-optimistic. With climate change, the Mediterranean Sea is projected to rise up to five feet before 2100, meaning that mean water level could reach the critical threshold of 110 centimeters. That would cause Venice to suffer flooding twice a day at high tide. Malanotte-Rizzoli maintains that MOSE was engineered to handle about 2 feet of sea-level rise. The New Venice Consortium, the organization entrusted with building the barrier, says the same, but this reporter could find no evidence that this was an official project goal. The question of capabilities is crucial, not only because sea-level rise makes higher storm surges more likely, but because it will require the barrier to activate more often—increasing wear and tear on a structure that has already experienced structural problems. According to Georg Umgiesser, an oceanographer at the Italian National Research Council’s Institute of Marine Sciences, with 50 centimeters (about 20 inches) of sea-level rise, the barrier will be closed once a day, whereas with 70 centimeters (about 28 inches), the gates will be closed more often than they are open. “More frequent closing doesn’t only imply additional maintenance costs,” Umgiesser said, “but an ever-increasing dependence on the barrier to avert severe flooding. A failure could be devastating.” Over the years, alternatives to a seawall have been proposed. Some offered tweaks to the system of mobile gates, while others involved different technologies. Still others were aimed only at making the flooding more bearable. So far, though, none has found wide support. At any rate, it seems clear that Venice, like many other coastal cities around the world, won’t be saved by a barrier alone. “Since the 1966 flood, the frequency of tides over 110 centimeters has doubled each decade,” said Giovanni Cecconi, head of the Venice Resilience Lab. “And this trend is not going to stop anytime soon, even if emissions were curbed.” “It’s obvious that MOSE is not a magic wand,” he continued, “but rather something that will allow us to take time to figure out and implement new ways to cope with a crisis.” More Climate Science","Finally, construction is finishing on the delayed barrier to protect the city from high tides.

Martha Pskowski,"“SCANDAL!!,” read the Facebook post of Mexican comedian and journalist Jorge Roberto Avilés on March 6th. “The government of Venezuela has confirmed on its television station (Venevision) what we all already knew: Nicolás Maduro is behind Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s campaign.” Accompanying the post was a video that proved what opponents of López Obrador, a three-time Mexican presidential candidate, had long claimed: López Obrador was a crony of the Venezuelan Chavista regime, and his latest presidential campaign — which culminates with the upcoming July 1st presidential election — was propped up by a foreign regime. The video features the logos of Venezuela’s state-backed television station Venezolana de Televisión (VTV) and depicts a newscaster saying, “With the triumph of this Latin American leader on July 1, the Bolivarian Revolution will have a first-rate ally in the continent to confront international attacks.” Venezuela has become an aphorism for the fears of many Mexican voters. Though López Obrador has consistently denied any formal ties to Venezuela, the video looked like proof of a connection. The clip spread fast — Avilés has 1.6 million followers on Facebook — and by March 12th, it had racked up more than 630,000 views. The video looked like proof of a foreign connection But something was off: the logos weren’t from VTV, and the videos’ timestamps read 7:58PM — a slot when VTV doesn’t broadcast news. For discerning observers, all the signs were there. The clip shared by Avilés wasn’t a VTV clip but instead a strange amalgamation of video, audio, and fabricated graphics from three separate sources. It was, in other words, a piece of fake news. With Mexico’s election on the horizon, weeding out fake news in the country of 127 million has never been more pressing. Mexicans have long distrusted the press, and for good reason. For decades, the national news media here consisted of two television networks and a handful of newspapers, all propped up financially by the controlling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Coverage of the government was favorable, and negative stories were buried. “When the government wanted to announce something, it came out over Televisa,” says Esteban Illades, editor of the Mexican magazine Nexos and author of the recent book Fake News: Una nueva realidad. “It was very rare to find a version that contradicted the government line in these ‘official’ news outlets.” Government publicity continues to be an important line item in media companies’ budgets. A report by the Mexican NGO Fundar, published in September 2017, found that the government spent $1.88 billion between January 2013 and June 2017 on media advertising, and many outlets still report the “official” version of events without further investigation. A Bloomberg investigation last fall revealed that politicians paid for packages of positive stories or to suppress negative reports. Fact-checking, says Illades, is just starting to permeate Mexican newsrooms. As a result, a 2018 poll suggested that more Mexicans trust the army and the Catholic Church than the media. Social media and digital outlets have emerged as an important counterbalance to government-controlled media — but it also presents the risks of mass misinformation. Mexico is a hub in the Spanish-speaking world for bot farms. In the 2012 presidential campaign, now-imprisoned Colombian hacker Andrés Sepúlveda claims to have launched 30,000 Twitter bots in support of Peña Nieto’s campaign. Many Mexicans also get their news from messaging applications like WhatsApp, and news outlets are hard-pressed to catch up when chain messages spread inaccurate information almost instantaneously. A 2018 poll suggested that more Mexicans trust the army and the Catholic Church than the media July 1st will be the largest election in Mexican history. Voters will be deciding on the makeup of the Senate, state and local races, and voting for a president. In terms of managing the spread of fake news, Illades says, “2018 is a trial by fire.” When the video of Maduro endorsing López Obrador went viral, Verificado 18, a new Mexican fact-checking initiative, was just setting up its office in the Condesa neighborhood of Mexico City. Verificado 18 is the brainchild of Tania Montalvo, the editor of the fact-checking unit at digital media outlet Animal Político. With funding from Google and Facebook, Verificado 18 has hired 12 journalists and data analysts to work full-time for the duration of the presidential campaign. They have a clear mission: “To confront two phenomenons: on the one hand, fake news, and on the other, [the candidates’] impossible promises and unsubstantiated critiques,” according to the website. Verificado 18 partners with local papers across the country, ranging from El Diario de Yucatán in Southeastern Mexico to the national television and print behemoth Milenio. In the vein of ElectionLand in the States, the team fact-checks viral stories and the candidates’ claims in debates and speeches. Verificado 18 has fact-checked stories ranging from Pope Francis speaking out against López Obrador ( false ) to candidate Ricardo Anaya speaking in favor of the border wall ( false ) to the first lady of Zacatecas praying for the country not to become a socialist dictatorship ( true ). As the Maduro clip spread across Facebook, the Verificado 18 team reached out to video experts and Venezuelan television journalists to help analyze it. Jorge Ramís, the audience editor at Verificado 18, says that a few obvious errors tipped them off that the video was fake. “The logo was placed wrong, and in other technical aspects, it didn’t match up to what [VTV] broadcasts,” he says. Venezuelan journalists noted that the broadcast supposedly aired at 7:58PM, a time slot when VTV does not broadcast news. It appears that the video was fabricated by pasting an audio recording over video footage made in Mexico combined with lifted VTV logos. Verificado 18 revealed that the pro-López Obrador subtitles and images of the candidate had been pasted onto an unrelated broadcast On March 12th, Verificado 18 published an explainer debunking the video. The explainer was then reprinted by numerous partner news outlets. Avilés removed the video, and a radio program that he appears on, La Maldita Hora, issued an apology, saying they “never intended to deliberately spread false information on our platforms.” Keeping up with the steady flow of fake news is a constant challenge. In January, another viral video spread across Facebook, supposedly depicting a Russia Today (RT) TV broadcaster announcing that the Kremlin was also supporting López Obrador. Verificado 18 sought out a Russian translator and subsequently revealed that the pro-López Obrador subtitles and images of the candidate had been pasted onto an unrelated broadcast, which was, in fact, from the channel Rossiya 24. Despite Verificado 18’s best efforts, digital rights activists warn that the threat of misinformation is only growing. De ESCÁNDALO esto no tiene nada, de FALSO todo. pic.twitter.com/wJR4Ma1Mo1 — AJ+ Español (@ajplusespanol) March 13, 2018 Alberto Escorcia has tracked Twitter trends in Mexico since 2010 on his website Lo Que Sigue, and he currently reports on bots for BuzzFeed México. He says that, like in the States, organized networks of paid social media users amplify fake stories. “These networks are a tool to destabilize countries and to change elections,” he told The Verge over Skype. He’s lived outside Mexico for a year due to violent threats for his work. Facebook and Twitter have taken more proactive steps to combat the spread of fake news since Trump’s election. But Escorcia says that their efforts fall short in developing countries. In his experience, the most robust troll and cyborg networks exist in Honduras and Mexico. “ The rules from Twitter aren’t enough,” Escorcia says. “An attack must line up exactly with what the rules prohibit for them to take down the account.” He explains how politicians enlist social media in disinformation campaigns: a politician goes to a middleman, who then contracts a public relations agency specialized in social network manipulation. The agencies offer different portfolios of social network profiles to promote messages in favor of the politician or ones critical of his opponents. Payments are made in cash. “These interactions are semi-clandestine, so it’s hard to find a paper trail,” he says. The same structure has been documented in investigative reports by ADN Político and Univisión. Escorcia says the groups are effective because they have an eager, low-wage labor pool. “The conditions in our country, or a country like Bangladesh or Vietnam, lead many jobless people to get involved in this business,” Escorcia explains. Montalvo of Verificado 18 says that Facebook has been just as integral to the spread of fake news, with pages disguised as news outlets publishing a mix of true and false stories. One such page — Diario de Oaxaca — has over 450,000 followers. Even a fake story published on Diario de Oaxaca that is “downgraded” through Facebook’s Third Party Fact-Checking (of which Verificado 18 is a part) can reach thousands of people. Then there’s WhatsApp, which allows users to create groups with hundreds of members. Chain messages about the election are circulating over WhatsApp groups, with no mechanism to trace the origin of the information. The Center for International Media Assistance recently wrote that while Facebook and Twitter receive more attention, “ private, ‘dark social’ messengers [including Signal, Telegram, and Whatsapp] may be all the more to blame for the viral spread of disinformation, which is nearly impossible to track or counter once it is being circulated.” “The conditions in our country, or a country like Bangladesh or Vietnam, lead many jobless people to get involved in this business.” Verificado 18 has opened a WhatsApp account to receive reports of election-related chain messages, but it acknowledges that it’s the hardest platform to track. Observers doubt that fake news will sway the election or upend López Obrador’s expected victory. López Obrador currently has a double-digit lead, and Mexico’s presidential election is determined by plurality. Nonetheless, fake news has amplified the polarization between López Obrador’s supporters and his detractors. Escorcia worries that even if López Obrador wins by a significant percentage, orchestrated social media campaigns could provoke violence during the post-election period. He points to an incident in January 2017, during the “Gasolinazo,” when the government announced an increase in gas prices. As people took to the streets in protest, bots pushed the hashtag #SaqueaUnWalmart (loot a Walmart), which became a Trending Topic in Mexico City on January 3rd. The hashtag then circulated over WhatsApp, setting off fears of widespread looting. Hundreds of businesses closed early, and people took shelter, but only a handful of stores were actually looted. Escorcia considers this a “combined operation,” where a fabricated story online provokes reactions in the streets. He envisions a similar situation playing out if López Obrador is elected — bots and human actors inciting panic during the inauguration, for example. “I think it’s going to get ugly on election day,” says Escorcia. “Bots aren’t just used for political propaganda; they can be used to repress and stop resistance.”","As Mexico gears up for the largest election in its history, the nonprofit Verificado 18 is struggling to confront and debunk a flood of fake news across Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp.",2018-06-27T14:46:30Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Mexico struggles to weed out fake news ahead of its biggest election ever,https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17503444/mexico-election-fake-news-facebook-twitter-whatsapp,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZWrJDEF_PfP768vXfVRhMZhW2dI=/0x185:2040x1253/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11596485/VRG_ILLO_2692_v04.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,flood,0
"Marnie Shure on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","Ive watched my mother host 29 Thanksgivings. This roughly equates to a collective 870 guests, a metric half-ton of turkey, and enough gravy to flood the Chicago suburbs. Anyone who can estimate the overall caloric intake deserves the Nobel Prize. A Midwestern Thanksgiving is a special thing, as so much of a hosts energy must be spent anticipating and accommodating a wide range of potentialities. Take the weather: My own lifetime has seen Thanksgiving Day range from 27 to 63 degrees Fahrenheit, a spread that allows for both slushy boots and sunburns. Yes, sunburnswere Irish, okay? Irish also means accommodating a crowd thats ranged from 25 to 40 guests (sometimes cousins bring dates; sometimes the babies are kept at home), a differential of three tables of diners. And on any given year, the crowds age range might span four generations and eight decades, meaning that both accessibility and entertainment become heightened components of the operation. Ive watched my mother every year as she performs this seamless calculus, and have absorbed what I hope is some secondhand prowess. Hosting a Midwestern gathering is a deeply gratifying exercise; you just have to think like a guest to do it right. As a gift to the most entertaining-averse among you, here are some prized learnings from my familys hearth and home to yours. 1. Establish a debooting zone You never want to tell guests exactly what to do, but a big rug on the front porch piled high with others snow-caked Uggs and Wellies might send the message that youre not too jazzed on all that sludge tracking through the house. Besides, who can get comfy while bound to wet, heavy footwear? Which brings us to the next tenet. 2. Enact a B.Y.O.S. policy Thats Bring Your Own Slippers. Not as an enforced rule or anything; just start the trend by showing up to family parties with cozy footwear in tow. Its both a courtesy and a compliment: You keep the hosts floors slush-free and show them just how comfortable youre made by their hospitality. The trend will gain traction among your cousins, and youll be in fuzzy slippers all night. Everyone wins! 3. Get creative with the overflow seating Piano benches and ottomans not only fulfill their duty as extra chairs, but also seem to delight the younger kids, who will all scramble to fill those seats first. Maybe forking up mashed potatoes from these tiny, upholstered pouf-thrones provides a transgressive thrill. 4. Deploy every possible tactic for keeping guests out of the kitchen Coolers full of beer, water, and soda: back porch. Wine, glassware, and corkscrews: on the sideboard. Appetizers: living room. Coats: on the bed in the guest bedroom. Trash/recycling: next to the sideboard, or in the hallway, or in the laundry room, or out back. Brought a dish of your own? The hostess will take that to the fridge for you; you just worry about getting yourself some chicken dip, which is far away, in the living room! Guests seem preternaturally attracted to the kitchen, and tend to drift toward it until the room is so packed that new arrivals must fold into the paper-thin crevices of free space that remain. Its both a nuisance and a fire-code violation, and if left unchecked, these crowds will cause the kitchen to swell and burst into a shower of splintered wood, smashed brick, and stainless steel shrapnel. If you want Thanksgiving dinner to materialize, you need room to open your oven, and so youve got to keep everyone out of the kitchen by supplying almost no incentive to head there. (Almost, because of course theyre going to want to say hello to the head chef.) 5. Embrace culinary cacophony Theres a debate that rages in the far corners of foodie internet: Should dinner party guests be invited to contribute dishes of their own, or will this disrupt the harmonious composition of the meal the host has planned? I bite my thumb at the latter camp, at least when it comes to Thanksgiving dinner. Its a time for belly-bursting comforts, not culinary mastery. Theres going to be an excess of everything: salty sides, starchy mains, sickly-sweet salads made primarily of marshmallow. The desserts will be disproportionately chocolate, and beverage offerings include beer, wine, and Baileys. Thanksgiving is a day for family (whomever we embrace as such), and theres nothing you wouldnt do for familyeven if that means forgoing an interesting new recipe because you know it wont play as well as the cranberry sauce youve made every year since 1982. 6. Also enact a B.Y.O.T. policy Bring Your Own Tupperware. In the interest of letting not one spoonful go to waste, guests should feel free to arrive armed with plastic tubs aplenty to fill up with their favorites as they head out the door. Alternatively, a host can take this opportunity to get rid of the many reusable Thai containers that have accumulated in their cabinets over the past year. 7. Then do it all over again My moms little stroke of genius, the Black Friday meal invites family and friends to head over after any potential shopping sprees for a lazy, casual afternoon complete with platters of reheated leftovers and as-yet-unsliced desserts. Because no holiday ought to last a single measly day. There are many more tricks up this Midwestern sleeve: serving hot appetizers in one of these, placing a dining table directly in front of the couch so diehards neednt pull themselves away from football, and so on. But the only indispensable advice is this: Make Thanksgiving what you want it to be. Cling to the traditions that delight you, and not a single one that doesnt. Define family and dinner table and saying grace and side salad however loosely befits your holiday. I promise your guests wont leave feeling burned by the discord of multiple cheesy-potato sides. They likely love you too much to scrutinize, and theyll drift off into a pleasant, starchy slumber as soon as they cross their own thresholds. Cheers to a party well thrown.","I’ve watched my mother host 29 Thanksgivings.

Aimée Lutkin,"Today, March 20, is the spring equinox. In the northern hemisphere, days will start getting longer, nights shorter, and warmth will flood the land. To celebrate this shift, go outside tonight and check out the supermoon, which will coincidentally be lighting up the sky.
Its a rare occurrence for a spring equinox to correspond with a supermoon; according to National Geographic, it hasnt happened since 2000 and wont again until 2030. Supermoons themselves arent so rare; there have already been two this year. Space.com explains that the supermoon is an optical illusion created by the moons orbit around Earth, which is more oval than circular:
A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with the moons perigee, or the point in its elliptical orbit at which it is closest to Earth. This makes the moon appear up to 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter than usual.
However, this is the last supermoon of 2019; its also special because its a worm moon. NBC News reports that this moniker comes from an old folklore story that a full moon during this time corresponds to the ground meltingand all the earthworms start moving around again. The Farmers Almanac shared this story about the name:
As the temperature begins to warm and the ground begins to thaw, earthworm casts appear, heralding the return of the robins. For this reason, the March full moon is often known as the Full Worm Moon.
You can look up the time that the moon will be rising in your area on Time and Date, and with clear skies, you should be able to bathe in the glow of a new season.

JONAH ENGEL BROMWICH,"Photo Kevin Davis, left, and Mayor Catherine Pugh last year. Credit Patrick Semansky/Associated Press The mayor of Baltimore abruptly announced on Friday that she had relieved the city’s police commissioner of duty after a year of unprecedented violence in the city. Mayor Catherine Pugh said that Darryl D. De Sousa, a 30-year veteran of the department who was most recently a deputy police commissioner, would replace Kevin Davis, who became commissioner in 2015. Mr. De Sousa will be Baltimore’s ninth police commissioner since 1994. Baltimore experienced a record murder rate last year and had by far the highest rate of the largest 30 cities in the United States. There have been more than 300 homicides in the city in each of the past three years, including 343 recorded in 2017. By comparison, New York, which has a population more than 10 times that of Baltimore, experienced only 286 murders last year. “The fact is, we are not achieving the pace of progress that our residents have every right to expect,” she said in a statement.

GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO,"Photo Stephen Colbert compared President Trump to a fire chief who “keeps tweeting, ‘Fake news. We don’t know that that’s a fire.

Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, Mike Rogers, the head of the N.S.A., said he was still waiting for the president to give him the authority to look into Russian interference more deeply. Colbert took Trump to task, making a reference to his tweetstorm earlier that day, in which the president called the continuing Russia investigation a “witch hunt.” “The president has not told the National Security Agency to secure the nation against Russian hacking that we know is still happening. It’s like if your house is on fire, and the firemen are all there, and they agree that the flames are presently consuming your center hall colonial, but the fire chief keeps tweeting, ‘Fake news. We don’t know that that’s a fire. Could be a very shiny flood. Point is, there’s no proof of combustion. Witch hunt!’” — STEPHEN COLBERT Video by The Late Show With Stephen Colbert “There’s no doubt in any of the intelligence agencies that Russia did everything it could to influence the 2016 election — from effective methods, like Facebook ads and Twitter bots, to total dead ends, like Don Jr.” — STEPHEN COLBERT Trump 2020 Trump's Running for Re-Election, Live-Action Dora the Explorer - Monologue Video by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Jimmy Fallon responded sarcastically to the news that Trump is already planning for 2020. “President Trump is expected to announce that he’s running for re-election in 2020.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Twitter/RealAlexJones The US did not descend into a second civil war on 4 July. Why is this news? Because right-wing US broadcaster and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones told his 830,000 Twitter followers to expect exactly that, with a dire warning issued three days before: ""BREAKING: Democrats Plan To Launch Civil War On July 4th"". According to Jones, anti-Republican elements were massing to overthrow President Trump on Independence Day. The Democratic Party did not comment, but on Twitter Jones' claim inspired an explosion of parody letters from the front, using the hashtag #SecondCivilWarLetters. ""My Dear John,"" began Twitter user Amanda Blount, ""the war isn't going as planned. Our supply trucks are limited. I'm out of wine and sunscreen.

While many tweets preserved the brave-but-dolorous tone of real letters from America's civil war, others imagined a better fate for the Democrats. ""General Rodham, we have gained on the enemy by building a wall of your emails, which they can't get over,"" crowed @LHannich, in a nod to the Clinton email saga. For @TruthArrmy, toilets were the way to break the enemy's spirits. ""What time's the war?"" enquired US model and regular Trump baiter Chrissy Teigen, keen to avoid a scheduling conflict. Col Morris Davis, a former chief prosecutor at Guantanamo Bay, issued a plea for supplies, writing: ""Dear Alexa, we are pinned down and in urgent need of ammunition. Please send ASAP... but only if it qualifies for Amazon Prime's free shipping."" By the evening of 4 July, rumours of an end were nigh. ""Some people are saying that the war is over. Can this be true?"" enquired @KuiperBelle. ""Those of us in Texas remain sceptical, recalling the end of the first war, when the declaration of surrender got lost in the spam filter for two years.""

Authorities warn that Cyclone Owen could still reform offshore on Monday. Severe weather and flood warnings are in place. Owen hit land as a category 3 cyclone at around 03:00 on Saturday (17:00 Friday GMT), 70km (43 miles) from Kowanyama. ""We were right in the bullseye but then it dipped and went south,"" the town's Mayor Michael Yam said. ""There's no structural damage, a little debris, we're all good and in one piece.""

JESSE GREEN,"But Ms. Orlandersmith digs deep enough into each character, and with such decency, that no segment seems obligatory. Even the worst human among them — a vile racist (and homophobe) called Dougray — is allowed his back story, which helps explain, if in no way excuse, him. Photo Among the characters portrayed by Ms. Orlandersmith is Dougray, a racist who fantasizes about gunning down Ferguson’s black men. Credit Sara Krulwich/The New York Times Still, Dougray, who fantasizes about lining up Ferguson’s black males and gunning them down in order to make the town “clean/white/purified/like it must have been once,” threw me out of the play for a moment. Ms. Orlandersmith is so skilled at disappearing into her characters that I had forgotten until then what her process involved. Theoretically, this was a man she had interviewed, stood near, faced. The psychological violence of that encounter seemed almost like a replay of the literal violence it was meant to investigate. Later, I learned that many of the characters Ms. Orlandersmith portrays are fictional composites. I’m not sure whether that makes Dougray more bearable, or less: The idea that there are many Dougrays available for compositing seems terrible, if all too believable. Still, I think that if the play informed audiences about Ms. Orlandersmith’s methods, it might help them better understand her aims. Some of her earlier works, like the autobiographical “Forever,” are clearly factual, however poetically the facts are rendered. Others, like the Pulitzer Prize finalist “Yellowman,” are clearly fiction. Or perhaps “Until the Flood” is more effective for leaving you uncertain about which genre it falls into. The production, directed by Neel Keller, carefully splits the difference between documentary objectivity and poetic license. On a set (by Takeshi Kata) replicating the impromptu memorial of candles and stuffed animals that lined Canfield Avenue in the weeks after Mr. Brown’s death, Ms. Orlandersmith moves from character to character with minimal fuss, adding or subtracting a simple costume piece (by Kaye Voyce) but otherwise not attempting anything but verbal verisimilitude. Moody projections (by Nicholas Hussong) establish the locations, just as the lovely interstitial music by Justin Ellington establishes the elegiac tone. Despite this evenhanded treatment, I found myself crediting the black characters more than the white ones. No doubt this was in part because white racism, however outright or covert, is a familiar gargoyle, stuck with its one leer. Ms. Orlandersmith’s black characters are much more nuanced, and able to explore themes that, coming from whites, would seem taboo. One of those is raised right from the start by a black retired schoolteacher named Louisa Hemphill. Acknowledging the damage done by racism — she grew up heeding signs that said “Don’t let the sun go down on you in this town” if you’re black — she nevertheless concludes that Mr. Brown was not only set up to be a victim but also “set himself up.” Several other characters echo this thought. Hassan, describing the routine threat of death from police violence, says there is a part of him that “wants to stand before a gun” knowing that the “redneck” holding it “would aim to shoot and not miss.” And when Paul, a 17-year-old who lives, as Mr. Brown did, in the “defeated” Canfield Green apartments, cries, “Please God let me get out,” he means get out alive. Those are two of the saddest lines you are likely to hear from a stage today, and therefore two of the most important. Composite or not, they ring damningly true.

DAVID W. CHEN,"One area that would be most affected is the largely working-class neighborhood of Canarsie, in Brooklyn along the coast of Jamaica Bay. When the original maps are compared with FEMA’s 2013 proposal, the difference for the area is stark: Just 26 buildings were in the 1983 FEMA flood zone; under the revised maps, that would have skyrocketed to 5,000 buildings. Canarsie, which is home to many Caribbean immigrants, has a higher percentage of owner-occupied homes with mortgages than the city as a whole. But in a neighborhood that weathered the city’s highest foreclosure rate after the subprime mortgage crisis, homeowners, many of whom rent out their basements to help pay the bills, have “little to put toward mitigating their flood risk,” according to a city report released in May. Even though the final flood maps are years away, city officials and community groups are exhorting residents to take advantage of low-cost or even free programs funded by the state Governor’s Office of Storm Recovery. By buying flood insurance now, officials say, policy holders would be grandfathered in and subject to only gradual increases once new maps are established. With such coverage, premiums would probably be around $500 a year; without it, the annual rates could be $3,000. But even $500 a year can be a hard sell in Canarsie, as made clear by a recent tour with Zachary Paganini, a doctoral student at the City University of New York, who has been researching what the looming changes to flood insurance might mean for the neighborhood. On Flatlands Eighth Street, adjacent to Fresh Creek, Nelson Lopez, who does not have flood insurance, noted that his entire block was decimated by Hurricane Sandy, even though the houses were outside FEMA’s flood zones. If the revisions were made permanent, his house would go from a no-risk area to a high-risk zone. “If you get flood insurance, you can’t pay your other bills,” he said. Canarsie, built on reclaimed marshes, is at the center of New York’s battle with the rising ocean. 1 Before Hurricane Sandy, the official floodplain made it seem like Canarsie was safe.

About two feet of water rushed into her basement during Hurricane Sandy. After seeking advice from the Center for New York City Neighborhoods, a nonprofit group that created a flood mapping tool, she purchased flood insurance to qualify for FEMA disaster funds. But Ms. Fraser, a day-care teacher, dropped it after a year because she could not afford the $600 annual premium. “I definitely don’t want to be in a high-risk zone, but I don’t want to move,” said Ms. Fraser, a Guyanese immigrant who moved into her house 20 years ago. “You can’t always run from one place to the next because you’re worried things will happen.” One clue to the possible contours of any future maps may be found in a single column buried in the city’s 2015 appeal. The city estimated that if the scientific errors were removed from FEMA’s revision, the number of people in the flood zone could increase by 6 percent to 230,000 over the 1983 maps, and the number of one- to four-family buildings could grow by 38 percent to 36,000. Both increases would be much smaller than the 100 percent jumps suggested by FEMA’s initial maps.

ELIZABETH A. HARRIS and KATE TAYLOR,"Not all the schools being closed are in Renewal. Among the schools slated for closure is the Urban Assembly School for Wildlife Conservation in the Bronx, where this fall a high school student who said he felt bullied stabbed two other students, killing one of them. A student in the middle school said he tried to hang himself in February because he had been so tormented by his peers. The 21 schools that will begin their transition out of the Renewal program will be called “Rise” schools. The Education Department said these schools each met at least 67 percent of the goals set for their improvements, and as a group, saw growth in measures like graduation rates, attendance and college readiness. Among those schools are the Renaissance School of the Arts in Manhattan and John Adams High School in Queens. Graduating schools will remain in the city’s Community Schools program, which creates partnerships with social service organizations to help with things like the attendance and supporting the social and emotional needs of students. Aaron Pallas, the chairman of the department of education policy at Columbia University’s Teachers College, said that many Renewal School principals have been ambivalent about the program. They’ve been happy to have the extra resources that come with it, but the label has been somewhat stigmatizing. So what will those schools look like when the extra money goes away? “That is an interesting longer term question about sustainability,” Mr. Pallas said. “To what extent does this program really hinge on the influx of dollars, and if those dollars are removed, what is going to happen?” Agustin Armendariz contributed research.

"JOHN SCHWARTZ, JAMES GLANZ and ANDREW W. LEHREN","Shifting Terrain As early as 2006, The Woodlands filed a plan for a new subdivision on thousands of acres containing “wooded areas and a few rural home sites,” according to documents obtained from Harris County. But it was not until the years leading up to 2011, when the Hughes Corporation put together the final pieces of its purchase of The Woodlands, that the housing market caught up with the plan. Houston shook off the wreckage of the subprime mortgage crisis and encountered a very different problem: a shortage of housing on the high end of the market. Touching off the surge in demand was an announcement by Exxon that it was opening a new corporate campus in nearby Spring. Exxon was far from alone, as a growing list of companies relocated to the area. So did tens of thousands of workers, drawn by the boom in fracking technologies that none other than Mr. Mitchell and colleagues had coaxed, tweaked and perfected over nearly 20 years. That influx would have all but saturated the existing home market, said Bill Gilmer, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. It drove a spike in land prices, allowing developers to consider new construction on relatively low-cost lots that previously would have been too costly to improve. “This would just give you the opportunity to make those extensive improvements and still come out ahead,” Mr. Gilmer said. FEMA maps of The Woodlands showed a tantalizing stretch of undeveloped land hard by a waterway called Spring Creek — including acreage in the 2006 plan. Building right along the creek would have been out of the question, but farther south, portions of the land were slightly above the 100-year flood plain, according to the maps. Those who knew the land and its history saw warning signs. Nick Rife, whose family owned land in the area, said he used to hunt there “when it wasn’t flooded.” By bringing in thousands of dump truck loads of dirt, it would be possible to expand the acreage above the flood plain, making the whole area suitable for construction. That is exactly what The Woodlands decided to do, documents show. The former edges of the flood plain run through what are now the lots of Ms. Martinez and Mr. Hickey, the longtime Woodlands resident who once worked for Mr. Mitchell and had built a new home in the neighborhood. On the strip of land containing Wood Drake Place — Ms. Martinez’s street — 60,907 cubic yards of dirt were laid down. FEMA approved a map change for that area on Feb. 8, 2011, documents show. The large extrusion of development around Lake Reverie Place — Mr. Hickey’s street — and the nearby Sundown Ridge Place got 19,890 cubic yards of dirt. On June 13, 2013, FEMA approved a map change for what would become lots for the 81 homes in those areas. The result: neighborhoods that seemed safe from flooding. When Esteban and Paola Seañez moved into their home next to Spring Creek in 2015, their mortgage company assured them that the plot was high and dry. When the couple asked about flood insurance, “They said, ‘You don’t even have to purchase it,’” Ms. Seañez recalled. Photo The view outside Ms. Martinez’s second-floor window this week. Credit Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times Last year, after water came within several feet of their door, Mr. Hickey’s neighbors James and Gayle Soeder inquired about flood insurance. Initially, the agent warned that the policy would be very expensive; the house was in a flood plain, she said. Mr. Soeder, who knew he had bought a home at the 500-year elevation, asked her to check again. “We see that the flood plain was revised recently,” the agent said. So, for a bargain rate of $450 per year, the Soeders became one of the families in the neighborhood to be covered by insurance when Harvey struck. A number of residents asked whether managers of The Woodlands since Mr. Mitchell had been as careful as its predecessors in designing the newer developments, and pointed to what they called more aggressive policies since the Howard Hughes Corporation — a brand revived in 2010 by the activist investor Bill Ackman — took over. Mr. Hickey dug into damage statistics and found that his recently constructed neighborhood flooded at far higher rates than others in The Woodlands. In older parts of the community, his research revealed, about 215 out of 33,000 homes flooded during Harvey, or less than 1 percent — a far smaller percentage than many other communities in the greater Houston area. Yet among homes built in more recent years in Harris County, 331 out of 4,993 flooded, or more than 6 percent. In the newest areas of that Harris County expansion, including those where the Soeder, the Hickey and the Seañez families live, 331 out of 1,450 homes were affected — a whopping 23 percent. Mr. Hickey questioned whether adequate measures had been taken in the fill project to provide water storage and drainage in big storms. Marc Crudgington, who bought his home the year after Ms. Martinez and her husband did, voiced similar concerns. “They’ve filled in lakes that have been around forever just so they can build on them, and clear-cut trees like nobody’s business,” he said. “Our name for it is not The Woodlands, it’s Concrete Land.” The company stated that “the senior development team is ‘essentially the same team’ that has worked on The Woodlands for 25 years.” Tim Welbes, co-president of The Woodlands Development Company, said the company had complied with FEMA standards for its homes, but that the neighborhood had been overwhelmed by the storm’s waters. “We met the standard,” he said. “This event exceeded the standard.” Still, at a recent meeting of The Woodlands Storm Drainage Task Force, residents expressed anger at local officials over the damage to homes from Hurricane Harvey — and, for many of them, from earlier floods. This task force was actually formed last year in response to previous flooding, and little had been done to improve the situation before Harvey.

Eric Niiler,"The record-setting floods deluging the Midwest are about to get a lot worse. Fueled by rapidly melting snowpack and a forecast of more rainstorms in the next few weeks, federal officials warn that 200 million people in 25 states face a risk through May. Floodwaters coursing through Nebraska have already forced tens of thousands of people to flee and have caused $1.3 billion in damage.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its spring flood outlook Thursday, predicting that two-thirds of the country is at risk of ""major to moderate flooding,"" from Fargo, North Dakota on the Red River of the North down to Nashville, Tennessee, on the Cumberland River. The floods from the past two weeks have compromised 200 miles of levees in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers.
The rains and floods are expected to continue through May and become more dire, according to Ed Clark, director of NOAAs National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, Clark said, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities.
A combination of heavy snowfall in late February, tropical rains and wet snow from the bomb cyclone that swept across the country a week ago and frozen or saturated ground surfaces have set the stage for the floods. Ice jams on top of frozen waterways are adding to the problem by diverting floodwaters out of river channels and sending them onto land. Its not looking like we are going to see any dry stretches anytime soon, says Thomas Graziano, director of the water prediction center at the National Weather Service.
Officials say the entire Mississippi River basin has received 3 times as much rainfall as in a normal year.
And it's not done falling yet. More rainstorms are expected to hit the Midwest over the next eight to 10 days. That precipitation will be like water running over concrete, Graziano says. Graziano says he expects this years flood levels to top the disastrous floods that hit the Missouri River in May 2011 and the Red River in North Dakota and Minnesota in 2009.
This winters big snowpack is fueling the floods. In the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota, more than 20 inches of snow remains on the ground. The Missouri, Ohio and Mississippi Rivers drain the central United States, but it takes several weeks for the water to travel downstream. In the meantime, emergency officials are warning local residents to make an evacuation plan as well as purchase flood insurance in certain areas.
Climate scientists say it's too early to tell exactly to what degree human-induced climate change has affected this spring flood cycle, but they note that the watery disaster is following a pattern of extreme weather events across the United States. There's about 10 percent more moisture available in the environment as a result of global climate change, says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.
Under the right conditions, that extra moisture can be amplified into 30 percent more rainfall during an extreme weather event such as a hurricane, bomb cyclone or the series of storms that has hit the Midwest, Trenberth explains.
""The extra fuel from global warming is what keeps [a storm] going,"" he says. ""And it's what turns it from a billion-dollar disaster to a $10 to $50 billion disaster.""

Adam Rogers,"You can see it on satellite imagery—a chaotic blur of wind and water shaped like a giant alien starfish over Australia, extending a tentacle diagonally across the Pacific and right into the Golden Gate. It’s called an atmospheric river, over a thousand miles of water and wind. This weekend is going to be as wet as an entire typical April. On the official scale, the storm will probably top out at “strong”—it might have enough water vapor transport to rate as “extreme,” but probably won’t reach “exceptional,” the real freak-out level of flood danger. That means several inches of rain. This is how California gets most of its disastrous floods, but also most of its drinking water. It’s a crazy way to do business, but understanding these atmospheric rivers might be the key to making sure the human race doesn’t die of thirst. Atmospheric rivers come ashore on nearly every west-facing coastline on Earth. A few times a year one of them does what this weekend’s storm will do: shotguns over Hawaii and into Northern California. “It tails all the way back into the tropics, almost to the date line,” says Michael Anderson, the California State climatologist. “It’s going to come through pretty quick.” Onshore, the fast, wet air from one of these so-called Pineapple Expresses ricochets upward off the coastal mountain ranges like a tennis ball catching the top of the net. The air rises; the water falls. That’s called “orographic enhancement,” and it’s how you get massive bursts of rain and floods. Somewhere between 30 and 60 percent of California’s entire water supply comes from atmospheric river storms. And they are intense. In one study of six years of California rainfall, monitored hour-by-hour, just 1,460 hours qualified as atmospheric river storms. But that scant 2.8 percent of time accounted for over 50 percent of the rainfall the researchers measured. California hoards more than half of that rain as snowfall on the tops of the Sierras. The rest it tries to save in reservoirs—a dozen big ones and about 150 littler ones scattered up and down the state. In the rainy winter months, the reservoirs fill up—ideally—leaving space for the snowmelt to come in the summer. Ideally. During the winter, all the reservoirs stay empty enough to absorb flood waves from storms. “But on April 1, that reserve space starts being relaxed so they can capture snowmelt,” Anderson says. “With a storm this time of year, you still have that flood reserve space, so there’s room for the reservoirs to catch that water. The question will be, as that reserve space is being relaxed, can that water be kept for the conservation pool?” It’s a balance—hold onto water for a rain-free summer and possible drought, be ready to capture snowmelt, but leave enough room to store a flood wave during the storm season. Every reservoir has a rule curve that says how much water is too much. But atmospheric rivers can make it tough to know when to apply those rules. In November and December of 2012, the Lake Mendocino Reservoir absorbed water from two atmospheric river events, enough so that the water encroached into the “flood pool,” which is supposed to stay empty for emergencies. “So the reservoir operators released the water. It was the prudent thing to do,” says F. Martin Ralph, a research meteorologist at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “But nobody knew that there would be no more atmospheric rivers basically for the rest of the year, and that was the beginning of the drought. They never had a chance to refill the reservoir in the spring.” So Ralph, along with the Sonoma County Water Agency (which regulates the drinking water in Lake Mendocino), the US Army Corps of Engineers (which operates the flood prevention aspects of the reservoir), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (which monitors the salmon fishery that’s part of the lake’s hydrology) are all working on a finer-grained system. “It’s possible that with modern weather prediction we can see with some certainty these atmospheric rivers coming a few days ahead, so hypothetically one could consider keeping some of that extra water temporarily, and every day looking at the forecast to see if there’s an atmospheric river,” Ralph says. “If there’s not, the chance of there being a flood problem is essentially zero.” The idea’s still in a planning stage; Ralph’s group is now trying these “forecast-informed reservoir operations” at Mendocino and Prado in southern California. (It's still status quo ante at other reservoirs, like Like Oroville—where the people in charge will be trying out their new spillway, rebuilt since the old one crumbled during last year's rains. But if the new approach works—and so far it seems like it may—reservoirs can keep the water for a not-rainy day. That day may be coming. Or it might not. Water in the American west was variable and unpredictable even before humans started pumping enough carbon into the atmosphere that it’d change the climate. A warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor. That by itself would strengthen atmospheric rivers. But a warmer atmosphere means warmer poles, which reduces the temperature difference between the middle of the planet and the ends. That means weaker winds and weaker ARs. “However, there’s a big asterisk on that. It’s inevitable that some storms will be just as strong in terms of wind as they are today, and they will have available to them more water vapor,” Ralph says. “There could be a class of atmospheric river storms that are a lot stronger than we’ve seen in the past.” Ralph’s ideas for managing reservoirs better might end up being a necessary adaptation to a changed climate —and not just in California. The northwestern US gets a quarter to a third of its annual rainfall from atmospheric rivers, and they cause floods there, too. Arizona’s and Idaho’s big winter floods are often due to atmospheric rivers; a few years ago one even caused major flooding in Nashville. They are the drivers of flood and drought around the world. So understanding those ocean-spanning tendrils on satellite maps may be the solution to what’s arguably going to be humanity’s most pressing problem: figuring out what to do when the rains come, and when they don’t.",An atmospheric river means this weekend is going to be as wet as an entire typical April.,2018-04-06T17:30:46Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",An Atmospheric River Will Hit California With a Month's Worth of Rain,https://www.wired.com/story/a-months-worth-of-rain-will-hit-california-this-weekend/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5ac6bb0b19970475a8fa4ab4/191:100/pass/sfrain_623351114208.jpg,wired,Wired,flood,0
Taylor Hatmaker,"Today in a press conference, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman elaborated on his office’s efforts to investigate the FCC’s flood of fake anti-net neutrality comments while calling for a delay of the agency’s vital net neutrality vote until the source of the fraudulent comments is identified. Schneiderman joined a group of 27 senators who are also calling for a delay on the December 14 vote that is widely expected to repeal Obama-era net neutrality rules. Schneiderman was joined on stage by democratic FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, an Obama-era appointee who was reappointed by the Trump administration. “[It is] incumbent upon the FCC and all of my colleagues to stand back, figure out what’s in this record before us and get to the bottom of these stolen identities,” said Rosenworcel. Schneiderman added that the feedback system was “corrupted” — a fact that he accuses the FCC of being well aware of. According to Schneiderman, the net neutrality feedback process generated more than 23 million total comments, marking an unprecedented level of participation. His office suspects that as many as a million of those comments are linked to stolen identities, including a 13 year old who never submitted a comment, a recently deceased woman and the office of the Attorney General’s own assistant press secretary. He called on government officials in other states that with residents that appear to have “likely victims” to get involved, including California, Missouri, Texas, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Schneiderman cited reports that that half a million of the comments appear to have been filed from Russian email addresses, a fact that net neutrality advocates likely hope will stoke further public interest in the often dry proceedings of the communications regulatory body. Further, Schneiderman notes that 50,000 consumer complaints are missing from the FCC record. The New York Attorney General’s office has been working on getting to the bottom of the fake FCC net neutrality comment controversy for months. Last month, Schneiderman criticized the FCC for its failure to cooperate in his office’s ongoing investigation into the fake comments, which it began in June, making repeated contacts to the FCC over the subsequent five months. Last week, Schneiderman set up a website that allows New Yorkers to report if their name and identifying info was misused to make a fraudulent net neutrality feedback comment appear legitimate. Last month, a dataset analyzing the FCC’s net neutrality comments between April and October of this year revealed that over a million anti-net neutrality comments that flooded the FCC’s system appear to have been sown by spambots, while as many as 99% of the legitimate comments were voicing their support of net neutrality. “There’s no way with this set of corrupted records…[we can] have a vote based on what the American people really think,” Schneiderman said.

MAGGIE HABERMAN and MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT,"Photo Emmet T. Flood, left, in 2007, when he was the White House special counsel under George W. Bush. Credit Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images President Trump is in discussions with a veteran Washington lawyer who represented Bill Clinton during the impeachment process about joining the White House to help deal with the special counsel inquiry, according to four people familiar with the matter. The lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office this past week to discuss the possibility, according to the people. No final decision has been made, according to two of the people. Should Mr. Flood come on board, the two people said, his main duties would be a day-to-day role helping the president navigate his dealings with the Justice Department. Two people close to the president said that the overture to Mr. Flood did not indicate any new concerns about the inquiry. Still, it appears, at the least, to be an acknowledgment that the investigation is unlikely to end anytime soon. Mr. Flood would not replace Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer who since last summer has taken the lead role in dealing with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. But Mr. Cobb has told friends for weeks that he views his position as temporary and does not expect to remain in the job for much longer. Mr. Cobb’s primary task — producing documents for Mr. Mueller and arranging for White House aides to meet with prosecutors — is largely complete. Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers have been handling negotiations with Mr. Mueller over the terms of a presidential interview.

MARY WILLIAMS WALSH,"Yet inland flooding is in some ways more perilous. A study by the National Hurricane Center found that more than half the Americans killed by flooding during hurricanes and tropical storms over a 30-year period had died after the storms moved inland, presenting hazards like flash floods and mudslides and sweeping motorists off flooded roads. And it’s many of the people affected by those hazards who don’t have flood insurance. People near the coasts tend to know their risks. Owners of expensive beach houses often buy even more flood insurance than they have to, because the government’s mandatory coverage is capped at $250,000 per house plus $100,000 for the contents. On top of that, additional “layers” of coverage can be purchased from private insurers. In the Carolinas, a quarter to half of the households near the coast are insured, said Ray Lehmann, a member of SmarterSafer, a coalition of taxpayer groups, environmental organizations, insurers and others that has pushed for flood-insurance reform. Further inland, it’s another story. “We’re talking about places in North Carolina where the coverage is less than 1 percent,” said Mr. Lehmann, also the director of finance, insurance and trade policy at the R Street Institute, a think tank that promotes free-market policies.","Flood waters inundated Lumberton, N.C., on Tuesday following Hurricane Florence.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,"The aid group said it had seen hundreds of cases of acute watery diarrhea in the past few days, though the germs responsible often were not known.
The scale of extreme damage will likely lead to a dramatic increase of waterborne diseases, skin infections, respiratory tract infections and malaria in the coming days and weeks, said Gert Verdonck, the groups emergency coordinator in Beira.
Hurried efforts were underway to restore running water to Beira. The United Nations childrens agency said parts of the citys water supply system were working again, with water running in 60 percent of the pipes. The government also was operating water trucks.
With roads submerged or damaged, Beira remains accessibly primarily by air and sea, and relief agencies continued on Wednesday to explore ways to deliver more aid to the city. Even more challenging was reaching rural communities, some of them still without contact with the outside world.
More humanitarian groups arrived as the United Nations urged the international community to fund a $282 million emergency appeal for the next three months.
The United Nations refugee agency announced that its first aid flight had landed in the capital, Maputo, with plans to take tents, mosquito nets and other items to Beira. Two other flights are planned for Zimbabwe and Malawi this week.","With vast areas submerged by contaminated water, officials warned that more cases of potentially lethal, waterborne diseases should be expected.",2019-03-27T15:49:20Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Cholera Outbreak Raises New Danger in Flood-Ravaged Mozambique,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/world/africa/cholera-mozambique-cyclone-idai.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/27/world/27cyclone/merlin_152643936_f8dc177d-3199-4c4d-94e1-89ba481b6114-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,flood,0
CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM,"Finding settings that amplify an operas drama has long been Mr. Einhorns mission. Since 2012, On Site Opera, which he helped found, has put on productions in unusual spaces, including the Bronx Zoo (Shostakovichs The Tale of the Silly Baby Mouse), a church crypt (Gregg Kallors The Tell-Tale Heart) and Madame Tussauds (Rameaus Pygmalion). But in telling the story of the crippled shepherd boy Amahl and his life-changing encounter with the three kings drawn by the star of Bethlehem, Mr. Einhorn decided to find not only the right place, but also the right people. Speaking of the backgrounds of his amateur choristers, who will share the stage with professional musicians, Mr. Einhorn said he had taken care to be sensitive to who these people are and never to go into an exploitative territory in how we talk about them, or how we fold their experiences into the production itself.

Aimée Lutkin,"Storms can destroy your home and level your neighborhood, but even after they pass, flooding presents unique dangers you might not be aware of. Even walking through water, it turns out, can kill you. It’s grim to think about, but on the other hand, a little preparedness might save your life. On subreddit LifeProTips, user u /daynanfighter explained why it’s best to use a little boat to get from place to place, even if it seems like the flooding is walkable: For those in flooded areas, use extreme caution when walking on streets and sidewalks. Manhole covers are often forced off by the flood and can be extremely dangerous as people can fall in, get trapped, and drown. I’m from New Orleans where flooding is common. Rising water in sewers offen moves manhole covers(openings to the sewer) creating a very dangerous situation especially when water is being pumped through the sewers (as in during a flood). It creates underground rivers and people fall in and drown. Use a boat whenever possible while crossing flooded urban areas and use extreme caution when walking. They also recommended bring not only food and water, but an axe if you’re fleeing to the top level of your home—if the flooding is bad enough you could drown in your attic with no way to escape. If you don’t think you could hack through your own roof, consider the potential that the water might get higher before going to an upper story. In the comments, people shared other hidden dangers to be aware of when traversing a flooded neighborhood, including snakes. User u/ how-about-no-bitch gave a very in-depth analysis of how dangerous waterlogged snakes actually are, and a reminder to be aware in general of wildlife. They say snakes are for the most part trying to escape as well, so just stay out of their way. Here’s how: Just be aware of your surroundings and watch where you put your fingers and opening doors. Be careful around thick brush or low hanging branches. This is relevant to any flooding. You are going to see a whole lot of animals you didn’t realize were nearby. Also. For fucks sake watch out for fire ant floating islands. They will be more likely to fuck up your day more than most other animals. Other important mentions: the flood is almost certainly not composed of fresh running rainwater. It’s a mix of water and sewage, which means you could easily make yourself very ill while wading in it. Also, keep in mind downed power lines. Several people wrote they knew of folks who had been electrocuted while trying to escape their homes. Large bodies of water, even brand new ones created on your street, often have currents that could sweep you away. There will also be sudden rising waters at times, so what seemed traversable will be suddenly much less so. But, if you must walk through, use a probe ahead of you and cover up as much as possible to keep contaminated water out, according to u/ NoyzMaker : Don’t walk in flood waters at all unless you have boot or hip waders to keep all the water off your person. Most of that water is contaminated and a simple cut or scratch can easily get infected. Also always use a walking stick or other type of “probe” to test the stability of the space in front of you. Will keep you from getting stuck in sudden mud or open manhole covers like OP mentions since even something small like a water meter cover getting lifted can catch you off guard and twist your ankle. The general message: don’t walk around unless you absolutely have to.","Storms can destroy your home and level your neighborhood, but even after they pass, flooding presents unique dangers you might not be aware of.

SARAH MASLIN NIR,"Some transportation experts argue that even bolder action is necessary. To encourage car-pooling they have called for banning vehicles with fewer than three people from the Williamsburg Bridge for longer than just rush hours as the city envisions and extending the ban to other bridges. And 14th Street, they say, should be restricted primarily to buses 24 hours a day to make it easier on subway riders. “A lot of people don’t commute 9 to 5 hours,” said Kate Slevin, the vice president of state programs and advocacy at the Regional Plan Association, an urban research group. “A lot of people are traveling down 14th Street all times of the day. The worry here is you’re just going to have an inability to get around.” For now, the biggest worry on all sides is preparing for the unknown. “It might look all right on a computer simulation,” said City Councilwoman Margaret Chin, who represents Chinatown. “But in real life, I just can’t imagine it.” Photo During the shut down, 14th Street is expected to become the busiest bus route in the country, carrying as many as 84,000 riders a day. Credit Julia Gillard for The New York Times 14th Street: Nation’s Busiest Bus Route The nucleus of the city and the M.T.A.’s plan is 14th Street, which stretches from the East River to the Hudson River. During the morning and evening rush between Third Avenue and Ninth Avenue, it will be limited to buses with the exception of some vehicles like delivery trucks. The city has a goal of ensuring that buses can cross the bus corridor along 14th Street in 20 minutes, a speed rate of over 6.5 miles per hour and over 40 percent faster than buses there travel now. But some transit experts are dubious, believing that 14th Street “will saturate with buses,” said Annie Weinstock, the president of BRT International, a company that plans and designs bus rapid transit systems and that helped produce an alternate plan for 14th Street. “Buses will queue up behind one another and become a bus parking lot.” Ms. Trottenberg said the plan for 14th Street was flexible. “If we don’t get it right from the start we can adjust,’’ she said. Transit experts have pushed for buses to be free to speed loading and prevent gridlock. “The only way we are going to get near the capacity that the M.T.A. thinks will shift on to buses is if we do everything we can to get people onto those buses as fast as we can,” said Nick Sifuentes, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group. A spokesman for the M.T.A., Jon Weinstein, said the agency had not made any final decisions about fares. Businesses have already begun making plans for the shutdown, including shifting deliveries to overnight to avoid the crush, said Jennifer Falk, executive director of the Union Square Partnership, the business improvement district for the area. On the other hand, some retailers are looking forward to the flood of new commuters. “There are tens of thousands of people who will experience the ground floor retail on 14th Street who would never come above ground before,” Ms. Falk said.

RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.,"The amount the ground can soak up is limited, because it is so wet, but thats a lot better than having it frozen, because frozen ground is like a parking lot, Mr. Pearson added. Water just flows right off.
Over all, he said, the storm does not seem as powerful at this point as the March tempest, but it still has a lot of moisture and lot of potential to cause a lot of problems, he said. Its still going to pack a punch.
Forecasters say that for a storm to officially qualify as a bomb cyclone, the atmospheric pressure must drop at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, creating a particularly strong and rapidly intensifying storm. This one might not produce quite that steep a pressure drop, they say.
But temperatures are set to plunge quickly just the same, as a low-pressure system drawing in moisture to the Midwest is displaced by a high-pressure system full of colder air. Omaha, for example, is predicted to see its daytime high temperature fall from almost 80 degrees on Monday to about 40 degrees on Friday.
The bigger flood risk this time may center on the Mississippi River and its swollen tributaries rather than the Missouri River, where levels have been receding, said Jeff Berardelli, a meteorologist.
It will be a more prolific snow producer and a more blinding blizzard than the bomb cyclone was, Mr. Berardelli said of the new storm, partly because it may idle over much of the Midwest for a time.
Its likely going to slow down and stall, he said. Literally, the storm will barely move.
But like Mr. Pearson, Mr. Berardelli said that a higher proportion of snow than rain may be a good thing.
If it melts over a longer period of time, that would be better, he said. We dont want it all happening in a day or two.","Flooding in the town of Hamburg, Iowa, on March 20.

"MITCH SMITH, JOHN SCHWARTZ and TIM GRUBER","Many of the levees, usually earthen and topped with grass, were built by farmers decades ago and are now managed by a patchwork of local government agencies known as levee districts that often do not coordinate or even follow the same rules. With increased flooding in the past few years, the levees are being tested more frequently than ever before, straining the finances and expertise of some of those districts. The levee situation has become so grave that the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the countrys levee system a D grade in 2017, suggesting $80 billion in investment over 10 years.
When the next one comes along bigger, they either fail or are overtopped again, said Nicholas Pinter, an expert on rivers and flooding at the University of California, Davis.
According to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees infrastructure on the Missouri River and some of its tributaries, at least 62 levees had been breached or overtopped in the Midwest in March, and hundreds of miles of levees had sustained damage.
When they run water over the top of them, theres not anything you can do, said Pat Sheldon, the president of a rural levee district in southwest Iowa that was still paying off repairs from the 2011 flood. This time, Mr. Sheldon said, the damage to the levees was much worse, perhaps in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Its terrible, said Mr. Sheldon, whose farm was also cut off by the water.
In Missouri, Mr. Bullock pointed out a levee that last week had been split open and consumed by the river. A large log swirled in the water near where the earthen berm should have been. I dont know what were going to do this time, he said.
The Army Corps of Engineers, which helps determine water levels by operating a series of dams on the Missouri River, tries to balance the needs of many who use the rivers it manages, including farmers, barge shippers, endangered animal species and people who use the water for recreation. Those interests are sometimes at odds, and have been the subject of decades of litigation. Corps officials say they are not allowed to change the congressionally authorized purposes of the reservoirs, though they had been most focused on limiting floods for the past year.
The Corpss No. 1 priority in its operations is life safety, said Maj. Gen. Scott A. Spellmon, the Corpss deputy commanding general for civil and emergency operations, in a statement. Our current focus is to protect life, mitigate risks to flooding events and repair damages due to the recent events in the basin.","Hundreds of miles of levees in the Midwest have been overwhelmed by the floods, leaving “Swiss cheese” infrastructure and reigniting a flood control debate.",2019-03-31T09:00:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","‘Breaches Everywhere’: Midwest Levees Burst, and Tough Questions Follow",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/us/midwest-floods-levees.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/29/us/00levees-01/00levees-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,flood,0
Melanie Ehrenkranz,"As hundreds of millions of people flood social networks, tech companies are struggling to weed out harassment on their platformsand so theyre turning to machines for help. On Tuesday, Instagram announced it was doing just that. While the majority of photos shared on Instagram are positive and bring people joy, occasionally a photo is shared that is unkind or unwelcome, Instagrams new lead Adam Mosseri wrote in a blog post. We are now using machine learning technology to proactively detect bullying in photos and their captions and send them to our Community Operations team to review. Instagram allows users to report accounts that show the intent of bullying or harassment, which are against its Community Guidelines, though its unclear, as it stands, how effectively and quickly such accounts are penalized or shut down. Mosseri noted in Tuesdays blog post that many people who experience or observe bullying dont report it and that rolling out these machine-learning efforts alongside human ones will help the team identify and remove significantly more bullying. This new tech has already been deployed and will continue to roll out in the weeks ahead, according to the company. Instagram will also add its bullying comment filterwhich hides comments containing attacks on a persons appearance or character, as well as threats to a persons well being or health to all live videos. Its already available in Instagrams Feed, Explore, and Profile sections. The service also added a kindness camera effect to spread positivity. This is Mosseris first announcement for the photo-sharing service since its original founders contentiously departed last month. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, has hardly earned its parent companys reputation for serving as a catalyst for psychological devastation, violence, and the destruction of democracy, but it still has its issues, with bullying at the top of that list. Research from anti-bullying non-profit Ditch the Label last year found that, of 10,000 respondents aged 12 to 20, 7 percent said they had been bullied on Instagram. It ranked as the number one social network for cyberbullyingslightly higher than Facebook itself. While leaning on algorithms for help with issues at such a large scale isnt inherently a bad thing, its also far from a sweeping solution. Algorithms arent free from bias and they currently lack the ability to understand the nuance and context of human language. Theyve screwed up in the past, and they have yet to prove theyre equipped to flawlessly tackle an issue as expansive, complex, and sensitive as cyberbullying.","As hundreds of millions of people flood social networks, tech companies are struggling to weed out harassment on their platforms—and so they’re turning to machines for help.

Mary Beth Griggs,"Conspiracy theories are dusted amid the violent videos, racist comments, and death threats that Facebook moderators face every day. That putrid flood of information can be traumatic, as The Verge ’s Casey Newton found when he reported on the working conditions endured by moderators in Phoenix, Arizona. Some of the workers bombarded with conspiracy theories told Newton that they were starting to believe the ideas they were seeing. What makes people start believing that the Earth is flat, or that 9/11 wasn’t a terrorist attack? And, in this case, did the stressful working conditions have anything to do with it? To answer some of those questions, we turned to Mike Wood. Wood, a psychologist at the University of Winchester, studies conspiracy theories, and how they spread from the fringes to the mainstream. The Verge spoke to Wood about the current research into conspiracy theories, and whether there’s anything people can do to make themselves less susceptible to them. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity. You’ve done quite a bit of research into conspiracy theories. Can we start with the basics? What exactly is a ‘conspiracy theory’? I’m not going to look into whether it’s true or not that everybody in the government is a lizard person We’re going to start off real complicated right off the bat — nobody can agree on this. If you ask different people in different academic fields, they’re going to give you different answers. As a psychologist, I’m not going to look into whether it’s true or not that everybody in the government is a lizard person, I’m just interested in why people would accept or reject that idea. So, for me, a conspiracy theory is a secret plot by powerful people or organizations working together to advance some kind of sinister goal through deception. If you ask other people they’ll give you other definitions, like a philosopher would say that a conspiracy theory is any theory about a conspiracy. Which I think is probably too broad, and doesn’t fit how most people would use the term. In The Verge’s recent article on Facebook moderators, the fact that these workers started believing in the conspiracy theory videos that they were being asked to moderate really stood out to readers. Is that propagation by exposure something that you’ve seen before in your conspiracy theory research? How do these things spread? The exposure aspect is interesting in this case. We’ve got some data on this from 9/11 conspiracy theories showing that one of the big predictors of whether or not somebody will believe a particular conspiracy theory is how much they’ve been exposed to it. conspiracy theories can be appealing to people for a lot of reasons The problem is that this is all cross-sectional data. We just have one point in time, and we know that the people who believe these theories have more exposure to them than the people that don’t. We don’t know if that’s because they believe them and then they seek them out because they want to know more, or if they saw this stuff and then that convinced them of it. It sounds like this might be a case where people were exposed to it for long periods of time and that actually induced them to believe in it. So there’s a causal aspect to this that we haven’t had in the research before. But there are other studies where people do these experiments where you get people to read a conspiracy theory passage — a little passage about how Princess Diana was secretly killed by Queen Elizabeth — and you can see that that has some influence on people. It changes how they think about the issue. In the short term at least, we certainly see those effects but this is an interesting sort of long-term exposure effect that we saw in these moderators. Other research has shown that being exposed to facts doesn’t seem to change people’s minds. Do we know why people being exposed to conspiracy theories in particular makes people believe them? Exposing people to information is going to affect them in some way or another. We all like to think that we’re immune to this stuff, but it does have an effect. I don’t know that conspiracy theories have a uniquely powerful effect to them. Where conspiracy theories can seduce people is when you have a conspiracy theory that is very appealing to you on the basis of other things that you believe. We all like to think that we’re immune to this stuff Let’s say that you’re a huge supporter of Donald Trump, and you come across a conspiracy theory that says “all of the people who are his rivals — his political enemies, people that he doesn’t like — are all super evil and are working together to engage in Satanic child sacrifice.” This is something that perhaps would appeal to you because of the other things that you believe. It wouldn’t appeal to somebody who doesn’t like Donald Trump at all and is probably quite OK with his enemies just being normal people. It has to be congruent to some extent with the other things you already believe. But conspiracy theories can be appealing to people for a lot of reasons. It could be because it makes sense of something that they had trouble to coming to grips with before. It could be a way of dealing with some type of uncertainty, feeling like they have lost control with what’s happening to them, or a rationalization of some failure they’ve had, or some defeat their side has suffered in an election. The other aspect of this story was the mental health effects of watching horrific videos all the time. Would stress play a role in this kind of thing, if they’re being exposed to stressful videos and then have conspiracy videos thrown in? Yeah, there is some work on this. Conspiracy theories do associate with stress. Basically, there’s been some research that’s showed that when people undergo a stressful life event — something like death of a family member, divorce, major disruption to their lives — conspiracy theories are more likely in that circumstance. So there is some indication that psychological stress can put people in this place where they’re looking around for new answers or they’re possibly trying to come to grips with the world in a new way. We’ve got other research showing that when someone doesn’t feel in control of their life or in control of what’s happening to them, conspiracy theories seem more plausible, and that might have been what’s happening with these people. I’m not sure what their subjective psychological experience was at the time, but there is some data that suggests that can happen. Conspiracy theories have been around for a long time, but social media is a relatively new invention in the span of human history. How has it changed the way conspiracy theories spread? It’s made them a lot more visible for sure. If you would read the local newspaper 30 years ago, you wouldn’t have the comment section at the bottom saying “this is all lies” and “that’s what they want you to think.” But if you read a lot of local news now, or you go to social media or your Twitter feed, you’ll see that. That’s a big change I think. The information doesn’t spread in such a top-down way as it did before. There’s always going to be a hierarchy of how information gets out there, but to an extent it’s more democratized now. Given that we are online constantly, whether for jobs, or social life, is there any way to combat or insulate yourself from these kinds of misinformation or conspiracy theories? Or is it just part of the ecosystem now? It’s hard to not come across it at all, I would say. There are steps that you can take to make sure that the information that you’re getting is as good as it can be. A lot of that is just finding reliable sources of information and making sure that you’re not classifying it as reliable just because it flatters what you already believe. Because, again, that’s where a lot of conspiracy theories come from. They play off preconceptions that people have and make them more vivid. There are studies showing that if you get people to think carefully about things, and not just go with their gut, they’re going to be less convinced of conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories tend to have a much easier time finding purchase in your mind if you have a very intuitive approach to something. If you just say “ah, that sounds right, that feels right to me,” that’s when conspiracy theories are going to be most convincing to you. It’s really easy to believe crap because crap is appealing People can go with their gut feeling because they are distracted or preoccupied or don’t have time to look into everything. Nobody has enough time to look into everything. You just have to find people who are good thinkers and figure stuff out, and try to do it yourself as much as you can and put in the effort. How much effort does it take for our brains to push back on our gut? It takes effort for sure. It’s really easy to believe crap because crap is appealing in a lot of ways.

Devin Coldewey,"Whoever thought we would leave telemarketing behind in this brave new smartphone world of ours lacked imagination. Robocalls are a menace growing in volume and even a massive $120 million fine leveled against a prominent source of them by the FCC likely won’t stem the flood. The fine was announced today during the FCC’s monthly open meeting: a Mr Adrian Abramovich was responsible for nearly 100 million robocalls over a three-month period, and will almost certainly be bankrupted by this record forfteiture. “Our decision sends a loud and clear message,” said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in a statement. “This FCC is an active cop on the beat and will throw the book at anyone who violates our spoofing and robocall rules and harms consumers.” That sounds impressive until you hear that these calls took place in 2016, and meanwhile there were 3.4 billion robocalls made last month alone. Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel applauds the fine, but questions the practicality of pursuing damages when actions need to be taken to prevent the crimes in the first place. “Let’s be honest,” she wrote in a statement, “Going after a single bad actor is emptying the ocean with a teaspoon.” She points out that a set of rules designed to prevent robocalls was overturned a couple months ago, and that 20 petitions to the FCC under those rules for legal exemptions and such have yet to be addressed. And a technology designed to prevent robocalls altogether, recommended in a report more than a year ago and currently set to be implemented in Canada in 2019, has no such date here in the States. As someone who gets these robocalls all the time, I fully support both this fine and the more serious measures Rosenworcel suggests.

Connie Loizos,"In many ways, it’s the best of times and the worst of times to be a venture capitalist. While money continues to flood into Silicon Valley, the math keeps getting harder to square. At what point do rising valuations stop making sense? How much mental bandwidth does one spend on blockchain technologies? Can the world handle another SoftBank megafund? These are among the many (many) questions we have for a distinguished panel of top investors who are coming together at our giant Disrupt SF show on September 5-7 to discuss what’s happening on the ground, and how they stay above the fray. Among our guests: Megan Quinn, a general partner with the venture firm Spark Capital, who, over the years, has become as well-known in startup circles for her wit as her insights about company-building. (Among her recent tweets: “Any time a late stage company tells me “… and we’ve never done any marketing!!” it has the opposite of the desired effect. Marketing – whether acquisition, brand, performance, etc – is a core competency at pretty much every [company] of consequence building for the long term.”) Quinn knows a thing or two about what companies need to grow, having led a number of early-stage and growth consumer investments for Kleiner Perkins prior to joining Spark and, before that, spending years in product development at both Square and Google. She’s also a straight-shooter when it comes to talking trends. Asked about SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund at a smaller event in San Francisco last year, Quinn was candid about the impact it is having on later-stage funds like the one she is leading, readily noting startups that have met with Spark and other firms about a sub-$100 million round before SoftBank has entered the picture “and is like, here’s $200 million!” Do these “ baby buyouts,” as she’d characterized them at the time, make sense? We’ll ask her! We’re also excited to welcome Sarah Tavel, a Harvard philosophy major turned longtime venture capitalist whose star in the venture industry has been on the rise for years, first at Bessemer Venture Partners, then Greylock Partners, and most recently at Benchmark, the storied venture firm, which convinced Tavel to join its ranks last year. (She became its first, and currently, only, female venture partner.) In between her venture stints, Tavel was also among the first product managers at the digital scrapbook Pinterest, after falling in love with the platform when it was run by five people and joining the company after convincing her colleagues at Bessemer to lead its Series B round. That turned out to be a pretty fantastic move for Bessemer, and for Tavel, who was hired back out of the company by Greylock. Now, Tavel has fallen in to love with crypto, recently making her first bet on the sector with Chainanalysis, which works with law enforcement agencies on virtual currency crimes, among other things. Can Benchmark, which has seemingly approached crypto at arm’s length, stomach much more ? We’ll ask her! Last but not least, we’re thrilled to welcome Aileen Lee, the longtime Kleiner Perkins investor who left in 2012 to form her own venture firm, Cowboy Ventures, and who helped inspire a new generation of women-led venture firms in the process. Lee — who has worked with Bloom Energy (on the cusp of going public ), Dollar Shave Club (acquired by Unilever for $1 billion in 2016), and Accompany ( acquired in May by Cisco) — has more recently helped pioneered something perhaps even more powerful than any individual firm: a network of female VCs who quietly began coming together last year to help elevate other women investors and entrepreneurs. Their express mission: doubling the percentage of women in VC partner roles over the next decade and increasing total funding to female founders by 10 percent within five years. Called “All Raise,” the community, which started with 36 women and grows by the day, is actually hosting a three-part workshop for women founders over two days of Disrupt. (You can learn more about that here.) In the meantime, we’ll be talking with Lee about what she’s seeing at the early-stage consumer and enterprise companies with which Cowboy Ventures meets. Are valuations up or down? Has the market cooled, as is widely believed? Can Silicon Valley firms ignore what’s happening elsewhere, especially in China? We’ll ask her! If you’re looking to better understand what’s happening behind the scenes in venture capital, you won’t want to miss this conversation, taking place on September 5th, the first day of Disrupt. The full agenda is here. Passes for the show are available at the Early-Bird rate until July 25 here.","In many ways, it’s the best of times and the worst of times to be a venture capitalist.

Rachel Becker,"The worst disaster in California’s history wasn’t an earthquake, or a fire, or a drought — it was a flood that killed thousands, wiped out mines and ranches, and submerged the state capital, Sacramento. For 43 days, starting in December 1861, California was inundated. Today, hardly anyone thinks about the floodwaters that turned California’s Central Valley into a vast lake — but it will happen again. “It’s not a question of if, but when,” writes seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones in her new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters H ave Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them). That’s why it’s key for us to know about the disasters in our history, so that we’re not doomed to repeat them on what will certainly be a much larger scale. After all, more than 100 times as many people now live in California as did during that deluge, Jones writes. “What’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities.” While natural hazards are inevitable, the destruction they wreak is not, Jones says in an interview with The Verge. “We can make choices about how we handle that — but we have to think ahead,” she says. Working at the US Geological Survey, Jones led a team of scientists who investigated the potential catastrophes in California’s future. One of them was a flood, and the team discovered that our existing flood control strategies would be no match for a deluge nearly the size of the one that started in 1861: The disaster would cause more devastation than an earthquake on the infamous San Andreas fault. After 33 years at the USGS, Jones retired and opened the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society, which aims to boost community resilience using science. In her book, she lays out catastrophic disasters in human history from the volcanic eruption that destroyed Pompeii to Hurricane Katrina to the Tohoku quake in Japan in 2011. She tells both the scientific story of how disasters unfolded, and the human story of the communities they struck. “We have to think ahead.” Her goal is to teach readers about disasters by drawing them in with narratives, and to address the ways human nature can make it harder to prepare for the future. Most of us assume a big disaster is going to be similar to smaller ones we’ve experienced, which can make us overconfident in our ability to deal with catastrophes — something experts call “normalization bias.” Our tendency to focus on more immediate threats can also come at the expense of preparing for more distant ones — which makes sense, Jones says: “If you worry about the 100-year flood and not about the wolf that’s about to eat your children, your DNA does not get passed down.” She draws on her experience as a scientist, and as a communicator who helped the public make sense of the destruction in the aftermath of earthquakes. The Verge spoke with Jones about natural hazards, risk assessment, and the disaster that haunts her. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. I grew up in California, and only learned about the 1861-1862 flood last year. How do you keep the memory of such a major disaster fresh, and make sure that people don’t forget that this could happen again? Photo by Helen Berger Dr. Lucy Jones It’s very difficult to do. In a natural world, if we hadn’t built all of our flood control systems, we would have smaller floods much more often. When you have the smaller ones, at least you know that flooding is a risk. But you do tend to believe that the risk is what you’ve already dealt with. So, paradoxically, the flood managers who were fully aware of the 1861 flood seemed more willing to say, ‘We’ve got it covered. That isn’t really going to happen again.” And, like with earthquakes, I find that the people were actually part of a response to Northridge, [ a quake that hit part of the Los Angeles area in 1994 ], are much more overconfident about their abilities to handle the really big one, because they feel like they dealt with the really big one. And that that wasn’t the really big one doesn’t get through. Hundreds of years ago, we didn’t have the information to be able to think ahead. Now we have more information, and yet we still struggle with the emotional aspect of it, because it doesn’t seem real to us. And that, right there, is the challenge of natural disasters. We know what they’re going to do, we know how to build to avoid the damage, but everything about human nature keeps us from looking forward [for] that really long-term planning. So it requires much more rational, logical thought, and reasoned discourse. So how do we now wrestle with the human inability to think ahead and also to remember the past? “Around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before.” Because of globalization and improved telecommunications, we now have a situation where a flood or a big disaster somewhere else in the world is something we can experience in real time. One of the most striking examples of that was the Tohoku earthquake in northern Japan [in 2011]. I’m sitting in my living room in California, and I can turn on the TV and watch in real time the tsunami wave. And we see the people fleeing from it, from the air. We don’t have enough to save them at this point, but we watch them in real time suffer through this. Now, around the world, people are more concerned about tsunami risk than they were before, I would say. Fifteen years ago, it was rare to find a person who knew what a tsunami was. But between the Indian Ocean event [in 2004], and Japan [in 2011], and the really direct, emotional experience with the power of telecommunications, we have a really different understanding and experience of it. And that is allowing us to overcome that normalization bias, and it’s part of the reason that we’ve been able to [make progress] here in Southern California [with] getting people to take the risk seriously and doing something about it. For us, it isn’t about tsunamis, it’s mostly about earthquakes. The book is divided by chapter into case studies of different disasters through history — which one kept you up at night? Which one haunted you? The 1927 Mississippi flood — the greatest flood disaster in American history. Mississippi is a huge river system that drains the majority of American states. A huge rainfall starting in the fall of 1926 through winter and spring led to failures of the levees protecting the land around the Mississippi river. And 27,000 square miles were flooded and over 1 million people were flooded out of their homes. Over 600,000 people were living in refugee camps. “What really haunted me... was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens.” But what really haunted me about it — and made it by far the most difficult chapter to research and write — was seeing how awful we were to our fellow citizens. What happened to African American victims of the flood was appalling, and just the inhumanity of how they were treated. The Kanto earthquake, which was only four years before that was also — in Japan — an equally horrible turning on neighbors. And it was recognizing that part of the human experience is the need to find a reason why it was the victim’s fault, to blame the victim: “Because if it was the victim’s fault, then I can protect myself by not making those same mistakes.” It’s a subconscious response to fear: “I don’t want that to be able to happen to me.” So you find reasons that it’s the victim’s fault. And at the worst level, you then punish the victim of the situation. So when you ask what haunted me, I’m an Earth scientist. So the physical part of it was all what I understood and expected going in. What haunted me, and inspired, was sometimes the horribleness of human response, and sometimes the real inspiration of human response. And you see both in those stories. The book talks about the disconnect between the language scientists use and the language the public use s to talk about disasters. Scientists have their wind speeds for hurricanes, magnitude for earthquake, probability for flood — then the public asks, “Was it The Big One?” How do we bridge that gap — and do we need to? “I just see people talking past each other so much.” The stuff I put in this book — none of it is really hard to understand. A high schooler could easily read the book and understand it, maybe even somebody younger. And yet we don’t teach it. And therefore, the public doesn’t have a context within which to be getting the information or having the discussion. So we need better education in science, which does not mean learning a bunch of facts — the other part is to understand how to think about science, the fundamentals of science as a process for learning what’s really true. We don’t teach that. But then we also need to help the scientists understand that people are looking for a mix: they want the science, but they also want the human side of it. And we need to help the scientists do a better job of being to answer the human questions. I just see people talking past each other so much. You write about how being a seismologist gives you an unusual perspective on time and that a forecast that a disaster will happen “‘sometime in the next millennium’ sounds not like an evasion, but like a threat.” How has this perspective shaped your own relationship with risk? Are you resigned to it, or have you bought every kind of disaster insurance there is? “The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but chances of it in my lifetime?” The earthquake’s absolutely inevitable, but the chances of it in my lifetime? Well, the San Andreas is probably going to have [an earthquake] in my lifetime, but the fault I live near probably isn’t. So yes, it’s a possibility, but I just have to keep it balanced because it’s a relatively low possibility compared to other things. People assume that where I live must be a place that’s really safe from earthquakes, but we moved to a community with really good schools sitting right on top of a significant fault. We were basically gambling that an earthquake wouldn’t happen before the kids got out of high school, and it worked. Climate change is going to make meteorological disasters more frequent and more devastating, right? What do we need to do to make sure that we’re prepared? It’s going to be very difficult. People do not sufficiently understand what we are doing to ourselves with this. We need to do everything we can to stop adding carbon to the atmosphere and reduce what’s already there if it’s at all possible. Because more heat in the atmosphere doesn’t just mean it’s warmer and ‘oh I guess I can handle that.’ That means more energy to drive storms, and they are going to be getting worse. “That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger.” So first off, we’ve got to admit it. We can’t talk about nuisance flooding, because high tide is bringing it into your house, without thinking about what that means when the hurricane comes through. One of the big issues in America is that we have a pretty strong tradition of individual land rights: nobody gets to tell you what to do with your own land. We are really struggling as a society to be able to make those big scale decisions. We need to be changing our attitudes about community, how much we share, to accept that we’re dependent on the decisions of others. We don’t like to do that as Americans either, we so prize our independence. So we philosophically oppose that, but that doesn’t change what’s going to happen. That doesn’t stop the hurricane from getting stronger. If there were one thing you wanted your reader to take home about this book, what is it? You have choices. That hazards are inevitable and the disaster is not. We as a society have choices, both what we do individually, but also a choice to work together. The thing that came out of it for me is that what’s at risk in disasters is not our individual lives, it’s the future of our communities, and we can change that if we can work together as a community.","In the new book, The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters have Shaped Us (and What We Can Do About Them),  seismologist and disaster expert Lucy Jones tells both the scientific story of disasters, and the human story of the communities they struck.",2018-05-26T13:00:02Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",The hardest part of preparing for disasters is overcoming human nature,https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/26/17321100/the-big-ones-natural-disasters-lucy-jones-earthquakes-hurricanes-volcanoes-floods,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MoH9Pj5-jHrX7PK8KOR706Ssf7I=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10780201/mdoying_180504_2512_0002.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,flood,0
ROBERTA SMITH,"Many of the works in Programmed: Rules, Codes and Choreographies in Art, 1965-2018, an exhibition at the Whitney Museum, require an electrical outlet. The presentation drawn mostly from the museums collection involves much in the way of video projections, lights, television sets, voice-overs, soundtracks, computers, computer programs and, in the most recent efforts, touch screens.
Yet regardless of whether power sources are needed, all the artworks use algorithms. That is, they are executed according to plans, instructions, numerical systems, or, as the shows subtitle indicates, rules, codes and choreographies. The analog examples tend to be foundational works of Minimal and Conceptual Art: Donald Judds 1965 aluminum relief based on the Fibonacci numerical sequence; a Sol LeWitt wall drawing from 1976 executed to written directions applicable to walls of any dimension; and Joseph Kosuths string of five words in green neon that reads Five Words in Green Neon (1965).
Then there is the shows most plugged work in several senses: Nam June Paiks 1989Fin de Siècle II, a monumental video wall of dizzying complexity formed by 207 television monitors of varying sizes arranged in adjoining grids.

While there is a high concentration of these basins in coal states like Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, the largest concentration is in southeastern states such as Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, which are more prone to hurricanes.

LINDA GREENHOUSE,"In the states appeal, titled, as is the other Indiana case, Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Indiana complains that the appeals court said nothing about the ultrasounds utility in helping women to come to a better, more informed abortion decision. The state claims that Planned Parenthood, which operates the four abortion clinics, could mitigate this burden by equipping its other reproductive health centers around the state with ultrasound equipment.
While the state defends the ultrasound requirement as protecting fetal life and dignity as well as maternal mental health, it doesnt explain how the new 18-hour requirement improves on the old law. No matter. Its not hard to envision five justices using this case to whittle down the undue burden standard as the Supreme Court applied it before Justice Anthony Kennedys retirement last year and as the Seventh Circuit has been applying it in recent months. The court will consider this case in April, after it receives Planned Parenthoods response to the states petition.
Of all the recent rulings, the decision that took me most by surprise and gives me the most concern was handed down two weeks ago by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The court upheld an Ohio law that bars state public health money from going to any organization that performs abortions. For any organization read Planned Parenthood, which receives no public money for abortions, but that for years has administered government grants for six public health programs, including H.I.V. testing, cancer screening and sexual violence prevention. Planned Parenthood is the largest provider of H.I.V. testing in Cleveland, Akron and Canton. It performs abortions at three of its 27 clinics in the state.
After then-Gov. John Kasich signed the law in 2016, Planned Parenthood sued on the ground that the state was imposing an unconstitutional condition by requiring it to forfeit its right to provide abortions in order to remain eligible for the unrelated public health grants. A Federal District Court barred the law from taking effect, in a decision upheld by a three-judge panel of the appeals court. But fortified by the addition of four Trump-appointed judges, the full court reheard the case and voted 11 to 6 to reverse the panel and uphold the law, with all the new judges in the majority.
I found Judge Jeffrey Suttons opinion for the court astonishing. He wrote that Planned Parenthood had no right to invoke the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions because while women have a right to obtain abortions, neither Planned Parenthood nor any other abortion provider has the right to perform them. As he explained: If theres no right, theres no unconstitutional condition. And the providers have no such constitutional right.
Judge Sutton, named to the appeals court by President George W. Bush, is a thoughtful conservative whom Ive long respected. Ive struggled to understand what led him to his conclusion. Since the earliest years of the Supreme Courts abortion jurisprudence, both the Supreme Court and the lower courts have regarded doctors and clinics as standing in the shoes of their abortion patients, entitled to assert rights that individual women are highly unlikely to be in a position to assert.
The precedents are clear on this crucial point, in case after case, court after court. As Judge Helene White wrote in dissent, An abortion providers constitutional right may be derivative of the patients right but it is a right nonetheless. She continued: The majoritys reasoning contorts a doctrine that aims to prevent the government from manipulating rights out of existence, to permit the state to leverage its funding to launch a thinly veiled attack on womens rights so long as it camouflages its unconstitutional condition in provider-focused verbiage. (On Monday of this week, a federal district judge in North Carolina, William L. Osteen Jr., struck down that states ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, finding that doctors themselves had standing to bring the case because of their plausible fear of prosecution if they interpreted the statutes health exception too generously in the view of state prosecutors.)
I dont know whether Planned Parenthood will appeal the Ohio decision, Planned Parenthood v. Hodges. Its received little attention not surprisingly. As framed by the appeals court, its not the kind of issue that sends culture warriors to the barricades. But theres no chance that the justices will miss its significance. Is it the small-target case they have been waiting for? Could be. As my favorite poet, Edna St. Vincent Millay, wrote in an obviously different context:
Tis not loves going that hurts my days,
But that it went in little ways.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"Photo Emmet T. Flood, left, in 2007, when he was the White House special counsel under George W. Bush. Credit Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images President Trump on Sunday disputed a New York Times report describing discussions it said he had had with a veteran lawyer about joining the White House to help handle matters related to the special counsel inquiry. In a pair of tweets, Mr. Trump wrote that The Times “purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out.” The Times, in a statement issued by its communications department, said, “We stand by our reporting, which was confirmed by multiple people close to the president.” The newspaper reported that the lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, who represented President Bill Clinton during his impeachment process, had met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office last week. It said that Mr. Trump had not made a final decision on whether to bring on Mr. Flood, who would help the White House manage its contacts with the Justice Department.

Brian Heater,"Like the initial HQ2 plan, todays news that Amazon will no longer be setting up shop in Queens has been met with a flood of mixed reactions. Business advocacy and real estate are decrying the retail giants decision to pack up and leave. I know Ive been flooded with responses from various corners all afternoon.
Local politicians, on the other hand, appear to be placing the news squarely at the feet of Amazon .
In a statement provided to TechCrunch, Mayor Bill de Blasio took Amazon to task for the move in a customary bit of New York saltiness.
You have to be tough to make it in New York City. We gave Amazon the opportunity to be a good neighbor and do business in the greatest city in the world, the Mayor stated. Instead of working with the community, Amazon threw away that opportunity. We have the best talent in the world and every day we are growing a stronger and fairer economy for everyone. If Amazon cant recognize what thats worth, its competitors will.
Of course, de Blasio was key in Amazons initial decision. The mayor was condemned by many quarters for what was regarded by many as closed door dealings involving, among other things, massive tax breaks for the company. A mere three days ago, he called the plan mission critical.
The Mayors current take appears to be something more along the lines of, yeah, well, we didnt really want you here anyway.
Speaker Corey Johnson, on the other hand, was one of the deals most vocal opponents from the outset, happily grilling Amazon reps at City Council meetings overs concerns around tax breaks, infrastructure and the companys longstanding opposition to employee unions.
I look forward to working with companies that understand that if youre willing to engage with New Yorkers and work through challenging issues New York City is the worlds best place to do business, he said in a statement provided to I hope this is the start of a conversation about vulture capitalism and where our tax dollars are best spent. I know Id choose mass transit over helipads any day.
Predictable, the city’s wing of the DSA was similarly in a celebratory mood. “”The impending Amazon deal was far from the only way capitalism is oppressing working class Queens residents and New Yorkers,” it said in a statement. “Millions of New Yorkers still lack any basic tenants rights and live with the threat of rent hikes, displacement, and evictions every day.”","Like the initial HQ2 plan, today’s news that Amazon will no longer be setting up shop in Queens has been met with a flood of mixed reactions.

Frederic Lardinois,"Google is hosting its annual Cloud Next developer conference in San Francisco this week. While the event is still in full swing, with a mystery concert capping off most of the programming tonight, the flood of news has now subsided, so here is our list of the most important announcements from the event.
Anthos
What is it? Anthos is the new name of the Google Cloud Services Platform, Google’s managed service for allowing enterprises to run applications in their private data center and in Google’s cloud. Google decided to give the service a new name, Anthos, but also expanded support to AWS and Azure, its competitors’ cloud platforms. This will allow enterprises to use a single platform, running on Google’s cloud, to deploy and manage their applications on any cloud. Enterprises will get a single bill and have a single dashboard to manage their applications. All of this, unsurprisingly, is powered by containers and Kubernetes.
Why does it matter? It’s still highly unusual for the big cloud competitors to launch a product that allows users to run applications on other platforms. The money, after all, is in charging fees for compute time and storage allocations. Google argues that this is something its customers want and that it solves a real problem. Google, however, is also chasing its competitors and looking for ways to differentiate its approach from them. I don’t think we’ll see AWS and Azure react with similar tools, but if they do, it’s a good thing for their customers.
Open-source integrations into the Google Cloud Console
What is it? Google announced that it would deeply integrate the products of a number of open-source companies into its cloud and essentially make them first-party services. These partners are Confluent, DataStax, Elastic, InfluxData, MongoDB, Neo4j and Redis Labs, with others likely to follow over time.
Why does it matter? These integrations are a boon for Google Cloud customers who are likely already using some of these services. They’ll get a single bill and access to support from these companies, all while managing the services from a single console. The subtext here, though, is a bit more complicated and reveals Google’s approach to open source and puts it into contrast with AWS. Many of the companies that are participating here are highly critical of AWS’s treatment of open source and quite public about it. Google is working with them while the perception is that AWS simply uses the code and doesn’t give back.
Google’s AI Platform
What is it? Google sees its AI prowess as one of its main differentiators in its fight against AWS, Azure and Co. The company already offered a wide range of AI tools, ranging from developer tools and services for advanced data scientists to AutoML, a service that can automatically train models and doesn’t require a PhD. The new AI Platform offers an end-to-end solution for more advanced developers that allows them to go from ingesting data to training and testing their models, to putting them into production. The platform can also use pre-built models.
Why does it matter? AI (and machine learning) is the major focus for all big cloud providers, but the developer experience leaves lots of room for improvement. Having an end-to-end solution is obviously a major step forward here and opens up the promise of machine learning to a wider range of potential users.
Your Android phone is now a security key
What is it? Instead of using a physical security key to enable two-factor authentication, you’ll now be able to use any Android 7+ phone as a security key, too. You set it up in your Google Account and your phone will then use Bluetooth (but without the hassle of creating a Bluetooth connection) to provide your second factor. For now, this only works with Chrome, but Google hopes to turn this into a standard that other browsers and mobile operating system vendors will also support. Google also recommends you still use a regular key as a backup for that inevitable day when you lose your phone.
Why it matters? Two-factor authentication is inherently safer than just using a login and password. Systems that use SMS and push-notifications are still vulnerable to phishing attacks while security keys — and this new Android-based system uses the same standards as existing keys — prevent this by ensuring that you are on a legitimate site. This new system takes the hassle out of using a physical key and may just convince more people to use two-factor authentication.
Google Cloud Code
What is it? Cloud Code is a set of plugins and extensions for popular IDE’s like IntelliJ and VS Code. The general idea here is to provide developers with all of the necessary tools to build cloud-native applications — all without having to deal with any of the plumbing work and configuration that comes with that. Using Cloud Code, developers can simply write their applications like before, but then package them as cloud-native apps and ship them to a Kubernetes cluster for testing or production.
Why does it matter? Writing cloud-native apps is complicated and usually involves writing complex configuration files. Cloud Code ideally makes all of this so easy that it’ll be far easier for developers — and the companies that employ them — to make this move to a modern infrastructure.
Google Cloud aims at retailers
What is it? The news here is that Google is launching a vertical solution that’s squarely aimed at retailers. That doesn’t sound all that earth-shattering, does it? But Google Cloud plans to offer more of these specialized solutions over time.
Why does it matter? Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian told us that customers are asking for these kinds of integrated solutions that package some of the companies existing tools into integrated solutions that these enterprises can deploy. This is essentially the first time it is doing so (with maybe the exception of healthcare), but it’ll likely offer more of these over time and they could become a major factor in growing the platform’s user base.

Jonathan Shieber,"Whether it’s by flood, fire, or the fury of a storm, climate-related catastrophes are now impacting most cities and towns across the country. As these natural disasters increase in frequency and severity, cities and the businesses that reside in them are mobilizing to understand how best to prepare for the climatological challenges they’re going to face — and increasingly they’re turning to companies like Jupiter Intelligence for information.
From offices in San Mateo, Calif., Boulder, Colo., and New York Jupiter Intelligence has made a business selling data from satellite imagery and advanced computer models to cities like New York and Miami, along with the Federal government and big insurance and real estate customers.
With its new financing, Jupiter plans to take its show on the global road, and is bringing its services to clients in Rotterdam, London, and Singapore.
It’s a story that has its roots in over two decades of work from founders Rich Sorkin, Eric Wun, Josh Hacker, and Alan Blumberg.
Wun and Sorkin met in 1996 in the early days of the development of mapping and weather prediction technologies. And got their start in the business co-founding Zeus, a weather prediction technology developer that was pitching its services to commodities traders.
“Zeus was way too early from a technology platform perspective,” says Hacker. “We put Zeus on the shelf eight years ago. Then when we came up with the idea for Jupiter most of the early ideas were already there.”
In the interim, Hacker served as the president of Kaggle, a company Google acquired back in 2017. By that point, Hacker had already left to launch Jupiter, which he started in 2016.
While Zeus predicted the thirty day weather for commodities traders, Jupiter is a more powerful toolkit that predicts the possibility of damage from severe weather and climate change for a much broader set of customers, Hacker says.
Wun and Sorkin were on board immediately, and the next person to join the fledgling team, was Hacker — who had run satellite operations for Skybox — another Google acquisition. Following the merger of Skybox with Planet Labs, Hacker took a job at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration within the Department of Commerce (one of the pre-eminent organizations focused on climate change).
The final recruit was Blumberg who was approached because of his role in developing the Princeton Ocean Model, which is used by over 5700 research and operational groups in 70 countries and his leadership position in developing 2-hour and 4-day flood predictions for Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Storm surge from Hurricane Sandy in New York City
After its launch the company was able to land three big insurance companies, QBE, Mistui, and Nephila, which all agreed to throw cash into the company’s new $35 million round.
Jupiter’s predictive and analytics technologies have applications far beyond insurance. Airports, ports, power plants, water facilities, hospitals, municipal and even the federal government are turning to the company for information, according to Sorkin.
Jupiter raised $1 million in its seed round from DCVC (Data Collective) and then closed on $10 million more from Ignition Partners . The latest $23 million was led by Energize Ventures, a fund focused on infrastructure and climate-related investments.
SYSTEMIQ, which was co-founded by McKinsey veteran Jeremy Oppenheim, also invested in Jupiters Series B. The architect of McKinseys Sustainability and Resource Practice said in a statement, “For a decade the planet has needed the kind of repeatable, globally consistent, insurance grade analytics Jupiter now delivers.”

The toolkit that the company pitches does purport to offer new levels of granularity and insight into the kinds of threats climate and weather-related disasters post to government and private assets.
“We predict probabilistically at the asset level… at the loading dock of a warehouse or a transmission box or a hotel on the beach, we determine the actual expected risk in a form that the insurance industry or the risk manager at an organization can use and integrate into their plans,” says Sorkin. 
The company’s process begins with global climate models and then drills down into a specific region which is used as the basis of predicting peril-like events, according to Sorkin.
That goes into a statistical model which translate the predictions into a form that quantifies the uncertainty and in a way that’s tailored to decision makers, he said.
Using APIs from Mapbox, the company can also provide a mapping interface that gives customers visualizations along with a product that lets users see what damage can look like inside of a building through virtual reality and a collaboration with Oculus.
“The strategy was to start with one peril in one place in one market so we started with flooding in Carolinas for the real estate,” says Sorkin. “We have expanded into much broader perils and geographies and market segments.”
For all of the time that Sorkin spends modeling out how cities will meet their doom in one form of cataclysm or another, Jupiter’s chief executive is fairly positive about the prospects for society to withstand the climate threat it currently faces.
“Even with all the bad things that could happen, we dont think the apocalypse is inevitable,” Sorkin says. “The extent of damage is a function of how much people invest in avoiding it over the next decade.”","Whether it’s by flood, fire, or the fury of a storm, climate-related catastrophes are now impacting most cities and towns across the country.

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"When: Officials will send high-priority warnings during tsunamis, blizzards, tornadoes, hurricanes, extreme wind conditions, storm surges, snow squalls and flash floods. In New York, flash flood warnings are the most common, said Nelson Vaz, a warning coordination meteorologist for the Weather Service. On days like today, the Weather Service’s forecasters are constantly monitoring rainfall rates and the affected environments. “If they feel the rainfall rates are going to exceed the ability of the ground to absorb that rainfall, and you’re going to see a threat to life and property from flooding, that’s when the forecaster will issue a flash flood warning,” Mr. Vaz explained. How: The warnings are issued from the National Weather Service’s offices in Upton, N.Y., using computer software called WarnGen, which allows the forecasters to create the text of the message — describing the location and hazards, for example — and to target the geographic area where the flooding is expected to happen. The technology, called Wireless Emergency Alerts, is the same tool that can push out Amber Alerts or emergency warnings from the president.

JESS BIDGOOD,"• The authorities evacuated people in Lahaina, in West Maui, after a brush fire ignited and spread quickly on Friday. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. • Five tourists from California were rescued from a flooded vacation home in Hilo on Thursday, according to The Associated Press. A slow-moving storm can lead to a lot more rain. The fact that Lane is moving slowly, about five miles an hour, means that it is likely to dump large amounts of rain. In June, our reporter Kendra Pierre-Louis looked at a study published in the journal Nature that focused on what is known as translation speed, which measures how quickly a storm is moving over an area, say, from Miami to the Florida Panhandle. Between 1949 and 2016, tropical cyclone translation speeds declined 10 percent worldwide, the study says. The storms, in effect, are sticking around for a longer period of time. Lingering hurricanes can be a problem, as Texans learned last year when Hurricane Harvey stalled over the state, causing devastating flooding and billions of dollars of damage. The storm dropped more than 30 inches of rain in two days and nearly 50 inches over four days in some places. A report released by Harris County, which includes Houston, found that Harvey’s rainfall exceeded every known flooding event in American history since 1899. The storm was approaching Hawaii on Wednesday. Read more about the dangers of lingering hurricanes here. It’s been a year filled with emergencies for Hawaii. First came an errant alert that a ballistic missile was headed for Hawaii. Then 50 inches of rain were recorded in one day on Kauai, flooding parts of the island. Next a slow-motion eruption of the Kilauea volcano ravaged parts of the Big Island. Now the state is facing its latest potential calamity: Hurricane Lane. On Thursday, we spoke with Hawaiians on the Big Island who were dealing with the deluge, and those to the north as they prepared for their own lashing of strong winds, heavy rain, rough surf and rising water. For many of the islands’ residents, it was hard to believe that a hurricane would make a direct hit when they have been spared so many times in the past. Still, some people prepared with a sense of urgency. “I’m normally not a person that makes sure my gas tanks are full and everything is all settled and organized, but I totally organized and brought everything in, and my chickens are in the garage,” said Heather Nelson, 39, who works in event production and lives in Volcano, Hawaii. On the Big Island, in Kalapana, Suzette Ridolfi, a teacher who evacuated her home as Kilauea was spewing lava, said “the volcano was may more scary.” “With the volcano there was no rest,” she said. “It was intense, intense, intense and the intensity never slowed down a bit. And, with the hurricane passing, there’s big rains and heavy rains and we get really scared for a few minutes, but then it stops and it’s peaceful, it’s calm.” Photo Employees of a Honolulu hotel filled sandbags in preparation for the storm. Credit John Locher/Associated Press Read more about the multiple threats faced by Hawaiians this year here. The storm put a damper on thousands of vacations. The five California tourists rescued from a vacation home on Thursday were a minuscule slice of the 270,000 tourists estimated to be on Hawaii. The state had a record year for tourism in 2017, according to George Szigeti, the president and chief executive of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, who said things had continued at a steady clip in 2018 despite the drumbeat of bad news. “It’s been a very active year,” Mr. Szigeti said, “but I would tell you, Hawaii is a very resilient destination.” Tourists who wanted to cut vacations short early may have found it difficult to do so, Mr. Szigeti said, because so many flights were already full. Doug Okada, the general manager of the Aston Waikiki Sunset, a towering hotel in Honolulu, said his 330 units were full this week, since it was high season. Some visitors had canceled incoming stays, but others had extended them because they did not want to fly out during the storm. “We just have to do our best to get through this,” said Mr. Okada, who was urging guests to shelter in place. “Some guests have never been in a hurricane situation, so it’s a thrilling experience. I’m glad they are positive, but they’ve been warned not to go out in dangerous conditions.” Meghan Miner Murray, Barbara Tanabe, John Schwartz, Kendra Pierre-Louis and Matt Stevens contributed reporting.

VANESSA FRIEDMAN,"There is nothing wrong with this, or with thinking about this; it doesnt reveal a superficiality or lack of substance, which is often the default fear when the topic of clothing comes up. 
On the contrary, it acknowledges the truth that we all make snap judgments based first on appearance, and then make a choice about how much time and brain space need to be devoted to influencing those judgments, and how much can be delegated.
This should be something everyone can relate to, given the current craziness around dress codes in general, be it the complete nonsense of events that request creative dress or dress to impress or the difficulty of corporate strictures on dressing appropriately in an office setting, a word so vague that it is practically meaningless. (Yes, Goldman Sachs, this means you.) 
To a certain extent, we are always in search of dress recommendations and instruction, as the social and professional codes of yesteryear have eroded under the increasing commingling of life and work, putting an end to unspoken uniforms. 
Thats why stylists and personal shoppers have become such a booming business, increasingly famous in their own right. In many ways, politics has been the most insulated of all professions, but clearly, even that is changing.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe warned of a ""race against time"" to rescue flood victims on Sunday, as emergency response teams in the country's western regions search for at least 60 missing, after floods and landslides caused by torrential rains killed over 100 people. SEE ALSO: California's wine country fire has been brewing for years Since the downpours started Thursday, evacuations had been ordered for up to 5.9 million people in 19 prefectures, according to The Japan Times, but this has been scaled back to 2 million since the weekend. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency is reported to have counted over 30,000 people accommodated in temporary evacuation centres as of Sunday. Some of the affected areas include Kyoto, Yamaguchi, Ehime, Fukuoka, Kagoshima, Hyogo, Shiga, Gifu, Kochi and Saga, with the Hiroshima and Okayama Prefectures among the hardest hit. It's the worst weather-related disaster in the country since 2011, when nearly 100 people were killed by two typhoons in August and September. The Times reports over 1,000 people in Okayama found themselves trapped on rooftops after the Oda River burst, with many rescued by helicopter or boat.

Rachel Becker,"After intensifying overnight, Hurricane Michael is now pummeling the Florida Panhandle as a Category 4 storm — the strongest hurricane on record to ever strike the region. Hundreds of thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate as Michael’s winds top speeds of 145 miles per hour, NBC News reports. Storm surge is expected to bring flood waters reaching 14 feet high — and already, there are “life threatening storm surge and catastrophic winds moving on shore,” the National Hurricane Center says. For those who stayed put, it’s time to seek shelter out of the way of waves and wind, Florida Governor Rick Scott warned on Twitter: “The time for evacuating along the coast has come and gone.” An extreme wind warning is currently in effect for locations between Laguna Beach and Eastpoint until 2:15PM ET. Wind gusts in excess of 130 mph are expected. Shelter in place IMMEDIATELY! #HurricaneMichael pic.twitter.com/jogpNWMwTv — NWS Tallahassee (@NWSTallahassee) October 10, 2018 The storm is unusually strong because of a few things: warm water in the Gulf, favorable wind conditions, and humidity. “Those are the perfect ingredients for a storm like this to really blossom,” says Marshall Shepherd, director of the University of Georgia’s atmospheric sciences program and former president of the American Meteorological Society. It’s possible the storm could get stronger still before landfall, the National Hurricane Center says. And after Hurricane Michael hits, Shepherd doubts we’ll see a hurricane with the same name again. “It’s a life-altering, society-altering situation,” he says. “Storms of this magnitude and impact, the name is typically retired. And I fully expect this to be the case for Michael.” The Verge spoke with Shepherd about Hurricane Michael’s unprecedented strength. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. How did Hurricane Michael get so strong? Overnight it’s really blossomed into a Category 4, and the primary reasons are that it was moving into very warm water, which is somewhat unusual for this late in October. It moved into a very favorable upper wind situation where there was not very much wind shear, and there’s a lot of moisture in the eastern United States out ahead of a cold front that’s coming from the west. When Michael was further south, it was in a very difficult wind shear environment. As you know, hurricanes don’t like wind shear — when the winds change direction or speed as you go up in altitude. One of the things that’s really interesting about Hurricane Michael is that it was very resilient. It was actually still intensifying even in an environment with a lot of wind shear, which was odd. So I knew once it got into an environment with less wind shear and over warm Gulf waters, the thing was going to just explode — and that’s what we’re seeing. From space, satellites from @NASAEarth + @NOAA see #HurricaneMichael as a major hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. Our latest space views: https://t.co/BvWmva7yU8 Latest storm weather from @NWS : https://t.co/Qk1x9RNd0k Be prepared + @FEMA resources: https://t.co/q2cgBnVW3h pic.twitter.com/wFhoVKGbU2 — NASA (@NASA) October 10, 2018 Is there anything else that can explain how Michael intensified so rapidly? We’ve been seeing these hot towers — these tall thunderstorms that form in the eyewall of the hurricane. I’ve been talking about these since my days as a scientist at NASA, because there are studies that show that when you have these hot towers, they’re more likely to indicate that the storm will go through a rapid intensification phase because they’re releasing so much heat that all that water vapor is condensing into cloud water in the storm. When water vapor condenses to form cloud water, it releases this burst of heat called latent heat — that’s really the fuel supply for these hurricane heat engines. When you have these hot towers, they’re like the supercharged pistons in the engine, if you will. You’ve got this ample warm water, you’ve got not a lot of wind shear overnight when the storm really intensified, so you can have a very efficient engine where all this water vapor is being converted to energy. What sort of hazards can we expect from the hurricane? If it stays at this intensity, and there’s evidence that it’s even still intensifying at this moment, this is going to be the strongest storm, at least on record, to ever hit this part of Florida. I think a lot of times we can overemphasize, or over play, the wind threat in a hurricane. I don’t think that’s the case with this one. There’s going to be significant wind impacts, not only at the landfall point and around the Panhandle of Florida because the storm is so large, it’s so strong. And because of the pace that it’s moving, even inland in parts of Alabama and Georgia there are going to be hurricane strength winds. So the winds are going to be a significant impact. The storm surge could be record-breaking in the coastal regions to the right of the storm. We could be seeing record eight to 13, perhaps more, feet of storm surge. [We] can’t downplay the rain. It’s not going to be a situation like Harvey and Florence where the thing stalls out and dumps three or four feet of rain. But there still could be half a foot to a foot of rainfall. And then, of course, to the right of the storm as it moves into Georgia and the Carolinas, you’ll get the tornado threats, too. It’s a horrible situation. Is it late in the year to be seeing a hurricane in the Gulf? I thought we were past the peak of hurricane season. Keep in mind with water, it takes several months for the transition from cold to warm and warm to cold. Even though air temperatures are starting to cool down, the heat characteristics of water means that the water has residual warmth for a while. That’s why the peak of the hurricane season is typically in September even though the actual hurricane season starts in June. So there’s this lag. So the waters are gradually starting to cool down from that peak in September, but they’re still typically warm enough to support hurricanes. We get hurricanes all of the time in October, that’s not unprecedented. And frankly when we do get October hurricanes, they form exactly where Michael formed, which is down in the southern Caribbean and moving into the Gulf. This is exactly what we expect from an October hurricane. I’m just cautioning that there is nothing particularly unique about a hurricane in October that takes this particular track. But yes, it certainly is interesting that it has tapped into enough warm water to explosively develop. How is climate change contributing to Hurricane Michael’s intensification? Storms like this are undoubtedly pushing more water into the coast because sea levels are higher. So when we have these types of storms and storm surge, the storm will be pushing a higher level of water than it would 50 or 70 years ago. That is something that I’m very comfortable saying, but I think only the studies over time will play out whether the warmer oceans — because of our broader, background climate change — are fueling more higher-octane storms. Physically, we understand that that should be the case, I want to clarify that. We understand from a scientific standpoint that a warming climate is causing warmer oceans, and you would think from a physics understanding of how these storms work that would lead to more intense storms. Whether I can say conclusively that that’s why this particular storm is more intense, I just think it would be irresponsible for me to speculate on that. What’s your advice to people in the area? It’s almost too late if you’re in Florida to do anything. People should have been gone a day or two ago. If they stayed in, all we can do is pray and hope that they’re okay. As the storm moves further inland, I am concerned that people further inland in my state of Georgia, for example, may not be really aware of the fact that they’re going to experience strong tropical storm to weak hurricane force winds in some parts well inland. I think that might catch a few people off guard. So hopefully they’re prepared for long power outages, perhaps trees falling down on their homes or in their yards. And for Georgia, I’m even worried about crop damage. That part of Georgia is a very agriculturally intense region of our state. It’s harvest time for some crops, so I even worry about that. How fast are we expecting this storm to move through the region? This storm is going to move quickly, which won’t mean four feet of rain like we saw in Florence or Harvey. But the downside of a quick-moving storm is that places further inland still feel the impact of a pretty powerful punch from the hurricane, because it takes a while to weaken. This is a very different storm than a Florence and a Harvey, but it carries its own unique threats because of the fact that places inland will see hurricane force winds or strong tropical storm force winds.","After intensifying overnight, Hurricane Michael is on track to pummel the Florida Panhandle on October 10th as a Category 4 storm.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","The Midwest floods continue to be a slow-moving disaster. Towns, farms, and infrastructure are still underwater in Nebraska, and water will take months to work through the vast network of rivers, creeks, and streams that drain the Upper Midwest into the Gulf of Mexico. 
The damage to the region could last much longer than that, though. It could require years to rebuild infrastructure, but the real challenge will be restoring the regions greatest resource, the reason there are so many farms there in the first place: its soil.
Early estimates indicate the floods could be responsible for $440 million in crop losses in Nebraska, which sits at the epicenter of the floods. That number could easily rise the longer floodwaters cut farmers off from fields and prevent spring plantings. Thats bad news for a state where one in four jobs are tied to or supported by farming, according to the states Department of Agriculture. States next door are dealing with their own varying levels of crisis from rivers overtopping their banks. 
Even after the floodwater recedes, the regions farms and the soil theyre built on could face a long road to recovery, spanning years or decades. To understand why, you have to understand how these floods happened. After an extremely wet fall, winter arrived with a fury. Repeated blasts of cold froze the soil and heavy snow piled up on top of it. Then came the bomb cyclone a few weeks ago. It unleashed a blizzard in western Nebraska, but the eastern portion of the state saw rain and lots of it. Nearly three-quarters of Nebraska weather stations are seeing an increase in winter rain, according to Climate Central (full disclosure: I helped with this analysis when I worked there), a hallmark of the warming world.
Soaked soils couldnt absorb the sudden influx of water, and so it began to run off into rivers and streams, scraping the earth away with it. Add in dam and levee failures, and the torrent truly clawed away at the Midwests most bountiful resource.
Basically what its going to do is going to erode the most productive topsoil, Mahdi Al-Kaisi, a soil and water specialist with Iowa States extension program, told Earther. This is why we need to think about climate change more seriously. Thats become very destructive to this whole system and put a lot of stress on these surfaces.
Its not even just the top layer of soil thats being ripped up and washed away. Where the floodwaters have receded, huge blocks of soil have been gouged away. The weight of the water has also compacted soil in some locations, while others are covered in sand and silt thats been swept up by engorged rivers, neither of which is as nutrient-rich or structured as the soil that supports the wheat, soybean, and corn crops. 
You have the good stuff moving away and not as good stuff moving in, Andrea Basche, an agronomist and soil scientist at the University of Nebraska, told Earther.
That puts farmers who depend on growing these crops for their livelihoods in a serious bind. They can try to plant this years crop, knowing productivity wont be as high as it was, or they can set about to the arduous task of restoring topsoil to a more productive state. The first step is just letting fields dry out, something that could take weeks or even months. Farmers can assess how much sand theyre looking at, though Al-Kaisi warned that using heavy equipment to do those assessments could disturb or breakup any topsoil that is left. 
For those lucky enough to be dealing with just a few inches of sand, they can just churn it up into the soil. But areas with more than 24 inches of sand could be lost causes. Nebraskas extension service suggests that farmers dealing with that situation [c]onsider the relative costs of moving the sand and of abandoning the crop area. Basche suggested that farmers could also use compost or restore wetlands and prairie as other possible solutions for rebuilding soil, but it still could take decades to restore productivity if it is ever the same in our lifetimes again.
That timeframe could mean many farmers and ranchers end up walking away rather than deal with mounting costs or the specter of bankruptcy. Farm revenue in Nebraska, while important, has been declining, and Trumps escalating trade wars have sapped an estimated $1 billion from Nebraska alone, according to the American Farm Bureau (though that number doesnt take into account programs designed to offset losses). The state of the soil only makes the situation more dire.
All this reveals yet another way climate change is upending the systems we rely on. Al-Kaisi said in the future, farmers could focus on low- or no-till agriculture, and planting cover crops could help mitigate some of the impacts of flooding. Systemic changes are also needed, including rethinking flood protection as climate change ups the odds of heavy downpours and rain falling on snow. 
It was not designed to handle this, John Remus, an Army Corps of Engineers manager said in a New York Times interview, referring to the intricate series of levees and dams that normally hold back the Missouri River. And the system will only be further taxed in the coming months, far from where the floods began. 
This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities, Ed Clark, director of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations National Water Center, said in a statement that went out with the agencys spring flood outlook. That outlook shows that areas all along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers face major flood risks through May, meaning more fields will face the scouring power of water.
We need to be really clear this is not just farmers problem, Al-Kaisi said. This is societys problem.

Several Midwestern states are reeling from historic flooding which hit the area a few weeks ago.
Thousands of people have been evacuated, and vast swathes of farmland has been destroyed. 
For many in Iowa, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Minnesota and South Dakota the recovery effort has been slow and painful, as people return to their homes.
As images of submerged farms were broadcast across the country, many looked for ways to help.
Here are some of the acts of kindness to emerge in the wake of the devastation.
'Any shoes are better than wet shoes'
When Addy Tritt, 25, noticed her local discount shoe shop was closing down she decided to buy out their entire stock.
Ms Tritt then donated the 204 pairs of shoes, valued at $6,000 (£4,555), to families affected by the floods. 
""I wanted them to go to people who actually needed them,"" Ms Tritt told CBS News.
After spending two hours negotiating with the the shop's head office, Ms Tritt paid just $100 (£76) for the entire stock.

 Addy Tritt donated 204 pairs of shoes to Nebraska flood victims
Of Ms Tritt's haul, 162 pairs were baby shoes, two were men's shoes and the rest were women's, according to the the Associated Press.
""Any shoes are better than wet shoes,"" Ms Tritt said. ""If people feel lost, they should try volunteering and donating. It gives me such fulfilment and I want others to feel the way I do.""
The shoes were part of a shipment to Nebraska farmers organised by a local student agricultural group. 
Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts said farmers were some of the worst affected by ""the most widespread destruction we have ever seen in our state's history"".
'Island hopping in Nebraska!'
With many roads in the region made impassable by floodwater, some volunteers took to the skies to rescue stranded residents. 
Adam Marshall, has been a private pilot for three years, and when he started to receive calls for help from people trapped in the nearby town of Fremont he fired up his small propeller plane. 
Mr Marshall told CNN that he has made more than 30 trips, and described it as ""island hopping in Nebraska"".
""My phone just started blowing up, and I told my wife, 'I think I'm going to be gone for a couple of days'.""
""I transported the entire Midland University dance team to Omaha so they wouldn't miss their commercial flight and a woman named Allie who has five kids and had been cut off from her family,"" he said.
Surrounded by rising floodwaters, Gary Fouraker was rushed to hospital after doctors suspected he had blood clots in his lungs. 
However, there was no room for his wife Marcia to travel with him in the helicopter. 
""I've never been scared like I was [at that point]"", Ms Fouraker told CNN. ""The roads weren't open.""
Mr Marshall came to her rescue, delivering Ms Fouraker to her husband's bedside an hour later. 
""I just really admire the way he, and so many other pilots, have really stepped up to help people,"" Ms Fouraker said.
""Most people had a look of relief when they got a ride,"" Mr Marshall reflected. ""I got a lot of hugs the last few days!""
'I've never escorted hay'
Derek Jilek, from North Dakota, knew he wanted to help when he saw photos of flooded farms across the Midwest. 
He posted on Facebook calling on his ""farm and ranch neighbours"" to donate a few hay bales to those who had been hit by the floods. 
Vast swathes of farmland was destroyed by the floodwater, and many farmers have struggled to feed their livestock.
What started as a small effort to collect donations, turned into a nine truck convoy carrying thousands of dollars worth of farming supplies and equipment. 
""I guess when you're helping or volunteering, I always heard that you do what you know. We know cows and we know trucking, so that's what we did,"" Mr Jilek told local news station WOWT. 
The convoy received a police escort for part of the 600 mile (965km) journey, with a new police department taking over as the trucks crossed county boundaries.
Sgt Dan Kensinger, from the Stark County Sheriff's Department, said, ""This was new to me. We've done funeral escorts and various other things. I've never escorted hay.""","As devastating flooding continues to affect the US Midwest, stories of kindness and charity have emerged.",2019-04-03T17:28:59Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Woman buys out shoe store to help flood victims,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47794159,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D474/production/_106288345_55816599-305810056731146-5839318225745084416-n.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,flood,0
Tom McKay,"Facebook, which landed itself in the crosshairs after becoming one of the primary venues by which federal prosecutors allege a Kremlin-linked, pro-Donald Trump Russian operation called the Internet Research Agency tried to flood the US with disinformation and propaganda before the 2016 elections, now says it will verify the identities of people who buy election-related ads by mailing postcards. Per Reuters, Facebook says the process will involve any advertising that mentions a specific candidate, but not general issue-based ads: The process of using postcards containing a specific code will be required for advertising that mentions a specific candidate running for a federal office, Katie Harbath, Facebook’s global director of policy programs, said. The requirement will not apply to issue-based political ads, she said. “If you run an ad mentioning a candidate, we are going to mail you a postcard and you will have to use that code to prove you are in the United States,” Harbath said at a weekend conference of the National Association of Secretaries of State, where executives from Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google also spoke. “It won’t solve everything,” Harbath said in a brief interview with Reuters following her remarks. According to Reuters, Facebook says the mailers are the best solution they could come up with and that they would be in use before the 2018 midterm elections scheduled for November. Though Russian groups purchased around $100,000 in ads on Facebook, it also produced a much larger array of unpaid content for the site that eventually reached up to 126 million Americans on Facebook and 20 million on subsidiary site Instagram—a number that sounds large, but is also “a tiny share of the 33 trillion posts Americans saw in their Facebook news feeds between 2015 and 2017,” the Washington Post noted. The share that were reached by the Russian-paid ads came in at just 10 million of that total. Federal law prohibits foreign entities from making any kinds of expenditures or contributions towards any electoral campaign in the US, as well as requires candidate committees, party committees, and political action committees to disclose how they spend money (though growing amounts of dark money spending by non-profit groups that don’t have to disclose their donors is increasingly an issue). According to the Washington Post, however, Facebook’s terms of service stipulate that advertisers have responsibility for “understanding and complying with all applicable laws and regulations.” As news of the alleged Russian operation has alarmed legislators, some commentators have characterized its response as intended to prevent any fix that could affect its highly profitable and largely automated targeted ad model. For years, Bloomberg reported, Facebook has long sought Federal Election Commission exemptions from political advertising disclosure, and its policy of leaving compliance to ad buyers has helped it “generate hundreds of millions of dollars in political campaign spots.” Since the new policy apparently only applies to ads directly mentioning candidates by name, it would apply to many but not all of the ads purchased by the Russian group during the election season. News of the postcard announcement may have been briefly overshadowed, however, by Trump’s decision to retweet a Facebook advertising executive who had tried to distance the Russian operation from the outcome of the elections.

Tom McKay,"Yellowstone National Park is probably not about to erupt in an explosion that could wreck the immediate area and flood the state of Wyoming with ash, despite several “unusual” eruptions at the world’s largest active geyser over the course of the past few weeks. Per Reuters, scientists say that there is no sign the increased frequency of eruptions at Steamboat Geyser is an indication the Yellowstone caldera—a massive volcanic crater formed by the last of three super-eruptions in the region from 2.1 million to 630,000 years ago—is about to blow: Steamboat Geyser, which can shoot water as high as 300 feet (91 meters) into the air, erupted on March 15, April 19 and on Friday. The last time it erupted three times in a year was in 2003, the U.S. Geological Survey’s Yellowstone Volcano Observatory said. The last time it erupted prior to March was more than three years ago in September 2014. “There is nothing to indicate that any sort of volcanic eruption is imminent,” Michael Poland, the scientist in charge for the observatory, said in an email. According to the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, the Steamboat Geyser eruption on Friday was reported by a park visitor and was estimated to have begun at 6:30 am; that person was likely the only one who witnessed it firsthand, since boardwalks leading to area are closed due to high snowfall. Poland told Reuters the two April eruptions were smaller than usual at the geyser, but did eject approximately 10 times more water than Old Faithful, the park’s most famous geyser. He added that geysers erupt sporadically and that the distribution of the latest events may simply reflect “randomness.” A real indication of serious danger would be if the underground hydrothermal systems beneath the park dried up, which would indicate magma was getting closer to the surface, Reuters added. While it’s been 70,000 years since the last major lava event in Yellowstone, the region is still very much active and poses the potential to erupt at some point in the future, perhaps disastrously. Per the Washington Post, an event in Yellowstone could be thousands of times more powerful than the Mount St. Helens explosion in 1980; the United States Geological Survey predicts that a sufficiently powerful eruption, while unlikely, would leave much of the northern Rockies buried in feet of ash. Lava flows could cover a radius up to 30 or 40 miles in diameter, with “disastrous” accumulations of 10 or more centimeters in a radius of up to 500 miles. That’s a worst case scenario, and scientists tend to emphasize that even a moderate volcanic eruption there is unlikely to happen in our lifetimes. Recent computer models have shed some light on the structure of the magmatic system below Yellowstone, though scientists are still far away from predicting future eruptions. However, Yellowstone Volcano Observatory monitoring arrays would probably detect “sudden or strong movements or shifts in heat that would indicate increasing activity,” the National Park Service writes, and that a “catastrophic” eruption would likely be preceded by weeks to years of warning signs.

Dell Cameron,"More than 100 emergency sirens blanket the City of San Francisco, ready to warn locals in the event of a flood, a fire, an earthquake, or terrorism. And while true emergencies are few and far between, everyone in the Bay Area knows the siren’s racket, even if they’ve trained their ears to tune it out. Redolent of an wartime air raid, the sirens wail precisely at noon each Tuesday, rising and falling, eerily and slowly. “This is a test,” a voice follows. “This is a test of the outdoor warning system. This is only a test.” And thus concludes the Tuesday midday siren tradition. What the residents don’t know is that their siren has long been vulnerable to attack. Triggering the sound for malicious or mischievous purposes isn’t stupid-easy, but for a person educated in radio-frequency security, who has $30 to blow at an electronics store, there’s virtually nothing to stop them from bathing the city in obnoxious tones for hours on end. Worst still, the same vulnerability might very well affect similar emergency systems in countless other cities, universities, and public utilities installations (read: nuclear power plants). Two years ago, a software engineer—originally from Australia—moved to San Francisco from South Bay and noticed the sirens everywhere he went. Perched atop poles, and often intentionally positioned so as not to “adversely affect residents by blocking their views,” most people wouldn’t give it a second thought. But the engineer, Balint Seeber, just happens to be obsessed with electromagnetic radiation—in particular, the range of frequencies most of us simply refer to as “radio.” Examining the sirens, installed by a company called Acoustic Technology, Inc, or ATI Systems, Seeber, the director of vulnerability research at Bastille Networks, deduced that all were triggered by RF (radio frequency). And of course they are. It would be incredibly inefficient to do it any other way. Why on earth would the city run miles and miles of electric cable to over a 100 points in the city when sweet, wireless radio is so cheap and easy to use? “Before customers panic too much, please understand that this is not a trivially easy thing that just anyone can do.” With access to a specially licensed frequency, there’s virtually nothing to impede the signal sent once a week by the city’s emergency management department. What’s more, test signals, not intended to trigger the sirens, can be sent just as easily, ensuring that the system is on standby for when it is needed most. It’s nearly foolproof. Nearly. It’s not clear what possessed him to do it, but on one Tuesday, shortly before noon, Seeber connected a radio transceiver to his laptop and prepared to scan the airwaves for the siren system’s signal. As it blared, he searched the spectrum broadly, scanning for any activity that matched the siren’s call. Eventually, he hit pay dirt. ATI’s proprietary digital radio protocol, unfortunately, did not benefit from any security measures that would be useful in defending against malicious triggering, he found. “I was expecting some type of encryption might’ve been applied that would have yielded packets with random-looking data,” Seeber told Gizmodo. That wasn’t the case. “These particular activation packets, as they call them, have the same structure every week,” he said. “So it became quickly very apparent that you could forge these packets. It’s not as simple as a replay attack,” he said, meaning you can’t just record the sound and re-emit it. “There’s a little more complexity to them. But not much more.” What would it take then to actually trigger the sirens? Someone with an electrical engineering degree would be ideal. The most complex bit, of course, is finding someone to code the software needed to demodulate, replicate, and transmit the necessary RF signal. San Francisco’s sirens are activated by a manned central controller strategically placed within the city. When an emergency calls, the controller transmits digital activation packets to a repeater, which, according to Seebe, is located in Twin Peaks, the city’s second highest summit and geographical center. The repeater, having receiving the packets, in turn transmits the packets over a licensed frequency to the sirens, each of which contains a modem for demodulating the packets. Anyone who may intercept them, purposefully or by accident, will likely only hear what sounds like seemingly random tones firing in short bursts—a binary code unchanging week to week and the key to the siren’s annoying song. A person who understands this technology as Seeber does should be able to decipher the flow of ones and zeros and, if they’re an asshole, wake up the entire city. (Oh, and they need that $30 radio, too.) These signals can be scrambled, randomized, or in other words, encrypted, to stave off this type of malicious attacks. But according to Bastille, a firm that specializes in analyzing RF-based attacks—for banks, tech companies, as well as the government—many companies believe that merely developing their own radio protocol is security enough. Having confidence that you’re secure simply because no one knows what the hell you’re doing is sometime called “security through obscurity.” Picture a safe with a locking mechanism that no one has ever seen—does that make it unbreakable? As Seeber deftly demonstrated, the obscurity trick doesn’t always work so well. “What we find in our work in general is that in IoT and critical infrastructure and industrial control systems, a lot of companies decide that they’re going to implement a proprietary RF protocol—a radio frequency protocol—to communicate, and they may or may not add security to that,” Bastille’s chief revenue officer, Ivan O’Sullivan, told Gizmodo. Seeber’s research, which was conducted passively—meaning, he never actually attempted to trigger the alarms himself—demonstrated that ATI had not attempted to encrypt its activation sequence, likely because it assumed anyone who happened to find it would have no idea what it was for. “I do see now various forms of new packets that do look more random. And that makes me optimistic.” According to its website, ATI has a host of featured clients one might recognize, among them One World Trade Center and West Point Academy. But it’s unclear which systems at which locations are similarly affected by the vulnerability. Bastille was, however, able to test Seeber’s discovery at one other location. The problem, it seems, is not San Francisco’s alone. “[Seeber] went to the Midwest and proved it at a second location,” O’Sullivan said. “We know of at least two confirmed locations, and that’s what we’ve done so far, but we haven’t been able to travel to each of the locations.” The second location, Seeber informed Gizmodo, was in Sedgwick County, Kansas. Authorities there, he said, confirmed to Bastille that they’d been working with ATI to fix their problems as well. “What we want now is to make sure that ATI’s other customers are made aware of the vulnerability, communicate with ATI, and work with them to take—and, if necessary, customize—the patch and get it out there,” added O’Sullivan said. In a public statement Tuesday, ATI did not contest with Bastille’s findings. It did, however, urged its customers not to panic... too much. “Bastille Networks, a company that offers visibility into known and unknown mobile, wireless and IoT devices within an enterprise’s corporate airspace, reported that by monitoring one of our systems for months, they have largely deduced the command format of our packets,” ATI wrote, adding: “This is likely true.” It continued: “However, we wish to point out these are technically sophisticated people who have devoted significant time and effort to this task. Before customers panic too much, please understand that this is not a trivially easy thing that just anyone can do. Spoofing our current protocol is still several orders of magnitude harder than spoofing a DTMF-based siren system.” (DTMF tones, such as those used on old landlines telephones, have been used in the past to activate emergency systems.) ATI confirmed that indeed it was issuing a patch to further safeguard its systems, at least ones not already protected from the vulnerability, which Seeber has named “ Siren Jack.” The sirens deployed by ATI on military bases, for instance, already use encrypted signals. The military’s equipment is considerably more expensive, however, and not every local government will be able to justify the expense, ATI said. Thanks to Bastille, a patch created by ATI against Siren Jack is now currently being tested, and the company plan to roll it out soon. Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as it sounds. The sirens, ATI said, “are not mass market consumer items connected to the internet where you simply download a patch.” San Francisco, at least, may be able to rest easy. Changes have been apparent, says Seeber, who continues to monitor ATI’s protocols from his home with his laptop and Amazon-bought radio. “I do see now various forms of new packets that do look more random,” he says. “And that makes me optimistic.”","More than 100 emergency sirens blanket the City of San Francisco, ready to warn locals in the event of a flood, a fire, an earthquake, or terrorism.

Rhett Jones,"Mark Zuckerberg is set to testify before Congress this week as his apology tour rolls on, but the Facebook CEO’s newfound humility has done little stem the flood of criticism hitting his company. The latest high-profile critic to jump into the fray is Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. It’s been about three weeks since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke and Facebook users began to truly recognize how reckless Facebook can be with their data. Zuckerberg has been frantically trying to reassure the public that Facebook knows it “ needs to do a better job ” and that’s why lots of features that could have rolled out years ago are going live. But for observers like Wozniak, there’s little the social network can do because its fundamental business model is the problem. In a goodbye message he posted on Facebook Sunday, Wozniak said he’s leaving the site that has brought him “more negatives than positives.” He has since deactivated his account, but not deleted it, telling USA Today he wants to retain the “stevewoz” user name. “Users provide every detail of their life to Facebook and... Facebook makes a lot of advertising money off this,” the Woz told the paper. “The profits are all based on the user’s info, but the users get none of the profits back.” Echoing Apple CEO Tim Cook’s recent comments, Wozniak said that it would be better to just pay Facebook directly for use of the network, adding “with Facebook, you are the product.” Cook’s criticisms were previewed almost two weeks ago, but the full interview with Recode and MSNBC ran over the weekend. He went further than Wozniak, saying that not only has the Facebook model demonstrated itself to be untenable, Apple thinks it should never exist in the first place. “Look, we’ve never believed that these detailed profiles of people—that has incredibly deep personal information that is patched together from several sources—should exist,” he said. In Apple’s view, he said, all of these connective data points could be used in devious ways, and is one of the things that is “possible in life but shouldn’t exist.” After saying that he’s typically not a fan of regulations, he went as far as to suggest Facebook shouldn’t be allowed to exist. In an interview with Vox last week, Zuckerberg called Cook’s comments “extremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth.” He argued that a lot of people can’t afford to pay and Facebook seeks to make a product that connects everyone in the world. Of course, Zuckerberg’s big idea has always just been the internet. He wants an internet inside the internet. And when Facebook has attempted to launch a basic internet service that people pay for with their data, it’s been met with accusations of “ digital colonialism ” and being a backdoor violation of net neutrality. This is a case of three wildly rich men trying to publicly hash out what’s best for the public, and it’s tough to say that any of them are free of hypocrisy in this situation. But considering the news that Zuckerberg had a special tool to delete his messages from other users’ inboxes, all three men can probably agree with Cook’s assertion that Facebook is just “ creepy.” [ USA Today ]","Mark Zuckerberg is set to testify before Congress this week as his apology tour rolls on, but the Facebook CEO’s newfound humility has done little stem the flood of criticism hitting his company.

Rhett Jones,"Headlines are blaring: “ Trump moves to ban bump stocks,” and gun enthusiasts are wasting no time stockpiling for the apocalypse. Slide Fire, the primary manufacturer of the accessory that effectively turns a semi-automatic weapon into a machine gun, has been hit with a flood of traffic and its website is currently down. Following the murder of 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida by a lone gunman carrying a high-powered assault rifle, the Trump administration has offered little comfort and few solutions for the country going forward. Over the weekend, he used the shooting victims as a human shield to create some sort of doubt about the FBI’s Russia investigation, and his staff characterized the tragedy as a “ reprieve ” from the bad publicity they’d faced over the last week. But as the student survivors have chosen to voice their support for gun control and criticize Trump’s lack of action, he’s apparently now feeling the pressure to at least give the illusion that he takes the situation seriously. On Tuesday, Trump claimed that he sent a memo to the Justice Department “directing the attorney general to propose regulations that ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns.” While there are a number of legal devices on the market that can make a semi-automatic weapon act as if it were fully-automatic, “ bump fire stocks ” are the most well known. These devices replace the stock on a gun and simulate automatic fire rates with a sliding mechanism that takes advantage of the gun’s natural recoil. The shooter keeps their finger in place and lets the motion of the gun do the pulling. You might recall that bump stocks were a big topic following the shooting in Las Vegas last October that left 58 people dead and 851 others injured. Even conservative lawmakers like Paul Ryan seemed open to a ban on bump stocks. The NRA called for the ATF to “review whether these devices comply with federal law.” They do comply with current US law, and—as the NRA acknowledged in its statement— the ATF has confirmed this twice before. Lawmakers and gun organizations successfully deflected and nothing has been done. Now we’re onto a new mass shooting, but this one didn’t involve bump stocks. But that old ban people wanted? Well, it’s suddenly back in the news. And the ceaselessly terrified crowd that hoards guns every time it hears the phrase “background check” is bombarding Slide Fire’s site to get its hands on the apparently soon-to-be-banned device. Considering that Slide Fire was just running a President’s Day promotion with the coupon code “MAGA,” it seems safe to say that this time the push for a ban will be as real as the last one.","Headlines are blaring: “ Trump moves to ban bump stocks,” and gun enthusiasts are wasting no time stockpiling for the apocalypse.

Rhett Jones,"Last spring, Facebook was confronted with a flood of scandals and new privacy regulations in Europe that reminded users that they could use a feature on the social network to download their data. Now, it seems a lot of people are using that tool. More people than Facebook can handle. According to Recode, a lot of users are complaining that when they try to use Facebooks data export tool to ask for their data, its taking an unusually long time for the company to process the request. Facebook did not immediately respond to Gizmodos request for more information on the issue, but a spokesperson told Recode: Over the past two weeks weve experienced a higher volume of Download Your Information requests than usual. This means it is taking longer to process the requests. We are working on it and appreciate peoples patience. Its interesting because downloading your data is a common action that users take when theyre preparing to delete their account. Sometimes users just want to get a look at everything Facebook has on them, other times theyre just making a backup, but often theyre essentially saying thanks for the memories. Its also interesting that this surge in data requests came right around the time that the New York Times published an in-depth look at all the ways that Facebook tried to avoid accountability for allowing its platform to be used to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Of course, theres always a Facebook scandal in the news so attributing this high volume of possible defectors to any one event could be a case of broken clock syndrome. Maybe this is a teaching moment for Facebook. Maybe the fact that its too slow to deliver users private information is indicative of a wider problem. Maybe people noticed all those times it was too slow to take action on a wide range of issues and theyre in a rush to delete their accounts.

Andrew Freedman,"From late 1861 through early 1862, a megaflood of historic proportions put large parts of the state of California underwater. The state's Central Valley, which is now one of the most productive agricultural ares in the country, became a vast inland lake. The city of Sacramento, which sits at the intersection of the American and Sacramento rivers, flooded, and remained under water for months. According to one account, one-quarter of the state's 800,000 cattle drowned in the flooding, and one-third of the state's property was destroyed. SEE ALSO: Parade of storms threatens to prolong California dam crisis The "" Great Flood"" of 1861 to 1862 is becoming more likely to reoccur as the climate warms, a new study finds. A study published Monday in Nature Climate Change found that despite an overall small change in the state's average yearly precipitation throughout the 20th century and in projections for the future, there may be huge and highly consequential changes in precipitation extremes within seasons, some of which have already begun to buffet the state. ""In practical terms, this means that what is today considered to be the '200-year flood '—an event that would overwhelm the vast majority of California’s flood defenses and water infrastructure —will become the '40-50 year flood' in the coming decades,"" lead author Daniel Swain, a climate researcher at the University of California at Los Angeles wrote in a blog post on Monday. Relative change (in percent) in extremely wet seasons (top), extremely dry seasons (middle), and year-to-year “whiplash” (bottom) by 2070-2100 in Southern California. Image: Swain et al. 2018. In an interview, Swain said he was surprised how sharply the risk of another ""Great Flood"" event increased just over the next 40 years, according to the numerous computer model simulations used in the study. The study found that between 2018 and 2060, California's major urban areas, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, ""are more likely than not"" to experience at least one extremely severe storm sequence that is similar in magnitude to the Great Flood. This is a three-fold increase in the risk of such a devastating event. Swain said this result “is pretty eyebrow-raising, certainly to me, it and may raise some eyebrows in the emergency planning community as well.” That flood was the result of an unrelenting series of storms that channeled a firehose of moisture off the Pacific Ocean, known as ""atmospheric river"" weather systems. The study makes for sobering reading, because it shows how sharply the risk of both extremely wet and dry seasons is increasing, along with what the authors term ""precipitation whiplash"" as the climate oscillates between these two extremes. Previous studies, Swain said, had focused on how annual average precipitation may change as the climate warms, but the relatively small amount of change at this timescale is effectively masking far more consequential trends at shorter timescales. “That seems to be masking very significant changes in the character of precipitation” and precipitation extremes, Swain said. The researchers utilized computer models to simulate precipitation trends in California during the remainder of the 21st century, studying results from simulations including the ""business as usual"" course of greenhouse gas emissions as well as control runs that did not include an increase in global warming pollutants. Increasing frequency of precipitation extremes in California. Image: Ucla/daniel swain. One of the more unique insights the study provides is the likelihood that there will be more frequent and drastic year-to-year precipitation shifts, much like the one that occurred between a record drought that lasted from about 2012 to 2016, and was followed by a record wet winter in parts of California during the winter of 2016 to 2017. The wet winter peaked with the failure of a spillway at the Oroville Dam in 2017, which forced about 250,000 people to evacuate. The study projects a 25 to 100 percent increase in such precipitation whiplash events during the coming years. As the study notes, California's water infrastructure is simply not prepared for such an escalation in extreme events. The study states: Few of the dams, levees and canals that currently protect millions living in California’s flood plains and facilitate the movement of water from Sierra Nevada watersheds to coastal cities have been tested by a deluge as severe as the extraordinary 1861–1862 storm sequence —a repeat of which would probably lead to considerable loss of life and economic damages approaching a trillion dollars. The study is consistent with other findings on how precipitation extremes are already changing as the climate warms, but it may actually underestimate the severity of these changes for California, said Kevin Trenberth, a senior researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. Trenberth was not involved in the new study. In general, a warmer world will provide storms with more moisture to work with, as the air's capacity to hold water vapor and the evaporation rates from the land and sea all increase. There's already observational evidence showing this is taking place. But this new study serves as a warning that coming decades will bring a wild ride from one extreme to the next, challenging even our sturdiest, most modern infrastructure.

MARK LANDLER and MAGGIE HABERMAN,"On Friday evening, Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, had dinner on the patio at Mar-a-Lago with their son, Barron, and Mrs. Trumps parents.
On Sunday, the president played golf with three political allies from South Carolina: Senator Lindsey Graham, former Representative Trey Gowdy, and Mick Mulvaney, another former representative now serving as the acting White House chief of staff.
Early in the day, Mr. Trump broke his Twitter silence, posting, in quick succession, Good Morning, Have a Great Day! and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! which could be read as either expressions of hope or growing confidence.

Catie Keck,"Following reports last month that Juul was in talks with Big Tobacco for a possible minority stake in its company, it seems that nicotine-fueled train is chugging right along.
Tobacco giant Altria, the maker of Marlboro, is reportedly looking to acquire a 35 percent stake in Juul Labs in a deal that would put the latters value at approximately $38 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter. The deal would give Juul a significant leg up in valuation over many of its startup contemporaries, the Journal noted, such as SpaceX and Airbnb:
The $12.8 billion cash injection could be announced as soon as this week, the people said. It would more than double what Juul was valued at just a few months ago, a sign of how quickly the startup has been growing and Altrias desire to find growth outside its shrinking cigarette business.
Also citing sources familiar with the matter, CNBC reported Wednesday that a $12.8 billion investment in Juul has already been approved by Altrias board of directors, and that the rumored deal could be announced as soon as Thursday morning.
Juul did not immediately return a request for comment about the rumored deal.
The report puts Juul in a tricky position, both because its come under fire for its well-documented popularity with teens and because accepting such a huge cash investment from Big Tobacco flies in the face of its quit-smoking branding.
At JUUL our mission is simple: eliminate cigarette smoking throughout the world one smoker at a time, Juul CEO Kevin Burns said a statement in May. 38 million Americans and one billion people around the world still smoke. Smoking remains the worlds number one source of preventable death.
Juul employees, some of whom appear to have been under the impression the companys stated ethos was more important than money, characterized the rumored Altria investment as a deal with the devil, Axios reported in November. The site also reported that the vape giant rebuffed the initial interest, but Altria remained persistent, regularly coming back with higher price points.
The dust doesnt appear to have settled on that front, with the Journal reporting this week that during an all-hands meeting, Juul Chief Executive Kevin Burns told staff that any deal would have to meet criteria including Juul maintaining full control of the company, employees having the option to cash out shares and the new investor taking actions to support Juuls mission, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Catie Keck,"Thanks to Facebooks incessantflood of wrongdoing making headlines nearly daily, any of us would be forgiven for forgetting about its rumored pivot to the blockchain. But the social media giants cryptocurrency is reportedly still on, even as it becomes increasingly clear that nothing is sacred online and the internet was maybe a mistake.
Citing sources familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported Thursday that Facebooks long-rumored cryptocurrency is in development and will allow users to exchange currency through its encrypted chat service WhatsApp. But dont expect it super soon:
The company is developing a stablecoina type of digital currency pegged to the U.S. dollarto minimize volatility, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal plans. Facebook is far from releasing the coin, because its still working on the strategy, including a plan for custody assets, or regular currencies that would be held to protect the value of the stablecoin, the people said.
The company is currently eyeing the remittances market in India, Bloomberg said. A spokesperson for Facebook told Bloomberg the company is exploring ways to leverage the power of blockchain technology, and that its new crypto outfit headed by PayPals former president David Marcus is exploring many different applications. Marcus announced in May onwhere elseFacebook that he would be leaving the companys Messenger team to join its blockchain division.
After nearly four unbelievably rewarding years leading Messenger, I have decided it was time for me to take on a new challenge, Marcus said at the time. Im setting up a small group to explore how to best leverage Blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch.
A potentially imminent cryptocurrency wasnt the only thing that had WhatsApp in the news this week. Citing a report from two Israeli NGOs, TechCrunch reported Thursday that WhatsApp is now looking at a serious encrypted child pornography problem on its platformone that its parent company Facebook has (surprise!) failed to get its hands around.
Facebooks Year From Hell continues, but its crypto ambitions appear to remain very much alive.

Rhett Jones,"For a moment, Mark Zuckerberg’s appearance before members of the European Parliament looked like it was going to be a very bad day for the Facebook CEO. Then he started answering questions, a flood of pablum spewed from his mouth, and everyone got angry. In the lead up to Zuckerberg’s first appearance before politicians in Europe since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, it was widely expected he’d face much tougher questions than he did in front of the US Congress. Not only are Europeans generally more protective of privacy and more open to breaking up monopolies, but the EU is implementing its long-awaited GDPR privacy protections at the end of the week. Here we have governmental authorities actually imposing regulations rather than just talking about it, and there are numerous indications that Facebook is already worming its way around them. Indeed, the leaders of European Parliament’s political groups had some hard-hitting questions for Zuckerberg. Some even followed up on questions raised by the Senate that have remained unanswered since April. Most questioners seemed to have a better grasp of the issues at hand than the majority of Congress. And the majority of the questions were quite specific, such as, “Will Facebook allow all users to completely opt-out of targeted advertising?” But the format that was chosen completely screwed up any chance of getting a straight answer from Zuckerberg. Rather than giving each Member of Parliament time to ask a question, get an answer, and followup, everyone asked their questions in the beginning. Each member threw out around six questions and Zuckerberg was given the chance to respond to the dozens of inquiries all at once. At first, this seemed to be getting under the CEOs skin. A huge number of issues were raised in rapid-fire succession and I wondered how he’d possibly address each concern. In the end, he didn’t. You can find some form of every Zuckerberg answer in his prepared remarks that were released before the hearing, and read out loud by him as the proceedings began. The 34-year-old exec has had months to sharpen his skills in delivering canned answers and he did on Tuesday; he did it without breaking a sweat. Rather than respond to individual questions, he looked at his notes and grouped them into themes. You’ve heard every reply before. They all boiled down to “Facebook needs to do better, and we are!” The session went over its allotted time and Zuckerberg announced that he would wrap up. He lamented that “there were a lot of specific questions that I didn’t get to specifically answer,” but he was pleased that he “was able to address the high-level areas” of everyone’s concerns. This didn’t sit well in the room. Various members began pointing out which questions went unanswered. Belgium’s Philippe Lamberts angrily pointed out that he phrased all six of his questions for yes or no answers and received no response. Lamberts laid it out plainly, “of course, you asked for this format for a reason.” It was unclear whose idea this odd format was before Lamberts scolded Zuckerberg. The most intense moment came right as Zuckerberg was wrapping up. Britain’s Syed Kamall reminded the CEO that he hadn’t addressed concerns about the “shadow profiles” Facebook builds around non-users data. Here’s Mark’s face: Zuckerberg tried to explain that Facebook has announced a clear history tool that will let users wipe all basic browsing history data. He explained that the company keeps tabs on non-users to make sure they aren’t scraping data and to monitor “how people use our service.” Kamall interrupted to ask how a non-Facebook user can stop their data from being transferred to Facebook’s system. “On the security side, we think it’s important to keep it to protect people in our community,” Zuckerberg responded curtly before turning to his counsel and changing the subject. In the end, no one seemed satisfied today but there was the appearance of a promise to follow-up on questions in writing. That promise came from Zuckerberg’s lawyer. The questions that went unanswered at his two sessions in Congress still linger, but we know that’s in part because Republican lawmakers haven’t followed up. Something tells me the Members of Parliament will. Below, you’ll find every question that Mark Zuckerberg was asked and failed to answer with specifics. We’ve paraphrased many of them for the sake of clarity. Germany’s Manfred Weber: Is Cambridge Analytica an isolated case? Can you guarantee that another scandal will not happen in three, six, nine months’ time? Did you personally make the decision in 2015 to not notify your users about the loss of their data to Cambridge Analytica? And why was the decision made not notify users? Is there an alternative to Facebook’s services in Europe today? Would you consider your company a monopoly? I think it’s time to discuss breaking up Facebook, can you convince me not to do so? Germany’s Udo Bullmann: Are you ready to completely comply with the new GDPR regulations within the next three days? Can you guarantee that Facebook is in line with the new rules? Can you guarantee that you will not collect and sell any data to third parties without proper consent especially if people want to leave Facebook? How quickly and under what conditions will users who leave Facebook’s data be fully removed? How can you explain that the number of false accounts on Facebook are on the rise? What are you doing to target specifically sophisticated fake accounts, especially when it comes to political manipulation? Are you ready to guarantee that upcoming European elections will be free of manipulation from foreign and hostile powers? How can you adapt your business model to make this guarantee? Britain’s Syed Kamall: Facebook has admitted to creating “shadow profiles” of people who surf the web but don’t have a Facebook account. Is avoiding the internet entirely the only way to prevent Facebook from collecting my data? What do you do with the data from non-Facebook users? Do you commercialize it? Is that morally acceptable? Is a non-Facebook user able to see the data that’s been collected? If not, why not? Belgium’s Guy Verhofstadt: Are you telling us the truth when you say that you will apply GDPR privacy standards? Because there are already indications that you’re violating the regulations. Article 82 of GDPR gives the ability of compensation for users who have their rights violated. Will you compensate European Facebook users when you violate GDPR and what will be the amount of compensation? Will you cooperate with European authorities, open your books, and allow us to see if Facebook is a monopoly? Would you be open to the idea of splitting off Messenger and WhatsApp, but keeping Instagram under the Facebook umbrella? How will you be remembered: As one the three big internet giants along with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates who have enriched our world, or as the genius who created a digital monster that is destroying our democracy and society? Belgium’s Philippe Lamberts: (All yes or no questions.) Will Facebook promise “systematic” and “public” transparency on all electoral campaigns? Will Facebook allow all users to completely opt-out of targeted advertising? Does Facebook provide media or curated content, or is it a neutral platform? Will Facebook voluntarily commit to publishing the list of its legal entities, the number of people they employ, their turnover, their profits or losses, and the taxes they pay or subsidies they receive, on a country by country basis? Will Facebook commit to paying taxes in the countries where it operates? Germany’s Gabriele Zimmer: You’ve stated that you support the GDPR privacy regulations and that you’ll apply it globally “in spirit.” What does that mean, exactly? Have you really moved the data of users that was stored on servers in Europe so that data would be outside the effective reach of European authorities? You’ve spent a lot of money on lobbying to delay the implementation of data protection regulations. Is this really in the interest of Facebook? How has the culture at Facebook changed in relation to discrimination against women, sexism, and violence against women since the days when it was a “hot or not” website? Britain’s Nigel Farage: Would you accept a social media bill of rights that guarantees the basic protection of freedom of speech? France’s Nicolas Bay: (Relating to fake news as well as personal expression.) Is the arbitrary censorship carried out by Facebook compatible with the fundamental values of our democracy? What legal basis do you have for deleting Facebook pages based on religious expression? Is the hunt for fake news becoming an excuse to hunt and silence freedoms of opinion and expression? Northern Ireland’s Diane Dodds: Can you explain to us what you are doing to work with third-party organizations to try to educate people on safety when using the Internet? Can you say you are comfortable that everyone’s children will be kept safe when using the default settings of your website? (In relationship to hate speech, terrorism, and offensive posts) Can you tell us how you define acceptable comments on the site? Italy’s Cristiana Muscardini: Does Facebook check third-party company’s compliance with its policies? How will you ensure that this really happens? Which specific things will Facebook do to prevent another scandal from happening? Britain’s Claude Moraes: Is Cambridge Analytica just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to mishandling users data? Why didn’t you inform users that their data had been compromised and give them a chance to take measures to further protect their data? Are you going to give users total access to their related marketing materials, as is required in GDPR? Germany’s Jan Philipp Albrecht: Will you assure that no Facebook user or future Facebook user will be required to give consent for the use of their personal data any further than is necessary for use of the service? You told the Senate that Facebook collects and keeps some data for security purposes. Can you promise that this data which you keep for security purposes is not used for other services or purposes like targeted advertisement? Can you promise that the data of European users will not be used or exchanged between the WhatsApp and Facebook services?

JULIE BOSMAN,"Florida had at least 31 incidents in the week after the shooting, more than any other state, the group said; Ohio followed, with 29; and Kentucky was third, with 24. Other states that experienced unusually high numbers of threats, false alarms or other incidents included California, Georgia, Mississippi, New York, Texas and Virginia. Dozens of teenagers have been arrested in connection with threats, often posted on Twitter or Snapchat. School administrators are scrutinizing students and their backpacks closely; the day after the Florida attack, a student at Clarksburg High School in Montgomery County, Md., was found to have a loaded Glock 9-millimeter handgun in his bag at school, the police said. A student at Pasco High School in Dade City, Fla., was arrested on Friday after a staff member conducting a routine sweep of vehicles in the parking lot discovered an AR-15 rifle and ammunition in the student’s truck. (The school district later said that the gun apparently had been meant for hog hunting.) The police say they are taking all reports seriously in light of the attack in Florida, where law enforcement authorities had been given warnings about the suspect who is accused of fatally shooting 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Scott Israel, the sheriff of Broward County, Fla., said on Thursday that his department had received 23 calls regarding the suspect, Nikolas Cruz, over several years, but may not have followed up on them sufficiently. On Jan. 5, a woman who knew Mr. Cruz called the F.B.I.’s tip hotline saying that she was worried he might resort to slipping “into a school and just shooting the place up.” In that call, made more than a month before the attack, she gave the authorities an unambiguous warning: “I know he’s going to explode.” Aaron Chapin, the chief of the Shorewood Hills Police in Wisconsin, said, “We have to treat every situation as if it’s real.” He added that police departments could become overwhelmed chasing false alarms or threats that turn out to be hoaxes. “If we’re constantly fielding non-actual threats, at some point there’s exhaustion,” he said. The number of threats to schools has risen after previous school shootings as well, including an attack in January in Benton, Ky., where two 15-year-old students were killed, according to Amy Klinger, a founder of the Educator’s School Safety Network and its director of programs. But the jump in threats has been especially pronounced since the Florida attack. “It’s reflective of the feeling in the country,” Ms. Klinger said. “You have to think about what someone who’s making a threat wants to get out of it. They want chaos, fear, for people to be upset.” That is exactly what occurred in school districts like the one in Orono, Minn., where a high school student wrote last week in an anonymous Twitter post: “Orono is not safe. Today at 12:00 p.m. I will shoot up the school myself.” The police were called, the school went into lockdown, and teachers and students barricaded doors with metal cabinets and desks. Parents rushed to the school and were kept outside, while they texted and called their children for several hours and waited for updates. The boy who the police say wrote the Twitter post was arrested and charged as a juvenile with making terroristic threats. Correy Farniok, the chief of police in Orono, said the authorities took the threat seriously because of its specificity. Other campuses have closed in recent days in response to vague social media postings. An Instagram post on the former N.F.L. player Jonathan Martin’s verified account, featuring an image of a shotgun, a reference to revenge and the name of his former high school in California, prompted the closing of the school, Harvard-Westlake. Across the nation, students and school employees said they were on alert. Two 16-year-olds in Arlington, Tex., were arrested after tipsters said they scrawled on a wall and wrote online that they were planning to attack their school. At El Camino High School in Whittier, Calif., a school employee said he heard a 17-year-old student telling a classmate, “I guarantee you the school will be shot up in three weeks.” The employee confronted the student and reported him to the police. When investigators from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department searched the boy’s home, they recovered two AR-15 rifles, two handguns and 90 high-capacity magazines. Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based research group, said the attack in Florida seemed to resonate more strongly than most previous attacks, heightening the sensitivity to additional possible threats, at least for now. “You’ve got the threats coming into schools and the bomb scares,” Mr. Wexler said. “But you also have the related part of citizens being more attentive to threats. People are probably recording more situations, and that’s creating a higher sensitivity to the whole issue.” Continue reading the main story","Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department officers at El Camino High School in Whittier, Calif., where a school safety officer reported hearing a student make a menacing prediction.",2018-02-25T20:46:33Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","After Parkland, a Flood of New Threats, Tips and False Alarms",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/us/threats-schools-shootings.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/24/opinion/00threats2/00threats2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,flood,0
Andrew Liszewski,"It doesn’t matter what ludicrous conspiracy theory is stopping you from storing your money in a bank, you’ll be happy to know that the US Department of the Treasury has an entire division dedicated to the task of trying to rebuild and recover currency should your cash-stuffed mattress get destroyed in a fire or flood. CNN’s Great Big Story paid a visit to the US Department of the Treasury’s Mutilated Currency Division, whose sole purpose is to evaluate currency that’s been damaged or destroyed to an extent that it can’t be used as legal tender. Most of the 23,000-plus cases the technicians deal with every year come from citizens who’ve lost money in a natural disaster, like floods or wildfires, but at times it’s just someone who forgot they left a stack of Benjamins in the oven for ‘safe’ keeping. The service is completely free, and there’s no surcharge on the roughly $40 million in reimbursements the Treasury issues to citizens every year. What is required, however, is at least 51 percent of a bill being still intact, which helps ensure the Mutilated Currency Division doesn’t issue two refunds for a single bank note, which could lead to potential scams. So what scenario provides the biggest challenge to the technicians who are often tasked with sifting through mountains of shredded paper? It’s not currency that’s been burned, but stacks of cash that were thoroughly soaked and then left to dry, which occasionally solidify into rock-solid bricks that have to be painstakingly peeled into individual bills.

At the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, GAC is seeking to up its profile in advance of its 2019 US launch with — what else? — an eye-catching, futuristic, mostly irrational electric car concept. The Enverge certainly attracted a lot of attention here in Detroit with its gull-wing doors, “floating” digital dash-screen, and alleged range of 370 miles on a single charge. That would place it over the Tesla Model 3, which is, of course, a real car and not a concept like this. GAC also unveiled the GA4 midsize sedan that will go on sale in China later this month.

The headlights slide out and detach to be used as flood lights. (GAC calls it the “G light,” naturally.) The two-door SUV also has virtual reality screens embedded in the side windows. The 71kWh battery can be recharged wirelessly; 10 minutes is enough for 240 miles of range. And now Michigan Gov.

Tom McKay,"The New York Attorney Generals office has subpoenaed more than a dozen telecommunications trade groups, lobbying contractors and Washington advocacy organizations, the New York Times reported on Tuesday, seeking to determine whether they were behind the flood of fake public comments submitted before the Federal Communication Commissions decision to revoke net neutrality rules last year. Barbara Underwood, who became the states attorney general earlier this year after predecessor Eric Schneiderman resigned in disgrace, wants to see whether industry groups were behind a huge effort to pollute the 22 million letters filed to the FCCs electronic comment filing system with fraudlent submissions. Many of the comments were filed using temporary or duplicate email addresses, and millions were repeated verbatim using industry-friendly scripts. A recent study from Stanford University researchers found that just 800,000 of the messages were unique, and of those 99.7 percent opposed the FCCs decision. The Times wrote that Underwoods team has already determined that millions of the mass-submitted comments used real individuals names, amounting to identity fraud, and that there appears to be a clear link to a number of firms involved in the net neutrality debate: Most strikingly, many comments on net neutrality were falsely submitted under the names of real people, in what amounted to mass acts of virtual identity theft. Some comments used the name of dead people. Ms. Underwoods investigators have estimated that almost half of all of the comments more than nine million used stolen identities. The investigation has traced comments submitted through bulk uploads and through an F.C.C. service that allows advocates to solicit public comments on their own websites and then transmit them to the agency. Investigators have identified four buckets of apparently fraudulent comments, each of which appears to have been associated with a particular network of advocacy organizations, trade groups and consultants, including at least some on both sides of the debate. Sources told the Times that three companies were named in the subpoenas, including the industry-funded, anti-net neutrality coalition Broadband for America, former Christian Coalition director Ralph Reeds Century Strategies, and conservative messaging firm Media Bridge. (As the paper noted, one of Media Bridges press releases boasted that its client American Commitment had submitted nearly 800,000 comments on the issue.) Century Strategies told the Times the attorney generals investigation should be focused on pro-net neutrality groups. However, the Wall Street Journal reported that advocates for the net neutrality rules were also named, including Fight for the Future and Free Press. The Journal also wrote that Media Bridge managing partner Shane Cory, the former director of the right-wing Project Veritas project, said his group had submitted what he thought were real comments but that bad actors may have slipped in. Cory put the blame on the FCCs commenting system, which he said did not have tools to safeguard against abuse: He said part of the blame lies with government agencies that put no limits on how comments are posted, not requiring verification of identity or commonly used tools to hinder bots. Mr. Pai has acknowledged the problem and recently told Congress the FCC was planning to improve its comments system to ward off fakery. Unfortunately, with no limits, it is the Wild West out there, Mr. Cory said. The corruption of the public process will happenespecially when you have billion-dollar questions at stake. A Free Press spokesperson told the Journal, We are responding to their requests and welcome this inquiry. As BuzzFeed News noted, FCC chair and Donald Trump appointee Ajit Pai has previously cited the number of comments filed supporting the decision to revoke the rules (despite some opinion polls showing it was wildly unpopular ). Thats despite the fact that allegations of massive spamming in the comment process were widespread months before the FCCs board of commissioners ever voted on the issue. The FCC also spread lies about a non-existent cyberattack on the commenting system following a May 7, 2017 segment on HBO host John Olivers Last Week Tonight asking viewers to submit comments, leading to accusations it was deliberately downplaying public comments opposed to the repeal. The F.C.C.s public comment process was corrupted by millions of fake comments, Underwood told the Times in a statement. The law protects New Yorkers from deception and the misuse of their identities. My office will get to the bottom of what happened and hold accountable those responsible for using stolen identities to distort public opinion on net neutrality.

Adam Rosenberg,"Paris is flooding. Although heavy rains that inundated the city throughout the week stopped on Friday, continued flooding from the Seine — the river that cuts through France's capital — is still causing concern. SEE ALSO: The Doomsday Clock is a gimmick, but why it just moved closer to midnight is deadly serious By Wednesday, the water level had hit 16 feet, more than double the Seine's average 6.5-foot depth. While French meteorological service Meteo France no longer expects floodwaters to cross the 20-foot mark at their deepest, as previously predicted, it'll be close. Paris police told CNN that water in parts of the Seine will reach 5.95 meters, or just shy of 20 feet, during the evening hours of Sunday night into Monday morning. It's not quite at the level of a 1910 flood that saw the Seine's deepest point rise to almost 28 feet. It's also short of a June 2016 flood, which saw the Seine's water level hit 21 feet. The second incident is obviously more alarming, since this latest flood is the second such incident in a two-year period. ""Two floodings of the Seine river in less than two years — we have to change, we have to change the way we build this city,"" Colombe Brossel, deputy mayor of Paris, told CNN. ""We have to understand that climatic change is not a word, it's a reality.""

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The East Coast is bracing for another nor’easter this week, with the National Weather Service in Boston warning that the city and nearby coastlines could see three to four feet of storm surge flooding. This, in the same winter that the bomb cyclone turned many of Boston’s streets into frozen soup. Parts of the Northeast are getting hammered by frigid temperatures right now, just 24 hours after a … Read more Read Is it the latest sign of the end times? Not really. Winter storms like nor’easters, it turns out, routinely deliver worse flooding than hurricanes to this part of the world, a reality confirmed by a study published earlier this year, the Washington Post ’s Capital Weather Gang noted today. Why’s that, you might ask? The reason has everything to do with the difference in how nor’easters and hurricanes form—a difference that allows nor’easters to maintain hurricane-like central pressures and rip-roaring winds at latitudes where their tropical cousins typically fizzle out. “By the time a hurricane gets off New England, it’s over very cold water and starts to decay,” Jeff Masters, meteorologist and blogger with Weather Underground, told Earther. Hurricanes get their strength from oceanic heat, forming in warm equatorial regions where there’s plenty of evaporating water to condense into storm clouds. Nor’easters get their energy from an entirely different source: as Masters put it, the contrast in density between warm, moist air from the ocean and cold, dry air from the land. When these contrasting air masses collide, the cold dry air sinks, and releases energy. The technical term for the atmospheric set-up that drives the formation of a nor’easter is ‘ baroclinic instability.’ Unlike hurricanes, which form and thrive in tropical waters and feature a warm core, nor’easters form at mid-latitudes, and their cores are cold. Because they don’t rely on ocean heat for their energy, they can maintain hurricane-like central pressures and wind strengths at latitudes where hurricanes struggle to. This can lead to some very bad flooding. “Occasionally you get a strong hurricane up there [in the northeast], but they’re pretty uncommon,” Masters said. “It’s the big ‘nor’easters that dominate the record storm surge,” for the region. Models are calling for this week’s nor’easter to deliver damaging winds, heavy rain, and snowfall to the Eastern seaboard beginning on Thursday night, although the storm’s exact track remains uncertain, the Weather Channel reports. A coastal flood watch is in effect from Friday morning through Saturday afternoon for eastern Massachusetts, with the NWS warning that “moderate to major” coastal flooding that could inundate roads and basements and tear up beaches. Coastal flood watches are also in effect for much of Delaware and New Jersey, and parts of Queens and Long Island. Exacerbating the flood risk is the fact that this storm is due to coincide with the astronomical high tide—the full moon rises tomorrow. When the Sun, Moon and Earth are perfectly aligned, the gravitational tug-of-war causes the most extreme tides of the month. The coastal flood risk is expected to persist over three high tide cycles, thanks to the long-lived nature of this storm. “All three tides are expected to be in the top ten on record [for Boston], maybe in the top five,” Masters said said. Lastly, just in case you thought we were going to get through an entire weather post without mentioning climate change, you should know that for nor’easters as for hurricanes, sea level rise is adding inches to storm surge and making the coastal flooding threat worse. A recent study in Nature found that sea levels along the northern half of the Eastern seaboard have risen about an inch per decade since 1980, three to four times the global average rate. “That makes it a lot easier to get a record-high water level causing substantial damage,” Masters said.

Historic floods have deluged vast swaths of the Midwest even flooding a third of the U.S. Air Force base that houses the nation's critical U.S. Strategic Command. But the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says the floods aren't nearly over. The agency's 2019 Spring Outlook found that nearly two-thirds of the lower 48 states are at risk for flooding in the coming months. 
""The extensive flooding weve seen in the past two weeks will continue through May and become more dire and may be exacerbated in the coming weeks as the water flows downstream, Ed Clark, director of NOAAs National Water Center, said in a statement. 
This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities.

Regions in Nebraska, Minnesota, and Iowa have already seen historic flooding, with some major rivers particularly the Missouri River absolutely smashing previous flood records by some four feet. What's more, many of the nation's well-engineered levees have failed to contain the record floodwaters. 
The dramatic flooding which is already forecast to cost well over $1 billion in damages is consistent with a big uptick in heavy rains over the last half-century: Between 1958 and 2012, the amount of rain in the heaviest rainfall events in the Midwest shot up by a whopping 37 percent, according to U.S. government scientists. 
SEE ALSO: This scientist keeps winning money from people who bet against climate change
This is in large part due to Earth's changing atmosphere. Specifically, the climate has warmed by 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit), and because of simple physics, the warmer air is able to hold more water vapor. Specifically, for every 1 degree Celsius of warming, the air can hold seven percent more water. 
After the rapid melting of winter snow and deluges of rain in mid-March, NOAA expects the flood risk to continue as more rain falls and then travels down already overloaded rivers.
Extreme flooding along the Missouri River.

""As this excess water flows downstream through the river basins, the flood threat will become worse and geographically more widespread,"" NOAA concluded.
The agency forecasts flood risk by accounting for how much snow is left to melt, areas experiencing drought, how saturated soils are with moisture, the depth of frozen soil, the height of rivers, and expected precipitation. As the floodmap shows, regions near the Mississipi river and vast swaths of land in the Great Plains and Midwest are at risk for major and moderate flooding.

Steve O'Hear,"Insurance tech features on an increasing number of VC decks lately. On the surface at least, the insurance industry presents an almost perfect storm for disruption. On the one hand it is a legacy industry in drastic need of digitisation and yet paralysed by innovator’s dilemma. On the other hand new technology, such as ubiquitous connectivity, new kinds of sensors and machine learning, means that the very essence of insurance (i.e. how to assess risk) will potentially look very different in just a few years. However, due to the regulatory overhead required to get a new insurance tech startup off the ground and the fact that it usually requires working with incumbent re-insurers or underwriters, progress has been slow. Or so says Stephen Brittain, co-founder and director of InsurTech Gateway, a newly-launched accelerator for ‘insurtech’ startups that is backed by Hambro Perks and Robert Lumley. In what appears to be a first, at least in the U.K., InsurTech Gateway is also an FCA-authorised insurance broker in its own right, and has arranged underwriting capability from Aspen, one of the world’s biggest insurance and reinsurance specialists. This, Brittain reckons, should dramatically cut down the time it takes for startups backed by the accelerator to launch new and innovative products. “[Right now] the wrong people are getting through because the barriers are so high,” he says. “Rather than spending 18 months being bounced around the insurance market and coming out the other end as an expert in form filling and startup tourism, we want to partner with entrepreneurs and help them get to market in a matter of weeks”. In addition to helping new insurtech startups achieve delegated regulatory approval and receive underwriting support, InsurTech Gateway invests on bespoke terms, matched to companies at various stages. Think pre-seed to seed funding in range. It also provides, desk space, “full compliance, back-end technical platforms and GDPR procedures,” and has ready-made partnership agreements with key capital providers, distributors and infrastructure, such as IT and payment platforms. Once all of this is in place, argues Brittain, it becomes easier for more entrepreneurial and creative people to get into insurtech: people who aren’t encumbered by legacy thinking and don’t necessarily come from the insurance industry. “That’s what this is about, we’re lowering the barrier to entry so that genius can come in,” he says. Meanwhile, I’m told that three portfolio companies are already in place: InMyBag, which offers specialist insurance and data recovery for freelancers; By Miles, a telematics-based car insurance for low mileage drivers; and Floodflash, an IoT flood sensor that enables instant settlement flood insurance. Another five more insurtech startups are expected to join InsurTech Gateway by the end of 2018.","In what appears to be a first, at least in the U.K., InsurTech Gateway is an FCA-authorised insurance broker in its own right.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"The growing reality for social networks is that they will perpetually be exploited in new and terrorizing ways and there may not be a sweeping solution for bad actors. The hope is that solutions outpace abusers. This race was on disturbing display over the weekend as a horrific video of a gunman opening fire on worshippers in two mosques in New Zealand went viral, and the worlds leading video-sharing service scrambled to scrub the deluge of uploads.
The alleged shooter is now in custody, at least 50 people are dead, and many others are hospitalized with injuries. But another key facet of the massacre was spreading a hate-filled 74-page manifesto and first-person footage of the shootings that was captured on a body cam worn by the perpetrator. The disturbing footage immediately began to spread and YouTube removed every instance it could find. Traditionally, viral content spreads by people sharing it from its original source and if its caught early enough, cutting off the head of the snake can do a lot to slow it down. But in this case, trolls and ideological allies of the gunman immediately began pounding YouTubes servers with fresh uploads of the graphic footage.
Every time a tragedy like this happens we learn something new, and in this case it was the unprecedented volume of videos, Neal Mohan, YouTubes chief product officer, told The Washington Post. Stating the obvious, Mohan said they would have liked to get a handle on this earlier.
Mohan also told the Washington Post that the Christchurch attack, was a tragedy that was almost designed for the purpose of going viral, adding that YouTube has made progress, but that doesnt mean we dont have a lot of work ahead of us, and this incident has shown that, especially in the case of more viral videos like this one, theres more work to be done.
The video uploaded over the weekend wasnt unique in its footage of a mass shooting, but in its point-of-view: the gunman livestreamed the video from a body cam. And Mohan reportedly said that the video was shared as swiftly as one upload per second in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. YouTube hasnt released exact figures on how many uploads there were of the attack, but the numbers that have been made available on other social platforms are staggeringFacebook said that it took down 1.5 million videos of the attack within the first 24 hours after the shooting.
Mohan is correct in his assertion that YouTube is the model platform for such gruesome virality. YouTube is the most powerful video-sharing platform in the world. It also has a very credible reputation for suggesting videos centered around conspiracy theories and white supremacy. For Nazis, what better way to spread their ideologies and incite hateful violence than to tap into this easily exploited and Herculean platform?
YouTube does have certain systems in place to flag and remove hateful and violent content. It can use a hashing system to identify videos that match the original video, automatically detecting and deleting any copies that are subsequently uploaded. Unfortunately, this system isnt effective when it comes to all types of subtle manipulations to the video. As the Washington Post noted, users that uploaded videos of the Christchurch shooting made some tweaks to the original video, including watermarks, logos, size alterations, and animations.
Many violent extremist groups, like ISIS, use common footage and imagery, YouTube wrote in a Twitter thread on Monday. These can also be signals for our detection systems that help us to remove content at scale. The company added: However, every breaking news event is unique and there are no reference files provided in advance. And theres also a constant flow of new footage, and countless variations of known footage uploaded in the hours immediately after an event. These factors present a significant challenge, but we are continually working to improve our detection systems.
When we reached out to YouTube with some clarifying questions about how its filtering system works, a spokesperson simply redirected us to this Twitter thread that gives the broad outlines of its functionality.
YouTube here is partly referencing its Content ID system, which lets copyright owners preemptively submit files to the platform which will then be cross-referenced with any videos uploaded to the service. These creators can then keep track of when a video is uploaded that matches their content. While this applies to more innocuous material, like music and film, it poses the question of whether this same system can apply to videos like the Christchurch shooting. But the footage of the mass shooting flooding the social networks over the weekend is unlike existing media in YouTubes databases, and so its system is unable to preemptively flag it. And, as previously mentioned, was uploaded with different variations, gaming it and evading the system in place. This, combined with the staggering volume of uploads, created a kind of virality that is unprecedented.
Like any piece of machine learning software, our matching technology continues to get better, but frankly, its a work in progress, Mohan told the Washington Post.
Because the system in its current state is unable to detect certain variations, and because even thousands of humans are not enough to urgently eyeball and review flagged videos, Mohan chose to allow the final decision to be made by the machines. As weve seen with other failures for AI-driven moderation, benign videos are often accidentally removed. That was likely the case here, but ultimately the team chose expediency over precision. Creators whose content was unfairly removed can file an appeal.
The issue plaguing YouTube is that trolls and extremists have the incentive to hone their efforts on its platformtheir content will almost certainly get the most views and subsequently the most shares. And YouTube is infamous for recommending hate-related content, meaning it is exacerbating the very problem it is trying to eradicate. The content is coming from inside the house. In the wake of a tragedy caught on film, if extremists push that content hard onto the one leading platform (while also slightly manipulating some of the versions) its inevitable that some are going to slip through the systems cracks and find their way into recommendations.
As YouTube mentioned in its Twitter thread on Monday, it is always working on ways to better detect violating content. And as we previously mentioned, our only saving grace is that those building the platforms can remain at least one step ahead of those trying to abuse them. Its an unsettling reality and one that may have social networks reckoning with their role as catalysts for this new disturbing virality.
[The Washington Post]",The growing reality for social networks is that they will perpetually be exploited in new and terrorizing ways and there may not be a sweeping solution for bad actors. The hope is that solutions outpace abusers.

MITCH SMITH,"CHICAGO Severe floods closed highways, caused evacuations and forced a series of tense water rescues across the Midwest on Thursday as melting snow and heavy rain created dangerous conditions.
If you choose to stay where youre at, youre on your own, said Shane Weidner, the public safety director in Norfolk, Neb., where a levee system was nearing capacity and police officers had told about one-third of the citys 24,000 residents to evacuate.
Mr. Weidner said one person was reported missing in Norfolk and a family of 10 was stranded in a home surrounded by rising waters. City officials were asking residents with airboats for their help in rescuing the family. Elsewhere in Nebraska, state officials said at least one person had died. Search and rescue teams were trying to reach others who were trapped.
Across parts of Nebraska, South Dakota and Iowa, rising water was threatening homes and covering farm fields, and the authorities warned people to stay off swamped roadways. In Minnehaha County, S.D., which includes Sioux Falls, the sheriffs office posted a photo of a car washed off the road. In Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, near Sioux City, residents were asked to conserve their water use because all the draining water is inundating our sewer system. And in Nebraska, the State Patrol said at least one rural bridge appeared to have been destroyed and that large ice blocks had washed down from rivers and covered highways.","Martin Thompson cleared snow from a sidewalk on Wednesday in Casper, Wyo.

Nicole Gallucci,"Venice is currently experiencing the worst flooding it's seen in a decade, but one restaurant refuses to let the knee-high water impact business. As the city begins to recover from the intense storms that recently hit Italy, killing several people, the restaurant in Venice has its doors open and is serving anyone daring enough to venture out into the flood. A video, shared to Simone Sciascia 's Facebook page on Monday, shows staff carrying pizzas to serve customers like it's just another day at work. Servers are seen wading through the flooded restaurant where diners are sitting at tables enjoying their food. And nearly everyone is wearing tall protective rain boots of some sort. Now that's dedication. The end of the video offers a look at the streets of Venice, which still remain significantly flooded. Nearly 80 percent of the city was flooded after water levels rose an estimated 160 centimeters (5 feet, 3 inches) above sea level during the storms. And along with streets and local businesses, noteworthy areas and historical landmarks like St. Mark's Square, the Rialto bridge, the Piazza San Marco, and more, have been impacted by the floods. Though flooding is common throughout Italy especially as winter nears and winds carry water from the Adriatic Sea into the Venetian Lagoon this level of water is the worst Venice has experienced since 1979. SEE ALSO: Dramatic photos show the worst flood to hit Venice in 10 years As noted in an earlier article, Italy now experiences major flooding every four years or so, which means people have started taking necessary precautions to deal with the water ahead of time. These include barriers placed in front of houses, and raised walkways and additional drains added around the city. As Venice's 5-foot tide continues to drop throughout the course of the week, we're sure more and more restaurants will start re-opening their doors. But for now, the video shows quite a rare and remarkable sight.","Venice is currently experiencing the worst flooding it's seen in a decade, but one restaurant refuses to let the knee-high water impact business.

Cathleen O'Grady,"Enlarge / Riverfront Ave. in Calgary during the Alberta floods 2013. reader comments 0 In June 2013, Keith Musselman was living in the Canadian Rockies when the nearby Bow River flooded. “We were in a valley, so we were stuck for about five days,” Musselman told Ars. “The community was devastated.” The flood was one of the costliest and most devastating natural disasters in Canada’s history, with five people killed, more than 100,000 evacuated, and extreme property damage. Heavy rainfall falling on late snow in the mountains had overwhelmed rivers and reservoirs, and Musselman, a hydrologist, realized that this kind of rain-on-snow flooding wasn’t properly understood. “Forecasters have a good handle on what happens when rain falls,” he says. “But when that rain falls in mountains where there’s deep snow, we don’t have a good handle on what the flood volume will be.” Musselman and a group of colleagues used historical data to sketch out what the rain-on-snow flood risk looks like across western North America—and how that risk is likely to change in a warming world. Their paper, published in Nature Climate Change this week, finds that some areas will see reduced risk thanks to declining snowfall. But at higher elevations, there’ll still be snow, and the increasing amount of rain falling on that snow will have implications for flood risks. The perfect storm At drier and higher elevations, rainfall on snow isn’t so much of a problem, either because there’s not enough rain or not enough snow for it to matter. But when the conditions are just right, heavy rainfall can combine with snowmelt to produce floods that are more catastrophic than the rainfall would cause. When Musselman moved to work at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), his colleagues there had also identified this as something they wanted to study—and “they had a great dataset,” Musselman says. “We used that to understand how rare these large flood events are.” Work has been done on this before, but this team was able to use more fine-grained data to build up a detailed picture. They built a simulated world of weather systems that would produce rain-on-snow floods in the same places and with the same frequency as the 13 years of historical data they used. Once they were sure that the simulation matched the historical patterns of snowpack, snowmelt, and other factors, they used it to build up a picture of how those kinds of events might change over the next 13 years. The model showed shifting patterns: areas that currently have a high risk of flooding will see a decrease, as precipitation will occur more frequently as rain than snow. But at higher elevations, where once there would have been snow falling on a snowpack, rising temperatures will now cause rain to fall on that snow. The Sierra Nevada, Canadian Rockies, and Colorado River headwaters saw the highest increases in risk, with floods twice as likely in some cases. Philip Mote, who studies climate-related snowpack change and wasn’t involved in this work, points out that the starting rate of floods might not be particularly high, so a doubling of the risk might not necessarily mean a region suddenly awash with floods. The shifting landscape will nonetheless demand a rethink of flood management—but for that, more data will be needed. Computational limits “Climate scientists like to look at [periods of] 30 years,” Musselman notes. But his team had to limit the time window because they were running into the limits of computational power available to them. “We’re up against this wall of computational demand to simulate all the physics that are involved,” he explains. The two 13-year simulations took up a year of NCAR supercomputer time, so they were also only able to look at one climate change scenario—the average of all 19 different climate models in a “business-as-usual” emissions scenario. Ideally, it would also be good to know what the projections look like under additional climate scenarios. The 13-year simulation is “OK if it’s treated carefully,” says Prof. Mote. “That’s a constraint if you’re running a 4km resolution over the whole of the US—that’s a whole heck of a lot of computing and data.” It does make things tricky for regions that have rare events that might be represented only a few times across 13 years, he explains: “The exact way those events change is probably less robust than if they had a 30- or 50-year simulation.” Opening the floodgates In anticipation of winter and spring rainfall, reservoir managers in many regions release large amounts of water in the fall, creating space to buffer the incoming deluge. “Reservoir managers follow tight rules,” Musselman explains. “They have guidelines based on historical data. The challenge is, as the climate changes, our rules and regulations aren’t adjusting accordingly.” The simulation suggests that the flood risk isn’t the only thing set to change—seasonal timing will change, too. In some regions, the highest risk is likely to shift from spring to winter; in others, from winter to spring. This means new rules both for providing flood buffers and for ensuring enough refill during dry periods. The current rules are “heavily focused on dates,” says Charles Luce, a hydrologist who studies water management. Changing the rules is complicated because of all the different people involved, but there’s already work underway to figure out how to update the rules in the face of climate change, he says. That work will likely be “looking to this paper for guidance.” The flood protection infrastructure itself also needs a look, says civil engineer Farshid Vahedifard : “Levees and dams need to be re-analyzed to see if they can safely withstand and handle this new pattern of flooding.” This is particularly crucial, he adds, since “most of these dams and levees are old, and a good percentage of them are currently operating under marginal conditions.” There’s still work to be done to turn this risk projection into useful information, though. “It’s the first step in a series of studies that aim to better understand the hydrology,” says Musselman. Future work will need to look at how this translates to a very local scale, including how factors like soil saturation and vegetation affect the risk of runoff becoming a flood. And ongoing observation of the real situation on the ground will also be essential. Hydrologist Wouter Berghuijs agrees with Mote that the simulations match what intuition would predict, but it’s “good to see it confirmed in harder numbers,” says Berghuijs. “These models are not perfect, and there are uncertainties associated with them,” he adds “That does not mean they don’t provide useful insights.” Nature Climate Change, 2018.

The newly formed group of autonomous tech industry leaders aims to develop products for self-driving cars that support multi-gig ethernet connectivity, allowing those vehicles to better handle the data overload from all the sensors, cameras, RADAR, LIDAR, ultrasound, and other equipment that allow them to operate on the road without human drivers. SEE ALSO: Inside the technology that helps self-driving cars ""see"" For a self-driving car, a faster network like the one proposed by the NAV Alliance can take in all the inputs from the road and make a faster, better decision if the vehicle should need to brake, switch lanes, or slow down.

Dell Cameron,"Between 2013 and 2015, the FCC reportedly spent close to $3 million overhauling its comment system. But after being flooded with millions of fake comments during a docket to overturn net neutrality last summer, the agency is now planning another total makeover. In a letter to two U.S. senators, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai proposed a plan “to rebuild and re-engineer” the commission’s Electronic Comment Filing System, or ECFS, to provide “safeguards against abusive conduct.” That sounds like a great idea—but one has to wonder what the FCC was doing over the past few years if not building a comment system engineered to protect against misuse. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report Pai’s letter on Wednesday. After being selected to lead the agency by President Donald Trump, Pai focused on stripping his own agency of its authority to regulate internet service providers. When the agency prepared to announce new rules repealing net neutrality regulations nationwide, the FCC made the conscious decision not to put any effort into weeding out fake comments. Any kind of comment filtering, it was believed, would lead to accusations of censorship, even if it was only a small number of genuine comments that got deleted. This was more or less an admission, albeit a private one, that the FCC has no reliable mechanism for determining whether comments are real or fake. In a bipartisan letter on Monday, two US senators called on the FCC to investigate the identity… Read more Read Its decision, while perhaps meant to protect the FCC’s reputation and the integrity of the commenting process—which, frankly, only ever grabs the public’s attention broadly when the issue of net neutrality is involved—backfired spectacularly. By last fall, the FCC was being widely accused by state attorneys general of abetting identity theft after it refused to cooperate with federal law enforcement officials who sought to examine the fake comments’ origin. “It is troubling that some bad actors submitted comments using false names,” Pai said in the letter to the two lawmakers, Senators Pat Toomey and Jeff Merkley. “Indeed, like you, comments were submitted in my name and my wife’s name that reflect viewpoints we do not hold.” But one suggestion offered by Pai seems less geared toward authenticating commenters’ identities: a Captcha system to distinguish between humans and bots. That wouldn’t stop someone from submitting comments using someone else’s identity and, if enforced across the entire system, would prevent the use of bulk submissions. While the FCC only reviews a handful of the millions of comments it receives—typically those submitted by experts and academics who submit multi-page legal opinions—in recent years, activists have used submission tallies as a means to demonstrate widespread public interest in a particular rulemaking agenda. Often, comments are collected en masse by groups on both sides of the aisle, from pro-net neutrality Fight for the Future to the conservative FreedomWorks. The FCC’s IT staff generally works behind the scenes to accommodate such groups, including for-profit ones such as CQ-RollCall, whose confidential clients pay for advocacy-based services. The system-wide enforcement of a Captcha system would likely put an end to bulk submissions. This may reduce the influx of fake comments, but it would also significantly reduce the number of comments overall. The FCC has remained largely silent on the issue, repeatedly dodging questions from Democratic lawmakers. The agency has also been called before few oversight hearings over the past two years and is one of the least transparent in recent history. Likely the only reason Pai responded to the letter at all is because one of the authors, Sen. Toomey, happens to be a Republican.","Between 2013 and 2015, the FCC reportedly spent close to $3 million overhauling its comment system.

Andrew Freedman,"A devastating flash flood event in mid-April caused widespread damage on the lush Hawaiian island of Kauai. Now comes word that during the 24-hour period between April 14 and 15, a staggering 49.69 inches of rain fell at a rain gauge about 1 mile west of Hanalei. If this amount is verified by the National Climatic Extremes Committee, which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and serves as a sort of Guinness Book of World Records for weather and climate, it would be the heaviest 24-hour rainfall total ever recorded in the U.S. SEE ALSO: The National Weather Service had to add a new color to its maps to show Harvey's rainfall The current record is 43 inches, set on July 25-26, 1979, in Alvin, Texas. It would also crush the state record of 38 inches, which was also set in Kauai, back in 1956. The committee members will review the rain gage to determine if it was functioning properly at the time of the rainstorm. This particular gage is operated by a nonprofit organization called the WAIPA Foundation. It's possible that the committee will conclude that the amount of rain was actually less than recorded, or conversely, that it underestimated the rainfall total. It's not surprising that a national rainfall record would come from Kauai, since it's rugged terrain contains some of the wettest landscapes on Earth. Mt. Waialeale, for example, receives about 460 inches of rain per year, and is the wettest place in the country. The April rains, though, were unusually intense and widespread, causing flash flooding throughout the island and forcing thousands to evacuate. Homes, businesses, and infrastructure was damaged or destroyed in a disaster that few in the continental U.S. heard of. This rainstorm is in keeping with climate change trends, as global warming is already making extreme precipitation events both more frequent and intense. No studies have yet been done on this particular event to see how climate change affected it, but other research has shown that global warming has made heavy rainfall events, including Hurricane Harvey, which was the most extreme rainstorm on record in the U.S., much more likely.","A devastating flash flood event in mid-April caused widespread damage on the lush Hawaiian island of Kauai.

City officials create lifted walkways in anticipation of the high flooding. Image: Getty Images Floods like this used to be f ew and far between. But now major floods happen around once every four years, and scientists think that human-caused climate change is at least in part to blame. Plus, it doesn't help that the petrified logs holding the city afloat are sinking. Venice has reportedly sunk 6 feet since the city's medieval heyday. In order to avert continuous catastrophe, back in 2003 the Italian government began working on Project Mose Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico to help curb the effects of sea level rise on Venice. The three arrows point to the locations of the three barriers within the Mose project. Image: google maps The idea was to create three barriers to blockade the flow of water from the Adriatic into the Venetian Lagoon. The barriers would shut when scientists expected the highest tides. So far, two of the three have been completed, with a third one approaching completion in the coming years. The project should be finished within the next two or three years. In the meantime, Venice has other mechanisms in place to defend against the floods. Climate change, sinking stilts, and strong winds are putting Venice in significant danger of facing worse and worse floods. Image: Getty Images Drains are in every city square. Lifted walkways are put in place. Homes and storefronts, especially those facing the lagoon, have 1 foot barriers on their front doors, or their doors are lifted off the ground entirely. The 5 foot tide is expected to lessen throughout the rest of the week so hopefully Venice will have time to recover before it has to sound the flood alarms again.","Deadly storms across Italy have brought Venice face-to-face with one of the city's worst floods in at least a decade — leaving residents, store owners, and tourists alike fending off knee-high flood water.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","South Carolina has been dealing with flooding since Florence arrived at the coast on September 13. More than a week later, the situation is only worsening for some coastal residents. Potentially record-breaking flood waters are set to inundate areas that didnt see much flooding last week along the northeastern coast of South Carolina, home to the popular Grand Strand beaches. Thats because rain can take a little while to travel downhill through rivers and streams before reaching the ocean. In this case, were talking about rain making its way through the Yadkin-Pee Dee River Basin, which covers more than 7,000 square miles from northern North Carolina to the South Carolina coast. You can think of the Yadkin-Pee Dee River Basin as a bathtub, according to Frank Alsheimer, the science and operations officer at the National Weather Services office in Columbia, South Carolina. This particular event is extremely uncommon. It doesnt matter where you fill up a bathtub with water, its going to fill up anyway because you have edges on either side, Alsheimer told Earther. Any rain that falls, all the way up this far north as northern North Carolina, gets into the basin and very slowly drains down toward the coast. This drainageinto the communities in Georgetown County, South Carolina, as well as the cities of Conway and Myrtle Beachcould affect up to 30,000 people in the area, said Derrec Becker, the chief communications officer at the South Carolina Emergency Management Division to Earther. No mandatory evacuations are in place yet, but many are self-evacuating as they brace for more water. The 11 shelters in South Carolina are just 3 percent occupied so far, Becker told Earther. [The flooding is] probably going to get more severe, he said. Currently, flood waters along the Waccamaw River near Conway, South Carolina, sit at about 20.75 feet, Alsheimer said. This already breaks the previous record of 17.9 feet. And its more than 10 feet above the flood stage for the Waccamaw River, which is fueling the dangerous situation in these areas. Still, an additional two feet of floodwater is forecasted to impact the region by Wednesday. The record-breaking nature of the flood threat speaks to the fact that while rainfall tends to be localized along the basin, this time, the basin got hit from all angles. This particular event is extremely uncommon, Alsheimer said. Were talking about unprecedented levels we havent seen before, and because of that, were going to have a lot of personal suffering of people who live in areas that were never flooded before but will be flooded because of this event. This storm has already left at least 42 people dead throughout North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Its laid the groundwork for a public health crisis due to released animal feces, carcasses, and toxic waste. And some places havent even seen the worst of it.","South Carolina has been dealing with flooding since Florence arrived at the coast on September 13.

TIMOTHY WILLIAMS,"Groups from outside the state are intimately involved in the fate of the new initiative, known as Constitutional Amendment W. Represent. Us, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization focused on passing anti-corruption laws across the nation, drafted the initiative; it is now pitted against Americans For Prosperity, a conservative group financed by the Koch brothers. Represent. Us has promoted similar measures in Democratic strongholds in recent years, including Rhode Island and San Francisco. The organizations leaders say they believe South Dakota has some of the weakest ethics laws in the nation. Amendment W calls for creating an ethics board that could conduct audits and investigate potential ethics lapses by South Dakota politicians, including bribery and violations of lobbying rules and campaign finance laws. This time around, supporters of the measure wrote the initiative as a constitutional amendment, so that elected officials would not be able to alter or repeal it if it passes. David Owen, president of the state Chamber of Commerce, who is leading the campaign opposing the initiative, said lobbyists in the state play an important role in educating legislators about topics in which lobbyists have expertise. A law limiting that work, he said, would be both unnecessary and harmful. We decided, good Lord, this is a wreck and a direct threat to our ability to communicate, he said. The fact is, I dont think we have corruption in the Legislature. He paused, adding, Thats different than saying everyone should love their legislation. Blake Curd, the Republican Senate majority leader, supported repealing the states 2016 ethics initiative, and opposes the new ballot measure. He said both measures are probably unconstitutional and would be too expensive to administer.","When South Dakota lawmakers undid a voter initiative meant to rein in their behavior, they were part of a struggle between politicians and voters from Maine to California over who should shape legislation.",2018-10-15T09:00:06Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",First Came a Flood of Ballot Measures From Voters.

RICHARD FAUSSET,"The long-term solution for Trent Court feels only more pressing. But it is a complicated issue, and one that does not sort out easily along racial lines. Mayor Dana E. Outlaw, a Democrat who is white, said Monday that he simply wants to see the residents moved away from danger, and soon. In an emotional phone interview, he said he would like to convince fellow members of the board of aldermen to put an end to the class and racial tensions by turning the place into a riverside park. “I’ve got to get us out of this constipation of political rhetorical dialogue and do the right thing, and get folks out of the lead paint, asbestos and flood conditions,” he said. “The best way I can do it is abate the concern. Why don’t we just build a common greenway area where all the residents can have a gazebo and some benches and a piece of monolithic art? It can be the people’s recreational park. I’m out of the box, brother.” Alderwoman Sabrina Bengel, a white politician whose district covers Trent Court and the historic heart of town, is a champion of the plan, and noted that it had the support of the residents council president, Cheryl Reed. In July, according to the local paper, Ms. Reed, 67, told the board she wanted to see “decent housing that no longer looks like public housing,” adding: “We pray that we don’t have a big hurricane this year.” On Monday, Ms. Reed was at a shelter at a local elementary school. She said she was hoping to get into Trent Court to check on her apartment, which she heard had taken on two feet of water. Among the plan’s opponents is Jameesha Harris, an African-American alderwoman who moved here from Albany, N.Y. “I just feel it’s modern-day gentrification,” she said. Her district includes a predominantly black neighborhood, Pembroke, where some Trent Court residents could be relocated. Some Pembroke residents have raised objections, worried about a possible uptick in traffic and crime. At Trent Court on Sunday evening, Ms. Monk was worrying about other things, including the neighbors who had it worse than her. She pointed to Sylvester Smith, 62, a retired cook who lived in one of the apartments closest to the river.","Residents of a North Carolina housing complex have found themselves at the center of a redevelopment drama, even as they wonder what will become of their Florence-hit homes.",2018-09-18T00:01:40Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","In Flood-Hit Public Housing, a Reminder That the Poor Bear Brunt of Storms’ Fury",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/us/hurricane-florence-new-bern-poor.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/18/us/18newbern-02/18newbern-02-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,flood,1

Andrew Freedman,"The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast are in for a wild ride during the next few days as a nor'easter rapidly intensifies off the East Coast of the U.S. The storm will bring with it an array of life-threatening hazards, from record-breaking coastal flooding and hurricane force winds, to cement-like wet snow that will bring down trees and power lines. The storm will undergo bombogenesis, a process in which the minimum central air pressure will drop by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. In general, the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. The rapid drop in air pressure will kick up extremely strong winds, which will help bring air travel to a halt in some of the biggest cities in the country, from Boston to Washington, D.C., due to high winds and heavy precipitation. SEE ALSO: Dangerous storm targets Northeast, Mid-Atlantic with high winds, coastal flooding, inland snow Along the Massachusetts shoreline, coastal flooding is likely to exceed all of the benchmark floods of the past, including the Blizzard of 1978, and possibly the highest water level on record in Boston, which was set earlier this winter. Up and down the coast of eastern Massachusetts, a 3-to-5-foot storm surge on top of high astronomical high tides, coupled with angry seas with building waves, will do significant damage to shoreline infrastructure, including homes and businesses. A man walks through a flooded section of Brant Rock in Marshfield, Mass., on Jan. 4, 2018, as the afternoon high tide struck during the blizzard. Image: John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images On Jan. 4 of this year, Boston saw its highest water level on record when the ""Bomb Cyclone"" hit the city. That storm flooded a subway station and shut down portions of the city. This event has the potential to do even more damage in the low-lying, coastal city. Communities to the north and south of Boston, will also see major coastal flooding on par with some of the biggest coastal storms on record. Cape Cod looks to be in line for some of the highest winds and waves, and its beaches are prone to erosion. Chart showing atmospheric spin at around 15,000 feet, depicting a closed upper level low south of New England, a telltale sign of an intense Nor'easter. Image: tropicaltidbits.com The overall weather pattern in which this nor'easter is forming is going to prevent the storm from skipping east, out to sea, quickly. This will heighten the storm's impacts, making coastal flooding last through multiple high tides, as east to northeast winds drive water ashore in Massachusetts, parts of Long Island, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. A sprawling, intense area of high pressure parked over Greenland is serving as a giant stop sign in the atmosphere, pinning storms like this close to the U.S. coast. Such a high pressure area is known as a ""Greenland block,"" and it's a prerequisite for producing a severe winter weather event in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Here's what to expect in the big cities of the Northeast, along with more details on the threat of heavy, wet snow making it all the way to the coast, which could spread power outage closer to highly populated areas. Computer model projection showing sea level pressure and winds just above the Earth's surface on March 2, 2018. Image: tropicaltidbits.com Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Philadelphia: In these cities, heavy rain on Thursday night and Friday, along with extremely windy conditions on Friday will be the biggest impacts from the storm. Some coastal flooding is possible in the Philadelphia area as well. Wind gusts could exceed 60 miles per hour on Friday in the D.C. area, as the region will be located between the deepening low pressure area offshore and high pressure to the west, causing a wind tunnel effect. New York City: In New York, the official forecast is for a sloppy, messy, windswept rainstorm. The precipitation may mix with or change to snow at times, but any accumulations are highly uncertain at this time. It's possible that the storm will manufacture enough cold air through dynamical cooling to turn the rain to heavy snow late on Friday into Saturday morning, which would create a host of problems in the city and nearby suburbs, but this is not a high-confidence forecast scenario. Winds will gust to at least 50 to 60 miles per hour along the coast, and moderate to major coastal flooding is possible at high tides, which is also the case in coastal New Jersey. Storm surge of 3-5 feet with big wave action is no joke. Take this storm very seriously if you are at the coast. Major flooding is expected. And remember this flooding is for 3-4 straight tide cycles. pic.twitter.com/QvMx7dPRuB — Eric Fisher (@ericfisher) March 1, 2018 Hartford, Connecticut: Heavy rain and snow is expected from late Thursday night through Saturday in Hartford. Snowfall amounts, however, hinge on how much temperatures cool down during the storm, with anywhere from 3 to 6 inches of snow to a foot of heavy, wet snow possible. Snowfall exceeding 3 inches could cause widespread power outages, given the weight of the wet snow on trees and power lines. The Halloween nor'easter of 2011 dumped about a foot of snow in Hartford, causing a weeklong power outage. Boston: The strongest winds, most severe storm surge, and historic coastal flooding all appear to be focused on Beantown and other locations in eastern Massachusetts. Winds could gust to hurricane force — 75 miles per hour — in the area, and a combination of high astronomical tides, a 3-to-5-foot storm surge, and destructive waves are likely to produce historic coastal flooding in many areas during multiple high tides. [COASTAL FLOOD WARNING] 9 am Friday → 3 am Sunday; severe damage to shoreline structures; some homes may be destroyed; widespread inundation of coastal roads, basements; LIFE THREATENING SITUATION! Many neighborhoods may be at risk of being cut off for a time. pic.twitter.com/3IeOWcEilh — NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) March 1, 2018 Like in New York City, there is also a wild card of precipitation type in Boston, with some computer models suggesting that heavy rain will change to accumulating snow on Friday night and Saturday, as the center of the storm drifts further to the south. The National Weather Service is using strong language to warn people about the likelihood of potentially historic coastal flooding from this nor'easter, calling it a ""LIFE THREATENING SITUATION."" A summary of talking points w/ the forecast high impact / long duration coastal storm. Please take this storm seriously! For those living along the coast, this is a LIFE &amp; DEATH situation. Please heed the advice of local officials. pic.twitter.com/jOAMNeWSbl — NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) March 1, 2018 It's not a coincidence that Boston may set back-to-back records for its highest water level in the same year. Coastal flooding is an increasing hazard in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast in part because of sea level rise caused by global warming. Higher background sea levels make it easier for storm surges to break records and do more damage. This is similar to basketball players competing on a court with a steadily rising floor, making it easier for them to dunk. Over 40-feet significant wave height now forecast by ECMWF model for massive Nor'easter. Seas dramatically build in Friday unfortunately with long duration component of direction perpendicular to the coast.

Just off the Massachusetts coast, waves may tower up to 35 feet, and some of the highest swells in years are likely well offshore. Any ships caught in its path could be in trouble, as high winds and waves present a serious hazard. Cruise ships in particular have had a habit recently of sailing directly into powerful East Coast storms, hopefully that won't happen again this time.","The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast are in for a wild ride during the next few days as a nor'easter rapidly intensifies off the East Coast of the U.S. The storm will bring with it an array of life-threatening hazards, from record-breaking coastal flooding and hurr…",2018-03-01T20:28:13Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}","Intense nor'easter may demolish coastal flood records, knock out power to millions",https://mashable.com/2018/03/01/noreaster-new-england-worst-coastal-flooding/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/LhZYhGJ19GBNVsk3jSIjxNpx46E=/1200x630/2018%2F03%2F01%2Fa9%2Fe36ae33d5376495f8308a830613fdade.87678.jpg,mashable,Mashable,flood,1
Melanie Ehrenkranz,"Advertising for The Nun, an upcoming horror film centered around the inexplicable suicide of a nun in 1950s Romania, is predictably terrorizing. But a YouTube ad for the film has seemingly crossed the line, driving a flood of users to complain about it online and, ultimately, get it removed from the platform. A tweet cautioning users about the ad had over 100,000 retweets as of Tuesday morning. Last night, YouTube responded to the message, stating that the ad “violates our shocking content policy and it’s no longer running as an ad.” Asked for comment, YouTube confirmed to Gizmodo the tweet was accurate and the ad had been removed. The ad in question is just a few seconds long, and while horror is subjective, it’s easy to see why a lot of users would feel affronted by it. The ad shows an on-screen volume indicator turning all the way down followed by a jump scare of a nun. You can watch a re-uplod of the ad here. While the full trailer is longer and arguably more disturbing, it’s not served up to viewers who might just be browsing innocuous videos online only to be interrupted by a screaming nun. “IF I SEE THE NUN TRAILER POP UP AS ANOTHER AD WHEN IM WATCHING YOUTUBE IMMA THROW HANDS. IM TIRED OF GETTING SCARED IN THE MIDDLE OF A JAMES CHARLES VIDEO,” one user wrote on Twitter. “IM LITERALLY SHAKING AND TEARING UP RIGHT NOW I JUST WANTED TO PLAY EPIPHANY BUT WHY DID YOUTUBE GAVE ME A FUCKING THE NUN JUSMPSCARE AS AN AD AT 5 FUCKING AM,” wrote another. Google, YouTube’s parent company, does have an advertising policy that prohibits shocking content. Ads featuring “violent language, gruesome or disgusting imagery, or graphic images or accounts of physical trauma” as well as promotions “that are likely to shock or scare” are not allowed. Google lists crime scene photos and execution videos as cases of the former, and ads indicating that the viewer “may be in danger, be infected with a disease, or be the victim of a conspiracy” as examples of the latter. Of course, these are all real-life horrors, not marketing campaigns for a fictitious horror film. But it’s evident that content doesn’t have to be nonfiction to appall. It could just be a really fucked up ad. This whole debacle is unsurprising, given YouTube’s less than celebrated history of content moderation. In June, three parents reached out to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), a non-statutory UK watchdog organization, after their kids saw ads for a horror movie before kid-aimed content like Frozen songs, a Lego tutorial, and Minecraft videos. One of the ads, which were for Insidious: The Last Key, allegedly showed a woman “lying on a floor immobile, bloodied and distressed while a humanoid creature crept towards her and then probed at her with claw-like fingers and pierced her skin,” according to the ASA. Ultimately, the ASA told Sony Pictures to ensure such ads weren’t targeted at children in the future. And aside from horror films, YouTube has also spectacularly failed at moderating content related to suicide, porn, addiction, and gun modification tutorials, as well as disturbing content targeting children. Just to name a few. [ Polygon ]","Advertising for The Nun, an upcoming horror film centered around the inexplicable suicide of a nun in 1950s Romania, is predictably terrorizing.

SHERYL GAY STOLBERG,"“It becomes a kind of Catch-22,” said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. “One of their criteria is the issue of viability, but without their endorsement, viability becomes very tough, because so many people use them as their barometer of, ‘Oh, does this woman have a chance?’” Emily’s List has also faced criticism that it does not do enough to lift up women of color. Nina Turner, an African-American former state senator from Ohio who was endorsed by Emily’s List when she ran for secretary of state in 2014, said minorities may face higher hurdles than white women in raising money, because they are less likely to come from wealthy circles. “I got the money late when I needed it early, because they were judging my ability to fund-raise more than where I stood on the issues,” Ms. Turner said, adding, “I don’t think they take into consideration the hurdles that black and Hispanic women have to jump when you judge viability.” Ms. Schriock said Emily’s List does recognize “the obstacles that are particularly in front of women of color.” “Do we have to do more?” she asked. “Absolutely, as does the party.” In the Georgia governor’s primary, race — and a chance to make history — was “a big piece,” but not the only consideration, in Emily’s List’s decision to endorse Ms. Abrams, who is African-American, Ms. Schriock said. Ms. Abrams, a former minority leader in the Georgia House of Representatives, has a national profile and a longstanding relationship with Emily’s List, which gave her its rising star award in 2014. If elected, she would become the nation’s first black female governor. She has also outraised Ms. Evans, reporting nearly $3.3 million in campaign contributions, according to campaign filings in Georgia, compared with $2.6 million for Ms. Evans. Some political analysts say that Ms. Evans might have broader appeal with white moderates and thus a better chance of winning a Georgia general election. Ms. Schriock disagrees. She says Emily’s List is counting on Ms. Abrams, who is favored to win the primary, to expand the Democratic electorate by pulling in black and Latino voters who might not otherwise go to the polls. The Georgia WIN List, Georgia’s equivalent of Emily’s List, has remained neutral in the campaign. “For us to have chosen between the two, it would have destroyed my organization,” said Melita Easters, the group’s chairwoman.","Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, Democrat of New Mexico, said that “there’s no way I would be here” without Emily’s List, which backed her in 2012 but not in her first run for Congress in 2008.",2018-05-04T23:00:55Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Tough Choices, and Criticism, for Emily’s List as Democratic Women Flood Primaries",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/politics/emilys-list-midterm-elections.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/29/us/politics/29dc-emilyslist1/29dc-emilyslist1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,flood,1
"Kelly Murray, CNN","(CNN)As if one winter storm around the holidays wasn't enough, a new one is taking shape for New Year's Eve, bringing more heavy rain and a renewed flood threat.
It comes on the heels of the deadly storm system that plagued much of the Midwest, South and East over Christmas. 
The worst is over as that storm pushes offshore into the Atlantic. But it killed at least six people in the Midwest and South and brought blizzard conditions, a foot of snow, and winds exceeding 55 mph to the Great Plains and Upper Midwest on Thursday. It then ripped across the East with heavy rainfall and winds.
On Friday, more than 50 million people were under the threat of floods, with flood watches and warnings stretching from the Gulf Coast to New Jersey. 
Flash flooding affected Southern Mississippi and Alabama, triggering dangerous situations and high-water rescues. Up to a foot of rain fell in less than a day.
The rough weather made holiday travel even more of a headache. There were nearly 9,000 flight delays into, within or out of the country Friday, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware.
As of Saturday, flood watches have been largely discontinued, but there are still warnings for some rivers in the South, particularly across southern Mississippi and Alabama, according to CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera.
""I'm not expecting the foot of rain some areas in the Southern US received,"" Cabrera said. ""An additional 1 to 3 inches may renew flooding concerns due to saturated soils. Some areas in the South will in fact make a run for wettest year on record with the last few storms filling rain gauges to record levels.""
Forecast radar images for Saturday show rain persisting in coastal areas of the Southeast, but it should clear out for inland cities, including Atlanta and Charlotte.
The letup won't last long, however. On Sunday, moisture emanating from the Gulf of Mexico will bring a band of showers to southeastern Texas and then stretch across southern Louisiana, all the way up through the Carolinas.
Then, on the last day of 2018, another storm will bring rain, although less heavy, to the North and East, Cabrera said.
Conditions will be wet, but temperatures will be mild in much of the Southeast -- in the 60s and 70s -- and in the 40s in the Northeast as New Year's Eve revelers welcome 2019.","As if one winter storm around the holidays wasn't enough, a new one is taking shape for New Year's Eve, bringing more heavy rain and a renewed flood threat.

A potent atmospheric river a long band of water vapor that often transports ample amounts of moisture to the western U.S. like ""rivers in the sky"" deluged portions of Northern California this week. The Russian River, which winds through the Sonoma County town of Guerneville, reached over 45-feet high and swamped the area, prompting the Sheriff to announce on Twitter that the town had been surrounded by water with no way in or out.  
While California relies heavily on these wintertime atmospheric rivers for its water, scientists expect these storms to grow wetter as Earth's climate heats up. 
""We're likely to see rain in increasingly intense bursts,"" Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said in an interview.
""This really was a firehose aimed at Sonoma County,"" Swain added.

Though it can be challenging to attribute any particular blast of rain to extreme weather stoked by climate change, this destructive event does have a telltale climate fingerprint. 
""It does seem to be another data point suggesting individual atmospheric rivers are becoming wetter,"" said Paul Ullrich, a climate scientist at the University of California at Davis.

""This year is exemplary,"" said Ullrich, noting that atmospheric rivers dumped excessive amounts of rain in California during January. ""It very much supports that hypothesis.""

Generally, scientists expect California's rainy season to become shorter and more contracted but still have about the same amount of rainfall as in the past. That means more extreme deluges. 
Once heavy rains repeatedly hit California, they set the stage for floods. The ground becomes oversaturated with water. 
""That sets up the whole system to overflow,"" said Ullrich.

Future atmospheric rivers are expected to bring loads of water from both the tropics and drier areas over the ocean, said Swain. Due to simple physics, as the atmosphere warms, the air is able to hold more water vapor. Specifically, for every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, the air can hold seven percent more water.

"JACK HEALY, RICHARD FAUSSET and CAMPBELL ROBERTSON","But the mind-set seemed to have fully changed. Local officials used to regard hurricane response as something akin to major snow removal: sporadic events that therefore warranted relatively little investment. “Two years of these types of storms have really made us look internally at our own preparation,” Mr. Sears said. “Now that we have a better understanding of where people may be at risk, we can better stage assets in that area.” “Matthew got me once, Florence got me twice,” Mr. Sears said Tuesday, recounting what he told the City Council this week. “The next hurricane won’t get me.” Closer to the coast, in Conway, S.C., a few miles northwest of Myrtle Beach, the weariness with the cycle of worry, flood, repeat was palpable. “I grew up here,” said Matt Bruton, 34, a moving and storage business operator, who was hanging out Tuesday in his single-story brick home in Old Sherwood Country Club, an eclectic neighborhood of old and new houses north of the Waccamaw River. The waters had already risen through neighboring Crabtree Swamp to a level higher than residents had ever seen. “We had a record flood during Floyd in ’99, and it wasn’t this high,” Mr. Bruton said. “The hundred-year flood they called it the last time, and here we are again. I’d like to put my house in a different, higher place, but I call this the best neighborhood in Conway.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","When last weeks bomb cyclone hit the Midwest, it was hard to imagine the inundation it could bring amid whiteout conditions and more than a foot of snow. But the warm weather that wrapped in behind it quickly melted out all that white stuff and unleashed historic flooding across parts of Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas, and Missouri.
Floodwaters have worked their way down the rivers that run like arteries through the region, overtop the banks of the Missouri, Platte, Elkhorn, and more. Dams have been destroyed, bridges and other infrastructure have been washed away, and small towns have been cut off from the outside world, surrounded by moats of muddy water. The flooding has also paralyzed the various military bases scattered across the region, with waters lapping up against Fort Leavenworth and Offutt Air Force Base, home U.S. Strategic Command. As Task and Purpose helpfully notes, that means the base that oversees the Pentagons nuclear strategic deterrence and global strike capabilities is largely underwater. 
The situation also neatly illustrates how climate changewhich is leading to more intense precipitationis a threat multiplier.
As of Monday, nine flood gauges operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration remained at major flood stage with another 17 in moderate flood stages. While the on-the-ground photos show the human toll of the floods, satellites are the best way to get a handle on the full scope of whats happening in the Midwest. Below are before and after images captured by the European Space Agencys Sentinel satellites.

Joshua Rapp Learn,"It sounds like a B-rated science fiction movie: wallabies implanted with microchips opening their own personal pet doors when they want to come home. But this isn’t an ill-advised sequel to Tank Girl. Researchers in Australia recently implanted a bridled nail-tailed wallaby with a microchip and trained it to use a cat door to find food and escape predators. The 62-day experiment was designed to prove that such technology could be useful to help in the eventual wild release of captive-bred animals. Bridled nail-tailed wallabies are among the smallest wallabies, themselves often described as smaller versions of closely related kangaroos; both are marsupials in the Macropodidae family. About as large as medium-sized dogs, the wallaby’s name refers to a small nail it has on the end of its tail (nobody has yet figured out the nail’s purpose). The wallabies, listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, are threatened in their native Australian habitat by predators like feral dogs and cats. Since these predators aren’t native to the continent, the wallabies have nary a notion of the threats they pose. The IUCN estimates that fewer than 250 bridled nail-tail wallabies remain in the wild. “If we don’t act now, there won’t be any left soon,” said Julia Hoy, research manager at the University of Queensland’s Hidden Vale Wildlife Centre, a research and teaching organization focused on wildlife management. Hoy admitted that wallabies aren’t known for their intelligence. But she and her colleagues wanted to see whether they could train a captive nail-tailed wallaby named Flood to use a cat door to find food and escape from predators. “If we can do it with her, we can do it with anyone,” said Hoy. Flood was born in captivity in 2011, around the time of intense flooding that wiped out several towns west of Brisbane, Australia. She is one of a number of wallabies and other native Australian animals held by the wildlife center as insurance, in case wild populations drop to unsustainable levels. In the meantime, the researchers are developing techniques they could use to help captive-raised animals survive if they are released in the future. The team implanted Flood with a microchip that allowed her to push open an otherwise locked pet door, which led to a safe space with available food. The door was programmed to unlock when the microchip got near, but Flood wasn’t exactly a quick learner. “The answer is do it very slowly and careful, and do it in small stages,” Hoy said, adding that they first had to get the wallaby comfortable with pushing the door open. Eventually, though, Flood got the hang of it and made use of her secure personal apartment. Their report on Flood’s training was published in June in Zoo Biology. She said that the results signal good news if wallabies like Flood are released back into the wild. Doors like these can help researchers do a type of soft release, which involves partial feeding as well as giving the animals a safe place to hide from any feral dogs intent on making a meal out of them, at least until they learn to fend for themselves completely. Cautious steps like this are necessary, since it would be a waste of time, resources, and precious wallabies if the animals were released only to be immediately eaten by an invasive predator. Hoy and her colleagues are busy training other animals, including northern brown bandicoots, to fear dogs and cats. While this is the first time that this type of setup has been used on wallabies, other research has employed door-opening tech for species as varied as owl monkeys and birds. Biology professor Vladimir Pravosudov and his colleagues from the University of Nevada, Reno, placed electric bands on the legs of chickadees that allowed them to access feeders, as part of an effort to learn about their spatial memory performance and cognitive flexibility. Pravosudov said he’s not surprised that the wallaby could learn to use such a device, and suggested that the use of this technology will soon become common among wildlife researchers and managers. “It doesn’t require handling animals in the wild, so [the technology] is all over the place,” he said, adding this allows for a way of monitoring wildlife behavior without the interference of human presence.

TEGNA,"GRAND RAPIDS, MICH. - Grand Rapids is better-prepared to handled the higher waters in the Grand River than before the 2013 flood, a city official said Tuesday. With heavy rains this week, the Grand River downtown gauge is predicted to reach 20.5 feet on Saturday, Feb. 24, according to the National Weather Service. The highest reading occurred on April 22, 2013 at 21.85 feet, in a flood where hundreds of homes were evacuated in a state of emergency. The record-flooding was a result of multiple factors, said Grand Rapids City Engineer Mark De Clercq. ""We had a snow pack that year,"" De Clercq said. ""We also had a series of small rain events that year that impacted the Grand River water shed."" The city was already in the process of updating its flood plain maps with FEMA during the 2013 flood and completed the improvements in 2017, he said. ""In 2016 and 2017, we went forth and delivered the construction, or improvements, to certain locations along the flood protection system to raise the top of the flood wall to meet that 100-year base flood elevation,"" De Clercq said. The city also raised some of the soil embankments to prevent flooding, including by the Ford Museum and the Wealthy Street bridge. ""[With what is predicted this weekend], compared to about 25.5 feed at the 100-year, there's still definitely about five-and-a-half feet of flood protection still available,"" De Clercq said. The Grand River won't look the same in a few years. The city is working with Grand Rapids Whitewater to restore the river's rapids. Construction is expected to begin in 2019, and the restoration won't affect the city's flood control, said Richard Bishop, president of Grand Rapids Whitewater. ""The Sixth Street dam and the four low-head dams, they have no flood control capacity today at all,"" Bishop said. ""They're not flood control dams, so when you take it out that won't affect the flood plain. Flood walls are what contains it in the river."" The project, he said, is budgeted at $44 million. ► Make it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this. Download the WZZM 13 app now. Have a news tip?

Marcus Gilmer,"As the tire fire that is Theresa May's handling of Brexit continues to burn, a crowd pegged at around a million people flooded the streets of London on Saturday, protesting the disastrous policy and calling on a new referendum. 
SEE ALSO: John Oliver shares his thoughts on Brexit and we honestly don't know whether to laugh or cry
While the option of a second referendum on Brexit was once seen as highly unlikely, there's now a semblance of hope for those backing the vote. Prime Minister May has bungled the process and is faced with a variety of dubious options, including a yet-again delayed exit or even a no-deal Brexit that would have serious ramifications.
Dubbed ""Put It To The People,"" Saturday's march saw around a million people participate, organizers said. The event also included a rally in front of Parliament. London Mayor Sadiq Khan was among those marching and he was scheduled to speak at the post-march rally. 
The swarm of people in London was in direct contrast to the much smaller ""March to Leave,"" a two-week trek of pro-leave protesters led by Nigel Farage, walking from Sunderland with the aim of arriving in London on Friday, March 29, the originally planned Brexit date. 
In London, though, the streets were flooded with protesters holding quippy signs and marching in costume, all part of the growing movement to demand a new vote over leaving the EU. 
Even superheroes backed the second vote protest.

One of many, many clever signs seen in London during Saturday's protest.

The movement to remain in the EU got a big boost in visibility earlier in the week when an online petition calling for revoking Article 50, the law that outlines how countries can exit the EU, gained so many signatures (now at 4.4 million) that it crashed the government's petition website. 
Organizers pegged the crowd at just over a million participants.

Even dogs joined the march.
Image: Getty Images
To say the Brexit process has been a disaster is putting it mildly, as can be seen by the fact that Prime Minister May is the target of both aforementioned protests that take opposing sides. It's reflective of the infighting that's taken place in Parliament, leaving that body of government in a deadlock with no plan in place for an exit. 
Despite Saturday's enormous protest, odds of a second referendum are still long thanks to the hurdles that need to be cleared including approval from that deadlocked Parliament, a decision on what, exactly, the referendum would be a vote on, and negotiating a timetable on the vote. 
Madness is an understatement when it comes to the Brexit mess

London was flooded Saturday with protesters and their signs, calling on a new Brexit vote as Teresa May flirts with disaster.

Matt Simon,"California continues to take stock of its unprecedented conflagrations between the Camp Fire in the north, which on its own is the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, and the Woolsey Fire in the south, 82 lives have been lost so far, with hundreds more still missing. As firefighters keep battling the blazes, a new menace is emerging: debris flows. The rains are coming to California, as soon as Tuesday night, and the fires have primed the soil for another disaster that can claim yet more lives. The coastal town of Montecito, in Southern California, learned this lesson less than a year ago. Last December, the massive Thomas Fire burned through the hills, right up to the edges of town. Thanks to the communitys comprehensive fire preparedness plan, only 7 homes were lost. But a month later, the scorched hills outside of town let loose a storm-driven debris flow that enveloped the town, killing 21. The problem is a fundamental change to the soil itself. When a wildfire burns vegetation, it releases organic compounds. These compounds are heated in the fire, volatilize, and then re-condense on soil particles, says Brian Ebel, a hydrologist with the USGS. This soil normally absorbs water, but the organic compounds turn it hydrophobic, literally meaning fear of water. It is not an understatement: You can pour a bottle of water on this burned soil and itll bead right off, as if the dirt were polished marble. The water will pool up and sit there, and it can take more than an hour for it to penetrate fire-scorched soil, says Ebel. Problem number two: vegetation anchors the soil. When fire burns it away, the soil loosens. You can think of vegetation as a protective blanket, says Jason Kean, a hydrologist at the USGS. Without it, sediment has nothing to hold it in place. Before there's even rain, debris can roll down the hill and accumulate in channels. Now hydrologists and meteorologists are keeping a close eye on communities that butt up against these latest fires, where the conditions are set for catastrophic debris flows when the rain comes. Once it starts raining hard on a burn area, the things can get generated really fast, like five minutes, says Kean. The debris flow can carry boulders and trees along with mud, making it more dangerous than a regular flood or a dry landslide. When you mobilize themkeep them mobile with this muddy matrix in between themthey can go 3 kilometers, says Kean. The video below shows just how easily the flow tosses boulders around. Boulders can also act like a moving dam, retarding the flow. So you get this surging behavior, where these things are holding back a whole bunch of flow behind it, adds Kean. It really makes the flow depth increase several times what you'd get in a water-only flood. The Montecito debris flow got to be 30 feet deep at points, lodging boulders in trees. Humans are powerless to stop itsandbags just become more debris for the flow. But it can be predicted, giving residents a chance to evacuate. The work begins as soon as a wildfires smoke clears enough for satellites to get a good look at how badly areas have burned. This information is relayed to scientists on the ground, who enter those burned regions as soon as its safe. The greatest risk of debris flow is in the zones that burned the most intensely, and scientists spend two or three days wandering the fire perimeter taking soil samples. That involves testing the hydrophobicity of the soil, the water repellency, says Eric Huff, staff chief of Cal Fires Forest Practice Program, and actually getting down on hands and knees and looking at what that surface soil layer is showing, whether or not organic matter has been completely burned off. Kean and his colleagues then compare this data to their understanding of where debris flows have let loose in the area historically, building a map that captures the probability and potential volume of a debris flow. They also identify values at riskhuman life and structures that may be in danger. With all this data in mind, they can calculate how much rain you would need to potentially let loose a debris flow for different regions of the map. Often half an inch of rain in an hour is enough to kick one off, or as little as five minutes of heavy rain. It's kind of a run-of-the-mill storm, says Kean. It's heavy rain, but it's not particularly exceptional. So the National Weather Service carefully watches storms as they head into California. (Unfortunately, with climate change, California may see fewer yet more intense storms going forward.) As the rain approaches the coast, officials can send out wireless alerts, like you would get for an Amber alert, as well as warnings on TV and radio. Which brings us back to the Montecito disaster. Forecasters saw the storm coming, predicting it would drop an inch and a half of rain an hour. What we saw in reality that night was a 30-minute heavy rain that moved through that area, says Eric Boldt, a warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service. It was closer to six and a half inches per hour. And there's no computer models that exist today that can predict that type of rate. Officials had put voluntary evacuation orders in place, but not everyone heeded the advice. This was just after the Thomas Fire, after all. They had just been evacuated for two or three weeks over the holiday season, says Boldt. They were just getting comfortable back in their homes and they didn't want to leave again. If you havent cleared out in time and the flow comes, the recommendation is to shelter in placemoving to the upper story of your house, for instance. Out on the streets is exactly where you don't want to be, as the flow follows those paths. We've even seen people, if they were able to get up on their countertops in their kitchen, the mud came up to about that level, says Boldt. It's a different way of thinking about the impact because it's not the same as a flash flood. With a flash flood, you can see a river swelling and move to higher ground. Flee up a hill just before a debris flow, though, and that ground could kill you. The debris flow risk can persist for up to five years after a wildfire. So residents whose homes narrowly survived a wildfire may not realize theyre in danger of the surrounding hills for longer than a year. But the danger is most certainly there. Its a brutal consideration for those trying to recover from the Camp and Woolsey fires, but its also an extremely important one. A menace begets another menace.

"Eliott C. McLaughlin, CNN","(CNN) After the deadly flooding of 2016, Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said Ellicott City was reduced to a ""war zone"" and likened it to the scene of disaster movie set. On Monday, Kittleman said the flooding of 2018 was much nastier. Authorities were still in the assessment stage on a soggy Memorial Day, trying to determine exactly how much worse. Particularly worrying, Kittleman said, is a 25- to 30-foot-wide hole just north of Main Street, where the ground appears to have buckled under the weight of the flooding. ""There are a lot of people whose lives are going to be devastated again, and they've been working so hard to come back and we just need to be there for them and to tell them... all of our resources are there to help them,"" Kittleman said. ""I can't imagine what they're going through. I couldn't imagine what they went through two years ago, and now it's even worse."" The first concern is people. Emergency responders conducted 30 rescues Monday morning as they continued their search for a missing man, identified as Eddison Hermond. Sarah Lopez was at a restaurant, attending a birthday party with Hermond when the flooding began, she told CNN. Hermond left to help a woman rescue her cat from a pet store. Witnesses returned and said Hermond slipped into the river and was carried away, said Lopez, whose husband met Hermond 20 years ago in the US Air Force. As rescuers continue searching for Hermond, there were no reports of deaths or major injuries as of early Monday, Kittleman said. The 2016 flood killed two people, when floodwaters swept away their vehicles. Gas and electricity have been shut down on Main Street, where water ran through buildings as if it were a tributary of the nearby Patapsco River, which swelled to record levels during Sunday's storms. The river is a major waterway that feeds into the Chesapeake Bay. Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric said it will need to survey the damage to its infrastructure before providing a timeline for restoring service. Flooding claimed the old courthouse, Kittleman said, and there are homes on the west end of downtown whose foundations and basements are gone. ""A lot of the businesses, the first floors are gone, like they were two years ago,"" he said. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency Sunday in Howard County. Marked by quaint shops in the bottom floors of brick, stone slab and siding-clad buildings, the historic downtown is a major draw in this community of about 66,000 people located about 12 miles west of Baltimore. Main Street, also known as Frederick Road, was transformed into a waterway over the weekend, as brown water sluiced through town, destroying shops and upending cars. In some areas, the water rose above the buildings' first floors. To understand what authorities were surveying Monday, it's perhaps helpful to understand what happened fewer than two years ago. After 6 inches of rain fell on the flood-prone community in about two hours, residents say the flooding came from nowhere in 2016. In addition to the two people killed, more than two dozen buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed. Residents formed human chains to pluck their neighbors from the rushing waters. Kittleman said at the time that it was the worst devastation in Howard County in 50 years, but the town rallied around the slogan ""Ellicott City Strong"" and got to the arduous work of putting their community back together again. When the rain came Sunday, many residents remained in the throes of recovery. The county was working on stormwater retention ponds and preparing to install additional piping. Money from a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant had just arrived and was slated for repairs and construction, Kittleman said. ""There are things that we are doing. It just can't be done in less than two years,"" he said. ""After the flood in 2016 and working on the recovery there, you can't get things done in a year or two. It just can't happen. And you saw, we get the money from FEMA two years later. That's how it works."" More than 8 inches in 15 hours The river rose 17.8 feet in two hours Sunday afternoon, to 24.1 feet, a record from the previous high of 23.6 feet. The National Weather Service, which issued a flash flood warning for southeastern Howard County through early Monday, reported that parts of the greater Baltimore area got isolated rainfall of more than 9 inches. Three to 6 inches was common throughout the metro area. In parts of Ellicott, more than 8 inches fell between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. Sunday, the weather service said. The eastern portion of the community saw more than 7 inches in that timespan, while the southwestern side of town received more than 5 inches of the wet stuff. There are possibilities that another inch could fall, the NWS said, and though that doesn't sound like much rain, it means trouble for the already saturated ground and burgeoning rivers. Aside from the Patapsco River, there are four other smaller waterways running through and around the Ellicott. The Howard County Department of Fire and Rescue Services urged residents to evacuate downtown or move to higher ground while rescue teams fanned out through the area. They're being asked to stay away from Main Street until authorities can ensure buildings are safe to enter. The Roger Carter Community Center is open for those who need a place to shelter. Gov. Hogan toured the area Sunday with Kittleman. He lamented the destruction, noting that just two weeks earlier, he had visited the historic downtown and spoken with business owners about rebuilding efforts. ""The place looked terrific,"" he said. ""It's just devastating because people have their lives tied up in this and went through a heck of a lot and came back and now they're starting all over again."" Kittleman expressed confidence Monday that Ellicott could make another comeback. ""This is where we're one Howard again, and we'll be one Ellicott City,"" he said. ""We will be stronger in the future. We really will, folks. This is not a place that gives in. We didn't give in in 2016. We're not going to give in in 2018."" Asked what he'd say to downtown business owners who have their doubts about reopening after being hammered twice in 22 months, Kittleman said he sees their side of things. ""I can totally understand what they're saying. If I was in their shoes, I'd probably be reassessing that myself."" CNN's Paul P. Murphy, Lindy Royce, Emanuella Grinberg and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","After the deadly flooding of 2016, Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said Ellicott City was reduced to a ""war zone"" and likened it to the scene of disaster movie set.

It never flooded before. I never even got a complaint about water in the road.” Some in New Jersey blamed the scale of the flooding on climate change — and politics. Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, said that changes to waterway protections had left the state more vulnerable. “We continue to see more and more flood events across our state, affecting homes and communities and putting our waterways at risk,” Mr. Tittel said. “More development creates more impervious surfaces and destroys floodplains and wetlands,” he added. “This all contributes to increased flooding and storm water runoff, further putting communities at risk.”","Flash floods swept through New York and New Jersey over the last three days, leading to states of emergency and evacuations across the region.",2018-08-14T23:23:35Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",You Got the Flood Warning on Your Phone.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters In the wake of devastating floods in the southern Indian state of Kerala, local volunteers played an integral part clearing the mud and debris. BBC Tamil's Pramila Krishnan spoke to one woman who spent weeks helping clean up her city. On 23 August, Sandhini Gopakumar, a 34-year-old housewife, returned to her home in the flood-ravaged city of Cochin with her husband and two children. They had been forced to spend five days in three different emergency relief camps. ""On my way back home, I saw the bloated bodies of cattle floating in stagnant water,"" recalls Sandhini. ""How were we going to clean this up? I thought. How many days would we need?"" The floods were the worst to hit Kerala in a century. Hundreds were killed and more than a million displaced. Like Sandhini and her family, many took shelter in relief camps spread across the state. By the end of the month, flood waters began to recede and Kerala started to limp back to normal. But even as the danger from flood waters faded, a new challenge loomed large: homes were muddied and wrecked; sewers had overflowed and rubbish filled the streets; large parts of cities and villages had become unliveable. Image copyright Sharique Ahmad Sandhini remembers her heart sinking at the sight of garbage piled up in Paravur, her neighbourhood in Cochin. When she entered her house, she found herself knee-deep in mud and surrounded by the unbearable stench of sewage and rotting food. ""It gave me a terrible headache,"" she says. It took her two whole days to clean the small two-bedroom house. Nearly everything the family owned, from the furniture to kitchen utensils, was beyond repair. She says she kept thinking of the thousands of families across Kerala who were also helpless in the face of the destruction wrought by the floods. ""I called up other members from Kudumbashree and we started cleaning public places."" Kudumbashree is a unique initiative by the Kerala government to fight poverty and empower women. Set up in 1997, it comprises only female volunteers. (""Kudumba"" in the local Malayalam language means family and ""shree"" means woman). Sandhini and her fellow-members volunteered for hours every day to clean up their neighbourhoods and towns. ""My team of 10 might have been small in number but we were strong in our resolve to deliver, and deliver fast,"" Sandhini says, with a touch of pride. Image copyright Getty Images Armed with masks and gloves, they got to work. At the local government school, they put the soaked furniture out to dry and rid the classrooms of slush and worms. She says it was disheartening to listen to school officials tell them how many computers had been damaged and how many books and school records had been destroyed. At the government-run day care centres, they disinfected the floors multiple times because large patches of fungi had spread in many of the centres; and they dug pits for stored food that had begun to decompose. ""Now, every time I pass by, the teacher thanks me for our help,"" Sandhini says with a smile. Over a period of two weeks, they cleared debris, segregated waste and sold wrecked furniture and other items to scrap shops. They swept roads, mopped floors and scrubbed the insides of schools and hospitals. ""I couldn't afford to donate a lot of money so I gave my time and labour instead,"" Sandhini says. Image copyright Sharique Ahmad The women exchanged the saris they usually wore in favour of salwar kameez - a popular Indian outfit in which a long tunic is paired with pleated trousers. The trousers allowed them to move more freely, helping them wade through deep puddles and navigate other dangers - like the snakes, scorpions and various kinds of insects the floods had brought into people's homes. ""Wherever we went, locals helped us,"" Sandhini says. ""Men lifted heavy bins, picked broken glass and helped catch snakes."" The health centre, she says, was the worst place to clean. The smell - from the broken septic tanks and the overflowing toilets - was ""revolting"". Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption The Kerala Chief Minister has said the state has ""never seen anything like this before"" Some volunteers fell ill, which triggered panic as they feared they had leptospirosis or rat fever. This happens when rats drown in flood water which contaminates it further, allowing the bacteria to spread. The disease claimed 11 lives in Kerala in two days. ""I also had fever for a few days but that was expected - we were tired and needed to rest,"" says Sandhini. Throughout, she had stayed in relief camps or at the homes of friends and relatives, depending on where her cleaning drive took her next. ""We had access to safe food and water because people were generous,"" she says. When she finally went home after two weeks, she says everyone recognised her. ""I was a known face in my neighbourhood. The smile they give me is a symbol of Kudumbashree's success.""",Sandhini Gopakumar led a group of women volunteers in Kerala in the aftermath of devastating floods.,2018-10-02T21:41:14Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Kerala flood aftermath: Battling snakes and sewage to clean a city,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-45545576,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/18372/production/_103068199_048704892-1.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,flood,0

(Photo: Brian Powers, Rodney White/The Register) Buy Photo Though emergency officials expected a storm in Des Moines on Saturday, the sheer strength of it took people by surprise, according to a news conference on Sunday. ""It’s hard to predict how that water is going to rise and how quickly it’s going to come,"" said Sgt. Paul Parizek, spokesman for Des Moines police. ""The speed and how long that rain fell caught us by surprise."" For the near future, the heavy rain has ended across central Iowa, according to Kelsey Angle, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Des Moines. Between 3 to 8 inches of rain fell rapidly across the Des Moines metro Saturday, contributing to ""catastrophic flooding,"" Angle said. Walnut Creek at 63rd Street recorded the highest crest on record just over 19 feet, Angle said. Take a look from above as water spills over the banks of Walnut Creek in Windsor Heights. Rodney White and Michael Zamora, The Register The Saylorville Lake reservoir is forecast to crest at about 888 feet by next weekend — a depth that is above the lip of the concrete emergency spillway, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday. On Sunday, 20,500 cubic square feet was flowing out. ""We are not anticipating a flood release that is uncontrolled out of Saylorville,"" said Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie. Much of the Des Moines area got 6 to 7 inches of rain in less than three hours Saturday, and the flash flooding resulted in one death, rescues of people stranded in their vehicles, apartment evacuations and a house explosion in Urbandale. At least 100 people have been displaced, according to the American Red Cross. As of 9 a.m. on Sunday, the Saylorville Lake reservoir stands at 878.39 feet, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. It increased over 2 feet in the last 24 hours. Saylorville Lake reached 866.6 feet above sea level Tuesday afternoon, an increase of more than 15 feet in just five days. The top of the dam's spillway is at 884 feet; that figure can be increased to 890 feet with the use of pneumatic crest gates. When in use, the inflatable pneumatic crest gate pushes water back from the lake's spillway dam and allows engineers to keep channeling it through the dam's main gates. This helps control erosion on the spillway. Last Slide Next Slide Saylorville Lake hit a historic high level on July 11, 1993, when it crested at 892 feet above sea level. On June 12, 2008, the lake level rose to 891 feet above sea level. The most heavily damaged areas in the Des Moines area are along Fourmile Creek and Walnut Creek in the metro, said A.J. Mumm, Polk County Emergency Management Director. The worst flooding damages are along the Fourmile Creek from East Douglas Avenue all the way to Pleasant Hill, until it meets the Des Moines River. Damage is along Walnut Creek through Urbandale, Clive, Windsor Heights and Des Moines. Walnut Creek flooded at record levels during Saturday's deluge. A little east of Clive, the creek at 63rd Street in Des Moines set a record when it crested at 11:45 p.m. at 19.08 feet. The previous high was 18.7 in 2015. ""We've seen truly historic crests on both of the waterways,"" Mumm said. Fleur Drive in Des Moines appears to be safe as of Sunday morning, but residents in the eastern side of town should use caution near the Fourmile Creek area, where numerous buildings were evacuated Sunday because of record flooding, said Chad Christensen, Des Moines Public Works flood systems engineer. How to deal with a flooded home: The latest forecast from the National Weather Service in Des Moines shows the Raccoon River cresting at 16.5 feet near Fleur Drive — just on the brink of when water comes on to the road. If no additional rain hits the metro, the road will not have to close, Christensen said. Public works is focusing its attention along the Fourmile Creek area, which was hit with 6 to 10 inches of rain along its base, Christensen said. Drivers are advised to stay away. Road damage has been reported along Second Avenue, where water peeled and displaced the asphalt. Birdland Drive and Prospect Road are also closed. The city closed the gate that’s a part of the Birdland levee across from Saylor Road as a precaution. It’s been all-hands-on-deck in the public works department as crews survey and fix damages since 8 p.m. Saturday, Christensen told the Register.

Anthony R. Wood,"With the prospect of several hours of potent, wave-inciting onshore winds from the season's first nor'easter, a coastal flood warning was in effect Saturday for the New Jersey Shore, a flood advisory was posted for Philadelphia, and the region's power companies were on alert for potential power outages. The National Weather Service on Friday also posted a wind advisory for the Shore until 11 a.m. Saturday, saying winds could gust to 45 mph and whip up waves of 7 to 10 feet; gusts of up to 60 mph were possible north of Atlantic City. The critical time for coastal flooding would be the first high tide, which occurs at 9:42 a.m. Saturday, said Weather Service meteorologist Lee Robertson. Astronomical tides would be a bit higher than usual given that while the moon will be waning, it still will be nearly full. The Weather Service said that ""widespread flooding of roadways is expected with many roads becoming impassable."" But after mid-morning Saturday, the flood threat, at least, was expected to ebb. The storm will be a quick mover, and Saturday ""night's high tide is actually lower"" than the morning one, Robertson said. Meanwhile, utility companies said crews were on standby in case of power outages, given the powerful winds and heavy rains, with 1 to 2 inches expected. Plus, because of the late leaf fall, trees still are laden with surprisingly green leaves, and soils remain wet from weeks of heavy rain. That could make trees vulnerable to gusts. ""We are ready to respond,"" said Frank Tedesco, spokesperson for Atlantic City Electric Co. Philadelphia International Airport is advising travelers to check with their airlines for potential flight delays. The storm is going to get an additional charge from strong winds in the upper atmosphere, the Weather Service office in Mount Holly said in its Friday morning discussion. Rain is forecast to continue well into the afternoon Saturday but should be over by nightfall.

MAGGIE HABERMAN and MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT,"Mr. Cobb also predicted a quick end to the investigation. “I’d be embarrassed if this is still haunting the White House by Thanksgiving and worse if it’s still haunting him by year end,” Mr. Cobb was quoted as saying. But Mr. Dowd’s personal relationship Mr. Mueller never developed, and he began clashing with the special counsel’s office over whether Mr. Trump would be interviewed. Mr. Dowd has since said that he believes Mr. Mueller “snookered” the Trump team into cooperating. In March, Mr. Dowd resigned, telling associates that he disagreed with the president’s desire to sit for an interview with Mr. Mueller — one form of cooperation he opposed — and leaving Mr. Sekulow with the task of rebuilding the legal team from scratch, and without knowing many of the details of the case. Because Mr. Trump and his advisers had concluded that the only real threat to him was impeachment, Mr. Giuliani was brought in to lead the effort to undermine Mr. Mueller’s credibility with the public, while the husband and wife legal team of Jane and Marty Raskin, former federal prosecutors based in Florida, was hired to deal directly with Mr. Mueller’s office. To deal with the investigation of Mr. Cohen in New York, Mr. Trump hired Joanna C. Hendon. And with Mr. Flood brought on to replace Mr. Cobb, who had also departed, a new, more aggressive team had taken shape. But if the policy of cooperation had ended, the turmoil among the lawyers had not. Ten days after The Times reported that Mr. McGahn had cooperated extensively with Mr. Mueller, Mr. Trump tweeted that Mr. McGahn would be leaving the White House in the fall. That came as a surprise to Mr. McGahn, who had not discussed his departure with Mr. Trump since earlier this year. Since then, Mr. Trump has had discussions with Mr. Flood about replacing Mr. McGahn. But Mr. Flood is hesitant, in part because that could pull him away from one of the main reasons he initially joined the White House: to represent another president in impeachment proceedings.","John Dowd, the first head of President Trump’s legal team, pursued a strategy of cooperation with the special counsel investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election.",2018-09-18T09:00:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Trump’s Growing Legal Team Has a Problem: It’s Operating Partly in the Dark,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/us/politics/trump-legal-team-lawyers.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/06/us/politics/06dc-legal-1/06dc-legal-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,flood,0
Michael Bociurkiw,"Michael Bociurkiw is a global affairs analyst, at work on his first nonfiction book on screen and social media addiction. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinions on CNN. (CNN) About 41 million Americans live in areas that have a chance of flooding -- and the number exposed to serious flooding is as much as 3.1 times higher than previous estimates. Time is clearly not on our side. Sea levels are rising faster than predicted, and homeowners in particularly vulnerable areas, such as South Florida, could see their properties literally under water within their lifetimes. Relative sea levels there are roughly four inches higher now than in 1992; various projections, including by the Army Corps of Engineers, see rises in South Florida of 12 inches by 2030 and between 2 to 3 feet by 2060. What's more, ""rare events are going to become more common in the future strictly due to sea level rise,"" William Sweet, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), told The Guardian. And so it would make some sense that as officials tally the damage from Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas, with 41 dead and insured losses estimated at $2.5 billion, coastal homeowners and businesses might conduct their own tallies of the cost of continuing to live in places vulnerable to flooding and high winds. Yet, national and local leaders appear to be sleepwalking toward climate catastrophe. Based on my own exchanges over the years with municipal mayors from both inland and coastal jurisdictions, my sense is that few view it as a top priority -- especially those in places such as South Florida, where the property tax base is the main source of income. Rather than curbing building in vulnerable areas or returning flood-prone areas to nature, jurisdictions such as Miami Beach have opted to spend millions on flood abatement projects. And for their part, financial markets deflect reality. Climate change ""is a very slow-moving disaster that may last decades before it has any effect on the markets,"" Wall Street investor Michael Popow told me. ""In the meantime it is another negative in the macro-economic environment which will, sooner than later, cause the markets to crash."" But this disaster is not so slow-moving. Monster storms are coming faster and with more ferocity (last year was the f irst time in over a decade t hat four hurricanes made US landfall in one season), and a growing number of coastal dwellers have now lived through multiple storms, with some not even fully recovered from the last one. By one estimate, from Seattle-based Zillow Research, based on current projections by NOAA of ocean levels rising six feet by 2100, almost 2 million properties -- or roughly 2% of US housing stock, worth $882 billion -- could be under water in a little over 75 years. Close to half of that loss in value would occur in Florida alone, where 1 in 8 properties, worth a total of $400 billion, are threatened. As Zillow points out, given the insatiable appetite for waterfront properties, these numbers could be on the conservative side if development is allowed to continue in vulnerable areas. In fact sea-level rise is already swamping coastal property values: research b y the First Street Foundation has tabulated a home value loss of $14.1 billion across eight coastal US states since 2005. Ironic, is it not, that some of the most coveted and expensive property in the US is also becoming the most vulnerable -- and is on a depreciation cycle. In my frequent trips to South Florida, I encounter more and more people who are contemplating moving away from the waterfront -- especially in flood-prone Miami Beach, where even on clear days during high tides, and even with billions spent on flood alleviation measures, residents can encounter so-called blue-sky flooding. According to one study, such high-tide flooding there has increased by more than 400% in the last 12 years. In short: if you're a young to middle-aged homeowner near water in South Florida, there is a chance that your property will be under water by the time you are a senior - or more likely when the time comes to sign the title over to little Jane or Johnny. John Hilliard's approach towards rising sea levels is probably typical of many of those who reside on the Venetian Islands. The elevation of his new waterfront home in Miami Beach is at about nine feet above sea level. ""That's reasonably high,"" he told me. ""I do see larger rain events due to the greater water-holding ability of a warmer atmosphere. But that rain should run off my island into the sea,"" instead of flooding and staying. ""After 2100 we will be wishing we took this issue seriously as the loss of property will be enormous."" What will be the trigger to cause mass panic or a collapse of the waterfront property bubble? The former mayor of Coral Gables, James Cason, offers a stark scenario: when water levels in that tony community rise to the point where the masts of sailboats are unable to pass under its main bridge, that is when people will ""suddenly see their property values go down because they can no longer get a boat out. So that will be one of the first indicators (of sea level rise) and a wake-up call for people."" Of course, outward migration from places like Coral Gables will translate into a slimmer property tax ledger for the seaside town, which in turn creates challenges for such municipalities to provide essential services. And municipal bonds, already in a precarious state, could sink even further when they are issued by jurisdictions known to have massive flooding problems. While it would take a lot for cities like Miami Beach to be abandoned, rising tides and more frequent monster storms are becoming, like the ravaging forest fires in California, a new normal. One study predicts there will be as many as 13 million ""climate refugees"" in America by the end of the century -- with the hardest-hit county being Miami-Dade. Even with inaction by a White House that prefers to ignore or deny climate change -- withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement and activating rollbacks on the Clean Power Plan -- there are localized measures that could defer a crash of the US coastal property bubble due to rising sea levels. Mayors need to step up to the plate and use the tools and policies at their disposal. One, which has already been implemented in many developing countries in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, is to return vulnerable areas to nature. That happened in the US, in flood-prone Mastic Beach, New York, after Superstorm Sandy, where damaged homes were bought back and the land transformed into wetlands. Sea walls and strict building codes can force people to build away from vulnerable areas. ""Part of the solution is being smart about where we continue to develop,"" said Steven McAlpine, an analyst with First Street. Waiting to see what happens from this slow-moving disaster is not an option. Once Donald Trump, his supporters in the fossil fuel industry and others accept what is happening it's going to be too late and too expensive for a fix.","In vulnerable areas, such as South Florida, homeowners could see their properties literally under water within their lifetimes, writes Michael Bociurkiw.

Following is a transcript of the video. This waterproof cover protects your car in a flood. It's called the Flood Guard. It claims to protect your car from floating away or being damaged by debris. It was inspired by waterproof bags used at the beach. Here's how it works. 1) Lay the bag down on a flat surface. 2) Hold the bag open. 3) Slowly drive or push your car into the bag. 4) Turn off your car and exit. 5) Zip the bag up. 6) Fold the zippered edge toward the car. 7) Connect the rear of the bag to the front using the straps. 8) Attach the padding. 9) Secure at least two straps to a post, tree, or fixed structure. This will keep your car from floating away. Now, your car is ready for water. After finding success with the Flood Guard Securo Inc. made an updated version. The new version takes only one person to set up. It can be set up in minutes. And it's lighter than the original. The shape allows one person to roll the bag over the car.

"Nicole Chavez, CNN","(CNN) South Carolina National Guardsmen allowed deputies to drive around a barricade blocking a flooded road in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence moments before two mental health patients drowned inside the vehicle, authorities say. Two deputies escaped when high water swept away their vehicle on September 18 but they could not pull out the patients on board, the Horry County Sheriff's Office said. Horry County spokeswoman Brooke Holden revealed on Thursday that guardsmen had waved the jail van around a barricade near the Little Pee Dee River in South Carolina. The river was over its flood stage at the time. It's unclear why the guardsmen allowed the jail van to pass. Lt. Col. Cindi King, the South Carolina National Guard's director of public affairs, declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. The sheriff's deputies who drove the prison van -- Stephen Flood and Joshua Bishop -- are on administrative leave with pay, Holden said. The victims were identified as Windy Newton, 45, of Shallotte, North Carolina, and Nicolette Green, 43, of Myrtle Beach. The deputies were transporting the women from Conway, near the coast, to Darlington, about 65 miles northwest. Harrowing police scanner audio provides details of the efforts to save the women, who could be heard talking as rescuers scrambled to save them. ""The officers report they got out. The van is submerged, and they cannot get their inmates out,"" an unidentified person says. Later, someone else reports, ""We have the two deputies that are out of the van and are secure on the boat. The two inmates are in the back of the van -- are still in the van -- and they're talking, and they're working on getting them out now."" The women were ""seat belted"" in the back of the van, Horry County Chief Deputy Tom Fox said. Rescue teams were able to save the deputies from the van's roof. But they could not pull the vehicle from the water because it was too dangerous, the sheriff's office said. The women's bodies were recovered by divers the following day and taken to Medical University of South Carolina for autopsies, officials said. CNN's Dave Alsup, Eliott McLaughlin and Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","South Carolina National Guardsmen allowed deputies to drive around a barricade blocking a flooded road in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence moments before two mental health patients drowned inside the vehicle, authorities say.",2018-09-28T05:18:25Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Two patients transported in police van drown after guardsmen allow it to pass flood barrier,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/28/us/florence-flood-jail-van-drowning/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180919164431-little-pee-dee-river-south-carolina-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,flood,0
Reuters Editorial,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said on Friday it will resume issuing new flood insurance policies during the partial U.S. government shutdown, reversing a decision announced two days ago. 
FEMA, which oversees the National Flood Insurance Program, said it was rescinding guidance issued on Wednesday that it would not be able to sell new policies during the shutdown unless Congress passes legislation reauthorizing the program. 
“As of this evening, all NFIP insurers have been directed to resume normal operations immediately and advised that the program will be considered operational since December 21, 2018, without interruption,” FEMA said on its website. 
The National Association of Realtors estimated the decision not to issue new policies could have disrupted up to 40,000 home sales each month. 
The flood insurance program insures about 5 million homes and businesses. 
The federal government has been partially shut down since Dec. 22 because of an impasse over President Donald Trump’s demand for $5 billion in taxpayer funding for a proposed border wall.

Jessica Dolcourt,"Ready or not, 5G data is at your doorstep. Samsung and Verizon made that fact crystal clear. Last Wednesday, Verizon lit up its 5G network, claiming it to be the world's first. Two days later, the largest phone maker on the planet began selling its first 5G device, the Galaxy S10 5G, in its home country of South Korea. These two events prove 5G is off to a very real, if slow, start. 
I tested Verizon's days-old 5G network in Chicago, one of its two launch cities. Some results were encouraging, but mostly my experience revealed how far Verizon has to go to make its newborn network stable enough to support phones like the Moto Z3 with a 5G Moto Mod, and the Galaxy S10 5G, when that device comes to the US.
Read also: Verizon gets sassy over 5G data speeds, then smack-talks AT&amp;T and T-Mobile
Samsung's exact US launch date is unconfirmed, but the S10 5G is rumored to go on preorder sale April 18, with a May 16 launch. It'll come exclusively to Verizon before heading to AT&amp;T, Sprint and T-Mobile. 
It's entirely possible that Samsung is deliberately holding back the S10 5G launch until Verizon's new 5G network becomes a little more stable, and perhaps more widespread. Right now it's available only in Chicago and Minneapolis (and in mere downtown hotspots at that), but Verizon says its 5G service will come to 30 cities by the end of 2019.  
Neither Samsung nor Verizon immediately responded to a request for comment on my theory.
I did get a chance to go hands-on with the Galaxy S10 5G in February. A little larger than the Galaxy S10 Plus -- it's a kind of an S10 Plus Plus -- the S10 5G has a 6.7-inch screen, a total of six cameras and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 chipset. It's absolutely a premium phone, though we'll need to see how some of its features, like its depth-sensing front and rear cameras, will work on the phone day to day. 
I did get an early demo of portrait video, which gives the background a blurred Bokeh effect, but it did need a little work to keep a moving subject separated from the background. 
Samsung also showed off a live demo of manipulating players in a baseball game being streamed over 5G. You could actually rotate them to take a look. That's not something a 4G phone can do.
Speeds will come at a cost
Samsung and Verizon haven't announced pricing for the Galaxy S10 5G, but we do know it'll cost more than the $1,000 Galaxy S10 Plus. My educated guess puts it at $1,100 or $1,200 all in. Verizon's 5G service also costs $10 more per month on top of your regular data plan. 
At a time when phone costs are rising, the advent of 5G is one more burden, or barrier, for people on a budget trying to keep up with the times. While we know costs will come down at least some after the new technology settles in, that could still be years away.
Verizon and Motorola both point to price as a main reason you might want the Moto Z3 and 5G Mod. With the total cost of ownership under $440 with both elements currently on sale and $830 at full retail price, Motorola's option may be the only midprice 5G choice until other phonemakers ramp up their own portfolios.

You can actually swivel this player on the Galaxy S10 5G to catch a different angle.

Samsung gets another chance
For Samsung, the Galaxy S10 5G is another opportunity to turn a profit and keep its spot at the top. Samsung's felt the chill of a slowing smartphone market, expecting revenue far below this same time last year, despite strong Galaxy S10 Plus preorders. 
It could be that customers are waiting for 5G and foldable phones to debut before making the decision to upgrade to a ""flat"" 4G phone. 
On that note, Samsung's foldable Galaxy Fold arrives April 26 for 4G networks, with a 5G variation coming out sometime after.
That said, CNET doesn't recommend rushing out to buy a first-wave 5G phone. Verizon's shaky 5G start is one deterrent. Higher prices for both the phone and 5G data service are another. But there's one more good reason to wait, too, and that's a new chip that can make 5G phones slimmer and more efficient. Those devices will be ready by the end of the year.
So while 5G is ready for you, you might not quite be ready for it.

Adam Rosenberg,"John McCain died on Saturday after a year-long struggle with brain cancer. He was an undisputed war hero and a Republican Senator with a complicated history as a legislator. McCain stood for a more principled brand of conservatism than many of his modern G.O.P. peers, and often expressed his distaste for the street-fighting and mud-slinging that defines Trumpism. SEE ALSO: John McCain, ever the political dramatist, has always understood the value of TV comedy Over the years, McCain earned a reputation for breaking ranks from his fellow Republicans. He didn't always cast his votes in ways that more left-leaning thinkers would have preferred, but in his words at least he took care to show respect and consideration for the views of his colleagues across the aisle. Those qualities in particular became an increasingly refreshing presence in a post-2016 political atmosphere that's largely been defined by partisan bickering and below-the-belt scheming. McCain served with honor, even at a time when fewer and fewer of his colleagues can say the same. Prior to entering politics — a career that included more than 30 years in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, as well as a competitive presidential campaign in 2008 against Barack Obama — McCain was a military man. He joined the U.S. Navy in the late '50s and became a pilot. Over the years, McCain earned a reputation for breaking ranks from fellow Republicans. McCain didn't see his first combat assignment until 1967, when the Vietnam War was in full swing. Less than a year into his service — during his 23rd bombing run — McCain's plane was shot down and he was captured by North Vietnamese forces. He then spent the next five and a half years as a prisoner of war, until his release in 1973. He continued to serve in the years after his release, eventually taking on the role of the U.S. Navy's liaison to the Senate. McCain retired in 1981 as a highly decorated captain. During his time in the Navy, he earned two Silver Stars, two Legions of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, three Bronze Star Medals, two Purple Hearts, two Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals, and a Prisoner of War Medal. This handful of paragraphs doesn't fully capture McCain's long and illustrious career. It should, however, give you the sense of a man who devoted his life to serving his country — which McCain certainly did. He's better remembered by the words of those who knew him. There are plenty of those to go around today as the McCain's family, friends, colleagues, and even political rivals have taken to social media to share their touching remembrances of the departed Senator.

He named the birds singing above us in the branches. He quoted lines from the novels he loved. We reminisced about the past, of personalities come and gone. He spoke wistfully of those he admired and expressed optimism that such leaders would rise up in the future. And now, in a way that would probably have him making wisecracks, we are wistful for John McCain. We may never see his like again, but it is his reflection of America that we need now more than ever. He was far too self-deprecating to ever have thought of himself as just such a towering figure, so I will go ahead and say it. He showed us who we are and who we can be when we are at our best. And he devoted his life to service and to the exalted idea of America that was bigger and better than him. Bigger than us all. His fidelity to that idea, and his idealism in balancing fierce political battles with a determination to always see the good and find the humanity in his opponents is an example that transcended politics and made him the man that he was.",John McCain died on Saturday after a year-long struggle with brain cancer.

Katie Reilly,"In March, President Donald Trump angrily denied that he was unhappy with his lawyers handling the Russia investigation and refuted a report that he planned to hire another high-powered attorney. “They are doing a great job,” he tweeted. Less than two months later, Trump is making those very changes to his legal team. The White House announced Wednesday that lawyer Ty Cobb will retire at the end of the month, and Emmett Flood, an attorney who represented Bill Clinton during his impeachment, will join the White House legal team. The White House confirmed Flood’s hiring after it was originally reported by the New York Times. “Emmet Flood will be joining the White House Staff to represent the President and the administration against the Russia witch hunt,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement on Wednesday. “Ty Cobb, a friend of the President, who has done a terrific job, will be retiring at the end of the month.” The White House said Cobb had been discussing his retirement for “several weeks.” On March 11, Trump responded to a New York Times report that he wanted to add Flood to the legal team. “The Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. Wrong. I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job,” Trump tweeted. One month later, he added: “I have agreed with the historically cooperative, disciplined approach that we have engaged in with Robert Mueller (Unlike the Clintons!) I have full confidence in Ty Cobb, my Special Counsel, and have been fully advised throughout each phase of this process.” Since then, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has also joined Trump’s legal team. The move comes as Trump intensifies his criticism of the Mueller probe, calling it a “witch hunt” and a “setup and trap.” On Monday, the New York Times published a list of more than four dozen questions that Mueller wants to ask Trump in an interview. Trump’s attorneys have not yet agreed to an interview, but Trump condemned the publication of the list of questions as “disgraceful.” In a tweet on Wednesday, Trump also threatened to use his powers as President to “get involved” in the investigation.","In March, Trump denied a report he was hiring Emmett Flood.

KATE ZERNIKE,"“Republicans are going, ‘Are you Trump or are you not Trump?’ ‘Are you this or are you that?’” she said. “You know what? This is no time to worry. Just get out and vote, and vote for the party, people, because the other side has gone way far left and it’s going to continue.” The district of red-roofed Spanish-style McMansions and oceanside golf courses stretches from southern Orange County to northern San Diego County and includes the Marine base at Camp Pendleton. The crowd cheering Ms. Harkey included several veterans and a woman with a sparkling flag pin. A leader of a local Republican women’s club noted proudly that her red dress was from Ivanka Trump’s label. As Ms. Harkey called out to make sure she had not missed any local officials — “School board, water board, anything else?” — a man in the crowd replied, “I’m all for waterboarding!” Ms. Harkey told her story of arriving in California as a young girl from Illinois and having to peel onions with the Mexican bracero workers to earn $11 for her first Barbie doll. She went to community college and the University of California-Irvine, working her way up in banking and to become mayor of Dana Point, a wealthy oceanfront enclave. She served six years in the California State Assembly and is now a member of a board that reviews state tax assessments. After nearly two decades of voting Republican in presidential races, the district went for Mrs. Clinton by 7 points in 2016. And Pat Bates, a state senator, warned the crowd at Ms. Harkey’s headquarters that Democrats had “overperformed” in their voter registration efforts in the June primaries. “We need boots on the ground,” she said. “Every single Republican has got to vote or we’re looking at a socialist southern Orange County and north San Diego, I kid you not.” The women at the Flip the 49th headquarters, who worked hard for that overperformance, began their activism out of concerns about the Trump administration dismantling the Affordable Care Act.

CHRIS DIXON and CAMPBELL ROBERTSON,"In a bad wind, a pile can quickly become an arsenal or at least clog storm drains. So far, though, the brunt of the storm has missed the areas with the most flood debris. Still, recovery efforts will be slow, officials said, as some flood-prone areas that had begun to rebuild now have to wait for waters to recede again. Theres people who had their homes damaged during Florence and now theres going to be some winds that could further damage their homes and property, said Mike Sprayberry, the director of the North Carolina Emergency Management agency, describing how a 50-mile-an-hour gust could rip the tarp off a house that was in the midst of repairs, sending rain pouring back inside. Federal disaster recovery centers set up in the Carolinas after Florence were closed on Thursday because of Michael. Schools in many parts of North Carolina have yet to reopen after Florence close to 90,000 students have been out of school for weeks. As Michael came into the state, there were more than 575 people still in shelters from the last storm and many others who would have likely needed them but are living in hotel rooms paid for with temporary disaster aid. In an era of climate change, the reality of the last few disasters just means a head start on this one. It almost just feels like another day at the office now, said Harrison Cahill, the spokesman for Lexington County, S.C., talking of a neighborhood with flooded homes in the county. He knew the homes firsthand, having visited in his previous job as a newspaper reporter, when they flooded in 2015.","Communities in the Carolinas already battered by Hurricane Florence faced a new onslaught: Hurricane Michael, downgraded to a tropical storm, but still packing a punch.",2018-10-11T22:52:23Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",They Were Still Recovering from Hurricane Florence.

MICHAEL KIMMELMAN,"‘Don’t California My Texas’ Jim Blackburn, a planner, environmental lawyer and something of a lightning rod around here, has been warning for years about climate change, the decrepit state of Houston’s reservoirs and the perils of developing the Katy Prairie. He remembers escaping years ago to the prairie to bird watch. One recent morning he drove me out there along the Grand Parkway and pulled into an unfinished subdivision. A saleswoman in a model home boasted about $1 billion worth of box stores and malls being built nearby. The development, she said, adheres to county standards requiring that houses be raised above the 100-year floodplain. The woman handed Mr. Blackburn a glossy brochure and a disclaimer, which he scanned before climbing back into the car, shaking his head. The disclaimer explained that roads outside the development, linking it to the parkway, occupy the 10-year floodplain, meaning they would have about a 10 percent chance of flooding every year. “These days that means they’ll flood anytime you look at them funny,” Mr. Blackburn said. “It’s the new normal.” That’s not far-off. The number of “heavy precipitation” events in the United States has skyrocketed since the 1960s. Since 1980, instances of extreme weather — hurricanes, floods, heat waves — linked to climate change have cost the United States $1.1 trillion. Studies show that for every dollar spent upfront in preparedness, American taxpayers could save $4 in emergency relief and reconstruction — not counting health costs, the impact of lost jobs and business revenues and incalculable grief. But that requires politicians to agree. “We suffered nothing short of a catastrophic disaster,” a veteran Texas lobbyist, Bill Miller, said. “It happens at a time when the people in the governing class in this state don’t believe in taxes and government. But they also don’t want anybody discouraged from coming here, because that’s bad for business.” An upbeat narrative casts business-friendly Texas in the loner role of swashbuckling cowboy, disdainful of coastal elites. “Don’t California my Texas” has become a rallying cry for Republican state lawmakers and a theme repeated by the governor, Greg Abbott, who has complained about “a patchwork quilt of bans and rules and regulations that is eroding the Texas model.” He believes cities are the culprit. For years, Texas Republicans promoted local controls to push against federal court orders on issues like desegregation and same-sex marriage. Now state leaders have made a U-turn. Mr. Abbott has complained about “political demagogues using climate change as an excuse to remake the American economy.” At a Republican gathering in June, he talked about the experience of driving out of the state’s capital, Austin. “It starts smelling different,” he told the audience. “And you know what that fragrance is? Freedom.” Little wonder, post-Harvey, that state and local officials have anointed different flood and recovery czars. Texas is sounding these days like Russia under the Romanovs. The system ensures nobody is clearly in charge. Least of all in Houston. A bill that would have allowed Harris County merely to issue the equivalent of parking tickets to developers violating floodplain regulations — the sort of regulations that control flooding — was vetoed by the governor. Two other bills to study flooding in the Houston region, introduced in the last legislative session, died in committee. And not long ago, when Houston’s Democratic mayor, Sylvester Turner, petitioned the governor to tap into the state’s multibillion-dollar Rainy Day Fund for post-Harvey debris removal, Mr. Abbott said he would not authorize money before 2019, when the Legislature is next scheduled to meet. I met with the mayor in City Hall at the time. He noted that the Legislature had convened a special session to ban gender-neutral bathrooms. “If they can meet about toilets, why can’t they meet when the toilets overflow?” one frustrated city official said, before Mr. Abbott came up with $50 million from a separate fund to stem growing criticism. Another official, this one with the county, made the point that the area around Houston is a patchwork of counties and municipalities with different rules and no coordination because Texans believed the upside of what became, in essence, institutionalized entropy was that it allowed residents to avoid the encumbrances of city governments, regulations and taxes. The problem is that hurricanes and floods, worsened by climate change, do not recognize political borders or county lines. Their toll is shared by everyone. The latest estimate from Moody’s puts recovery from Harvey at $81 billion, much of which will end up paid by taxpayers across the United States. “The whole trans-Mississippi pioneer enterprise was in fact brought to you by the federal government,” says Steven Conn, a historian and author of “Americans Against the City.” The hypocrisy of Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, resisting federal aid to the New York region after Hurricane Sandy but then requesting it for Texas after Harvey, is in fact part of this same history. Houston’s unregulated sprawl, Mr. Conn added, gives physical form to this politics of “decentralization and anti-statism.” Photo Bruce Hooper, outside his home in Kashmere Gardens in Houston, would like to move but has no place to go.

Credit Josh Haner/The New York Times A Houston Selling Point: It’s Not New York At the same time, Houston is in many ways a forward-looking, progressive city. Before it elected Mr. Turner, it elected a mayor who was a lesbian. The city is in thrall to cars and highways and has precious little mass transit, but the municipality of Houston relies more on renewable energy than any other big city in America. Houston has more green space, relative to paved, than New York. And what many Houston residents like about it, its supporters say, is precisely that it isn’t New York or San Francisco or Boston. They insist that its business-friendly, light-on-regulations approach helps account for a big rise in employment since 2000. A report by the city’s Center for Opportunity Urbanism, a pro-development organization, which cautions against overreacting to Harvey, said: “The city emanates a conviction that people should have the freedom to determine their destiny.” Photo Houston’s sprawl, and its dependence on the automobile, contributed to the misery that Hurricane Harvey unleashed. Credit Josh Haner/The New York Times Thomas Cole, director of the McGovern Center for Humanities and Ethics at the Texas Medical School of Houston, recalled how, during the 1960s, business leaders and politicians conspired with media executives to desegregate Houston quietly, seeing the turmoil that desegregation was causing elsewhere in the South. Decades later, Houston boasts of becoming the most diverse big city in the country, with comparatively low housing costs that translate to higher levels of minority homeownership. But what does “affordable” really mean if residents have to pay hefty transportation costs and rebuild, time and again, after floods? Houston’s affordability leans on loosely regulated, low-cost immigrant labor providing an abundance of cheaply made, slab-on-grade, single-family houses that sprawl on all that open land, in areas like the Katy Prairie. And it relies heavily on American taxpayers providing government tax credits, mortgage interest deductions, gas subsidies, artificially low flood insurance rates, highway construction money — and emergency relief, including buying out homeowners to remove their properties from harm’s way. Harris County officials say they have received as many requests for buyouts since the hurricane (3,000) as there have been buyouts since the mid-1990s. Harvey turned out to be an equal opportunity disaster. In Meyerland, an affluent district where Brays Bayou burst its banks, Steve and Julie Sacks’s house flooded for the third time in three years. They are among the homeowners hoping for a buyout. “But I’m not counting on one,” Mr. Sacks told me. Buying out rich homes to repurpose vulnerable areas like Meyerland for flood detention, as Mr. Sacks notes, would require loads of money and remove valuable properties from tax rolls in a county that relies on property taxes. Bruce Hooper would move, too. During Harvey, he woke up to crackling sounds, when floodwaters started to seep into his appliances and electrical outlets. Mr. Hooper lives in a poor area called Kashmere Gardens. I found him sitting on a tattered lawn chair outside the shell of his tumbledown rental. An unemployed former parks employee, Mr. Hooper told me that he and his family of five had to be airlifted out by the Coast Guard after a detention pond overflowed and water inside the house rose from ankle to chest high in an hour. He would live elsewhere, he said, but like many others without flood insurance or savings, “we got nowhere else to go.” Photo Andy and Christine Kahan inside their damaged home in Bear Creek Village. “Welcome to the war zone,” Mr. Kahan said. Credit Josh Haner/The New York Times As for Andy and Christine Kahan, they were among thousands who had no inkling they were especially vulnerable before Harvey. The Kahans own a single-story home in a middle-class neighborhood, Bear Creek Village. “The damn dam did us in,” Mr. Kahan said. The Kahans’s home was among those houses flooded by the reservoirs, which Harvey for the first time filled and threatened to overflow. Christine Kahan and her husband had lived for 28 years in their house without a flood. Now Ms. Kahan said she would entertain a buyout. A part-time real-estate agent, she advises clients to think twice about buying any home that flooded. Hers is now one of them. But Mr. Kahan says they will stay, for the time being. “I’m not a skeptic about climate change,” he told me. “It defies logic not to believe something is going on.” I asked how that lined up with his desire not to leave Bear Creek. “Harvey was an exception, an act of God,” he said, then added, “I know it doesn’t make sense. But I’m an optimist. “At least, I am until the next flood.” Continue reading the main story","Houston is drained by several meandering rivers, or bayous, that move water from west to east.

(CNN)Satellite images show just how high the water has risen along the Platte and Missouri Rivers, including a large portion of a US Air Force Base under water.
Upstream from Scribner, Nebraska, on the Elkhorn River, a flood gauge measured its second highest crest: 17.65 feet. The flood gauge just downstream from the town stopped reporting on Wednesday when minor flooding was taking place; it could have been affected by ice floes.
The images show how the Elkhorn River temporarily made the town of Scribner an island. It appears, looking at satellite imagery, the only connection for the almost 900 residents of the town was Highway 275.
Normally, the Logan Creek Dredge, the river that flows into the Elkhorn River, is barely visible. It, too, far exceeds its usual banks.
Downstream in Waterloo, Nebraska, the Elkhorn River rose to 24.64 feet, the highest ever measured.
It beat the previous record, set in 1962, by more than 5 feet. The Platte River, to the left in the image, also was at historic levels farther upstream, in Leshara, Nebraska.
How much water was flowing in the Platte River is apparent by how far it exceeds its banks between North Bend and Fremont, Nebraska.
The 28,000 residents of Fremont were cut off during the height of the flooding. While no injuries were reported, authorities were conducting rescue missions across the city.
In Ashland, Nebraska, the Platte River also saw record levels of flooding. The river there 24.35 feet on Saturday was over a foot higher than ever recorded.
The river swelled so much there, it cut through swathes of farmland, turning the highest points into islands.
Offutt Air Force Base sits along the Missouri River just south of Omaha, Nebarska. Satellite imagery from Planet Labs Inc. shows much of the base sitting in Missouri River floodwaters.
Floodwaters made it into some 30 buildings on base and nine aircraft were evacuated because of the flooding, officials said. They included eight variations of a C135, and one E4B, an advanced airborne command post known as a ""doomsday plane.""
One of the most dramatic images shows the mouth of the Platte River where it meets the Missouri River near La Platte, Nebraska.
The Sarpy County Sheriff's Office said it's still not safe enough to allow residents of the Hanson and Chris Lakes area back into their homes. A flood gauge just downstream on the Missouri River pegged its level at 40.62 feet on Saturday, over 4 feet above the historic crest.","Satellite images show just how high the water has risen along the Platte and Missouri Rivers, including a large portion of a US Air Force Base under water.",2019-03-18T21:54:42Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Satellite images show Nebraska and Iowa rivers swallowing towns,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/18/us/nebraska-iowa-floods-before-after-satellite-images-trnd/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318151844-oafb-missour-after-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,flood,1

Bonnie Burton,"Will fans save the Fox TV comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine from cancelation, after taking to Twitter? Fingers crossed. Fox When news hit on Thursday that the cop comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine was cancelled by Fox after five critically-acclaimed seasons due to low ratings, fans of the TV show were not happy and showed their disbelief and anger on Twitter. The TV series was a hit with fans for not only being hilarious, but also for tackling important topics such as racial profiling, sexuality and gun violence in the US. Brooklyn Nine-Nine was also the second-longest running TV show on Fox, behind New Girl. The show stars Andy Samberg, Andre Braugher, Melissa Fumero, Stephanie Beatriz, Chelsea Peretti, Joe Lo Truglio, Terry Crews, Dirk Blocker, and Joel McKinnon Miller, many of whom expressed their hope on Twitter that the series would not be cancelled after all. In addition to fan outrage, celebrities like Lin-Manuel Miranda, Seth Meyers, Mark Hamill and Sean Astin, just to name a few, also added their anger online about the show's unexpected cancellation. But there's hope: Hulu and TV station TBS have expressed interest in picking up the show, according to Deadline. Hopefully, Hulu will save Brooklyn Nine-Nine like it did with another fan-favorite previously canceled by Fox, The Mindy Project. Neither Fox nor Hulu immediately responded to a request for a comment. An episode about Brooklyn Nine-Nine's characters Jake and Amy's wedding will close out the show as the series finale, airing May 20 on Fox in the US and on Netflix in Australia. Until then, check out the cast, fan and celeb reactions below. From cast: I am still processing... don’t have all the words.. but.. These last 5 years have been incredible.

The minute you pick one up to take a bite, half a liter of burger juice pours onto your plate, making it a terrible place to set your burger down unless you’ve got a thing for soggy buns. Here’s my personal workaround. A hard-shell taco can break apart in your hands after just a couple bites if you’re not careful.… Read more Read Normally, you only have one option to avoid a sloppy, wet mess: once you pick up your burger, never set it down until you’ve finished it. It’s a fun game, but once you’ve won a few times, you realize it’s more fun to play the “drink beer and eat fries in between burger bites” game. Most places will automatically give you fries with your burger. I’m not sure, but it might actually be the law in most states. What I suggest is you take a few of those fries and lay them out on your plate, parallel to one another, and spaced out about a quarter of an inch. This is the “fry rack,” and it’s where you should now set your burger. Basically, you’ve created a kind of grate for burger juice to fall through down to the plate, as well as a dry platform for your burger to rest on. No more pools of burger juice, and no more soggy buns that fall apart before you’ve even managed to get halfway through that succulent half-pound patty. The fries also act as a sponge to soak up some of the juice before it can even begin to flood your plate. Granted, this method calls for the sacrifice of a few good fries, but they knew what they were getting into when they signed up. There is important information, and then there is very important information, and I would file… Read more Read If the fries that comprise your dry fry rack (that’s Shakespearean right there) start to get soggy, create a new fry rack on top of the old one with a perpendicular, crosshatching approach. You’ll once again be safe from juicy burgers.

Ben Paynter,"Several years ago, one of the eventual founders of One Concern nearly died in a tragic flood. Today, the company specializes in using artificial intelligence to predict how natural disasters are unfolding in real time on a city-block-level basis, in order to help disaster responders save as many lives as possible.As Fast Company wrote in November 2018:
“In 2014, Stanford student structural engineer Ahmad Wani was visiting family in his native Kashmir when a catastrophic flood struck. The rising waters stranded him and his family for seven days without food or water, during which they watched their neighbor’s home collapse, killing everyone inside.
After this horrifying experience, Wani was struck by just how disorganized the emergency response was. “There is no science behind how people should be rescued,” he says. “Disaster response is really random.”
To fix that, One Concern debuted Flood Concern in late 2018. It creates map-based visualizations of where water surges may hit hardest, up to five days ahead of an impending storm. For cities, that includes not just time-lapse breakdowns of how the water will rise, how fast it could move, and what direction it will be flowing, but also what structures will get swamped or washed away, and how differing mitigation efforts–from levy building to dam releases–will impact each scenario. It’s the winner of Fast Company’s 2019 World Changing Ideas Awards in the AI and Data category.

So far, Flood Concern has been retroactively tested against events like Hurricane Harvey to show that it could have predicted what areas would be most impacted well ahead of the storm. The company, which was founded in Silicon Valley in 2015, started with one of that region’s pressing threats: earthquakes. It’s since earned contracts with cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Cupertino, as well as private insurance companies.
Either way, a live field test is imminent as extreme weather events become more common. According to the National Centers for Environmental Information, the U.S. has experienced 241 severe weather events with damages exceeding $1 billion. In 2019, the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report ranked extreme weather like floods and storms its number one most pressing concern.
One Concern’s first offering, dubbed Seismic Concern, takes existing information from satellite images and building permits to figure out what kind of ground structures are built on, and what might happen if they started shaking. If a big one hits, the program can extrapolate from the epicenter to suggest the likeliest places for destruction, and then adjust as more data from things like 911 calls and social media gets factored in.

Flood Concern works similarly, but with a more dynamic set of variables. It includes soil saturation and building stability estimates but also how topography will affect potential runoff. Then it adds in factors like National Weather Service forecasts and U.S. Geological Survey data about nearby river or tidal flows to create a model that adjusts as the situation changes. “We look at how things change over space and time,” says One Concern cofounder and CTO Nicole Hu.
That allows emergency crews to figure out ahead of time what roads may still passable, and plan evacuation routes accordingly. The company can also overlay maps with existing demographic data to highlight what areas of a city might be especially in danger if people there don’t evacuate. It can also pinpoint crucial infrastructure like water tanks, electric plants, and hospitals that will need protecting–and run if/then hypotheticals about how to do that.
So far, the state of Arizona has signed on as a public partner. One Concern remains in discussion with other cities and is working with international development groups for how to affordably apply its services in developing countries. It’s also building another simulator, this time for wildfires. “For too long, we have only focused on how we can use technology to make things more convenient,” Hu says. “We want to bring innovative tech into the space to help [people] make better decisions, to help make those life-saving decisions.”","Flood Concern can help cities model flood damage and prepare better flood responses.

Jennie Dusheck,"Climate change used to seem like something that would confront our grandchildrena distant concern. Now, though, its staring us right in the face when we get up in the morning. People wade through seawater on sunlit Miami streets ; the Florida Panhandle, which rarely sees hurricanes, was recently flattened by a megastorm; and every year bigger and more frequent wildfires burn through Australia and California. As our planet warms up, the climate-related changes across the U.S. are well underway. Even if you havent had to cope with climate related problems yet, it may not be long before you have to protect your home from extreme weather, fire, flooding, or even sea level rise. To find out how climate change may affect your area, check out climate risks by region using the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit. A short video introduces the different parts of the website. You might want to go to the Steps to Resilience section that offers way to assess and reduce your risk. For example, your flood risk depends not just on your own home and where it sits, but also on things like how the city has channeled nearby creeks and what size culverts your local department of public works has installed beneath your street or road. When it rains harder than ever before, undersized culverts may be overwhelmed and creeks can back up and jump their banks, flooding homes and roads. In Santa Cruz, California, the citys climate action manager Tiffany Wise-West, PhD, has posted a detailed action plan, including a Practical Adaptation Actions for Residents. Were not covering every little thing, she says, but the Citys simple web page is a place for ordinary people to start. Santa Cruz County is one of the rare places that already has a detailed plan for the future. Ask your city and county government if they have a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan like this one. But even if your area doesnt, you can rough out a way to address the specific risks your home could face. In general, climate change experts talk about two ways of addressing climate change, preventing it and dealing with the consequences. Here we are focused on dealing with the consequences of climate change, sometimes called climate adaptation. Sea Level Rise Is your seaside condo at risk of looking like the castle in the bottom of a goldfish bowl? To find out, look up your area on Climate Centrals Surging Seas Risk Zone Map. Older climate models predict 1 to 4 feet of sea level rise by 2100. But depending on how quickly major ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica collapse, the sea could rise a dozen meters or more. For now, we dont know for sure when that might happen. For example, East Antarctics largest ice sheet is threatened by warm sea water slipping underneath it. That could set the front of it afloat and allow the massive landbound part to slide into the seaenough to raise global sea levels by nearly four meters (12 feet). Wise-West says the Santa Cruz plan is about the same whether the sea rises a meter in 80 years or sooner. Its just a matter of moving up the schedule, she says, looking serious. If you look at Port Arthur, Texas, on the Surging Seas website and set sea level to one meter (3 feet), you can glimpse the future. Here is Port Arthur today: Port Arthur is home to 50,000 people and the largest oil refinery in the United States. Heres what it could look like with one meter of sea level rise: That means that if you lived in Port Arthur, youd have to think about not only how sea level rise would affect your own backyard, but also how it would affect the oil refinery and how that would affect you. Thats a lesson to cast your net wide when thinking about how climate change might affect you through indirect effects. Go to your own address on the Surging Seas website and see what one meter of sea level rise looks like. Maybe your home is fine but the nearest fire station, the grocery store, and a power plant 30 miles down the coast will all be underwater. Think about the infrastructure you count on. Will it be okay? If the front steps of your condo are underwater, check your insurance policy to see, first, if you have purchased flood insurance and, second, if storm surges and sea level rise are covered. Have an emergency kit and an emergency plan for evacuating in case of a storm surge. But think longer term, too. You could put stilts under your house.

What do you Read more Read Flooding from rain and overflowing rivers might seem similar to flooding from sea level rise and in some ways a basement full of water is the same whether its freshwater or seawater. But there is a difference. Floods eventually recede. Even with climate change, it might be 10 or 50 years before another flood occurs in that location. Sea level rise not only doesnt recede, it will keep rising for the foreseeable future. If the sea is lapping at your driveway at high tide, it will be at your doorstep in time. If you are in doubt about whether your home could be affected by sea level rise, its not too soon to start thinking about moving inland, whether thats a just mile to higher ground or to another state. Boise, Idaho, is lovely and livable. Hotter Summers Government maps can help you estimate how much hotter itll get where you live. Phoenix, for example, is expected to go from about 92 days a year over 100 degrees F to 132 days a year by 2060. Until you move to (really lovely) Boise, here are a few things that will help protect your house from extreme heat: Paint your house white, and use the palest roofing you can find. Plant trees around your house to provide shade. Seal every crack in your attic. Insulate the attic and walls. Dont run an attic fanit may cool off the attic, but it will suck cool air right out of your house. Seal all gaps around electrical outlets or pipes coming through the wall. Weather strip your doors and replace leaky windows. Use fans to pull in cooler air in at night. Extreme Wind Hurricanes are becoming more powerful and more common. This is because warmer ocean water adds energy to tropical storms as they form. Meanwhile, tornados are occurring farther east than they used to and even showing up in unlikely places, such as California. Both kinds of extreme wind destroy buildings by ripping off roofs and hurling heavy objects through the air. Most building codes were written for relatively mild winds. You can build a house like this one that will withstand a category 5 hurricane. But if thats not in your budget, make your own house a bit sturdier with wind-resistant roofing, garage doors, and storm shutters. As always, be prepared to evacuate to a safer place when hurricanes are headed for your house.","Climate change used to seem like something that would confront our grandchildren—a distant concern.

"Kevin Pang on The Takeout, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","On my one trip to Austin, Texas, I stuffed an unholy quantity of food and drink inside my body. But what stuck with me (psychically)—even more so than Franklin Barbecue, La Barbecue, Micklethwaith, Qui, Uchi, the half dozen migas tacos, and the blur of food trailers—was an avocado-green coffee stand on South Congress called Jo’s. A trusted friend said a trip to Austin must include Jo’s Iced Turbo drink. This is the coffee stand with “I love you so much” scrawled on the side of the building and Instagrammed the world over. Jo’s describes its Iced Turbo as such: “Our signature sweet, creamy, cold coffee drink! Chocolate, hazelnut, coffee, and cream mixed together served over crushed ice.” The setting was ideal: a humid spring Texas day, so I opted for the large, 16-ounce cup for $4.50. This legendary beverage turned out to be a drinkable version of Nutella with the smoothness of cold-brewed coffee and the dairy richness of fresh cream. So I’ve had Jo’s Iced Turbo exactly once in my life, during this one trip to Austin two years ago, and that memory has seared into the taste receptors of my brain. I daydream about it often. Last week, I decided to devote two hours of my life trying to replicate this drink. There was scant available information online on how to recreate Jo’s Iced Turbo, but I began with this one blog post. The writer claims that a Jo’s employee revealed the drink contained whole milk, half and half, sweetened condensed milk, coffee, espresso, chocolate, and hazelnut. That’s where I began, testing out varying ratios and combinations. On batch number seven, something clicked. It triggered the same pleasurable memories from that spring Texas day two years ago. Also, my heart was palpitating from the flood of caffeine coursing through my bloodstream. But I think I nailed it, or at the least, something close. Enjoy, until your next trip to Austin. 1. In a large measuring cup, mix espresso, coffee, hazelnut syrup, and whole and chocolate milk. Separately, in a small cup, add a splash of hot water to a generously heaping tablespoon of condensed milk, and stir until it’s liquid. Add condensed milk to the other ingredients. 2. Whisk the concoction for 30 seconds. It will feel slightly thicker, but not frothy. Alternatively, add to a cocktail shaker and shake vigorously for 15 seconds. 3. Pour into a glass filled with crushed ice, stir, and let dilute for a minute before you enjoy this god of iced coffee drinks.","On my one trip to Austin, Texas, I stuffed an unholy quantity of food and drink inside my body.

The storm's footprint, in the form of high waves, is unusually expansive, extending all the way southward to the Caribbean and even northern South America. Swells generated by the storm's vast wind field now occupy at least half of the North Atlantic, according to maps provided by the U.S. Ocean Prediction Center, which is part of the National Weather Service.

Philip Ewing,"White House lawyer Ty Cobb is retiring and an outside attorney, Emmet Flood, is being brought in to take his place, the administration said Wednesday. J. David Ake/AP White House attorney Ty Cobb is retiring at the end of this month and veteran Washington lawyer Emmet Flood, who helped President Bill Clinton in his impeachment proceedings in the late 1990s, has signed on to replace him, the White House said Wednesday. Press secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed the changes after a report by The New York Times. The change in personnel follows other recent alterations to President Trump's legal team, including the addition of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and the departure of onetime counselor John Dowd. Cobb, ""a friend of the president,"" did ""a terrific job,"" said Sanders. Flood, Sanders said, ""will be joining the White House staff to represent the president and the administration against the Russia witch hunt."" The shakeup in Trump's coterie of legal advisers is taking place as two camps within it appear to be dueling over how to handle a prospective interview between Trump and the investigative team of Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller. One camp, apparently led by Giuliani, wants to keep the door open to an interview. It cites the downsides of not accommodating Mueller: he has threatened to issue a subpoena to try to compel Trump to appear before a grand jury. That could either spark a drawn-out courtroom war — one in which the White House is seen at a disadvantage — or lead to Trump invoking his Fifth Amendment right not to give evidence, with the concomitant political risks. Another camp, which had been led by Dowd, wants to take its chances and give Mueller the stiff-arm. Both internal and external advisers to Trump have said the risks are too great in him sitting down for an interview with Mueller or other investigators. That camp appeared to be making its case this week by outlining, also via the Times, the breadth and detail that Mueller and his investigators would want to cover in a prospective interview with the president. The Times' report on Wednesday suggested Flood will belong to the second school. He is ""expected to take a more adversarial approach to the investigation than Mr. Cobb, who had pushed Mr. Trump to strike a cooperative tone,"" as the newspaper put it. Times reporters Matt Apuzzo and Michael Schmidt also raised the prospect that Flood's arrival in the administration could clear the way for the departure of White House counsel Don McGahn, who may no longer be simpatico with Trump. Flood's law firm, Williams and Connolly, said on Wednesday that it was sad to see him go. ""Emmet is a special lawyer and long-time member of the Williams &amp; Connolly family,"" said chairman Dane Butswinkas. ""We are disappointed to lose him to the White House, but we fully appreciate Emmet's strong commitment to public service. The White House will be fortunate to have his experienced counsel.""","White House attorney Ty Cobb says he's retiring. An outside lawyer, Emmet Flood, is coming aboard.

Steve Dent,"The image above depicts a LiDAR relative elevation model (REM), showing current and previous channels carved out by the Sauk River in Washington State's Skagit and Snohomish counties. In the regular satellite image below, however, only the active, vegetation-free channels are clearly visible -- a striking display of what the technique can reveal. ""REMs are extremely useful in discerning where river channels have migrated in the past by vividly displaying fluvial features such as meander scars, terraces, and oxbow lakes,"" explains Washington State geologist Daniel E. Coe in a PDF. ""This type of information is very informative in channel migration and flood studies, as well as a host of other engineering and habitat assessments."" Carried on special aircraft, LiDAR produces visible-light laser beams. While much of it bounces off of trees and vegetation, enough make it through to the ground. By examining the raw data to see which beams travel the farthest, scientists can ""edit out"" trees, vegetation and man-made structures. That reveals hidden seismic faults, glacial landforms, landslides, lava flows and other features that are invisible on a regular satellite photo. Used in this way, the images also become a fantastic educational tool. Understanding things like drumlins, moraines and kettles can be pretty tough, but seeing a landform stripped to the bare ground brings the concepts to life. Suddenly, it becomes much easier to visualize how glaciers, lava flow (above), tsunamis and other natural phenomena have scarred (and will scar) our planet's surface over time. Considering that they're made by scientific instruments, the LiDAR images also happen to be beautiful (seriously, check them out ). You could even say that like other types of art, they strip away the surface to show things we may not want to see. A great example is the Toe Jam Hill fault scarp (part of the Seattle fault zone), first revealed by a LiDAR scan in the '90s. Subsequent trenching showed that it was the site of a single large earthquake 1,100 years ago, part of the great Seattle subduction quake at around 900 AD. That seismic event has become a part of the oral history and legend of Coast Salish Native Americans in the region, and is an ongoing concern to folks in Washington's Puget Sound area. LiDAR has become an important tool in confirming ancient stories, while helping us learn about future ones -- hopefully before they happen.","LiDAR is having a moment right now helping self-driving cars and robots not hit things, but don't forget about what else it can do.

Lane is part of a larger organized youth effort for gun control — which comes amid a resurgence of liberal activism. And these teens show no signs of stopping. Contemporaneous demands to end anti-black racism, reform immigration policies and the highlighting of the nationwide culture of sexual harassment continue to dominate headlines in 2018. But we've seen this before. The Sixties, brimming with hippies, anti-war demonstrations and calls for black power, was a key point for liberalism in the United States. And like then, younger generations are now trying to impact government policies to make the world a better place. What advice would activist from that time period have for these young students? I spoke with two protesters active during the Sixties: Did they make mistakes? Can this generation make lasting change? Mark D. Naison, was involved in the civil rights and anti-Vietnam movements. When he was a student at Columbia University he was a member of Congress of Racial Equality, or CORE, and Students for a Democratic Society. ""This is a long distance run, not a sprint,"" says Naison. He says he's very optimistic about this current movement addressing gun violence. One of the best things these protesters can do, he says, is to have a "" cultural component "" to mobilize people so they can impact companies and policies He advises students not to let up: ""I would recommend the full mobilization before the elections."" Not only am I thinking about the kids I saw in Ferguson. I remember watching those kids in Baltimore be met with police force at Mondawmin mall in Baltimore. And those kids in Baton Rouge @ the shell station run from teargas. It's beyond fair to name the differences. — Johnetta Elzie (@Nettaaaaaaaa) March 14, 2018 Naison reflects that his generation's contention for change went south when it descended into violence. ""People got so angry and frustrated when things didn't work that they became violent in ways which were not helpful."" He's referring to violence in the counterculture movement that stemmed from a radical faction — later expelled from SDS, called The Weather Underground. The militant group was notorious for bombing the Pentagon and police stations. The groups said they decided to turn to violence because they ""learned that protest and marches don't do it,"" one of its leaders said in a 1970 declaration of war. ""Revolutionary violence is the only way."" Nasion does not anticipate the current movement for gun control will cascade down that trajectory, ""since this is a movement against violence, I think that is a pitfall that can hopefully be avoided."" In the late 1960s, Denise Oliver-Velez, was a member of the Black Panther Party and the Young Lords. Over email, she shared some of her thoughts on the current movement: ""My only advice to them is that it is a long struggle."" Students should ""not to be discouraged by setbacks."" Oliver-Velez noted, however, there are similarities between white attitudes towards black activists in the 1960s and now. ""The role of black movements will never be embraced universally,"" she says. ""Just as few people recognize the impact of the Black Power movement on the Anti-Vietnam War groups (who are viewed as white) Black Lives Matter's organizing against brutality and suppression will never be credited as the first wave of major youth activism in this generation."" As young activists flood streets around the country — and the world — remember the legacy of activism is rich, and many people, for many years, have been fighting for a better Amercia.","Youth activism in America has a long and complicated history.

Kristina Panos,"What if you didn’t have to risk your life to disconnect the power during a catastrophic storm? That’s a question many people in Houston were asking themselves as they watched water from Hurricane Harvey and other storms surge through the streets, swell in the gutters, and flood their homes. Among these Houstonians were engineering students [Jon] and [Cyrus Jyan]. They watched as homeowners fought to safely disconnect their homes from the power grid and said, it shouldn’t have to be this way. They designed the Flood Fault Circuit Interrupter to monitor target areas and disconnect the power automatically when a credible threat is detected. The FFCI is built on top of existing protection schemes like GFCIs and Arc Fault Circuit Interrupters. It isn’t meant to replace them, but instead tie them together and turn them off based on input from float switches. As floodwaters rise, an EEPROM does a lookup and compare to decide if the threat is enough to shut it down. If so, an alarm signal to a shunt trip breaker can either throw the whole system to OFF, or else switch over to an alternate power source. The system is built around a standard security panel and keypad interface that supports 12 V alarm output. We particularly like the float switch enclosures that allow water to enter while keeping out debris.","What if you didn’t have to risk your life to disconnect the power during a catastrophic storm?

Delphine Schrank,"PIJIJIAPAN, Mexico (Reuters) - Just past 4 a.m., under a star-streaked sky, the Central American migrants shouldered their bags and picked over broken sidewalks, - first as a trickle, then as a flood - to the edge of the Mexican town. They walked straight, without hesitation. Few spoke much. Their compass point was north, towards the United States. Their goal for the day was Pijijiapan. The town, 30 miles away, was the next stop on a trek by thousands in a caravan that has so enraged U.S. President Donald Trump he has threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border and slash aid to Central America. Honduran boys Adonai, 5, and Denzel, 8, set off from Mapastepec still fogged with sleep. Their mother, Glenda Escobar, 33, clutched her youngest’s hand. Her friend, Maria, held onto Denzel’s T-shirt. No-one had a torch. Potholes were treacherous. Only the floodlights of the odd truck in the opposite lane of the highway helped them see a few feet at a time. Within minutes, a young man lay on his back, hugging his knee to his chest. He’d smashed his ankle on a rock, he said, and was in too much pain to stand. The single mother and her boys strode past, keeping pace with the long train of people. Her ultimate destination: Los Angeles, a city where she knows no one. “It’s because in my dreams, God told me that’s where he’s sending me,” she said. Trump, who campaigned against illegal immigration to win the 2016 U.S. presidential vote, has seized on this caravan in the run-up to the Nov. 6 mid-term congressional elections, firing up support for his Republican Party. Yet its members make up a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of people who every year flee violence and poverty in Central America for the United States. Estimates on the size of the caravan vary from around 3,500 to more than double that. Some migrants have abandoned the journey, deterred by the hardships or the possibility of making a new life in Mexico. Others joined it in southern Mexico. 30 MILES A DAY Escobar kneaded her shin. Agile and slight, she used to exercise regularly back home in the crime-wracked city of San Pedro Sula. But even the hardiest would have struggled to cover about 30 miles every day since she joined the caravan on Oct. 14. If she and her boys were lucky, a passing car or minivan would give them a ride before the sun turned the day from sticky warm to sticky hot. Soon the boys watched wide-eyed as dozens, mainly young men, sprinted for the backs of slowing trucks and jumped aboard - an impossible feat for a mother with two small children. Escobar’s family had had no food or water since residents of Mapastepec provided them a dinner of rice, beans, and eggs about 12 hours earlier. That morning, there had been nothing to eat at the school where they slept on a three-foot (1 meter) square patch of floor, squeezed among dozens of parents with small children. At least they had found shelter from the night’s downpour that soaked hundreds who slept on the sidewalks. A shifting committee of self-appointed representatives in green jackets decide when to rise, move or sweep the streets they borrow for a night. The caravan follows like clockwork. Through Guatemala to southern Mexico, private citizens, church groups and local organizations offered help at almost every stop and on the walks in between. Since entering Mexico, they have been assisted by members of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, a migrant rights group that has guided caravans through the country for several years, including one that drew the ire of Trump in April. His broadsides against that caravan generated enormous publicity, convincing others desperate to leave Central America that caravans are a safer way to travel. Others have begun forming behind Escobar’s group. LOOKING FOR WORK By 9 a.m, two hours past sunrise, the first hitchhikers reached Pijijiapan. Far behind, the Escobars walked, paused, zig-zagged into the bushes, walked, and stopped again. “We’ve been going so many days,” Escobar said, watching her sons flag, then suddenly leap to life and give each other piggy backs. “Should we rest here a bit?” The boys dropped down and started wrestling, which did nothing to stir Maria, who fell asleep in seconds on her backpack. Escobar, splayed on her back, stared at the sky, relating the many reasons that led to her journey. The eldest of seven children, she abandoned school and dreams of becoming a detective to help her mother. Life spiraled down at 18, she said, when on her way to work, a man she knew kidnapped her. She escaped but was pregnant with the child of her rapist, a former policeman who turned out to be a member of Barrio-18, she said. That brutal gang, together with MS-13, dominates much of El Salvador and Honduras. He disappeared, believed to have been killed, but no one ever found the body, she said. She raised his girl and had a son with another man. In time, he fled to the United States, promising to send for her. Within a year, his sister told her he had married someone else. Finally, she fell for a mototaxi driver, who fathered Denzel and Adonai. But he began to throw things at her and abuse her and the boys. Then he forced her out of the house she had paid for with money saved from years working as a cook and a seamstress, she said. When a neighbor told her about the caravan, she packed fast: a plastic tarp, clothes for the children, some soap. She left her two eldest with family, hoping to fetch them later. Coordinators have left open when and where the caravan might reach the U.S. border, saying it will likely fragment as many people stay in Mexico. Escobar and her family heaved to their feet. Denzel unfolded a discarded pamphlet that workers from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) distributed to the caravan two towns back. To disperse the convoy, Mexico has offered the Central Americans temporary jobs and identification papers if they submit requests for asylum in the south. But most have rejected the offer. “No, no,” Escobar told her son. “The United States is better. For everything.” POLICE FLAG DOWN RIDES After six hours, Escobar started hitchhiking. Just ahead, Captain Aispuro of the Mexican federal police was flagging down rides for women and children. With no orders to stop the band of travelers, Aispuro said he felt a duty to help. That day, he had found around 10 rides for mothers with children, he said. Escobar managed alone. Settled inside a minivan, their faces shone with gratitude. In Pijijiapan, hundreds had turned the main square into a mix of carnival and refugee camp. The family headed for a warehouse-sized shelter reserved for anyone with children. A medical aide squeezed iodine on a woman’s bleeding foot. People swarmed into the bathroom. Many fled for a dip in a river. In mid-afternoon, the warehouse was stifling with the crush of bodies. Escobar searched outside and set her plastic tarp under a tree. Two more stops and they would board a northbound freight train known as ‘La Bestia’ (the Beast), she said. All around, adults fell asleep, exhausted. But Adonai was sprinting for his third bottle of water. And Denzel was climbing a tree. “They’re as strong as adults,” she said. No sweat then, rousing them for the next day’s 3 a.m. start.

It’s actually quite an old project at this point, having been funded first in 2013, but its collection has grown to a considerable size. The money came from German art institution Film &amp; Medienstiftung NRW; the site was created (and is maintained) by creative house Chunderksen. The whole thing is suitably minimal, much like an actual museum: you find objects either by browsing randomly or by finding a corresponding tag, and are presented with some straightforward imagery and a player loaded with the carefully captured sound of the device being operated. Though the items themselves are banal, listening to these sounds of a bygone age is strangely addictive. They trigger memories or curiosity — was my Nintendo that squeaky? Didn’t my rotary phone click more? What kind was it anyway? I wonder if they have my old boombox… oh! A Viewmaster! The collection has grown over the years and continues to grow; it now includes interviews with experts in various subjects on the importance of saving these sounds. You can even submit your own, if you like. “We welcome suggestions in general, sound suggestions, stories, anecdotes and of course collaborations,” write the creators.

Greg Kumparak,"Way back in October of last year, Ring announced “Ring Protect” — a modular, no contract, DIY home security system. After a few delays, a bit of legal drama, and Ring being acquired for a billion dollars by Amazon, the alarm is finally about to ship — albeit with a slightly different (better!) name. Ring Protect has been redubbed as the more intuitive Ring Alarm — a better name if only because competitor Nest has both a security product and a totally different product (a smoke detector) called Nest Protect. Ring’s base level alarm kit starts at $199, which includes a keypad (for arming/disarming the system), one door/window sensor, a motion detector, and a range extender. You’ll probably want to add more components, and, fortunately, they’re relatively cheap: another door sensor, for example, is $20 bucks, while the motion detectors are $30. Nest’s competing security system packs a few tricks that Ring’s doesn’t (Nest combined the door/motion sensors into one, for example, and it’s got a fancy RFID system for PIN free disarming) but it also costs $200 more… and that’s after a $100 price drop that, presumably not by coincidence, just happened yesterday. The system doesn’t require any sort of contract — but if you want professional monitoring, it’ll be $10 bucks a month. That’s a pretty good deal, especially because if you’ve got any of Ring’s cameras (like its smart doorbell, or its floodlight cameras), that plan includes unlimited video storage for all of’em. Ring says it’s got more products on the way to expand the system, including smoke/carbon monoxide detectors and flood sensors. Ring’s security system is up for pre-order now and, if all goes as planned, will start shipping on July 4th.","Way back in October of last year, Ring announced “Ring Protect” — a modular, no contract, DIY home security system.

Tom Nardi,"Until a flood claimed its life, the 386 tower [Tylinol] found on the side of the road served him well as a DOS gaming rig. In the aftermath of the flood, the machine was left with ruined internals and a rusted case; it ended up being tossed in storage where it was slowly rotting away. But a recent idea got him to drag this old dinosaur back out into the light of day and give it a new lease on life with some modern gear. For our viewing pleasure [Tylinol] documented the restoration of the computer, dubbed SErEndIPITy, from start to finish. The rebuild starts with tearing the machine down to the steel frame and sanding all the rust off. Luckily it looks like no structural damage was done, and a coat of engine enamel got the frame looking more or less like new. The original motherboard mounting solution wouldn’t work for his modern board, so he ended up riveting a piece of sheet metal in and drilling new holes for standoffs to thread into. A nice element of this rebuild is that [Tylinol] didn’t want to drastically change the outward appearance of the machine. The customary yellowed plastic was left alone, and wherever possible the original hardware was reused. Rather than blow a hole in the case, he took his Dremel to the decorative ribbed design of the front panel and turned it into a stock-looking vent. The real star of this rebuild is the LED CPU “Speed” display on the front of the case. In its original form, this was a fake display that simply cycled through predefined digits when you pressed the “Turbo” button on the front panel. By grounding them one at a time, [Tylinol] figured out which lines on the PCB controlled each segment of the display and wired it up to a Teensy 3.5. He was then able to write a C# plugin for CoreTemp to display the temperature. The rebuilt machine is packing an i5-6500 processor, GTX 970 video card, and 8 GB of DDR4 RAM. Not exactly a speed demon compared to some of the modern desktops out there, but it certainly beats the original hardware. Incidentally, so does the Teensy 3.5 controlling the front panel display. There’s a certain irony there… Cramming modern hardware into the carcass of an outdated computer is nothing new, of course. But we especially like the builds that take the time to make it all look stock.

BeauHD,"In the wake of Wednesday's Parkland, Florida school shooting, which resulted in 17 deaths, troll and bot-tracking sites reported an immediate uptick in related tweets from political propaganda bots and Russia-linked Twitter accounts. Hamilton 68, a website created by Alliance for Securing Democracy, tracks Twitter activity from accounts it has identified as linked to Russian influence campaigns. On RoBhat Labs' Botcheck.me, a website created by two Berkeley students to track 1500 political propaganda bots, all of the top two-word phrases used in the last 24 hours -- excluding President Trump's name -- are related to the tragedy: School shooting, gun control, high school, Florida school. The top hashtags from the last 24 hours include Parkland, guncontrol, and guncontrolnow. While RoBhat Labs tracks general political bots, Hamilton 68 focuses specifically on those linked to the Russian government. According to the group's data, the top link shared by Russia-linked accounts in the last 48 hours is a 2014 Politifact article that looks critically at a statistic cited by pro-gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety. Twitter accounts tracked by the group have used the old link to try to debunk today's stats about the frequency of school shootings. Another top link shared by the network covers the ""deranged"" Instagram account of the shooter, showing images of him holding guns and knives, wearing army hats, and a screenshot of a Google search of the phrase ""Allahu Akbar."" Characterizing shooters as deranged lone wolves with potential terrorist connections is a popular strategy of pro-gun groups because of the implication that new gun laws could not have prevented their actions. Meanwhile, some accounts with large bot followings are already spreading misinformation about the shooter's ties to far-left group Antifa, even though the Associated Press reported that he was a member of a local white nationalist group. The Twitter account Education4Libs, which RoBhat Labs shows is one among the top accounts tweeted at by bots, is among the prominent disseminators of that idea.","An anonymous reader quotes a report from Wired: In the wake of Wednesday's Parkland, Florida school shooting, which resulted in 17 deaths, troll and bot-tracking sites reported an immediate uptick in related tweets from political propaganda bots and Russia-li…",2018-02-16T00:03:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Slashdot.org'}",Pro-Gun Russian Bots Flood Twitter After Parkland Shooting,https://tech.slashdot.org/story/18/02/15/2255242/pro-gun-russian-bots-flood-twitter-after-parkland-shooting,https://a.fsdn.com/sd/topics/twitter_64.png,,Slashdot.org,flood,0
Clare Roth,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission sought on Thursday to address suggestions in a Hungarian government information campaign that Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and billionaire investor George Soros seek to flood the country with migrants. 
Initially dismissing the campaign launched throughout Hungary on Feb. 18 as a “ludicrous conspiracy theory”, the Commission published a report debunking the assertions on billboards and full-page newspaper ads. 
Relations between European Union institutions and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s nationalist Fidesz ruling party have soured since the 2015 migration crisis, when Orban closed Hungary’s borders to all incoming refugees and asylum seekers. 
Many of the ads feature text stating “You have the right to know what Brussels is planning”, over pictures of Juncker and Hungarian-born Soros. Orban accuses Soros of encouraging mass immigration into Europe, a charge the philanthropist denies. 
“Citizens do deserve to know the truth about what the EU is doing,” Commission officials said. “But we believe that they deserve fact not fiction.” 
The Commission report rejected Hungarian assertions that the European Union executive arm wanted to introduce refugee resettlement quotas, stating that refugee resettlement “is and will always be on a purely voluntary basis”. 
Orban was reelected for a third consecutive term last April on a strong anti-immigration platform, and his Fidesz party leads the polls ahead of May’s European parliamentary election. 
He has said he hopes anti-immigration parties will gain a majority, which he said could lead to changes in the EU executive. 
Continuing its take-down of the adverts, the Commission noted that job-training pilot programs for migrants were voluntary and Hungary had opted out of participating. 
“Member states remain exclusively in charge of the numbers of workers they admit, if at all,” the report said. 
The Commission also said that EU funding had nothing to do with a country’s stance on immigration, but that cohesion money would go to countries hit by migration to help them manage.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"Earlier this year, Amazons facial recognition tech Rekognitionwhich can scan photos and videos and match them against databases of facesfaced a flood of criticism from Amazon employees, shareholders, and civil rights activists who argued that its use by government agencies was unethical or even dangerous. That backlash was spurred by an ACLU report showing how Amazon was working with law enforcement to market its surveillance techand now new documents provide more insight into how Amazon is giving this controversial tool to police. On Friday, Buzzfeed News published documents obtained through a public records request further detailing the relationship between Amazon and the Orlando Police Department, which participated in a pilot program of Rekognitions real-time facial recognition software. In June, the police department announced that its initial contract with Amazon had expired, but in July, the city said that it will continue testing Rekognition. According to BuzzFeed, Amazon provided the city of Orlando with tens of thousands of dollars of technology for free. This supports a Washington Post report that found Oregons Washington Countywhose police also piloted Rekognition paid only $6 to $12 a month for the service. Thats around how much it costs for a Netflix subscription. Additionally, the new documents reveal that Amazon required Orlando to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) that would keep details about the pilot under wraps. The ACLU previously discovered Washington County similarly signed an NDA with Amazon. Nondisclosure agreements are par for the course for tech companies, and Amazon claims that so is affording people with free pilots of their services. Providing customers with an opportunity to test technology with free credits is a common practice in the industry and something we offer to many of our customers with various AWS services, an Amazon Web Services spokesperson told Gizmodo in a statement. Talking to organizations about products and new features under a non-disclosure agreement is also something we do frequently with many of our customers for the purposes of protecting intellectual property and competitive information. We continue to support our customers in the responsible use of the technology which includes providing publicly available best practices and documentation as well as ongoing guidance from our machine learning experts, all of which is standard for customer engagements. Perhaps the most interesting information in the new documents, however, is how Orlando officials struggled to make Amazons technology work. It seems law enforcement teams have been given this widely criticized technology with littleif anytraining. Sgt. Eduardo Bernal of the Orlando Police Department told BuzzFeed that Amazon didnt provide any in-person instructions on how to use Rekognition, including on what photos they can upload to the database to create its list of suspected criminals. Emails included in the documents suggest that the pilot program was far from flawless, with internal and public communications about it riddled with slip-ups and confusion from the very beginning. A February email shows a city official complaining about the late delivery of Amazons tech. Once it was set up, the problems apparently continued. The streams keep stopping.seems like this happens daily, a March email from an Orlando official reads. I started 4 or 5 streams the other day and as you said, now only 1 is still up. I thought you were working on a script to automatically restart them if there were issues? Its unsurprising the program hasnt worked all of its kinks out yet. We saw the troubling implications of the systems flaws in July, when the ACLU of Northern California revealed that Rekognition incorrectly flagged 28 members of Congress as people suspected of crimes. Of the 28 misidentified members, 11 were people of color. Whats more, the error rate for non-white members of Congress was 39 percent, compared to five percent for Congress as whole. The test cost just $12.33. Thats a crucial driving factor behind demands for Amazon to cancel its facial recognition contracts with law enforcement officialsthe technology is currently flawed, biased, and, in the wrong hands, a powerful tool for discrimination. Currently, Orlando says it will only test the software by matching faces against photos of volunteer police officers, but its easy to imagine more dire consequences if use of this technology is expanded. Any company in this space that willingly hands this software over to a government, be it America or another nations, is willfully endangering peoples lives, Brian Brackeen, CEO of the face recognition and AI startup Kairos, wrote in an op-ed in June. We need movement from the top of every single company in this space to put a stop to these kinds of sales.

"Fitz Tepper,Romain Dillet","The crypto crash that began two days ago accelerated yesterday and today, with essentially all top 100 coins down anywhere between 15-30 percent. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is hovering around $450 billion, down ~30 percent from $650 billion just 48 hours ago. Yesterday, Bitcoin was just a few dollars away from dropping below $10,000, but it bounced back around $11k, a 15% drop from two days before. But Bitcoin is now trading below $10,000 on most major exchanges right now. In the past 24 hours, ETH is down 22.5 percent to around $850, Ripple is down 26.3 percent to $1.03, and so on. Unlike some crashes where we see value flood from one cryptocurrency into another, this sell off was traders exiting into fiat. Interestingly, Tether is the sole token in the top 50 that’s not down over the past seven days, and that’s because the price typically rises slightly above $1 when there is a demand to “cash out” into the stabilized token. Per usual, there’s no real rhyme or reason to this selloff. Two days ago, we reported on rumors that some Asia countries were moving to regulate the cryptocurrency trading and mining industry, but there hasn’t really been any concrete news on this front yet. Regardless of the reasons some in the cryptocurrency community are happy that the market is seeing at least some degree of a correction, as it keeps realities in check and is generally better for the long-term prospects of the industry.

George Dvorsky,"New research connects a powerful volcanic eruption—and a medieval poem that conjured memories of the dreaded event—to Iceland’s conversion to Christianity. At the turn of the 11th century, Iceland’s settlers formally replaced Odin, Thor, and Freya with Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. A new paper published in Climatic Change suggests memories of the Eldgjá lava flood—the largest volcanic eruption to hit Iceland in the past 2,000 years—convinced Icelanders to turn away from their Norse gods and embrace Christianity. This conclusion, reached by scientists from the University of Cambridge, was made possible by establishing a firm date for the eruption, and a reinterpretation of a grim poem called Vǫluspá, meaning “the prophecy of the seeress.” Prior to the new study, scientists knew about the terrible Eldgjá lava flood, but they couldn’t figure out when it actually happened. Estimates placed the eruption anywhere from 932 through to 939, with a best guess at 934 based on scattered evidence. To finally get it right, a research team, led by Clive Oppenheimer, collected data from ice cores and tree rings, showing that the eruption started in the spring of 939, and continued until autumn 940. Indeed, the Eldgjá lava flood, as its name and duration suggests, wasn’t any ordinary eruption. It happened in the southern region of Iceland along a 75-km-long (46 miles) fissure linked to the Katla volcano. The eruption threw massive amounts of lava onto the land, while spewing sulphurous gases into the atmosphere. An estimated 20 cubic kilometers of magma poured from the cracks. Needless to say, the eruption had an impact on Iceland’s inhabitants, who began to settle the island around 874. “This places the eruption squarely within the experience of the first two or three generations of Iceland’s settlers,” said Oppenheimer in a statement. “Some of the first wave of migrants to Iceland, brought over as children, may well have witnessed the eruption.” The settlers likely abandoned much of the island, or relocated elsewhere, as famine was probably severe, but no texts survived to tell us exactly what happened. But that’s where the poem could help, the researchers claim. A certain reading of Vǫluspá, dated to around 961, seems to paint an apocalyptic scene of the conditions both during and after the eruption—and even the onset of a cold volcanic winter (which was felt around the globe). [The wolf] is filled with the life-blood of doomed men, reddens the powers’ dwellings with ruddy gore; the sun-beams turn black the following summers, weather all woeful: do you know yet, or what? The sun starts to turn black, land sinks into sea; the bright stars scatter from the sky. Steam spurts up with what nourishes life, flame flies high against heaven itself. The poem also predicts the end of Iceland’s Norse gods, and the rise of a new, singular deity. Could this be construed as the conversion of Iceland to Christianity? The researchers think it’s a distinct possibility. “With a firm date for the eruption, many entries in medieval chronicles snap into place as likely consequences—sightings in Europe of an extraordinary atmospheric haze; severe winters; and cold summers, poor harvests; and food shortages,” said Oppenheimer. “But most striking is the almost eyewitness style in which the eruption is depicted in Voluspá. The poem’s interpretation as a prophecy of the end of the pagan gods and their replacement by the one, singular god, suggests that memories of this terrible volcanic eruption were purposefully provoked to stimulate the Christianisation of Iceland.” That accounts of a severe volcanic eruption—one still seared in memory—were used to fuel theological debate and proselytize Icelanders in the 10th century is not as outlandish as it may appear. The arguments may have sounded quite compelling, and the new religion may have offered some solace and reassurance. Oppenheimer and his colleagues present a good case, but like anything, there’s likely more to it than a scary poem. The reasons for Iceland’s conversion to Christianity are complex and multifaceted—the story of a horrible volcano quite possibly being among the many reasons why the Norse gods were abandoned.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Climate lawsuits have been piling up on the coasts. But a pioneering duo of Colorado counties and the city of Boulder have filed the first landlocked lawsuit against big oil earlier this week, suing Exxon and tar sands producer Suncor Energy. It represents a new front in the legal war that’s pitting communities stuck paying for the costs of climate change against the companies that caused it. And it could spread to neighboring states in flyover country. “Yes, sea level rise will be important,” Elise Jones, a commissioner in Boulder County who is part of the new suit, told Earther. “Middle America is being hit by climate change, too. We thought it was important that we tell that story.” The story is one of both big, present impacts visible in the wildfire-scarred hills and flood-scoured waterways, and small ones tucked away in the Excel spreadsheets about the costs of road paving, culverts, and air conditioners for schools. “In our eyes, it’s a pretty simple issue of property rights,” David Bookbinder, a lawyer with the libertarian Niskanen Center who is consulting on the case, told Earther. “We have local communities faced with tremendously escalating costs of dealing with climate change. It’s not some future hypothetical. It’s been happening for years. It’s happening for today, and quite literally, local taxpayers are getting stuck with the bill.” Boulder County, for instance, is still recovering from a 1,000-year rainfall event in 2013 that sent murky torrents of water streaming down canyons, tearing out roads and bridges, and inundating the city of Boulder. “Middle America is being hit by climate change, too.” The county blew through its $65 million in reserve cash shortly after the disaster. To make up for the shortfall, it asked residents to approve a five-year sales tax hike. It also relied on federal funds and public tax money to help with cleanup and recovery. And Jones told Earther recovery still isn’t over. “I was a brand new commissioner when the flood hit and I remember somebody saying it was going to take at least five years to rebuild and I thought they were crazy,” she said. “But it’s going to take a full decade to recover from that one incident.” Research has shown climate change increased the intensity of the rainfall event by about 30 percent. The rise in extreme precipitation events portends an even more challenging—and potentially costlier—future. Good news! Oil companies are woke to the reality of climate change. There’s just one small hitch.… Read more Read A county-commissioned report shows that even without climate shocks like the 2013 flood or a 2010 wildfire that was Colorado’s most destructive at the time, the cost of adaptation will be steep. Peering into those Excel sheets and then overlaying the climate impacts of more heat, wildfires, and increased risk of drought between the deluges revealed the county could be stuck with a bill of up to $157 million in adaptation costs if we do nothing to curb carbon emissions. Boulder is a comparatively wealthy county with a solid tax base of 319,000, but Jones said the burden of adaptation is too much to handle, which is why they’re suing oil companies. “We can’t afford it and it’s not fair,” she said. If that’s true for Boulder County, then it’s even more so for San Miguel County, which is also part of the suit. The county is located in southwest Colorado, and home to spectacular peaks straight off the Coors label ( seriously ) as well as sprawling farm land. Its tax base is smaller than Boulder’s but, as with so many counties in the West, the infrastructure needs are the same. “San Miguel County has a population of less than 8,000,” Bookbinder said. “They have as many roads as Boulder County and they’re 1/40th of the size. They’re in a box. They have to spend money and there’s no one handing out hundreds of millions [for upkeep].” The lawsuit against Exxon and Suncor is one way to find funds. Oil companies have known for decades about the impacts of climate change, all while spending millions to sow doubt publicly. Exxon’s knowledge was exposed in groundbreaking reporting from by InsideClimate News in 2015 and since then, other dominoes have fallen. Those reports have opened oil companies to a growing host of lawsuits by local governments seeking damages, and criminal investigations by attorneys general in Massachusetts, New York and elsewhere. Suncor was named in the Colorado lawsuit because it worked in the state and produces the dirtiest oil on the planet in the form of Albertan tar sands. “The idea that the fossil fuel industry would say, yep our products are causing this, we’re going make more of them, [including] products that are more carbon intensive seems absurd,” Bookbinder said. “Talk about giving the finger to local governments.” It will likely take years for all these suits to wend their way through federal and state courts. Whether they result in payouts or settlements is still very much unknown, but Amy Markwell, a lawyer for San Miguel County, told Earther the defendants’ arguments aren’t that hard to follow. “Climate change can be a fairly complicated issue but this lawsuit, we’re trying to keep it pretty simple,” she said. “Your neighbor does something that damages you or your property, you can go to your local courthouse and seek local damage payment.” This is, in essence, the same argument that coastal communities are making. The new Colorado case shows the damages landlocked counties face will be different but no less severe, and that big oil can expect more legal challengers from all corners to come looking for a just settlement.","Climate lawsuits have been piling up on the coasts.

Mallory Locklear,"The problem started in 2012 when the Hassell Law Group represented Ava Bird in a personal injury case. The two sides offer differing reasons as to why, but regardless, the firm decided to drop Bird's case. She then allegedly wrote a negative review on Yelp, giving the firm one star and encouraging others to stay away from Hassell Law Group. Dawn Hassell, the firm's owner and Bird's former attorney, asked Bird to take down the review calling it slander and warning that she would seek legal action for defamation. Bird declined to take down the review and in 2013, Hassell filed a lawsuit against Bird. Bird didn't appear before the court so by default a ruling was issued in Hassell's favor. Bird was later ordered to take down any defamatory reviews she posted on Yelp about Hassell and the Hassell Law Group as well as pay $557,918.85 in damages. But Yelp, which was not involved in the case, was also ordered to take down Bird's reviews. It filed a motion to vacate the order, arguing that because it wasn't given the opportunity to be heard in the case, its due process rights were violated. Additionally, it noted that it was protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The court denied Yelp's motion and when the company appealed, the Court of Appeal agreed with the lower court's ruling. But Yelp kept going, taking the case to the California Supreme Court, which in a 4-3 decision ruled that Yelp was indeed protected by Section 230 and should not be required to take down Bird's reviews. ""With this decision, online publishers in California can be assured that they cannot be lawfully forced to remove third-party speech through enterprising abuses of the legal system, and those of us that use such platforms to express ourselves cannot be easily silenced through such tactics either,"" Yelp said in a statement. A number of groups including the ACLU and EFF as well as companies like Facebook, Reddit, Snap and Twitter filed amicus briefs in support of Yelp's position, expressing concern that the initial ruling would ""unleash precisely the flood of litigation Section 230 is intended to avoid."" Yelp said the case ""threatened the rights of online platforms that allow people to freely share their thoughts and the billions of people that do so."" Section 230 already took a hit this year with the passing of FOSTA. Hassell's attorney Monique Olivier said that the decision ""stands as an invitation to spread falsehoods on the internet without consequence."" The Associated Press reports that Hassell is considering an appeal to the Supreme Court.","Yelp has been fighting a court order that said it had to take down two reviews from its site, an order that it claimed violated its right to due process and ignored Communications Decency Act protections that say companies with an online presence aren't liabl…",2018-07-03T17:19:00Z,"{'id': 'engadget', 'name': 'Engadget'}",California court says Yelp can’t be forced to remove negative reviews,https://www.engadget.com/2018/07/03/california-court-yelp-remove-negative-reviews/,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?thumbnail=1200%2C630&quality=80&image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fa1cdbd8bbdb584c04f0384b58bd6a22e%2F206502157%2Fyelp-ed.jpg&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=a7e7ff0a60da4399df531830881f48c32747f244,engadget,Engadget,flood,0
Lulu Garcia-Navarro,"You scroll through your friend's Instagram feed and see the most beautiful setting, and think: ""I want to go there."" And so you do. According to travel photographer Brent Knepper, you are part of the problem. In the online article "" Instagram is Loving Nature to Death,"" Knepper says that thanks to the photo sharing app, some of the best-kept secrets of the natural world are drawing big crowds and literally altering the landscape. Knepper tells NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro about some of the idyllic locations that are seemingly being ruined because of exposure on Instagram. Interview Highlights There's nothing wrong with seeing a cool space on the Internet and deciding to go there. It's just, maybe, don't start fires there, and clean up your poop. Brent Knepper, travel photographer On Horseshoe Bend in northern Arizona Horseshoe Bend is this beautiful spot 7 miles up the Colorado River from the Grand Canyon. It's in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, and the bend is very unique as far as waterway travels down there. It makes a complete 180-degree turn in a canyon 1,000 feet deep. From the viewing point at the top, you get this amazing view of this horseshoe shape, hence the name. It's a rugged, remote spot, and it's a very lovely place as long as you're willing to share it with a crowd.... I ran the numbers after doing a little bit of research, and the numbers do check out. On Instagram, Horseshoe Bend's popularity, in its hashtag or in its geotag, is normally 10 times as popular as anything else in that area. On why some visitors and construction are the problem Well, popularity is very important. The outdoor world needs more visitors and more accessibility. The difficulty with managing that side of it is that construction effects can have averse conditions applied to the natural areas, if you start doing different buildings. It's not that all visitors are a problem, of course; it's just some places tend to have people who neglect responsibilities of their visitorship. On other spaces that have changed In my article that I wrote for The Outline, I illustrate two other places that have also changed as a result of overwhelming popularity, specifically on Instagram. A smaller one, in Colorado, is Conundrum Hot Springs. After it became a spot to easily find on social media, the amount of visitorship went up really high. And the problem, since this is a very remote location where people hang around for a long time in the hot springs, is that they ran out of places to go to the bathroom. As a result, Conundrum Hot Springs had to be shut down for a little bit, while park rangers were up there with shovels to relieve that issue. Bathrooms were not built. They literally had to shovel up everyone's waste and pack it out for them. On Vance Creek Bridge Vance Creek Bridge is probably the most famous spot within the Instagram niche. It is the second-tallest bridge in the U.S.; it's privately owned and is about a two-hour drive outside Seattle. Its location was revealed in 2012 on Instagram and since then, visitorship has just exploded. The railing company that owns the bridge has tried to slow down the amount of people visiting it by putting up a fence and then excavating the whole area around the bridge before it drops down over 300 feet towards the river. They haven't been successful with that, and as a result of vandalism, graffiti and a couple of unresolved campfires that caught the bridge on fire — they're just going to tear it down now. On why people visit these places There's definitely a community aspect of it. There's nothing wrong with seeing a cool space on the Internet and deciding to go there. It's just, maybe, don't start fires there, and clean up your poop.

George Dvorsky,"Today’s addition of 70,000 new seeds to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault brings the total number of crops stored at the Arctic facility to over one million. It’s an important milestone—but to keep the vault running, and to protect it from the effects of climate change, the Norwegian government is going to have to spend upwards of $13 million in upgrades. The Estonian onion potato, black-eyed peas, Bambara groundnuts, and Hunter barley used to brew Irish beer are among the 70,000 deposits made today at Svalbard. That brings the total number of seeds deposited at the facility to a whopping 1,059,646, according to the BBC. The Doomsday Vault, as it’s been dubbed, opened exactly ten years ago today, and it’s there on Svalbard Island—halfway between the mainland of Norway and the North Pole—to protect the world’s seeds in the event of cataclysmic climate change, mega-droughts, nuclear war, or whichever apocalypse-inducing event we might be able to think of. Only one of the vault’s three chambers are full, but that’s not stopping the Norwegian government from contemplating some much-needed upgrades. There are still well over a million unique varieties of crops that still need to be stored at the site. A year ago, a flood at the vault’s entrance prompted a re-evaluation of the facility’s ability to fend off the effects of climate change (thankfully the flood didn’t damage the facility). Following a feasibility study commissioned by its Ministry of Agriculture and Food, the Norwegian government is proposing a startup grant of 100 million NOK ($12.7 million) to improve performance and extend the long-term viability of the vault. Even though it’s located in the Arctic Circle, Svalbard’s temperature is expected to increase from an average 21 degrees F (-5.9 C) to 38 degrees F (3.3 C), and rainfall is expected to increase by 40 percent, by the year 2100. Ironically, the facility designed to safeguard seeds in the event of climate change is being threatened by climate change. “The main principle for construction in permafrost areas is to avoid the warming and thawing of permafrost,” writes Statsbygg, the state-owned management company that conducted the feasibility study. “For buildings that are particularly sensitive to... damage, or where long life is desired, artificial cooling of the ground [will be required]. Climate change will lead to increased ground temperatures, less permafrost, poorer carrying capacity, [among other problems].” To prepare the vault for the coming effects of climate change, and to ensure that it will “continue to offer the world’s gene banks a secure storage space in the future,” the facility will be equipped with new refrigeration units, a concrete access tunnel, a service building to house emergency power, and new electrical equipment. Waterproof walls have already been fitted to prevent flooding.

Joe Wertz,"If Houston's record deluge during Hurricane Harvey highlighted the dangers of unchecked, sprawling development, then Tulsa — another conservative city built on oil — is a showcase for the opposite. For decades it has planned carefully and imposed wide-ranging regulations that aim to prevent the kind of devastating floods that used to make national headlines here. Other cities are taking note, as expanding development and a warming climate threaten to make flooding worse. On a recent afternoon, Bill Robison parks his city-issued car in front of a modest, beige ranch house in east Tulsa to carry out a key part of the city's program. ""That's the one I haven't been able to talk to yet,"" he says. Robison is lead engineer for Tulsa's storm water program, and this is one of 80 homes the city is currently trying to buy and tear down. Over the last three decades, Tulsa has cleared nearly 1,000 buildings from flood-prone areas. Typically, after people are flooded two or three times they're ready to sell out. Bill Robison ""Typically, after people are flooded two or three times they're ready to sell out,"" says Robison. Sure enough, the woman who answers the door tells him the house flooded not long ago. In fact, it's flooded repeatedly in recent years, and changed hands a number of times. She's open to a buyout. The great drainage war Tulsa is surprisingly vulnerable to flooding, from the Arkansas River and a spiderweb of 36 creeks. In the 1970s and 1980s the city was hit by a string of damaging floods. Activists and the public stormed city hall, but builders and property developers fought plans to address the flooding. Local media dubbed the dispute ""The Great Drainage War."" Then, in 1984, another flood disaster dumped more than a foot of rain leaving 14 people dead and hundreds injured. It galvanized the city. That, and a change of administration, allowed one of the nation's most aggressive flood control plans to move ahead. Tulsa's program is one of the few that accounts for urban growth. The city has built a network of drainage systems, and it's created green spaces that double as flood basins when needed. Bill Robison pulls his car over and points one out. ""You can see there's a Frisbee golf course here, walking trails and just a nice open area,"" he says. Tulsa's flood control plan includes multi-use drainage basins, like the athletic field at Will Rogers High School. It doubles as a detention pond for overflowing storm water. Joe Wertz/StateImpact Oklahoma Tulsa also enacted strict rules on where and how homes and buildings are constructed — rules that go far beyond national standards. Ron Flanagan, who helped write the flood control plan, says it can be tough mandating something that adds costs for developers. ""Elected officials are very sensitive to the development community's wants and desires and needs,"" he says. To help pay for the program the city added a fee to utility bills which was, and remains, unpopular. But having a strict program also means residents get big discounts on flood insurance. ""If you don't have the local people on board you haven't got a program,"" Flanagan says. ""The federal government can't enforce everything, and they have minimum standards."" Today, Tulsa's flooding problems are much smaller and officials say the prevention program has saved lives and millions of dollars. Other cities routinely reach out for advice. Even the State Department brings international groups to see the flood plan in action. Still, Flanagan worries. The longer Tulsa goes without a catastrophic flood, he says, the easier it is to forget why the city needed to change its ways.","For decades, Tulsa planned carefully and imposed regulations to prevent the kind of devastating floods that used to make national headlines.

"Holly Yan, CNN","(CNN) Deserts aren't supposed to get much rain, but Tropical Storm Rosa is flipping the script. Rosa is forecast to make landfall early Tuesday with more than 11 million people under a flash flood watch in the Southwest, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said. It'll drench Baja California with 3 to 6 inches of rain, with some spots getting up to 10 inches, the National Hurricane Center said. As it moves northeast, Rosa will also dump 2 to 4 inches of rain on much of Arizona, with up to 6 inches in the mountains. A flash flood watch is in effect for parts of Arizona until Wednesday as the storm's remnants move across the state, the National Weather Service said. ""These rainfall amounts may produce life-threatening flash flooding,"" the National Hurricane Center said. ""Dangerous debris flows and landslides are also possible in mountainous terrain."" Historically, it's unusual for the US Southwest to get pummeled by a hurricane or tropical storm. But ""these events have begun to increase in recent years,"" CNN meteorologist Gene Norman said. Research indicates that global warming contributes to tropical storms getting ""more intense, bigger and longer-lasting, thereby increasing their potential for damage,"" said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. While there might not be a direct link between global warming and the recent increase of severe storms in the US Southwest, ""it is possible that this could be a side effect of climate change,"" Norman said. ""Warmer oceans are allowing eastern Pacific storms to reach higher latitudes,"" he said. ""This was not the case earlier. It was quite rare for an eastern Pacific storm to even reach Baja California, and this is now becoming more common.""

Anna Mehler Paperny,"WILSON/WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Florence kept dumping rain on North Carolina on Sunday and officials warned residents that “the worst is yet to come” from a storm that has already killed at least eight people, as rivers inland were likely to flood. Florence, which crashed into the state as a hurricane on Friday, had weakened to a tropical depression by Sunday morning but was forecast to drop another 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 cm) of rain in North Carolina, bringing rainfall totals in some inland areas to 15 to 20 inches, according to the National Hurricane Center. The most rain so far from Florence was 33.9 inches (86 cm) in Swansboro, North Carolina, a new record for a single hurricane in the state. The previous record was 24 inches (61 cm), set by Hurricane Floyd, which killed 56 people in 1999, said Bryce Link, a meteorologist with DTN Marine Weather, a private forecasting service. In Fayetteville, a North Carolina city of about 210,000 people some 90 miles (145 km) inland, authorities told thousands of residents near the Cape Fear River and Little River to get out of their homes by Sunday afternoon because of the flood risk. “If you are refusing to leave during this mandatory evacuation, you need to do things like notify your legal next of kin because the loss of life is very, very possible,” Mayor Mitch Colvin said at a news conference on Saturday. “The worst is yet to come,” he added. A total of about 761,000 homes and businesses were without power on Sunday in North and South Carolina and surrounding states, down from a peak of nearly 1 million. In New Bern, about 90 miles northeast of Wilmington at the confluence of two rivers, Florence overwhelmed the town of 30,000 and left the downtown area under water. “It was pitch black and I was just scared out of my mind,” said Tracy Singleton, who with her family later fled her home near New Bern. As authorities rescued people by boat and even airlifted 50 stranded people in North Carolina, there were also reports of looting. Five people were arrested for breaking into a Dollar General Store, said the police department in Wilmington, which has imposed a nighttime curfew. A least seven people have died so far in the storm in North Carolina, including a mother and child killed by a falling tree and three people who drowned, state officials said. A woman died in South Carolina when her car hit a fallen tree. ‘CATASTROPHIC’ STORM “This is still a catastrophic, life threatening storm,” said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center. “It has already dumped 20 to 30 inches of rain on parts of the Carolinas with more to come,” he said. “And many of the rivers will see prolonged flooding, some not cresting for a few days.” Many roads were closed and authorities warned of landslides, tornadoes and flash floods, with dams and bridges in peril as rivers and creeks swelled. The flooding could taint waterways with murky coal ash and toxic hog waste. By Sunday morning the storm’s winds had dropped to about 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. It had picked up pace somewhat, moving west at 8 mph (13 kph), and its center was expected to move across the western Carolinas during Sunday and the Ohio Valley and Northeast United States on Monday and Tuesday. The White House said President Donald Trump approved making federal funding available in some affected counties. Trump, who plans to visit the region this week and he tweeted his “deepest sympathies and warmth” to the families and friends of those who died. As the United States dealt with Florence, a super typhoon made landfall in China’s Guangdong on Sunday after barreling past Hong Kong and Macau and killing dozens of people in the Philippines.

Twitter/Libby Solomon A Baltimore suburb was placed under a state of emergency on Sunday as flash floods inundated streets with several feet of water. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan issued the directive around 4:40 p.m. local time as heavy rain pummeled Ellicott City's Main Street. Videos and pictures from the scene showed waves of brown water submerging vehicles and nearly reaching to the top of a stop sign. No injuries have been reported in the flood, and by 5:20 p.m. the local fire and rescue department said the waters were receding, according to The Baltimore Sun. Emergency officials reported that at least one Ellicott City building has collapsed. Some residents told the Sun that the flood seemed to be more intense than the one that hit Ellicott City in July 2016, leaving two people dead and many downtown businesses destroyed. The flooding has left some residents stranded in buildings, and multiple rescues are in progress, according to local officials.

Jennifer Kay / AP,"Forecasters downgraded Alberto to a still-dangerous depression Monday evening, warning heavy rains and an accompanying flood threat would continue in the aftermath of the storm’s landfall in the Florida Panhandle. The Memorial Day strike on the Gulf Coast by the first named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season drove holiday beachgoers away from roiling, dangerous surf. What had sprung up from the Gulf of Mexico as a subtropical storm was now a vast, soggy system trekking inland as it flung rain — heavy at times — all around the Southeast. Forecasters warned that heavy downpours from the weakening system could raise the potential for life-threatening flash floods in coming hours or days across north Florida, much of Alabama and large areas of Georgia — and eventually into Tennessee and the Carolinas. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the depression was centered at 11 p.m. Monday about 50 miles west-northwest of Dothan, Alabama. Its top sustained winds had dropped nearly in half to about 35 mph. What remains of Alberto was crawling northward at about 12 mph. Subtropical Storm Alberto is approaching the Florida panhandle and is expected to make landfall sometime Monday. It had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph early Monday and can create dangerous waves for people not in its path. Authorities did not immediately attribute any deaths or injuries directly to Alberto. But in North Carolina, a television news anchor and a photojournalist were killed Monday when a tree that had been uprooted from rain-soaked ground toppled on their SUV as they reported on severe weather on the fringes of the huge system. That was hundreds of miles from Alberto’s center and more rain is on the way. Between four and eight inches of rain could soak the Florida Panhandle, Alabama, and western Georgia before the storm moves on. Isolated deluges of 12 inches also are possible in spots as the system heads toward the Tennessee Valley on Tuesday and later this week into the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region. Earlier Monday, Alberto rolled up big waves and tides along beaches of the northern Gulf Coast. Lifeguards posted red flags along the white sands of Pensacola Beach, where swimming and wading were banned as Alberto disrupted long holiday weekend plans for millions. The storm also forced some Memorial Day tributes to be cancelled across Florida’s Panhandle. Safety was the priority, but the decision was still a “heartbreaker,” said Tom Rice, a 29-year-old Army veteran who had helped with planning for a ceremony at Beal Memorial Cemetery in Fort Walton Beach. Some stragglers still made their way through the rain to pay tribute at the cemetery’s Veterans Tribute Tower, however. Rice said American flags had been placed Saturday on the graves of all 1,700 veterans buried in the cemetery. “We got the flags out,” Rice told the Northwest Florida Daily News as wind whipped a massive U.S. flag flying at half-staff. “That’s what’s important.” Along the Florida Panhandle, tourists vowed Alberto wouldn’t dampen their fun. Jason Powell sought to keep his children entertained with movies and TV, adding he hoped the sun would come out again after Alberto blew over. “So far we’ve seen a lot of wind and the ocean is really high, covering up the entire beach,” Powell remarked. Janet Rhumes said her group of friends from Kansas had been planning their Memorial Day weekend on Navarre Beach since October. They stocked up on groceries and settled in for card games. “We’ve never seen one before and we’re here celebrating a friend’s 20th birthday,” Rhumes told the Daily News. “So how often can you say you rode a storm out?” As Alberto’s weakening center heads inland it is being deprived of the warm waters that fuel tropical weather systems. As a subtropical storm, Alberto had a less defined and cooler center than a tropical storm, and its strongest winds were found farther from its center. Some of the rain bands spread hundreds of miles away from the center. Elsewhere, the North Carolina Highway Patrol said, a large tree toppled on a news television vehicle Monday near Tryon, North Carolina. WYFF-TV of Greenville, South Carolina, said a news anchor, Mike McCormick, and photojournalist, Aaron Smeltzer, with that station were both killed. McCormick and Smeltzer had just interviewed Tryon Fire Chief Geoffrey Tennant as they covered storms in North Carolina. “Ten minutes later we get the call and it was them,” Tennant said at a news conference, his voice cracking. Tennant did not directly blame the up to 2 inches of rain that fell Monday from the fringes of Alberto for the deaths. He said the roots of a large tree that toppled on the vehicle came loose from ground saturated by a week’s worth of earlier rain. The men died instantly, their TV vehicle’s engine still running, Tennant said.",A flood threat continues in the aftermath of the storm’s landfall in Florida,2018-05-29T09:48:31Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Alberto Downgraded to a Depression, But Heavy Rains Are Still to Come",http://time.com/5293644/alberto-storm-downgraded-depression/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/800-41.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,flood,1
CHRISTOPHER MELE,"That flooding ripped up sidewalks, gutted many of the town’s quaint shops and carried off vehicles, depositing some of them blocks away. Mr. Miller said Sunday’s rain started around 2:45 p.m. and had not yet subsided as of around 6:30 p.m. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning until 10:30 p.m. and said a third wave of significant water was imminent. The flooding in 2016 caused catastrophic damage, but 96 percent of the businesses downtown rebuilt and reopened. To see the damage on Sunday was “heartbreaking and devastating,” Mr. Miller said. Mr. Miller, who lives three miles from Ellicott City, said he had six inches of water in his basement, something that had not happened in the more than 25 years he has lived in the house. “We had a very, very heavy cell move over us, and it just unloaded and did not let up,” he said. Founded in 1772 as a mill town, Ellicott City has for the past several decades catered to tourists with its historic charm and antique shops. Its location in the Patapsco River Valley and its position on a granite bedrock make it susceptible to flooding “with terrific force,” Mr. Miller said.","The flooding struck Ellicott City, Md., on Sunday, prompting rescuers to tell residents, “If you are trapped, we are coming.”",2018-05-28T00:10:40Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Flash Flooding Rages Through Maryland Community,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/27/us/ellicott-city-flooding-maryland.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/28/us/28flood_xp/28flood_xp-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,flood,0
Melanie Ehrenkranz,"Back in September, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg quietly bought a 350-foot exploration yacht for $150 million, Hürriyet Daily News reports. According to the Turkish newspaper, the massive ship “can sail halfway around the world without refueling and is designed to endure the toughest weather conditions”—making it the perfect vessel to wait out an impending apocalypse that only you, the billionaire creator of Facebook, know about. Zuckerberg bought the yacht, named “Ulysses,” from New Zealand billionaire Graeme Hart. And Ulysses sure is something. Among other features, the passenger yacht is equipped with a helicopter deck, eight dining locations, five lounges, five bars, a gym, a day spa, a sauna, a massage room, a wine tasting room, and a cinema, all inside a hull reportedly designed to withstand “the arctic circles and the world’s hottest regions.” And Zuckerberg won’t have to enjoy these amenities alone: According to the ship’s spec page, Ulysses is commercially approved to carry up to 36 tech overlords who all saw this coming across the high seas after this all falls apart. Additionally, the yacht has a storage space filled with a shit-ton of water toys, including “Harleys, Superbikes, KTMs and ATVs, jets skis and all the traditional toys,” per the website.

George Dvorsky,"A former Thailand navy SEAL has died while working to save 12 boys and their coach from the submerged Tham Luang cave complex, the New York Times reports. The death comes as a heavy blow to the rescue mission, as monsoon rains threaten further flooding and as oxygen levels inside the chamber have started to drop. Around 1:00 am local time this morning, Saman Gunan, a 38-year-old retired Thai navy SEAL, was on his way out of the cave system after delivering extra oxygen canisters along the route to the trapped boys and their coach when he ran out of oxygen and lost consciousness. His partner, who was unable to revive him, brought his body back to the mouth of the cave. “His job was to deliver oxygen,” Passakorn Boonyaluck, the deputy governor of the Chiang Rai region, told reporters. “He did not have enough on his way back.” Saman, who had left the Thai navy, returned to help with the rescue mission. In respect for his efforts, the Thai king said he’ll sponsor the funeral. It’s doubtful the boys will be told about the diver’s death, as the news would likely damage their morale even further, and at a time when they need to build both their physical and psychological health. “I can guarantee that we will not panic, we will not stop our mission, we will not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste,” Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yukongkaew told reporters this morning. “But even though we have lost one man, we still have faith to carry out our work,” he said, adding that, “We are trained to expect risks at anytime. It’s part of the job.” The diver’s death underscores the danger of a rescue attempt. A round trip to the boys takes 11 hours, six of which, en route to the chamber, are against the current. Visibility is practically nil, and some passageways are mere crawlspaces. The 12 soccer players and their coach have been trapped in the Tham Luang cave complex for nearly two weeks. They were discovered by expert divers on July 2, about 2.5 miles (4 km) from the mouth of the cave. The “Wild Boars” team entered the cave when it was dry, but flood waters trapped them inside. Heavy monsoon rains are expected to resume on Sunday, presenting a challenge for rescue workers who are desperately trying to pump water out of the caves. Oxygen levels within the chamber are another concern. The demand for oxygen has increased owing to the presence of the support team members, who are currently attending to the boys. The oxygen level in the chamber is now at 15 percent, down from the usual 21 percent, the BBC reports. Oxygen canisters are being delivered to the chamber, along with food and medical supplies. Rescuers are currently working to connect a three mile (5 km) cable to the chamber to supply oxygen, along with a fiber optic cable for communication. A plan to leave the boys in the caves until the monsoon season ends—which won’t happen for another four months—is appearing less feasible with each passing day and hour. A rescue attempt through the submerged passages seems inevitable. “At first, we thought the children could stay for a long time,” said Apakorn, “but now things have changed, we have a limited time.” The expected rains will likely replenish the caves with water, but as the monsoon season progresses, there’s a heightened chance that sinkholes and streams will flood the cramped chamber. To complicate matters, the boys have never used scuba gear, and some don’t know how to swim. Sadly, the death of Saman Gunan shows how perilous the situation really is—even for experienced navy SEAL divers.

Amy Held,"Power lines smolder behind a fallen tree outside the Lincoln School in Providence, R.I., during the nor'easter Friday. Matt O'Brien/AP The storm system that pummeled much of the East Coast on Friday had moved hundreds of miles offshore by Saturday, but residual wind gusts and coastal flood threats, exacerbated by high tide, continued to plague the region from Maryland through Maine. Scientists say the storm has met the definition of a ""bomb cyclone,"" a dramatic name that seemed fitting for the vast damage already wrought over the region Saturday. ""It really just refers to a strong low pressure system that intensifies very rapidly,"" said Patrick Burke, a lead forecaster with NOAA's Weather Prediction Center. ""What it means is very intense winds, like you saw across all of the East Coast."" Gusts hit 70 m.p.h. Friday, but the highest was recorded in Barnstable, MA., on Cape Cod, at 93 m.p.h., Burke said. In all, at least seven people reportedly died from trees or limbs crashing down. In Putnam County, N.Y. police said an 11-year-old boy died Friday afternoon after a tree crashed onto his home. In Chesterfield County, Va., another child, age 6, lay asleep in his bed in the early morning hours Friday when a tree toppled on his residence, killing him, said the county in a statement. Five other people were killed — all adults in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Rhode Island — all from falling trees or branches, according to The Associated Press.

Patricia Kitchen,"Long Islanders can expect heavy rain and potential flash flooding Thursday as a cold front from the west interacts with tropical moisture from the south, forecasters said. Associated with Tropical Storm Michael, the moisture, surging northward from eastern North Carolina and Virginia, will move up into the area this afternoon and tonight, the National Weather Service said in a flash flood watch. The watch is in effect for the entire metropolitan region. On Long Island, the watch lasts from noon through late Thursday. The storm itself will stay to the south, moving off the coast and into the mid-Atlantic later in the day, according to the National Hurricane Center track. Look for showers and a few thunderstorms starting late morning to early afternoon, said Joe Pollina, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Upton. Long Island is looking at 1.5 to 2 inches of rain Thursday, with 2 to 4 possible in some spots, the watch said. Any heavy precipitation falling within a one- to three-hour time frame could result in flash flooding. With the Island already having had an abundance of recent precipitation, the ground is still rather moist and with up to 2 inches of rain or even a bit more possible, there will be some local flooding to contend with, said News 12 Long Island meteorologist Bill Korbel. Isolated minor coastal flooding is expected with the morning to early afternoon high tide cycle, particularly for the most vulnerable spots along the South Shore bays of Nassau County.

Leanna Garfield,"People look at cars and homes engulfed in floodwaters on February 22, 2017 in San Jose, California. Getty Images In California, earthquakes are common, and most residents understand the risks of powerful reverberations destroying their homes and streets. But according to a new book from LA's most famous seismologist, Lucy Jones, the state faces an even bigger threat: a megaflood that would pummel inland California. Jones' book, ""The Big Ones: How Natural Disasters Have Shaped Us (and What We Can Do about Them,"" looks at the history of the world's biggest earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, and volcanic eruptions — as well as disasters we could experience in coming years. One nightmare scenario investigated by the US Geological Survey, dubbed ARkStorm, would bring a series of heavy rains in a short timespan to California. The state could suffer extreme rainfall that overwhelms flood-control systems, forces 1.5 million people to evacuate, inundates 25% of California's land, and causes $725 billion in damage. Bringing as much as 15 times the water flowing out of the Mississippi River's mouth, an ARkStorm could devastate several areas in California, including Silicon Valley. According to Jones and the USGS, a major flood like this could strike in any future winter. California has also seen an ARkStorm before. California has a history of monster storms Grand Avenue in Buena Park, California during the flood of 1938. Photo courtesy Orange County Archives Eighty years ago, during one of the driest March-through-February periods ever recorded in the region, an epic series of storms caused mudflows that damaged and destroyed hundreds of homes in Southern California. As The Los Angeles Times notes, rain fell as fast as two inches an hour, inundating railroads, bridges, and roads throughout the San Fernando Valley. At least 21 people died. Nearly a century earlier, the Great Flood of 1862 submerged most of the Central Valley and Los Angeles Basin. Every major city in the region flooded, and downtown Sacramento was only accessible by boat. One-third of California's taxable land was destroyed, rendering the state bankrupt. The flood also killed just over 1% of the state's population. These two storms produced precipitation that exceeded levels that many places in the US experience once every 500 to 1,000 years on average. They did serve as wake-up calls for California, however. Local officials responded by building dams and making rivers deeper to mitigate future flooding following the 1938 flood. And after the Great Flood of 1862, California temporarily moved its capital to San Francisco. But Jones writes that California's modern-day flood-control systems aren't equipped to handle another storm of that magnitude. A Cal Fire firefighter looks at a flooded section of Highway 101 after a mudslide on January 10, 2018 in Montecito, California. Getty Images How to make California more resilient to mass floods In the last chapter of Jones' book, she lays out ways that California cities can prepare for the next big storm. For example, LA could invest more heavily in solar energy or rechargeable groundwater basins, which would both help the city mitigate climate change in the longterm and reduce reliance on power lines and old aqueducts during a storm in the meantime. Another resource for LA residents is the Community Emergency Response Training program, which allows neighborhoods to design their disaster response block-by-block. California is not equipped to handle mass flooding California's flood-control systems need massive overhauls, according to the USGS. Its existing levees aren't designed to withstand an ARkStorm, which could cause a flood 300 miles long and 20 or more miles wide. The agency's report also includes terrifying maps of hypothetical flooding that would happen during an ARkStorm. As seen below, it would plunge much of Sacramento, Northern Orange County, and Stockton underwater. Hypothetical flooding in an ARkStorm event in Sacramento. USGS Hypothetical flooding in an ARkStorm event in Stockton. USGS Other California cities that could see extreme flooding in coming years include areas in and around Silicon Valley (Among them: Santa Clara, Mountain View, Cupertino, San Jose, Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Foster City, San Mateo, Burlingame, Fremont, and Newark). State and local agencies allocate $30 million annually toward maintaining 1,600 miles of levees in the Central Valley. But Michael Mierzwa, the lead flood management planner for the California Department of Water Resources, told The LA Times they should be spending $130 million per year to meet current federal standards. Just last year, the Lake Oroville Dam north of Sacramento buckled after a series of torrential winter storms. The structure crumbled on one side, spilling a massive amount of water onto the dam's walls. If the state hadn't unplugged the dam in time, its walls would've likely eroded and unleashed all that water onto the surrounding communities. ""California flood protection is not designed for an ARkStorm-like event,"" the USGS writes.","A report from the US Geological Survey and a new book from Lucy Jones, an esteemed seismologist, say that an extreme storm could hit California.

 A man injured in the cyclone in Zimbabwe is carried away from a helicopter.
Cyclone Idai, which struck the coastline of Mozambique on 14 March, has caused devastation and heavy loss of life. 
The UN says 1.7 million people in Mozambique lived in the path of the cyclone, with a further 920,000 people affected in Malawi and many thousands more in Zimbabwe. 
So how common is extreme weather in southern Africa, and were these countries sufficiently prepared? 
Tropical cyclones in this part of the Indian Ocean are not that rare. 
Most form in the central Indian Ocean, sufficiently far enough off the coast for some preparations to be made. 
Cyclone Idai was unusual in that it formed in the Mozambique Channel, close to the coastline, giving governments and aid agencies less time to issue warnings and make plans.
""The cyclone was by no stretch of the imagination the most powerful... but what made it so devastating was where and how it hit,"" said Clare Nullis, spokeswoman for the World Meteorological Organization.
""The ocean floor along the coast by Mozambique is conducive to give storm surges, which reached roughly 3.5m-to-4m in the coastal city of Beira - which is absolutely huge.""
The low-lying coastal areas of central Mozambique are highly vulnerable to natural disasters but the budget for preparing and responding to them is very small. 
Last year, the government received support from international donors for a disaster fund of $18.3m (£13.9m) for 2018 and 2019.
This contingency plan is the main source of funding for any disaster response and is intended specifically for search and rescue within the first 72 hours.
For a major disaster such as Cyclone Idai, most of the funds for recovery and reconstruction are raised after a disaster has struck. 
And even without this latest emergency, Mozambique was facing economic strains as a result of a controversial loan deal in 2016 which resulted in a suspension of some international donor aid to the government.
Media captionAerial footage showing the disaster in Mozambique
How much warning?
The meteorological office of Mozambique, Inam, issued weather alerts as the storm developed.
Three days before the cyclone struck, the government raised the alert to the highest possible level, telling people to evacuate threatened areas. 
Some people were moved out by boat beforehand, but many didn't respond to warnings or weren't aware of them. 
""These public alerts were made in a timely fashion but it's always down to actors along the chain to decide how to act on this type of information,"" says Joao de Lima Rego, an adviser at Deltares, a research organisation focusing on coastal regions and river basins that has helped develop a forecasting system in Mozambique. 
As part of the forward planning for severe weather, safe zones had been created in rural areas for evacuation above the flood plain. 
On this occasion, however, the flooding was far more severe than anticipated.

Preparations in urban areas
The port city of Beira, with a population of half a million, had introduced measures to strengthen resilience to cyclones and flooding. 
Preparedness has focused on drainage systems, says Dinis Juizo, associate professor of hydrology at the University of Eduardo Mondlane in Maputo. 
Drainage canals and flood-control protection, such as a large water basin, have also been introduced.
However, much of the population of Beira outside the city centre live in informal housing often made of materials unable to withstand severe weather.
""The level of investment has not been high enough for an event of this scale,"" says Dinis Juizo.

 Aid agencies have faced challenges in getting resources to flood-hit areas of Mozambique
Malawi and Zimbabwe
The storm that eventually became Cyclone Idai had caused deaths in Malawi, to the north of Mozambique, in early March.
People in lowland areas were warned, but because warnings about flooding and rainfall are an annual occurrence during the rainy season, many people were reluctant to move and didn't anticipate the extent to which the country would suffer.
In Zimbabwe, there were also warnings about the approaching storm. 
But Zimbabwe's Minister of Defence, Oppah Muchinguri, has said her government failed to anticipate its strength. 
By the time the storm reached Zimbabwe it had weakened considerably and was no longer a tropical cyclone.
Nevertheless, it had a severe impact on the eastern regions of the country.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright NASA/NOAA The past year has been a busy one for hurricanes. There were 17 named storms in 2017, 10 hurricanes and six major hurricanes (category 3 or higher) - an above average year in each respect. The 10 hurricanes formed consecutively, without weaker tropical storms interrupting the sequence. The only other time this has been recorded was in 1893. Are these storms getting worse? And does climate change have anything to do with it? A year of records This Atlantic hurricane season has been particularly bad. There was Harvey, which pummelled the United States in August. It brought the largest amount of rain on record from any tropical system - 1,539mm. It caused the sort of flooding you'd expect to see once every 500 years, causing $200bn of damage to Houston, Texas. Ironically, this was the third such ""one every 500 years"" flood Houston had suffered in three years. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Usually hurricanes might last a day or two, but the torrential rain from Harvey lasted a week. September brought Irma, which devastated Caribbean communities. It was the joint second strongest Atlantic hurricane ever, with sustained winds of 185mph. Those winds were sustained for 37 hours - longer than any tropical system on record, anywhere in the world. Next came Hurricane Maria - another category 5 hurricane, with sustained winds of 175mph - which destroyed Puerto Rico's power grid. Finally, Hurricane Ophelia span past Portugal and Spain - the farthest east any major Atlantic hurricane has ever gone. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ophelia carried Saharan dust as far north as London, darkening the sky in the middle of the day Despite this, 2017 wasn't the worst year in some key respects. It didn't produce the strongest storm - that was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with sustained winds of 190mph. Nor did it have the greatest number of storms - that was 2005, which saw an incredible 28 named storms, including seven major hurricanes. One of them was the infamous Hurricane Katrina. But 2017 was probably the costliest. Estimates for the cost of the hurricane season vary and continue to be revised, ranging up to $385bn. By comparison, 2005 racked up $144bn in damage according to the National Hurricane Center - about $180bn today, adjusted for inflation. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey's persistent rain caused catastrophic flooding in parts of Texas It has certainly been a bad year. But over time, are hurricanes getting worse? There have been 33 of the strongest category 5 hurricanes since 1924. Eleven of these have occurred in the past 14 years. We know that hurricanes are powered by warm seas and over the past 100 years global average sea temperatures have risen by about 1C. But when you look at the total strength of storms in each year since records began, some years are more fearsome than others. Meteorologists use something called accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) to calculate the total wind power of all the storms in any given year. As you can see from the following chart, there's no clear upward trend. Why not? Even though seas are getting warmer, other factors can prevent hurricanes forming in particular years. Saharan dust can interfere with hurricane formation as can the close proximity of African storms to the equator. But one of the great weather ironies is that hurricanes hate strong winds. Strong winds in the Atlantic interfere with the circulation of air through a developing storm. This stops the storm growing into a hurricane. During a phenomenon called El Niño, the Pacific Ocean near the equator gets warmer than usual. This affects global wind patterns, leading to stronger winds in the Atlantic. That means El Niño years tend to be quiet years for hurricanes. But when the Pacific is cooler (known as La Niña), the reverse is true - making it easier for hurricanes to form. And 2017 is a La Niña year. In fact, the total storm strength in La Niña years has been rising decade by decade. Land drainage High winds are just part of the story. Climate change affects hurricane seasons in other ways, too. Rainfall during hurricanes can be devastating. Hurricane Harvey would have brought severe flooding to Houston regardless of climate change. But it is reasonable to assume that Harvey brought more rain than it would have done 100 years ago. Global air temperatures have also increased by about 1C in the past 100 years, and warmer air holds more water. That's likely to be behind the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events seen in the US in recent decades. Image copyright EPA Image caption Extreme rainfall events are becoming more common in the US, according to data from the EPA But the location of housing compounded the damage. Houston's population has more than doubled since 1960 to more than two million people. Housing developments are expanding into more marginal, poorly drained land. This puts more people in harm's way. Climate change is also causing seas to rise. Melting glaciers and land-based ice sheets contribute to higher sea levels. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Melting glaciers are causing sea levels to rise Also warmer water occupies a larger volume. So as seas warm up, sea levels rise. In the US, the largest sea-level rise is around the coast of the Gulf of Mexico - about 9.6mm each year at Eugene Island, Louisiana. All of this is increasing vulnerability to flooding when hurricanes and their associated storm surge reach land. A warmer world is bringing us a greater number of hurricanes and a greater risk of a hurricane becoming the most powerful category 5. There's an increased risk of flood damage - whether related to climate change, rising sea levels or more people moving into flood-prone areas. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Flood-hit Iran is evacuating more towns and villages as forecasts show further rain is expected on Saturday.
Heavy downpours are set to strike the south western provinces of the country as officials plan to release water from key river dams that are near capacity. 
Women and children are being moved to safer areas while men are asked to stay and assist with relief efforts. 
In recent weeks, much of the country has been submerged and the death toll currently stands at 70.
Towns such as Susangerd, with a population of 50,000, will be left at risk and it will be evacuated on Saturday, along with around five other communities in the province of Khuzestan.

Around 70 villages in the province have already been evacuated over the past week. 
The region is rich in oil and energy companies placed in the area have been assisting with the flood relief by using pumps to remove water. 
Extremely heavy rain began on March 19, in total affecting about 1,900 cities, towns and villages. Many thousands of roads, bridges and buildings have been destroyed. 
So far, 86,000 people are living in emergency shelters, of which about 1,000 were airlifted to safety. 
Aid agencies are struggling to cope with the demands and Iran's state budget is under pressure due to US sanctions on energy and banking. 
Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has accused US sanctions - reimposed after President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last year - of impeding aid efforts to affected areas, saying that it has caused a shortage of rescue helicopters.
""This isn't just economic warfare; it's economic terrorism,"" Mr Zarif tweeted on April 1.
The government has maintained that people, especially farmers, will be compensated for their losses. 
The head of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards said the armed forces were ""using all their power"" to minimise damage.

Environmental experts believe that deforestation has been one of the major causes of flooding in recent years in the country.
According to Iran's Natural Resources and Forestry Organization, widespread and unregulated deforestation has destroyed around half of Iran's northern forests, areas where major floods have occurred.
According to the organisation, the northern forests area has been reduced from 3.6 million to 1.8 million hectares during the past 40 years.

Mejs Hasan,"When an iceberg breaks off from a glacier, it can drift for thousands of miles, traveling freely across the open ocean. But last week, an iceberg’s journey was interrupted when it got stuck on a shallow part of the seafloor along Greenland’s western coast. In other words, the iceberg was grounded—and it had lodged itself right beside the small island village of Innaarsuit. Such grounded icebergs are actually pretty common, says Fiamma Straneo, who has traveled about 20 times to Greenland’s ice sheet for her work at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography. What’s unique about the iceberg by Innaarsuit, which has a population of less than 200, is both its size and its proximity to the village. A grounded iceberg experiences ocean water pushing at it in one direction and the seafloor pushing in another—a tug-of-war that makes it easy for limbs to break off with a splash that can rock boats or flood coasts. The iceberg might even do an entire somersault in the water. Across the world, from the Canadian Arctic to Patagonia in Argentina, that shedding is both a tourist attraction and an issue of concern. The larger the iceberg, the larger the waves it causes if it breaks apart—and the Innaarsuit iceberg rises about 300 feet above the water, according to a Danish meteorologist quoted by the Danish broadcaster DR. The iceberg that felled the Titanic is thought to have risen a mere 50 to 100 feet above water. What happens with a grounded iceberg is almost luck of the draw, says Margaret Lindeman, a PhD student also studying the Greenland ice sheet through Scripps. Perhaps only a small chunk of ice will fall off the iceberg; maybe a little piece will break off the bottom, allowing the iceberg to lift off the seafloor and drift away. Or maybe the whole canyon of ice will implode, causing the sort of flooding feared by villagers in Innaarsuit. Dozens of them evacuated on Friday from their lower-lying homes. Greenland’s steep, rocky western coastline is often treated to a procession of icebergs drifting through the water, the number of which has increased since the 1990s, likely due to ocean warming. Many villages are perched on flatter areas atop cliffs, out of the flood zone—but there are still fishing boats, marinas, and boat fuel-stations at the edge of the water. All this infrastructure gets damaged from time to time by grounded icebergs, Straneo says, even if the village itself does not need to be evacuated. The disintegrating icebergs also pose a problem for scientists. When Straneo and Lindeman collect ocean measurements off their boat, they never get too close to the iceberg. There’s too great a chance that a piece will break off and smash the boat, or that the iceberg will capsize. So instead, they send a remote-controlled robot resembling a bright yellow kayak through the icy water to collect data on temperature and salinity. For others, the splashes of the iceberg are a spectacle. Illulisat is a village and Unesco World Heritage site further south from Innaarsuit on Greenland’s western coast. Close by, a cliff of ice routinely sheds chunks into the water, generating dramatic waves that tourist boats travel to see. It’s the job of the boat captain to carefully time the tourists’ exit onto shore. Even so, sometimes a piece of iceberg falls off as they disembark, and passengers get doused as they scramble off the boat. Back in Innaarsuit, the Danish broadcaster DR reported that the iceberg was blown by winds a few hundred meters away from the island over the weekend; today, some evacuees were given the all-clear to return home. But the homes and streets within 10 meters from the coast are still off-limits, along with a convenience store, fish factory, and power plant. As Innaarsuit's villagers settle back in, they'll be keeping a close eye on the iceberg's next great migration.

Miles Parks,"White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow speaks during a meeting between President Donald Trump and governors and lawmakers at the White House in April 2018. Evan Vucci/AP House Republicans confronted two of President Trump's top economic advisers on trade on Thursday, while also breathing a sigh of relief after the administration's decision to begin easing tensions with Europe a day earlier. The Rose Garden announcement on Wednesday with Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, in which both sides said progress was made toward retreating from a trade war, went a long way in buying the Trump administration time to prove its plan is working. Republicans in Congress have grown increasingly impatient as the president has enacted hard-line trade policies targeting imports from Mexico, Canada, the European Union, and China, to name a few. ""[Trump]'s a great negotiator, he did a good job,"" said Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas about the move to soften the administration's stance on some goods. But Williams personifies the bind many Republicans find themselves in. He's a pro-Trump lawmaker, but he's also a car dealer, and the auto industry is losing sleep over Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, and the potential the administration has raised for more auto-related tariffs. Williams relayed his concerns to Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, and Peter Navarro, one of president Trump's top trade advisers, when the two advisers met with House Republicans Thursday morning to debrief the lawmakers on the EU deal and American trade policy going forward. Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas, was one of many Republican lawmakers to raise concerns about the Trump administration's trade policies on Thursday. Jacquelyn Martin/AP ""My message was — they need to be very careful with tariffs on domestic content,"" Williams said. ""[Car dealers are] already beginning to cancel orders with the manufacturers because they're fearful of tariffs... that can convert to less jobs, and job layoffs."" A ""flood"" of lawmakers expressed similar trade policy concerns to Kudlow and Navarro in the meeting, said Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich. ""I was making sure they heard the message that this is not just uncomfortable, but it's painful and damaging,"" Huizenga said. ""My constituents are being potentially put out of a job."" But Huizenga also said it would be hard not to characterize Trump's Wednesday announcement as a win. Trump said he and Juncker agreed that the EU would buy U.S. soybeans, and that the EU would become a ""massive buyer"" of U.S. liquefied natural gas. Juncker declared he ""had the intention to make a deal today and we made a deal today."" Trump said the two allies will also work to resolve tariffs on steel and aluminum, and work towards ""zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods."" ""Let me not just curse the darkness, I'm glad there was a candle lit yesterday with the European Union,"" Rep. Huizenga said. ""It's progress. To have the temperature lowered with our European trading partners and allies is smart."" Navarro met with Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday afternoon as well. Early in the week, the Trump administration came under fire after announcing a $12 billion subsidy program for farmers, especially soybean farmers, hurt by its own trade policies. It was unclear how much Wednesday's announcement that the EU would begin buying American soybeans would affect American farmers, as much of the hurt has actually come from tariffs on China. ""We shouldn't have a policy that creates economic distress and then implement FDR-style New Deal era programs to remedy problems of our own creation,"" said Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky. His state has also been affected by retaliatory tariffs from the EU on bourbon, and Barr said he didn't feel satisfied by the amount of specificity in Thursday's briefing on whether that would also be resolved soon.","Congressional Republicans are anxious about Trump's trade policies, but found some relief in the deal the president announced yesterday with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.",2018-07-26T21:48:23Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",House Republicans 'Flood' Trump Administration With Concerns Over Tariffs,https://www.npr.org/2018/07/26/632707044/house-republicans-flood-trump-administration-with-concerns-over-tariffs,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/07/26/roger-williams_wide-b7e318b417f0dc7b0ec0d6d06e1e4900183e6b46.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,flood,0
Reuters Editorial,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions have prevented the Iranian Red Crescent from obtaining any foreign financial aid to assist victims of flooding that has killed at least 70 people and inundated some 1,900 communities, the group said on Sunday. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that Washington was ready to help via the Red Cross and Red Crescent, but accused Iran’s clerical establishment of “mismanagement in urban planning and in emergency preparedness”. 
“No foreign cash help has been given to the Iranian Red Crescent society. With attention to the inhuman American sanctions, there is no way to send this cash assistance,” the Red Crescent said in a statement. 
It said the group had received some non-financial help from abroad which had been distributed to flood victims. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said last week that U.S. sanctions - reimposed after Washington quit a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers - were impeding aid efforts to flood-stricken towns and villages. 
“Blocked equipment includes relief choppers: This isn’t just economic warfare; it’s economic TERRORISM,” he said on Twitter. 
The flood disaster, arising from exceptionally heavy rainfall since March 19, has left aid agencies struggling to cope and seen 86,000 people moved to emergency shelters. 
The government has told citizens, and especially flood-affected farmers, that all losses will be compensated. 
Iran’s state budget is already stretched under U.S. sanctions on energy and banking sectors that have halved its oil exports and restricted access to some revenues abroad. 
Iran acted on Saturday to evacuate more towns and villages threatened by floods after continued rain in the southwest.

The water wrecked storefronts and left cars strewn amid debris on Monday. Katherine Frey/The Washington Post/Getty Images Fast-moving flood waters caused mayhem in Ellicott City, Md., on Sunday, triggering an emergency declaration and urgent messages for residents to seek higher ground. One man remains missing, as crews work to clear the area. Howard County Police say Eddison Hermond, 39, of Severn, Md., is unaccounted for; they're asking the public to help find him. Washington-area radio news outlet WTOP describes Hermond as ""an Air Force veteran and a member of the National Guard."" A friend of Hermond's told WTOP that the veteran had been in a restaurant in downtown Ellicott City on Sunday; witnesses said he was swept away after trying to help people. Swiftwater rescue teams searched for Hermond last night, both on foot and in all-terrain vehicles – but the search was suspended and resumed on Monday, according to the Arbutus Volunteer Fire Department. Founded in 1772, Ellicott City's Main Street and downtown have been designated a historic district. The same area suffered massive flooding in 2016, when the city barely avoided having to tear down any buildings in a long and expensive rebuilding effort. In that catastrophe in July of 2016, two people died in what was called a ""once in a 1,000 years"" event. But in 2018, it has happened again, devastating an area that, due to its valley setting, had endured other floods in the past. ******* MISSING PERSON ALERT IN ELLICOTT CITY ******* this is eddison hermond. he was swept away in the ellicott city flooding yesterday around 5pm trying to help people and hasn't been seen or heard from since. if you have any news, please contact me #EllicottCityFlood pic.twitter.com/moxxJm1Sjj — Kenneth Josepha (@Kdogcony76) May 28, 2018 Rain storms have been seen growing more intense in recent years – but part of the difference, at least one expert says, also lies in how the area's land surface has changed. Discussing Ellicott City after the 2016 flash flood, Jeffrey B. Halverson, a geography professor at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, told member station WAMU : ""It's heavily paved, there's lots of narrow streets that act as very rapid conduits of water – so the flood was as much about the nature of the underlying land surface as it was the large amount of rain falling from the sky."" Intense flooding hit the town's Main Street in at least two waves on Sunday, shoving cars down the street and bursting through storefronts – including at several buildings where people found themselves suddenly trapped in stores and restaurants. Images and video from the scene are striking, showing fast-moving water rising nearly as high as the bottom edge of the streets' stop signs and obliterating anything in the torrent's path. One day after the flooding hit, people are reaching out to help. The Howard County government says anyone who wants to volunteer can register at its website – but that for now, the downtown area remains off-limits. The Visit Ellicott City organization says a local non-profit called the Ellicott City Partnership is taking donations to help the community recover from the flood, as it did in 2016. On Monday, conditions had dried out enough that salvage crews could begin towing vehicles that had been caught in the disaster.","Less than two years after what had been called a ""once in a 1,000 years"" flood in 2016, Ellicott City, Md., sees its historic downtown ravaged anew.

Karissa Bell,"Google wants to help developers build the next Pokémon Go. The company announced that it's opening Google Maps to game developers who want to use its data to build location-based games similar to Pokémon Go. SEE ALSO: Google Maps has a 'Mario Time' feature, and it's as awesome as it sounds With the new APIs, the entirety of Google Maps essentially becomes a massive canvas for game developers to build on top of. Instead of manually creating map-based models, developers will simply be able to pull Google Maps data, including 3D renderings of buildings, landmarks, and roads, directly into their game development software. Needless to say, this is a huge deal for any developer interested in creating a location-based game. Google's mapped millions and millions of objects — all of which can now be easily brought into a mobile game. ""You're taking away what would otherwise be an enormous hurdle,"" says Google Maps product manager Clementine Jacoby. It should also come as good news to Pokémon Go enthusiasts, who should expect to see a lot more augmented reality games flood the scene in the next few months. (There are already a handful of games that've been announced that use the Google Maps APIs, including Jurassic World Alive, Ghostbusters World, and The Walking Dead: Our World.)

Marcus Gilmer,"With a giant nor'easter slamming into the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, forecasters are using warnings with dire language to inform coastal residents of Massachusetts that this storm will not be an ordinary event. In fact, record coastal flooding is anticipated in Boston and other parts of eastern Massachusetts, which is leading the National Weather Service to come out with statements that it rarely, if ever, issues. SEE ALSO: Intense nor'easter may demolish coastal flood records, knock out power to millions The coastal flooding is the result of a long fetch of easterly winds, reaching hurricane force (75 miles per hour), pointed squarely at the north-south coast of eastern Massachusetts. The combination of astronomical high tides, astorm surge of 3 to 5 feet, storm surge, and waves of up to 30 feet just just offshore, is already inundating the coastline with water levels well above normal tide levels, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). At high tide on Friday morning, the water in Boston Harbor reached 14.36 feet, which was the third-highest water level on record. And the worst of this storm is yet to come. For the high tide on Friday night, the NWS is forecasting a record water level will be set in Boston of between 15.4 and 15.7 feet, beating the old record set just two months ago. The long-lasting flooding and battering waves has prompted unusually drastic language in the NWS' warnings (emphasis ours). Damage to some shoreline structures may occur. There will likely be widespread inundation of coastal roads and basements with life-threatening inundation depths above 3 or more feet possible in some locations. Some neighborhoods may be cut off for an extended time. This is a dangerous storm, and evacuation of some neighborhoods may be necessary. Another major impact from the storm will likely be beach erosion, prompting this warning from the NWS: ""Very severe to extreme erosion is likely and may compromise protective dunes, seawalls and other structures. This storm may be capable of producing one or more new inlets."" In other words, this storm could simply smash through existing land, to create new islands. The NWS's Coastal Flood Threat and Inundation map shows where the worst flooding is expected along the Massachusetts coast, with water levels of nearly 15 feet expected in locations like Gloucester Harbor, Revere, Scituate, and Boston. The coastal flooding could break records all along Massachusetts' coast, including the Boston area, records that were just set in early January thanks to the ""Bomb Cyclone"" that whipped through the area. There's a major difference between that storm and this one, even though both are intensifying rapidly enough to be called meteorological bombs. Unlike with the ""Bomb Cyclone,"" which moved through quickly, a high pressure area over Greenland (also known as a ""Greenland block"") will keep the current storm system pinned in place for days. This means the storm will last through several high tide cycles along the North Atlantic coast, making damage more likely.

Reuters Editorial,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Oil’s price rally this year to its highest since May 2015 may seem a source of glee for OPEC, but some in the producer group fear the gains could prompt shale companies to crank open their spigots and flood the market. Benchmark Brent crude rose further above $68 a barrel on Tuesday, supported by oil output cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia that are due to run until the end of 2018. The surge comes as a welcome boost for the revenues of oil-producing nations, many still reeling from a price collapse that started in mid-2014 when crude began to fall steeply from above $100 per barrel due to oversupply. Some in OPEC are worried a prolonged rally could stimulate more U.S. shale oil output, however, creating more oversupply that could weigh on prices and market share. “We all are excited about the rally and want to see if it will be sustainable during the year, as it will certainly whet the appetite of shale producers,” an official from an OPEC country said. The oil minister of Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, said on Tuesday that the organization’s members were not keen on increased prices as such gains would encourage more shale production. OPEC has no formal target for oil prices. However, Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s top producer, wants to see crude above $60 to boost the valuation of its national oil company Aramco before an initial public offering of shares this year and to reduce the gap in its state budget, Saudi sources have said. OPEC sources say Saudi Arabia has become a strong advocate of higher prices, a shift from a more moderate stance in the past, and Saudi officials have downplayed the threat of a boost in shale production. Even so, U.S. production is expected soon to rise above 10 million barrels per day, close to Saudi levels, due largely to soaring output from shale drillers, government data shows. [EIA/M] OPEC officials also think the 2018 rally has been mainly driven by unrest in Iran, rather than a tighter balance between supply and demand, giving rise to concern it may not last. “Oil prices rose because of the political situation in Iran,” an OPEC source said. “There is a worry now that this would be followed by a sharp decline in prices.” A third OPEC source said market fundamentals did not justify the price rally. “It is only politics that is changing the mood. The push in prices will mean the peak is near and hence prices will give up some of the gains.” While OPEC sources say oil market fundamentals remain strong on the back of the supply cuts, others are worried that economic growth in consuming countries could slow and higher prices might encourage some producers to pump above their output target.

Powerful winds and rains are expected throughout Thursday and Friday through North Carolina. One thing you can do to help in the long term is vote out climate change deniers this November. But for immediate aid, here are some places you can donate who are supporting people on the ground. GlobalGiving supports local and grassroots that work to restore areas hit by disasters, and their Hurricane Michael Relief Fund can be found here. They have a current goal of two million dollars, some of which will be directed toward immediate needs, and they also direct money to rebuilding efforts. World Vision works with local groups as well, though many of them seem to be churches in the area. This might be an effective strategy, as houses of worship often serve as shelters during storms. World Vision is putting together food, clean water, personal hygiene items, flood cleanup kits and more for families. They are not based in Florida, but seem to run programs worldwide. You can donate here. Volunteer Florida is urging people to register as volunteers in Florida with them to support Hurricane Michael victims, and suggesting the Disaster Fund as a place to donate money. The Fund is Floridas official private fund for helping communities recover from disasters. Team Rubicon is a group of military veterans who mobilize for rescue efforts in disasters. They already have a number of members in North Carolina who are still helping with recovery efforts after Hurricane Florence. You can help them out here. Recommended by Charity Navigator, this group is a network of non-denominational evangelical Christian churches that has a long history of responding to disasters. They have equipment stationed and ready to move in along the Gulf Coast and in Albany, GA, according to their website. Direct Relief is also noted on Charity Navigator for their commitment to financial transparency. They are also firmly unaffiliated with any religion or political group and say they provide aid to anyone in need without regard to politics, religion, ethnic identities or ability to pay. They support in part almost 200 health facilities in Michaels path, and have outfitted ten of them with emergency medical packs in anticipation of the storm. You can donate here.

DAVID GONZALEZ,"“The river, historically, has marked this dynamic of life on the periphery and along borders,” said Ms. Escobar, 32. “It’s also associated with dreams of El Dorado, to extractive industries that take out resources.” She likens the local economy’s structure to one dominated by modern day robber barons who have enriched themselves through trade in everything from animal skins and feathers to cocaine and gold. Over all, members of 10 different indigenous groups account for 80 percent of the population. Some of them have been seminomadic, she said, while others have been able to establish themselves far from outside interference. Many of them pass through Puerto Carreño, which she said was founded as an outpost by the government 80 years ago. As with any border town, there is a mix of adventurers, rascals, robbers and people trying to survive. But the town’s indigenous residents, she said, face marginalization and discrimination. Ms. Escobar noted that indigenous girls as young as 10 have been ensnared in prostitution and drug use, living like indigents on the street.

Daniel Cooper,"Door View Cam comes with all of the usual features you'd expect from a Ring product, including HD video, privacy zones and smart alerts. In addition, however, it packs an impact sensor to alert you when a moron knocks on your door instead of, you know, pushing the clearly obvious bell. It's worth adding that existing Ring products will let you watch what's going on at the door with its Live View feature. But
Because this is designed to sit over door peepholes, the product is installed without drilling or permanent modifications. That should mean that folks in rental properties and apartment blocks will be up for trying the device, so long as you can pop out the existing peephole. And Ring will, as usual, guarantee to replace your equipment if it's stolen, although it should be pretty hard to steal.
Ring is also adding a number of new sensors that work with Ring Alarm, its comprehensive home security product. That includes a smoke and carbon monoxide sensor (pictured, right) that'll sound the horn if it detects either in your home's atmosphere. As well as a flood and freeze sensor that can spot water leaks and the dreaded cold temperature in your water pipes. The list is rounded out by a siren that'll sound the horn when the system detects ""a security event occurs.""
Ring itself doesn't make smart locks, but it is now adding integration for a number of smart locks, all of which also works with Alexa. The company will now sell locks through its own store, including deadbolts from Kwikset, Schlage and Yale. August's smart locks are going to work with Ring's system at some point in the future as well, letting you unlock the door through your Ring app. Not to mention that all of these will work seamlessly with Amazon's Echo products for voice control and video viewing.
Rounding out the product list is a new series of lighting gear, including a $70 wall-mounted floodlight and a $30 path light. The range begins shipping at the start of March, with more details coming in the future.
The Door View Cam will launch in the US, as well as selected European markets, at some point later in the year, with prices starting at $199. The various additional accessories for Ring Alarm are priced between $30 and $40, while the smart locks will set you back between $140 and $220, depending on which brand you choose.","Ring, a name now synonymous with video doorbells, is making a product to help folks who already have peepholes in their doors.

Anthony Ha,"EyeEm is unveiling new tools to help the brands and marketers using the site to source their images. Underlying these tools is a technology called EyeEm Vision, which we described in-depth earlier this year. The goal is to expand image recognition so that it’s not just identifying the objects in the photo, but also its aesthetic qualities. EyeEm’s co-founder and chief product officer Lorenz Aschoff described EyeEm Vision as an extension of the photography marketplace’s broader mission to address “the content crisis” — namely the fact that when EyeEm was founded in 2011, Aschoff felt that there was a “massive flood of images” that had “completely destroyed the visual aesthetics of the web.” EyeEm aims to fix that by helping brands find beautiful photographs. And Aschoff said EyeEm Vision has been trained to identify many of the visual elements that make for a good photograph — it is, in his words, “technology that understands, in general, beauty.” At the same time, he acknowledged, “What I think is beautiful might be different from what you think is beautiful.” Plus, individual brands are going to have their own specific standards and guidelines that go beyond beauty. So each customer can upload photos that train EyeEm Vision to identify photos that match their own aesthetic — Aschoff said EyeEm’s analysis is looking at around half a million different factors. One of the ways EyeEm is actually deploying the technology is by launching a new Missions Dashboard. Brands use Missions to crowdsource campaign photos from the EyeEm community, and the new dashboard allows them to track how their Mission is going — how many photographers are participating, how many photos have been uploaded and so on. EyeEm says that the average Mission results in more than 100,000 photos, which why it’s important to use EyeEm Vision to surface the photos that best match what the brand’s style. EyeEm is also incorporating Vision into a personalized search product, where marketers can search the EyeEm image library, filtered based on their own brand guidelines. For example, BCG’s 11,000 consultants can now search for images to use in their presentations and marketing materials, and EyeEm will only show the images that are a good fit with the BCG brand. And while this is less directly related to Vision, EyeEm is also announcing a new program called Custom, where brands can work with EyeEm photographers on custom shoots. Lastly, if you’re curious about Vision, you can try it out for yourself on the EyeEm website.

Annalee Newitz,"Enlarge / This Nilometer at Cairo is an ancient device that Egyptians used to measure Nile flooding, to predict the harvest and set tax levels. Scientists used historical data from Nileometers to see how volcanic eruptions affected Nile floods (and by extension, the health of the harvest). reader comments 1 From 305-30 BCE, ancient Egypt was ruled by the Ptolemaic Dynasty, a Greek family put in place after Alexander the Great conquered Egypt. Though Egypt's wealth and importance were legendary during this time, it was also a period of great civil unrest. Perhaps because they were being ruled by foreigners, the Egyptian people revolted against their leadership several times during the 200s, sparking civil wars. But now scientists believe these revolts may have broken out in part because of a chain reaction started by volcanoes halfway across the world. There's no doubt that the Egyptians were chafing under the yoke of their foreign monarchs. The days of the great pharaohs were over, and leaders from the north were replacing Egyptian culture with Greek gods and architecture. But why did the Egyptians' resentment boil over into open revolt sometimes and remain at a steady simmer otherwise? Historian Francis Ludlow of Trinity College, Ireland, and his colleagues believe that ash, dust, and other particles released by volcanoes during the 200s BCE caused temperatures to cool around the globe. Cooling resulted in less water evaporation, which meant less rain for northern Africa and, therefore, less flooding of the life-giving Nile River. Because the ancient Egyptians were a farming culture that lived and died by the harvest, the annual Nile flood was key to survival. Floods meant nutrient-rich waters fed the fields and everyone could eat. Nile levels were so important to the Egyptian economy that the government based tax amounts on readings from ""Nilometers,"" stone wells fed by the river where they could measure its height in cubits. If the levels were trending too high (destructive flooding) or too low (drought), taxes were scaled back to account for people's diminished fortunes. Years with low rainfall inevitably meant people wanted for more and had less to lose. Gripes with the government became full-scale rebellions, like the 20-year ""Theban revolt"" that started in 207 BCE and the ""Egyptian revolt"" against Ptolemy III between 245-238 BCE. Both came after periods of increased volcanic activity. Though many other factors were in play, there is an undeniable correlation between eruptions and rebellion against the Ptolemaic regime. The volcanic house of cards Ludlow and his colleagues gathered data for their hypothesis from a range of sources. They consulted the historical record to figure out when rebellions and unrest took place in Egypt. In addition, they measured social unrest by looking at when the Ptolemaic government issued new edicts, such as the famous Rosetta Stone (erected during the Great Revolt of 206-186 BCE), affirming the king's power over a restless population. The researchers did this under the assumption that the king would only need to issue such edicts if he felt his regime was threatened. Having established a chronology of uprisings, the researchers went volcano hunting. Volcanoes large enough to affect the climate also leave behind a telltale debris signature of volcanic sulfates in the ice of Greenland and Antarctica. By drilling out cores of ice from these areas, scientists can reconstruct when an eruption took place in the geological record. But could they be certain that these eruptions affected Nile flooding? To answer this question, the researchers returned again to the historical record, observing that eruptions in the 20th century had reduced Nile floods. Another treasure trove of data came from careful records of flood levels measured by keepers of the Islamic Nilometer between 622–1902 CE. By analyzing this data, Ludlow and his colleagues were able to model how much a given eruption would affect the Nile's annual flood cycle. The researchers found a clear connection between volcanic aerosol levels in the atmosphere and weak Nile flooding. University of Hawaii classicist Robert Littman, who was not involved in the study, urged caution when looking at flood levels. He's studied Nilometers extensively and noted that fluctuations in the level of the Nile would have varied greatly from region to region. ""We have texts that say 16 cubits is the ideal level in Luxor. But in the north, in the delta, it's seven cubits."" So there's no guarantee that an eruption would have affected all areas in Egypt the same way. Littman added that we also can't discount political pressures, such as ongoing wars in Syria, as catalysts for revolt. Ludlow agreed with Littman that poor flood seasons were just one part cause for social unrest. He acknowledged the revolts were ""the result of many conditions that happened to coalesce at the right time—these include ethnic tensions, with some resentment bubbling away among the native Egyptian populace against the new Greek elites ruling Egypt after Alexander the Great's conquest, combined with... economic policies enacted by the Ptolemies, such as the decision to move to a great focus on free-threshing wheat—as opposed to other grains that were less vulnerable to drought—because this was the favorite bread grain in the Greek world and could be exported for greater profit."" But, he added, the low flood levels could be a tipping point. ""We frame the volcanic eruptions and the associated failures of the Nile summer floodwaters as triggers because their impact occurs suddenly without warning. There may be decades without a major volcanic eruption, but then one or more suddenly occurs,"" he explained via email. ""Another way of putting it is that you could consider ethic tensions and economic stress as a chronic contribution or cause, while the sudden and short-term shock from a volcanic eruption is an acute contribution of cause."" In other words, the already-troubled Egyptian polity was teetering on the brink. The abrupt reversal of fortunes caused by bad flood seasons pushed them over into armed rebellion. Climate and future social problems There are interesting exceptions. During the 40s and 30s BCE, Egypt suffered greatly from reduced flooding and its attendant perils like mass starvation, plague, and inflation. But Queen Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, managed to quell revolt. She did it, Ludlow said, by ""offering grain relief from state granaries and banning exports of grain."" Volcano-induced revolts were not inevitable. Good public policies could make up for environmental disasters. Ludlow and his colleagues say the climate history of the Nile offers a lesson to cities coping with disaster today. Yale environmental scientist and study co-author Jennifer Marlon noted that ""it is very rare in science and history to have such strong and detailed evidence documenting how societies responded to climatic shocks in the past."" UC Berkeley public policy professor Solomon Hsiang, who was not involved in the study, has spent most of his career showing correlations between natural disasters and long-term socio-economic problems. Over the past several years, he's worked with the Global Policy Lab to show that disasters caused by climate change, such as typhoons and wildfires, can lead to economic downturns from which nations may never recover. Still, speaking at a recent conference, Hsiang said these studies should make us hopeful. ""This is the first time in human history when we have the technology to look ahead at what might come down the road,"" he mused. ""In past societies, leaders relied on fortune tellers to make decisions. We have data and science and analytics that allow us to see what's coming more clearly. So we can make informed decisions.""

Jonathan Shieber,"As renewable energy continues to gobble up more and more of the new energy capacity coming online, the solar project lending company Wunder Capital has raised $112 million in primarily debt financing to boost its business. The 90% debt and 10% equity commitment came from the multi-strategy investment firm Cyrus Investments, which has backed renewable energy projects for years through its investment in RePower Group. “The debt component is going to blow out the lending opportunity,” says Wunder chief executive Bryan Birsic. Wunder chose to consolidate the debt and equity round with a single lead investor to simplify the negotiation process on both sides of the table, Birsic said. “ Since Cyrus is an equity holder in the company we can come to better terms,” on debt facilities and repayment, he said. Wunder lends money to commercial solar energy development projects throughout the U.S. and its business has been buoyed by a flood of demand for new solar energy projects coming online. Since its launch in 2016, the company has financed over 180 projects throughout the U.S. which are generating somewhere in the range of 50 megawatts (or enough electricity to power roughly 32,500 homes). The Boulder, Colo.-based company makes money in three ways. It charges closing fees, a servicing fee and annual interest rate on the debt it provides — typically Wunder will pull in between 4% and 5% off of each loan it provides to a project. And business… for renewable energy … is booming. For instance, the industry appears to have shaken off concerns over price increases stemming from the tariffs imposed on solar panels as part of broad punitive measures President Trump has taken against China (which supplies most of the world’s solar panels). “It was really pleasant to see that folks were less reactionary and more responsive to the data,” says Birsic. The headlines, Birsic explains, were worse than the reality for the industry. The headlines in January predicted a 30% tariff on solar panels, but banks thought those increases would ultimately result in a 3% price increase for residential solar installations and a 4% price increase for commercial solar.

"USA TODAY, Doyle Rice, USA TODAY","Scientists say the coral reef off Australia's Christmas Island appears to be dying. The scientists say that if the reef doesn't thrive, neither will local fish, which are a major food and income source for the island population. (April 14) AP Just 50 miles off Cuba’s shore lies the healthiest coral reef system in the Caribbean. Dubbed Jardines de la Reina (Gardens of the Queen) by Columbus in 1492, the vast reef system has thrived. (Photo: BBC Earth and Giant Screen Films) Coral reefs aren't just pretty to look at: They also act as a natural flood protection barrier from powerful ocean storms. But with reefs in danger around the world, much of this valuable flood protection could be lost. A study released Tuesday pinpoints the value of coral reefs, finding coastal flood-related damages around the world would be twice what they are now if not for this natural flood barrier. On average, the entire planet's coral reefs are worth some $4 billion annually in flood protection, said study lead author Michael Beck, a scientist at the Nature Conservancy and a professor at the University of California – Santa Cruz. Closer to home, he said ""the United States receives nearly $100 million annually in direct flood reduction benefits from its reefs. ""The U.S. ranks 8th globally in terms of annual reef benefits to people and property in places such as Florida, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam."" The countries with the most to gain from reef conservation and restoration are Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Mexico and Cuba. Per capita, the study found reefs provide the most benefits to small island states including the Cayman Islands, Belize, Grenada, Cuba, Bahamas, Jamaica and the Philippines. More: Coral reefs under siege: Frequency of bleaching has increased almost fivefold since the '80s More: Coral reefs at severe risk as world's oceans become more acidic More: Great Barrier Reef has survived 5 near-death events but scientists unsure of its future The devastating damage from recent tropical cyclones such as Hurricanes Irma and Maria and Typhoon Haiyan would have been much worse without coral reefs, the study found. Coral reefs are best at protecting coasts from the biggest waves during powerful storms. “Unfortunately, we are already losing the height and complexity of shallow reefs around the world, so we are likely already seeing increases in flood damages along many tropical coastlines,"" Beck said. “Our national economies are normally only valued by how much we take from nature. For the first time, we can now value what every national economy gains in flood savings by conserving its coral reefs every year.” Globally, coral reefs face many threats, including coastal development, sand and coral mining, destructive and excessive fishing, storms and climate-related bleaching events. Overall, the frequency of severe coral bleaching events has increased nearly fivefold in the past four decades, from once every 25 to 30 years in the early 1980s to once every six years in 2016, a study published earlier this year found. Tuesday's study adds to a growing body of research that calculates the monetary value of assets and services that nature provides us for free, Agence France-Presse reported. Mangrove forests, for example, also protect against storm surges and serve as nurseries for dozens of aquatic species. They are disappearing at the rate of 1 to 2% each year, scientists say. In addition, bee populations that pollinate tens of billions of dollars worth of crops each year are collapsing, AFP said. ""Coral reefs are living ecosystems that can recover if they are well-managed, and this study identifies why and where we should find the needed support for restoration and management,"" Beck said. ""It is our hope that this science will lead to action and greater stewardship of reefs around the world.” Tuesday's study appeared in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Communications.

JACK HEALY,"The case began after North Carolina elections officials ran an audit that found 441 felons had voted improperly in the 2016 election. While most local prosecutors did not pursue these cases, Mr. Nadolski decided to file felony charges. “We want to maintain the integrity of the voting system,” Mr. Nadolski said. Most of the voters did not know one another before the prosecution, but as they attended court together and as their story spread through this conservative county, people started referring to them as one: the Alamance 12. Activists have protested outside the county courthouse and asked supporters to flood the district attorney’s office with letters and phone calls on the defendants’ behalf.

Chris Jones,"On August 24 at 8:20 pm, a 44-year-old moonlighting meteorologist named Eric Berger was nearly finished writing a post for his Houston-centric blog, Space City Weather, titled “ Harvey Late Night: Some Final Thursday Thoughts.” He was in his home office. He had just poured himself a glass of cabernet. He had been looking at the online forecasts from the National Hurricane Center and agreed with their essential conclusions: Harvey was a well-­organized storm that would land with hurricane force on the Texas Gulf Coast somewhere between Corpus Christi and Port O’Connor. Berger also backed the center’s belief that the winds would be strong in Houston that weekend, perhaps more than 40 miles per hour. But he was far more worried about the rain. The unanswered question is what happens to Harvey once it reaches the coast, Berger wrote. Where will it go, and will it go fast enough? Houston’s rainfall totals over the next five days depend on this, and we just don’t know. The considerable majority of modern weather forecasting is aided by computer algorithm. Most hurricane tracking relies on data crunched by various public and private computer models, and the models, which take different variables (temperature, moisture, mass) and consider them in different ways, are not always in agreement. The National Hurricane Center takes input from several models to make its predictions, averaging out their differences, in part because it faces the tallest order in hurricane forecasting: It must say that the hurricane will go here. So must television meteorologists, one of the center’s principal conduits to a concerned public. TV, too, demands a singular answer. Berger doesn’t have to draw a line. He is a certified meteorologist, but the weather is just a particularly absorbing hobby of his; his primary paying gig is writing about aerospace for Ars Technica (a site owned by WIRED Media Group), and he blogs about the weather in his free time. That gives him two luxuries that most front-line meteorologists don’t have: He can value certain models and their ensembles much more heavily than others, untangling as many as 50 different versions of each forecast, and he can also admit doubt. He can explore the subtlety of the weather, marveling at its mysteries, the way he has for his small but loyal community of readers for years, but especially since he established his site in October 2015. Berger does not generate his forecasts from scratch, pointing his licked finger into the wind and taking readings from the Galileo thermometer on his windowsill. He really does have a Galileo thermometer on his windowsill, but he works out of a home office that he hasn’t otherwise bothered to decorate, with a basic PC and a single monitor on which he toggles between tabs, from forecast to conflicting forecast. In Houston that evening, the US government forecast called for about 15 inches of rain. By then Berger had already begun to wonder. There is one model he has come to trust and rely on more than any other: the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’ Integrated Forecasting System, more popularly known in the US as the European model. Funded by 22 EU members and 12 cooperating states, the European model is sometimes shockingly accurate, in part because it’s so well financed and its computing power is stronger than most. With Harvey, it suggested that the storm would stall over Houston, dumping 25 inches of rain or more before eventually moving on. That synced with Berger’s own analysis of the weather patterns in the atmosphere. He detected a troublesome absence of steering currents, the forces that push hurricanes to wherever they’re headed next, and without those currents, the European model’s forecast of a stall made a lot of sense. Given the sum of the evidence before him, Berger felt confident in one fearsome prediction, and he wrote as much: Big-time floods are coming to Texas. It was, at its essence, an informed gut call, and Berger thought carefully about what he would write next. He had made his reputation, such as it was for a leisure-­time meteorologist with a city-specific weather blog, by refusing to submit to the hysterical frenzies that competent weather observers dismiss as “storm porn.” He is by nature a fairly skeptical person. His twin passions, space and the weather, share long histories of broken promises and unmet expectations. His site’s motto is “Hype-free forecasts for greater Houston,” mindful of the chaotic and ultimately unnecessary evacuations prompted by Hurricane Rita in 2005. I am not going to sugar-coat this, my friends, he had written in advance of that storm. As a Houston resident and property owner, I am truly mortified right now. Rita and Berger had both missed. But underplaying weather of dire consequences could lead to a different kind of calamity for his readers. James Spann, Alabama’s longtime weather forecaster of choice, had infamously botched that state’s ice storms of January 2014. Spann had predicted a “dusting” of snow, and unworried commuters headed out on the roads; when that dusting turned out to be a thick layer of ice, Spann shouldered much of the blame for the thousands of people who ended up stranded in their cars, schools, and workplaces overnight. Berger despises alarmism in all its forms. He also didn’t want to bear responsibility for children drowning in their attics. Berger’s wife, Amanda, was getting their own two daughters ready for bed in their League City apartment, temporary accommodations while the family builds their dream home in nearby Clear Creek. His dog, Bonnie, a Maltese-­poodle cross who dislikes all men but him, kept her usual vigilant watch. Berger can be painfully shy. Now he felt possessed by an unusual authority, exercised remotely through the digitally transmitted written word. He took another sip of his wine and returned to his keyboard. Certainly the Corpus Christi area and points immediately north and west of there will get too much rain, he wrote. Flooding will spread to other parts of Texas too, quite possibly Houston. But right now we can’t say that for certain. As I’ve said, it’s either going to be pretty bad, or really really bad here. He posted his piece. His site normally averaged somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 views a day. That particular entry received 207,334 over the next 24 hours. A shocked Berger surmised that his core readers were recommending him to their suddenly weather-concerned friends. He had become the center of a kind of storm within the storm. In the comments, one reader asked what Berger thought the rainfall totals might be in San Antonio, 200 miles to the west. Someone else asked about Colorado County, and another about the neighborhoods near Ellington Field. Another reader wondered whether her husband’s flight out of Hobby Airport on Saturday morning might be delayed. A man named Petey James pointed out that Saturday night was the night of the big fight between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor, and he wanted to know whether he should risk going to the local bar or pay to watch it at home. A woman named Deb Walters asked whether she should still have the party she had planned to host near Dacus on Saturday afternoon. I’d press ahead at this point, Berger wrote to her. Obviously if things turn ugly Saturday morning, you’ll have to cancel. The following morning, Friday, August 25, it started to rain, a few drops at first, and then a fairly steady shower. Harvey’s leading edge had come to town, and the models, constantly updated, began to align: Harvey was nearly laser-precise in its construction and massive, and it was also a slow mover. The rain was going to be measured in feet, not inches. Berger sat down at his desk, no wine this time, and wrote another post. “ A very serious flooding situation is coming, ” he wrote. He wrote it two more times for emphasis. “ A very serious flooding situation is coming. A very serious flooding situation is coming. ” It was 3:15 pm. He hoped Deb Walters had canceled her party. Millions turned to Berger’s Space City Weather blog during the storm. Since 1980, there have been more than 200 weather and climate events in the United States that have each caused more than $1 billion in damage. Three principal national bodies are charged with predicting their arrivals and effects. The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, keeps watch for tornadoes. The Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, monitors heavy rains. And the National Hurricane Center in Miami minds hurricanes. They have been busy. In the case of Harvey, all three were involved, funneling their best information to the Houston branch of the National Weather Service, one of its 122 field offices across the country. Each helps turn national forecasts into finely tuned local ones. The Houston office is the only one that shares space with its home county’s Office of Emergency Management—Galveston County in its case—better to coordinate their shared response. It is no accident that their building sits atop a mound and that their offices are on the upper floor. Over the past few decades, greater Houston has grown exponentially from a mosquito-­plagued oil port into the fifth-largest metro area in the United States, home to nearly 7 million people. That population explosion, combined with a certain regional antipathy toward civic oversight, has seen former swamps turned into sprawling, unregulated developments. Houston has been built to flood. Dan Reilly, 52, is the local Warning Coordination Meteorologist, part of the National Weather Service’s round-the-clock professional staff. In a catastrophe-prone city like his, the job is twofold. The first is the forecast. “When something bad is coming, that’s really when we need to be at the top of our game,” he says. Of the three most damaging effects of hurricanes—wind, storm surge, and rain—rain is one of the most difficult to quantify in advance. The heaviest rain typically falls in small pockets, and that level of precision is difficult to attain more than six to 12 hours ahead of its arrival. Houston’s physical size also makes rain forecasts challenging: Each side of the I-10, for instance—one of several highways that serve as boundaries in an otherwise endless city—might receive a substantially different amount. A good meteorologist is almost always, by definition, skilled at pattern recognition. Weather, like the law, is built on a foundation of similar cases. Veteran meteorologists—Reilly has been in the job for 24 years—mine their memories for analogues. In the early hours of Harvey, Reilly’s team began upping the National Weather Service’s rain forecast to amounts that no one had ever seen: 25 inches, 30, and eventually 50, over a widespread swath of Houston. Reilly set aside everything he knew about the weather and decided to obey the combination of awe and dread he felt in his chest: A killing flood was on its way. Somehow the warnings sounded different coming from him. The next part of the job, and perhaps the more important one, is getting the word out. At a time when the weather can be more extreme than ever, and trust in government is low, convincing people to heed your warnings, especially the most severe of them, might now be the weather forecaster’s harder task. The most serious warning when it comes to rain is called a Flash Flood Emergency, and before Harvey, the Houston office had issued that warning on only three occasions. It would soon be used for a fourth. Berger, sitting behind his Spartan desk that afternoon, anxiety beginning to weigh on him like heat, was first among those who might listen—and to whom others might listen about the coming storm. He wasn’t the government; he was a human being, and somehow the warnings sounded different to their ears coming from him, the kind of measured voice that shines through in a crisis. After he had written his ominous flood forecast three times, he looked out his office window at one of the two garages he keeps. One of them was bursting with new things for his new house, and he began ferrying boxes upstairs to his office, filling the space in front of his desk with new light fixtures, a microwave, and a tub. In between trips, he heard Amanda making arrangements to take shelter, with their daughters, at her sister’s house, built on pilings and tucked away from the wind. Berger would stay. He would hunker down behind his wall of boxes with his PC and his readers, now numbering in the hundreds of thousands, for the duration of the storm. He knew that his city was in serious trouble, and he felt an almost spiritual need to convince his neighbors that it was time for them to share his fears. The weather started making an impression on Berger in 2001, when Tropical Storm Allison came to town. Berger is from Michigan but had gone to the University of Texas to earn his astronomy degree. He moved to Houston for a girl, first working weekends at the Houston Chronicle before becoming the paper’s designated “SciGuy,” writing mostly about physics, chemistry, and astronomy. He also wrote a little about the weather. He had just bought his first house near White Oak Bayou. On June 8, a Friday night—what was it about storms and Friday nights?—he went out with some friends to see a Bob Schneider concert. Allison had passed through Houston once already, but now it returned to take a second run at the city. Berger remembers that the sound of the rain on the roof drowned out Schneider, as though there was too much percussion in the mix. After the concert, he and his friends left to wander around midtown, gawking at the water rising on the empty streets. Berger wrote about the storm. One of his stories, about the drowning deaths of tens of thousands of research animals in the basement of the Texas Medical Center, drew massive national readership. He began having visions—he saw a place for thoughtful written analysis of the weather online. His discussions could be more timely and interactive than the forecasts printed in the paper itself. And unlike TV meteorologists, he needn’t worry about ratings or being available to viewers only at certain designated times. In June 2005, he started his own blog on the Chronicle ’s site. He didn’t yet have any meteorological training; he was just someone who liked talking about the weather. (His colleagues called him “Weather Boy.” It was not a compliment.) Three months later came Katrina. Then came Rita. And three years later, Hurricane Ike. Berger’s life could seem governed by storms; even his first meeting with Amanda, whom he married in 2002, came only a few weeks after Allison’s transformative rains. He convinced the newspaper to put him through a distance learning program at Mississippi State to earn his certification as a professional meteorologist. Modern technology and information dissemination have led to a democratization of weather forecasting, and that could mean compounding disaster in the wrong hands. Berger wanted to make sure his hands were the right ones. When he left the Chronicle to join Ars Technica in October of 2015, he started Space City Weather. The day after he opened up shop, the remnants of Hurricane Patricia began clouding the skies of Houston. He was supposed to go out for dinner with Amanda. He worried his readers would feel he’d abandoned them in a time of need, and he couldn’t help writing a post. His first forecast on Space City Weather was for a flood. Now in August 2017, the rains on Harvey’s opening night shocked even him. They were biblical. Rain falling at a rate of 2 inches an hour would force most drivers to pull over. Harvey would sometimes drop 5. It didn’t look like water; it looked like milk. Worse, Berger studied the models and the satellite imagery, and if he knew anything in that moment, listening to the rain against his window, he knew that there was so much more to come. On Saturday, August 26, an hour after sunset, the evening’s first band of precipitation, which on radar resembled the longest tentacles of an angry squid, opened up over Houston, slowly crossing the city from west to east. As predicted by the European model, it stalled. Additional bands trailing behind it intensified and merged with the first. This created what meteorologists properly call a seething nexus of hate, Berger later wrote. The now-combined band extended more than 400 miles over Galveston and deep into the too-warm waters of the Gulf, creating a superhighway for rain to be delivered directly to Houston. By very early Sunday morning, Harvey’s enormous size began to tell, and another band prepared to make its assault on the already flooded southern suburbs. The Houston branch of the NWS had issued its special emergency bulletin, and in the adjacent Office of Emergency Management, the walls were being papered with calls for water rescues. People were drowning in the rain. A sleepless Berger sat down at his desk and began writing a new post. Amanda and their daughters had been at her sister’s house for several hours, and she texted him to ask if he thought the latest band would be the end of it. He inserted the scene into his piece, which went up at 2:10 am on Sunday morning. I wanted nothing more than to fall in her arms and tell her yes, this was it. By God, yes. Let’s go to bed and forget this ever happened. It had to be it, surely. It would not be it. Harvey would make true Berger’s most pessimistic projections and refuse to leave. He would tell his readers that the rain would continue, especially at night. He would later hear that administrators at the Houston Methodist Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine were among those looking to him for guidance. He would harbor a guilt for delivering bad news for so many. At 12:03 pm on Sunday, Berger finished writing a post that he titled: “Houston, We Will Get Through This.” With the prospect of more rain, you may feel hopeless or helpless, or both. From a mental health standpoint, the uncertainty this brings adds a considerable amount of stress to an already stressful situation. I wish we could tell you when the rains will end, but we can’t. Here’s one thing we are sure of, however. The rains will end. After that the sun will come out. More than a million people would visit Space City Weather on Sunday alone. Hurricane Harvey already had a name. Now it had its face. Harvey’s unrelenting rain left so much underwater—like these orchards in Pecan Grove. On Tuesday evening, more than four days after the rain first started to fall, Berger would finally write: It’s over. He had been nearly perfect in his forecast. It hadn’t been all that windy, so there weren’t many roofs blown off or trees toppled, except in those few cursed places that were also visited by tornadoes. And there wasn’t much local storm surge. The water didn’t come rushing through Houston. It didn’t arrive in walls the way it did in New Orleans with Katrina, one of the reasons Harvey directly killed 68 people, many in their cars, instead of an estimated 1,833 people, many in their beds. Harvey was a cataclysmic rain event, just as Berger had feared. He could have been wrong and his readers would have moved their furniture back downstairs and grumbled about the wasted effort. But he had been right, and thousands of his readers didn’t have a downstairs anymore. A month after the storm, Berger dropped into his Hyundai hybrid and went for a drive. He wanted to see the terrible reality that had accompanied his forecasts, as though he could use the reminder that Harvey really did do what it did, to Houston and to him. By then the last part of weather analysis, the accounting of the aftermath, was nearly complete. It had rained so hard for so long that Houston’s swamps and reservoirs and drainage canals filled up, which meant that the city’s kitchens and living rooms and dens filled up next. Then the water drained away. In the time in between it made an estimated $75 billion in property irreparably wet. He headed south toward Dickinson, one of the worst-hit areas. On some streets, every house had an enormous pile of debris out front—everything that had been inside the house was now outside of it, rotting in the sun. Other streets had been picked clean, and they looked almost normal, except that through their windows, Berger could see that the otherwise pristine-­seeming houses had been stripped down to the studs. There was a photograph that had made the rounds during the storm. It was of the flood-soaked residents of a nursing home, sitting on their loungers and walkers, water up to their chests. It seemed like a macabre piece of surrealist art. On his tour, Berger decided to visit that nursing home, La Vita Bella. Nearly everything that wasn’t human in that photograph was now sitting out in the yard. The lamps, the chairs, and the popcorn machine from that haunting image melted in the piles of sodden sheetrock and carpet, relics of a viral infamy. They were joined by smaller but perhaps more significant losses: a stuffed animal, a deck of playing cards, a broken mirror, a lipstick and a rouge, a large-print copy of Marley &amp; Me. At 12:03 pm on Sunday, Berger finished writing a post titled: ""Houston, We Will Get Through This."" Berger had also lost a book in the flood. Before dawn on Sunday, lightning had lit up the sky, and he could see that water had reached his garages. He had mostly emptied one but not the other—not the one that contained his old things, his diplomas and his Appetite for Destruction poster and his boxes of books. He raced down and lifted up a box from the floor and its bottom fell out. A book titled From Dawn to Decadence by Jacques Barzun dropped into the water and disappeared. Berger had treasured that book, a massive 500-year history of Western civilization. Its French-born author had died in Texas in 2012. Barzun was 104 years old, and the book had been his life’s work. Something about losing that particular book hit Berger harder than it might have. It was a metaphor for how easily even our monuments can be erased. He had written about the loss of that book and other things in a post that went up on Ars Technica early in the morning on August 30, the Wednesday after the storm. The post was titled “This Is Probably the Worst US Flood Storm Ever, and I’ll Never Be the Same.” The cardboard box had failed, he wrote, and the book had dropped into the murk. Almost immediately, a current from the rushing water beyond the garage door pulled the tome away, forever. Damn, I loved that book. An indescribably bad night had just gotten that little bit worse. Berger started receiving emails and notes from his grateful readers. They had saved some of their own treasures because of his warnings, and they felt they had a debt to settle. A copy of From Dawn to Decadence was eventually put into his hands by a stranger, a woman who had attended a talk he had overcome his nerves to give after the storm. That book now sits high and dry on a shelf in his office, a tiny reminder of the things that Harvey had taken, but also a reminder of the things it had delivered. The National Weather Service is part of a necessary and effective meteorological bureaucracy. It is staffed by thousands of people—by good and competent forecasters who care deeply about the weather and its effects on their communities. The NWS can offer its best daily guess, informed by their forecasters’ computer models and professional experiences. It can give warnings and sound alarms. But the NWS can’t talk about the weather the way human beings talk about the weather. It can’t explore each of its uncertainties, almost reveling in the sweeping possibilities of hurricanes and their animal behaviors. It can’t riff. More important, when the weather is at its worst: The National Weather Service can’t comfort. Even though Dan Reilly and his colleagues live and work in greater Houston, even though they were plenty concerned during Harvey for their own families and homes, they can’t issue a bulletin that says, We’re sick and tired of the rain, just like everyone else. They can’t write: The rains will end. After that the sun will come out. Only someone like Eric Berger can do that, providing a weather forecast that includes words like hope or sorry or maybe. Only someone like Eric Berger can employ our best technology in a way that still feels intimate and human-scale, applying the wisdom of satellites to Deb Walters and her doomed party. Only someone like Eric Berger, looking out his window at the rain and willing for it to stop even though he knows that it won’t be stopping anytime soon, can speak to a family watching the water on its torturous rise to their door, the winds threatening the entirety of their lives, and make them feel a little less alone in the storm. Update: After this article went to press, we heard from Deb Walters, one of the many people who sought Berger’s advice just before Hurricane Harvey. Thanks to Berger’s forecasts, Walters decided to cancel a house party she hosts every year for some members of Alcoholics Anonymous and ex-cons. It turned out to be a good call. Although Walters’ house was spared, the surrounding streets flooded, which would have stranded the guests there for three days. “These folks are hysterical,” she said (as in funny and lovable), “but the type of people you invite to a party aren’t necessarily the type of people you want to spend three days with.” She finally hosted the shindig three weeks later, for a smaller crowd. —The Editors Chris Jones is a longtime magazine writer.

 The status of National Parks will be up in the air. Park staff would be furloughed, although the parks themselves would remain accessible. However, some parks, including the Grand Canyon, are planning to stay open.
 Visa and passport services will continue as long as there are sufficient fees to support operations, a department spokesman said, but passport agencies located in government buildings affected by a lapse in appropriations may become unavailable to the public.

Megan Rose Dickey,"Zagster, the bike-share company behind the Pace brand, is launching what it’s calling Pace Parking. The idea is for it so serve as a parking platform for bikes, electric bikes and electric scooters. Pace is first launching these in Chicago, Austin and Bloomington, Ind., with the plan to launch in additional cities this year. This parking platform is designed to support dockless lock-to vehicles, like JUMP bikes and Skip scooters. In partnership with cities, private landowners and local businesses, the idea is to make sure communities have proper parking infrastructure. “With the meteoric rise of dockless bikes, ebikes and scooters in the U.S., our cities are now in the early stages of a massive transformation in how people get around — one as significant as the personal automobile in 20th century,” Zagster CEO Tim Ericson said in a statement. “Imagine a city with tens of thousands of cars and nowhere to park them — this is the huge challenge faced by every major U.S. city right now. Without mobility parking infrastructure, cities have no solution to secure the flood of new vehicles descending upon their streets and sidewalks, and we are the first company to do something about it. As the pioneer of lock-to dockless bike sharing, we’re proud to deliver the first ever universal, secure, smart parking platform for parking not just Pace bikes, but other shared bikes, personal bikes, electric scooters, and future mobility vehicles.” Earlier this year, Zagster raised a $15 million round led by Edison Capital Partners. The startup has also unveiled its new bike parking system for both shared and personal bikes. “Bikes have always locked to things,” Zagster CEO Tim Ericson said in a press release. “Cities have been willing to experiment with dockless bikes that don’t lock to anything because they lack sufficient bike parking and, until Pace, lacked a partner willing to install this infrastructure at no cost.” Zagster’s Pace is one of the newer entrants to the bike-share space, which consists of a number of startups and larger companies battling for contracts with cities all over the world. Pace, which launched in December, currently operates in Tallahassee, Florida and Knoxville, Tennessee. With the funding, Zagster plans to launch Pace in additional cities this year. Zagster also operates a bike-share solution for municipalities looking to offer their own city-specific services. Zagster, which launched in 2007, operates more than 200 bike-shares across 35 states in the U.S. This move to support multi-modal transportation options likely signals the entrance of yet another electric scooter service.","Zagster, the bike-share company behind the Pace brand, is launching what it’s calling Pace Parking.

John Biggs,"Leave your smartwatch on the counter because Timex is back with its first automatic watch in decades. Called the Marlin, this 21-jewel timepiece that hearkens back to the days of “Takes a licking, keeps on ticking.” The Marlins cost $249 and come in multiple styles. This particular model, in a rich burgundy, looks like something that you’d wear to a Madison Avenue cocktail party after work. Timex has also released manual wind watches for $199 featuring a truly retro design and numerals. Timex has long been a drug store brand – a brand sold in those cases at big drug stores and aimed at impulse shoppers who needed a watch… any kind of watch. While their Indiglo line of bright, light-up quartz watches was a long-time hit, they really didn’t do much beyond making a few very basic pieces for a non-discerning audience. Now, however, the company clearly looked at its history and liked what it saw. Timex was one of the first American watch brands to expand on a mass scale and they suffered greatly during the 1980 quartz crisis, a moment when the watch industry went from mechanical movements to electronic. Many watchmakers never recovered or are now a husk of their former glory – Hamilton, for example – but Timex kept at it. Now that they’ve given automatics and manual winds a try I’m excited to see where they go next. Many watchmakers have noticed that men and women are buying more and more retro watches to offset the creeping smartwatch flood. I’m glad to see the team at Timex is ready to take on this fascinating new world.","Leave your smartwatch on the counter because Timex is back with its first automatic watch in decades.

https://www.facebook.com/michael.miller.1466,"Crews were engaged in multiple water rescues and buildings collapsed in historic Ellicott City on Sunday evening as flood waters raged through its streets following torrential thunderstorms, Howard County officials said. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced at 6:40 p.m. he had declared a state of emergency in Howard County and was planning on making his way to Ellicott City to assess the damage. The Howard County fire department warned people trapped on the city’s Main Street to climb to the second floors of buildings as they awaited rescue and said the damage could rival devastating floods that occurred there in 2016. No injuries were immediately reported. “This is an EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC situation and you must move to HIGHER GROUND IMMEDIATELY AND STAY AWAY FROM ANYWHERE WHERE WATER IS MOVING,” the National Weather Service warned in a 5:30 p.m. tweet. Howard County public information officer Mark Miller said a torrent of water was rushing through the streets. Miller said the flooding “appears to be of equal magnitude as the 2016 floods.” “The town is flooding,” Miller said. “All of our first responders are responding.” The Howard County fire department warned people to stay away and said hundreds of rescuers were converging on Ellicott City from as far away as Northern Virginia. Howard County officials announced they were opening an emergency operations center to manage its response. Videos taken on Ellicott City’s Main Street show boiling brown waters flowing down the street, carrying debris and trash. The waters spilled into doors and windows and twisted traffic lights. Abigail Conte, 19, was at the Bean Hollow coffee shop in the historic section of the city when the rains began this afternoon. She said the staff announced they were closing around 3:45 because of a flood warning. She left the shop and began to make her way to her car about a half-mile away. “As I was walking outside, the street was becoming a river,” Conte said. She came to an intersection where it became too dangerous to continue. She eventually sought shelter at Cottage Antiques. As of about 6:30 p.m., she said she was trapped on the second floor of the building and had moved into a backroom because she was afraid a telephone pole might collapse on the shop. She said the owners of the antique shop said the basement of the building had flooded. She said she saw a garbage can and other detritus flowing down Main Street, but nothing larger. “It’s just flooded,” said a woman who answered the phone at A Journey from Junk. “I’m trying to work through my own panic attack.” Before declaring a state of emergency, Hogan activated the state’s emergency response, which sends extra rescue personnel to the scene from various state agencies, said his spokesperson Amelia Chasse. Several nearby counties — including Carroll, Frederick and Washington — sent swift water teams, she said. “The Governor sends his thoughts and deepest sympathies to those impacted, including residents and businesses in Ellicott City,” Chasse said. “He is warning people to be safe. Don’t come out to look at the flooding. There’s still danger out there.” The Capital Weather Gang reported radar indicated 3 to 6 inches of rain has fallen in just two hours in the Ellicott City area and it continues to rain heavily. Just to the south of Ellicott City, radar indicated as much as 7 to 8 inches had fallen. Jeff Halveson, professor of meteorology at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County and a contributor to the Capital Weather Gang, said the storm pattern had essentially stalled over Ellicott City, the same phenomenon that caused massive flooding in the City of Frederick two weeks ago. He said the storm could drop 10 to 12 inches of rain total, before it finally ends between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. He said he thought the flooding could ultimately be worse than what was seen in Ellicott City in 2016. “To say lightning strikes twice is basically what’s happening,” Halveson said. “To have this happen weeks apart and 30 miles apart is extraordinary. Ellicott City sustained severe damage in a July 30, 2016, flash flood that killed two people. During that flooding, houses along Main Street shook as residents filmed the devastation out their windows. Some formed human chains to rescue those stranded in their cars as the rising waters roared through the historic downtown. Emergency workers climbed onto roofs and chopped holes into stores to save those trapped inside. In the 2016 flooding, Joe Blevins, a father of three, was swept away as he climbed with his wife from their flooding car. His body was spotted by a hiker the next morning on the shore of the Patapsco River. The body of another tourist, Jessica Watsula, was found under the Ilchester Bridge.

David Murphy,"All I ever seem to see on the “New and Trending” list in Valve’s Steam service are games I know I’ll never play. And then there are those weird sexy games. In fact, as I write this article, the game “Tropical Liquor” sits near the top of my feed—another classic title that rewards you with anime characters that strip whenever you successfully complete a mini-game. (And don’t even get me started about Super Seducer, also appearing on the list today, or the flood of broken-as-hell Early Access games I regularly see.) Thankfully, there’s a way to heavily filter the games you see on Steam, but it’s somewhat buried within Steam’s clunky user interface. Here’s how you do it. Find the right settings menu To personalize Steam’s store, you’ll need to first find the correct Settings menu. Don’t look under Steam’s Settings menu (Steam &gt; Settings), nor your Profile preferences, nor even the “Your Store” link on Steam’s primary Store page. Instead, you’ll want to click on your account name in the upper-right corner of Steam’s UI and click on “Preferences.” (Note to Valve: It would be great to be able to access all of Steam’s options from a single, easy-to-find “Settings” menu, which could include feed customization. Just saying.) Remove game types you don’t care about Nothing against Early Access games—titles that might be beta-testing or in active development—but there are a lot of them and they can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming to view in Steam’s Store. And it’s perfectly fine to be the kind of person who prefers to know about games when they’re finished, not when they’re being worked on. Within Steam’s Store Content Preferences, you can select whether you want to see a variety of titles in Steam’s store: Early Access games, preorders, software, videos, movies, and VR content. If you aren’t interested in different categories—maybe you Netflix all movies instead of buying them, for example—just uncheck each category to remove its associated content from Steam. You can also elect to hide titles that are excessively gory or sexy, if one of those isn’t your cup of tea. Filter out games by keywords The “Tags to Filter Out” section in Steam’s Store Content Preferences is one of its more useful features. If there are certain types of games you have absolutely no interest in—like “anime” games or “free to play” games—just type in the tag. You only get three tags to filter (sigh), so make them good. Bonus: Even more content filters As you’ve probably noticed, the Store Content Preferences menu has a few other tricks up its sleeve. If you use Steam’s Discovery Queue or New Release Queue to find games that might interest you, you can adjust the content that appears in each. Filter titles you want to see by category—early access games, software, videos, and unreleased games—or filter out particular tags you don’t care about. You can also remove games by platform if you don’t think you’ll ever play titles on a Mac you don’t own or a Linux box you have no intention of ever setting up.",All I ever seem to see on the “New and Trending” list in Valve’s Steam service are games I know I’ll never play.

MIHIR ZAVERI,"Tropical Storm Lane drenched parts of Hawaii with about four feet of rain as it crept past the state on Saturday, causing flash floods and prompting evacuations even as it dissipated over the islands’ rugged slopes. The storm had weakened over several days from a Category 5 storm, with maximum winds now reaching up to 60 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service. But its plodding pace — just 3 m.p.h. — prolonged the rains. Some 46 inches fell on the eastern side of the Island of Hawaii, where landslides shut down roads and search-and-rescue efforts were underway. Flash flood warnings were still in effect on Saturday morning. Kelly Wooten, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii County Civil Defense, which has been coordinating the emergency response in hard-hit areas on Hawaii Island, said the agency had not yet been able to assess the damage from the storm. She said police, fire and other departments were working to keep people off the roads, as some areas were still under water. Ms. Wooten said no injuries or deaths had been reported so far. The county would be clearing debris and opening closed roads over the next few days, she added, as it recovered from a series of landslides.","Although Lane was downgraded to a tropical storm and its winds are forecast to weaken, rainfall totals are increasing, and the authorities warn of dangerous flash flooding.",2018-08-25T18:45:23Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Hurricane Lane, Now a Tropical Storm, Batters Hawaii With Heavy Rain",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/25/us/hawaii-hurricane-lane-tropical-storm.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/26/us/26hawaii/26hawaii-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,flood,1
Ellen Airhart,"The red imported fire ant is one of the worlds most invasive species. Its sting delivers a burning poison that kills living tissue. Together groups of ants devour deer fawns, baby birds, reptiles, and almost any other source of protein they can get their mandibles on. They form acres of crisscrossing tunnels with thousands of cooperative workers. And their territory has steadily been spreading.
The fire ants story is in some ways the opposite of what the insect world as a whole is experiencing. Measuring bug populations is an imperfect sciencetheyre small, mobile, and hidden. But they are undoubtedly shrinking, due to habitat destruction, climate change, and other human-driven trends. A German study found a 75 percent decline in insect biomass between 1989 and 2017. Another German study found that the butterfly population decreased from 117 species in 1840 to 71 species in 2013. And a 2014 Science review found that of the invertebrate species that are actively being monitored, the majority have decreased by almost half.
But for the fire ant, this mass die-off is a blessing. They are experts at filling in the ecological gaps where other organisms have disappeared. That can mean colonizing areas where other insects have slowly died away, or blossoming in the aftermath of a big disaster, like a flood, or expanding their turf after a smaller upset, like a lot of typical human landscaping. Humans are a fire ants best friend, says Walter Tschinkel, a biology professor at Florida State University and author of The Fire Ants. In the south, if you have a lawn, you have created a lovely habitat for fire ants.
Fans of warm temperatures, the ants build their homes around sprinklers and irrigation channels that allow them to set up outposts in dry climates. With human-driven climate change not only heating up the world but exacerbating hurricanes and wildfires, fire ants are primed to reap their rewards. They are steadily expanding their territory northward and, in the US, westward.
Fire ants are a symptom of a global problem, says Craig Allen, leader of the US Geological Survey in Nebraska. He refers to it as biotic homogenization. Its a term for what happens when an invasive species outperforms locals and takes over their resources. In the long run, the outcome is less genetic diversity, and fewer evolutionary strategies for species to succeed. Which leads, over time, to weaker ecosystems and more extinctions.
The red imported fire ant evolved on the floodplains of central South America, but people have hauled the ants all over the world on wooden shipping pallets. Once they arrived in the USin Alabama, sometime in the 1930s or early 40sthey developed another superpower. Prior to their spread in the US, they were known to organize in colonies with a single queen. If another mound arose in their vicinity, they attacked these rival ants. As a result, colonies were spaced relatively far apart, with about 40 mounds per acre. But sometime around 1973, something shifted.
A group of USDA scientists came across an area near Gulfport, Mississippi with an unusual number of fire ant mounds in close vicinity, with many more fertile queens than the usual single mama ant. Over time, scientists began to realized the significance of these findings, that the red imported fire ant was fundamentally different from other ants. Though some ant species have multiple queens per colony and others have just one, no other species uses both reproductive strategies. Fire ant colonies with multiple queens are denser400 to 500 mounds an acre, instead of 40and take more of a toll on the species around them. Theyre also much harder to kill with an insecticide, since the poison has to lop off the heads of several queens instead of just one.
Fire ants are perhaps most notorious for forming floating balls of horror that can coast through hurricanes. After Hurricane Harvey, the ants formed rafts of workers that link together using hooks on their limbs. If flood victims accidentally run into these mobile colonies, the ants attack, turning a dangerous situation into a potentially deadly one. One person wrote on Twitter that he Had a golf ball size group wash up on my foot during flooding near Austin.
An estimated 14 million people are stung every year, with some of those incidents leading to hospitalizations. About half of people are at least somewhat allergic to fire ant stings, and roughly one percent of people are at risk of having a dangerous full-body reaction. The cost of a world where Solenopsis invicta thrives doesnt end with the medical bills. They cause at least $6.7 billion in annual damages to not only people but houses, electrical and telephone lines, and agriculture.
That figure only captures the costs we can easily estimate. The ants are also adept at taking down baby birds and reptiles, including quail, alligators, lizards, and turtlesin particular, the threatened gopher tortoise, which digs burrows that more than 360 other species use for shelter. Once one of these baby animals pokes a hole in its shell to begin hatching, the ants can swarm inside their shells.
As this ant continues its plunder, the outlook for these other species (and our own ability to walk fearlessly across a lawn) is bleak. But some species seem to be defying the odds and evolving fire-ant resistance. The fence lizard, common in the Eastern US, is known to freeze in response to a threat. Thats terrible if your enemy is the fire ant, which can swarm, bite, and ultimately kill such a target. In areas where fire ants thrive, however, fence lizards appeared to have learned to bolt instead, according to a recent study in the journal Global Change Biology.
Yet fire ants continue to conquer new territory, confounding scientists estimates of their likely spread time and again. If you look back over time, it's a lesson in humility, says Allen. With warming temperatures, nothings stopping the red imported fire ant any time soon.
