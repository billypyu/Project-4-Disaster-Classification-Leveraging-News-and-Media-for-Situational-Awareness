MERRILL MARKOE,"Of course, I did better this time than I did with the last fire, when I wound up sleeping on a friends couch for five days wrapped in the leashes of four large dogs. There, I made the unhappy discovery that Id packed no bras or underwear, yet had somehow brought along the program from my sixth grade dance recital. That is why I recommend that you maintain, year round, a carefully packed box containing important papers, such as your birth certificate, passport, insurance policies, selected sentimental photos that are too glued into bulky photo albums to be digitized. And by the way, why did you glue them down like that? What is wrong with you? But now is not the time for recriminations. While youre in preparation mode, dont forget to include a list of all your internet passwords, even though it will turn out to be a futile gesture because every single site you sign onto during your emergency will tell you that your username or password is incorrect. So forget I even mentioned that one. Having accomplished that, breathe a sigh of relief, despite the fact that when you get to your place of safety, you will discover that repeated emergency raids to this prepacked box of important papers over the years have removed all things of importance and left in their place some old mail and a note full of incomprehensible jokes someone passed to you during a history test in the eighth grade. Why you took these things on an emergency evacuation will remain a mystery that will puzzle the ages. Some frequently asked questions about packing for an evacuation: Realize that all the items of clothing you pack will quickly blend together into one big mix-and-match outfit. Youll discover that the only T-shirt you packed says Im FUN! in 8-inch letters. (It was turned inside out in the drawer when you grabbed what you thought was a plain white shirt.) Just accept the fact that youll be seen in public wearing it with a pair of plaid pajama bottoms, a straw hat and a shawl made out of a duvet cover. No. When I packed a lot of makeup this time, I forgot that an older woman dressed in a T-shirt that screams Im fun, only looks weirder if she also has a face full of makeup. You will have two choices: 1) Dorothea Langes Dust Bowl studies 2) The entire canon of Diane Arbus. The best you can hope for, if all goes well, is a look that says: Im in the middle of doing my laundry. Oh, and by the way, in case you were wondering, Im fun.","A long line of residents seeking to return to Malibu, Calif., wait at a checkpoint on the Pacific Coast Highway after Woolsey Fire evacuation orders were lifted for the eastern portion of the city earlier this month.",2018-11-24T16:00:05Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Packing Tips for an Evacuation,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/opinion/sunday/packing-tips-for-an-evacuation.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/24/opinion/24MARKOE-return/24MARKOE-return-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,evacuation,0
TIM ARANGO,"Upper Lake — founded in 1854, a red archway in town announces — lies just beyond the checkpoint to the evacuation zone, which is managed by the National Guard and the Highway Patrol. Upper Lake was settled by two Anglo-Americans who had helped lead a revolt against Mexican rule in nearby Sonoma, a nugget of history written on the back of the postcards Mr. Lynch has stacked on the front counter. Upper Lake’s main street is a line of Old West-style storefronts, and with the evacuation of most residents, the place had the feel of a ghost town. Mr. Lynch described the area as economically depressed, and a place where people like to be left alone by the government. And even amid a devastating fire season and news reports about rising temperatures, there is plenty of skepticism over climate change. “Millions of years ago, I’m sure they had fires that raged and raged for months — it just so happens that we are in one of those cycles,” Mr. Lynch said. Other residents have stayed behind because they are worried about looters, concerned that they would return to find “their back doors kicked in,” he said. As he spoke, one of his regulars, Steve Lugger, came in to buy cat litter. “I’m the last living one in my family, and I just wanted to live in my house,” said Mr. Lugger, 68. “And I have 12 cats to take care of.” On a normal day, you can see clear across the lake, where almost every weekend there is a bass fishing tournament. But the fires have brought a thick haze of smoke.","We drove roughly 50 miles along Highway 20, from the firefighters’ base camp to the town of Clearlake Oaks, while the region was still under a mandatory evacuation order.",2018-08-10T09:40:26Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Inside the Mendocino Complex Fire Evacuation Zone,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/us/california-fires-mendocino-complex.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/10/us/10MENDOCINO-lede-01/merlin_142146867_cafa7abc-2773-4803-8940-5e862575bb04-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,evacuation,0

As we left, embers were falling from the sky and helicopters were flying low overhead spraying water. A completely surreal experience. We just bought our house in April. It’s our dream home. And as I type this, a house right next door to our neighbor’s is in flames. I’m not sure if our house will make it, but thankfully we are all safe.” — Lisa Goh “I got the emergency alert on my phone of fire at 5 something in the morning. I saw an alert of a six-acre fire near Mulholland Drive, east of the 405. That’s just a couple of miles away. By 6:15 the fire had reached 50 acres and I was already packing bags and calling my husband who is on business in Boston. By 6:30 I knew for sure we had to get out of there. I told our two nannies to wake up immediately and get their bags packed as well as the kids bags packed. I told them to pack as if we would never see this house again.” — Gwen Gottlieb “After dinner in Westlake, we were driving home down the grade and saw the red glow of the fires. It was awful and we just prayed for all in its path. Thirty minutes later we arrived in Ventura and the streetlights flickered. Then the entire city went dark. At that point we figured it was from the fires and headed inside. Not 20 minutes later I looked out my bedroom window and saw the red glow extremely close. I told my daughters we need to start gathering items as it must be spreading. Within minutes I saw the fire crest our hill and it was panic. We literally had minutes to get anything we could grab along with our pets (including our one week old kittens and a nursing Mom) and leave. We headed to Oxnard Shores to my fiancé’s parents’ home.

JULIA JACOBS,"One day at the beginning of September, the three black men crossed the barricade on their way to the ferry landing, prompting Mr. Bourgeois to open fire. After the men fled, Mr. Bourgeois bragged that he had got one and promised to kill the man, referring to him with a racial slur, according to the court documents.
Mr. Bourgeois also told a neighbor, Anything coming up this street darker than a brown paper bag is getting shot, the documents said. One of the men was struck in the neck and back, while the other two were hit in the arms, back and legs.
The court documents said Mr. Bourgeois showed others a baseball cap with blood on it that had fallen from the head of one of the injured men.
Hurricane Katrina, a Category 5 storm, killed more than 1,800 people and left much of New Orleans in ruins. In the days after the hurricane struck, a narrative based on rumors emerged, in many cases blaming poor black residents and looters for the chaos and violence. But in the months and years since, the fuller picture of the aftermath involved white vigilante violence, police killings and official cover-ups.
Hurricane Katrina was a tragic chapter in the history of our city, Peter G. Strasser, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana, said in the news release. Hopefully this plea brings some measure of finality to those directly affected by this crime and to this great city that endured so much in the days following this calamity.","In 2005, Roland J.

JACEY FORTIN,"Hurricanes in Categories 3, 4 and 5 are considered “major.” Hurricane Maria was a Category 4 storm when it hit Puerto Rico last year, ultimately killing thousands and causing months of power failures. If a hurricane’s winds reach Category 5 speeds, “a high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed,” according to the National Hurricane Center, and “power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.” Only a few hurricanes have ever made landfall in the United States as a Category 5 storm. The last was Andrew, in 1992. Meteorologists caution that a hurricane can be very dangerous no matter what its category, especially since the Saffir-Simpson scale doesn’t tell the whole story. It does not, for example, account for rainfall levels or storm surges — not directly, anyway — and those factors have a lot to do with flood risk. Take Hurricane Sandy. In 2012, it never made landfall as anything stronger than a Category 2 storm. But it led to flooding, mudslides, power failures and dozens of fatalities in the Caribbean and the United States. Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 storm last year and was soon downgraded to a Category 3. That rating did not account for the days of heavy rain that would follow, which led to fatal, catastrophic flooding.","On the morning of a mandatory evacuation in North Carolina, clouds dotted the skies over Nags Head on Tuesday.",2018-09-11T22:12:23Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",What Is a Category 5 Hurricane?

Aarian Marshall,"On Wednesday morning, Hurricane Michael barreled through the Florida panhandle. The most powerful storm to hit the region since record-keeping began in the mid-19th century ran roughshod over the states northwest coasts, damaging two local hospitals enough that they have started evacuating their patients from the areaeven after the storm has left. At least seven people are dead, 900,000 homes and businesses have lost power, and an estimated 325,000 people who fled the storm have to find their way back home. And in a terrible twist, researchers have found that Hurricane Michael hit some of the states least prepared counties. Those researchersJohn Renne, a professor of urban and regional planning and the director of Florida Atlantic Universitys Center for Urban and Environmental Solutions, and doctoral student Andrea Ramosreviewed six sorts of emergency plans for all 67 of Floridas counties. (In Floridaas in most places in the US emergency preparations happen on the local level.) Renne and Ramos's work found the counties in Florida with the least comprehensive hurricane evacuation plans were mostly in the state's panhandlein the area hit by Hurricane Michael. Each plan that the academics evaluated deals with different sorts of incidents or populations: Special Needs Registries and Specialized Transportation Plans should give authorities information on where and how residents with special needs should travel during an emergency. Pick-up location plans are for those without access to their own vehicles or who cant drive. Pet evacuation plans are for residents with pets (and those unwilling to evacuate without them). Multihazard plans are for events that include both hurricanes and other issues like flooding or environmental contamination risk. Evacuation maps are publicly available, easily accessible plans for evacuation routes. Renne and Ramos graded the effectiveness of each of plan on a 0 to 2 point scale, for a possible 12 points in total. A well-developed scheme scored a two. Non-existent plans got a zero. In the end, ten counties, all in northern Florida or the states panhandle, got weak scoresfewer than four points. Of those, at least one county, Gulf County, is under a mandatory evacuation order this week. Four other counties under mandatory evacuation ordersBay, Dixie, Taylor, and Wakullareceived moderate scores, meaning their plans earned between five and eight points. (The research has not yet been peer reviewed.) On the face of it, these results arent so surprising, says Renne. These are some of the least inhabited areas in Florida, accounting for just 1 percent of the states total permanent population. Plus, most counties receiving weak or moderate scores arent on the coast. If youre not a coastal county, it makes sense that you dont pay as much attention to evacuation plans, Renne says. He also notes that the state of Florida on the whole is much better at disaster planning than other coastal states, many which are less frequently threatened by hurricanes. But that relative distance from the coast will become less of a safeguard as climate change stirs up slower-moving, rain dense weather events. Storms like Michael and Florence are teaching planners to expect even inland coastal flooding. (During last months deluge in the Carolinas, inland areas saw more than 10 feet of flooding after swollen rivers pushed past their banks.) Places are flooding now that may have never flooded before, Renne says. It will take months, maybe years, for authorities to fully understand what happened during this unusually catastrophic storm. Being underprepared is, of course, about risk. Just because a county didnt have complete contingencies for dealing with their most vulnerable populations doesnt mean more of them were affected during Michael. It may be that places with weak plans got lucky this time. But while rescue teams continue to rescue, and lineman work on getting communications up and running in northern Florida, Renne urges more localities to get serious about disaster planning. And for the state and federal authorities to get better about helping them to plan. Theres no measuring stick for evacuation plans, says Renne. Its time to create oneand use it.

Twenty-five patients and their families are believed to have left via a government checkpoint on Wednesday. Another 31 were evacuated on Tuesday as part of an agreement between a rebel group and the government's ally Russia.

Image copyright EPA Image caption The patients have been evacuated along with family members As a result of the agreement between Russia and the rebel group Jaysh al-Islam, which controls the northern pocket around the major town of Douma, at least 55 patients on the list are reported to have left during pauses in the fighting. ""So far the agreement is going well,"" Yasser Delwan, Jaysh al-Islam's head of political affairs, told Reuters news agency. Among those evacuated on Wednesday was an 18-year-old boy called Omran, who lost a leg, an arm and an eye in a government attack two years ago, according to AFP news agency. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) and official Sana news agency later posted photos of civilians arriving at the government-controlled al-Wafideen checkpoint. Sana reported that they were then taken to reception centres. ""I hope all people manage to get out,"" one resident told state TV. ""They all wish to get out. But [the rebel fighters] are not letting them out. It is not up to us."" In a separate development, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent said a convoy of 25 lorries would deliver food and medical aid to Douma on Thursday. The convoy would be the second to get into Douma in a week but only the fourth to reach the Eastern Ghouta since November. ""This would be potentially a fairly large convoy with food and hopefully as much as possible of the other material that is in desperate need there, including medical supplies,"" UN humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland told Reuters news agency. Image copyright AFP Image caption Government air strikes continued in Hamouria and elsewhere in the southern rebel-held pocket Has the fighting stopped? No. Elsewhere in the Eastern Ghouta, there were reports of fresh air strikes. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said at least 25 civilians, including three children, had been killed by government and Russian raids on Wednesday. Aircraft reportedly targeted the towns of Kafr Batna, Saqba and Hamouria, which are in the southern rebel-held pocket controlled by the Faylaq al-Rahman faction. Unlike Jaysh al-Islam, it is not believed to have held talks with Russia. Mr Egeland said it was not too late to negotiate a pause in the fighting in the southern pocket like in Douma, to stop the ""rain of grenades and bullets"" on civilians. The Syrian police meanwhile told Sana that five civilians had been injured by shells fired at government-controlled areas of Damascus by rebels in the Eastern Ghouta.",Dozens of people in urgent need of medical treatment leave the besieged rebel-held Eastern Ghouta.,2018-03-14T17:53:06Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Syria war: Wounded leave Eastern Ghouta under evacuation deal,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43405101,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1719E/production/_100422649_mediaitem100422648.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,evacuation,1
"Ari Phillips on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","It’s been less than two months since mudslides tore through Southern California’s Santa Barbara County, killing 21 people and destroying at least 100 homes. Now, Montecito and Carpinteria, small coastal towns that suffered the bulk of that devastation, are under new evacuation orders as a strong rains are forecast. As of 8 a.m. Wednesday morning, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office has issued a Recommended Evacuation Warning for areas in the country that were recently hit by the Thomas, Sherpa, and Whittier wildfires. The burned areas clear a path for rocks and debris that otherwise would have probably have been contained during a flash flood. According to the warming, a winter storm arriving Thursday night and continuing through Friday could drop one-third to two-thirds of an inch of rain per hour. The National Weather Service informed officials that this heavy rainfall may be enough to trigger mud and debris flows near burn areas, according to KEYT news. Tree roots are also crucial in holding soil together along steep topography, and with that natural support removed, the land becomes much more susceptible to mudslides. This is especially the case in drought-ravaged regions where the soil is too dry to take in large amounts of water very quickly. This interactive map identifies the areas of Goleta, Santa Barbara, Montecito, Summerland and Carpinteria most threatened by the rains. Kathy Hoxsie, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard, told the Los Angeles Times that the “very moist system...goes right over” the Thomas Fire burn scar. The Thomas Fire, which ignited in early December, eventually became the state’s largest wildfire on record, burning about 281,900 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. Many were also forced to evacuate when the Thomas Fire threatened the region. The back-to-back natural disasters have forced local officials to reconsider how they warn residents about threats and how to distinguish between voluntary and mandatory evacuation zones. “The problem is, sometimes the focus is on the word ‘voluntary,’ rather than the word ‘evacuation,’”Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown recently told The Washington Post. “The reality is, it’s still an evacuation area...Had we known what we now know, we would have evacuated the entire area.” Additional evacuation information will be provided later on Wednesday and if any Mandatory Evacuation Order is issued, everyone must least the designated areas by Thursday, March 1 at 9 a.m. “If at any time people feel threatened, take immediate action,” states the release. “Do not wait for a notification. Those with access and functional needs and those with large animals should leave.” When evacuated Montecito residents started returning to their homes in early February after the devastating January mudslides, they were met with a host of new problems, including unhealthy layers of mud containing everything from sewage to petrochemicals, according to local reports. And now, another decision about evacuation.","It’s been less than two months since mudslides tore through Southern California’s Santa Barbara County, killing 21 people and destroying at least 100 homes.

JOHN SCHWARTZ and TIMOTHY WILLIAMS,"It is uncommon for powerful storms to barrel straight at the North Carolina coast, as Florence is doing. The last Category 4 storm to do so was Hazel in 1954, a storm famous for its destructiveness. Most storms that reach the coastal United States tend to track farther south, hitting Florida or entering the Gulf of Mexico. Dr. Francis noted that the storms that wander through the same portion of the Atlantic as Florence generally tend to turn north and east before they reach the coast. This year, though, an atmospheric phenomenon known as a blocking high, spun off from the jet stream “like a swirl in the river that separates itself from the main flow,” prevented Florence from making that turn. Mr. Cramer, the town manager in Carolina Beach, said he was worried about projections that Florence would be comparable to Hazel, which nearly wiped his town of 6,200 year-round residents off the map completely, destroying 362 buildings there. The coastline that Florence will plow into this week is, if anything, even more vulnerable than the one Hazel struck in 1954. Americans have flocked to the nation’s shores and have built extensively there in recent decades, ensuring that any modern storm will do much more property damage than those of previous generations. The trend has also put many more people directly in harm’s way. In 2010, 39 percent of Americans lived in counties directly on the shoreline — 123 million people, a 40 percent rise since 1970 — and the 2020 census is expected to show that figure growing by another 10 million people. Dr. Vecchi of Princeton said society needed to find a way to address the causes of climate change — though perhaps not this week. “Right now, I would focus on everybody getting safe, and away from Florence,” he said. “But afterward, there’s other questions that need to be asked.”","Many coastal communities in the Carolinas, including Nags Head, N.C., emptied out on Tuesday after the approach of Hurricane Florence prompted mandatory evacuation orders.",2018-09-12T00:48:18Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","As Florence’s Power Nears the Carolinas, Residents Brace for the Worst",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/us/as-florences-power-nears-the-carolinas-residents-brace-for-the-worst.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/11/us/hurricane-florence-tracking-map-promo-1536673849664/hurricane-florence-tracking-map-promo-1536673849664-facebookJumbo-v12.png,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,evacuation,0
"SIMON ROMERO, TIM ARANGO and THOMAS FULLER","One of the criticisms or the lessons learned was, hey, try to stagger your evacuations, Sheriff Honea said. In Paradise, the sheriff ordered staged evacuations according to zones in immediate peril. If everyone had been ordered to leave at once, the evacuation may have been more perilous, he said. If we hadnt tried to evacuate those zones with an imminent threat versus the ones where the threat was progressing towards them, I believe the traffic would have been even worse, he said. Paradise, given how it was planned and developed over decades, with homes built on a ridge surrounded by forests and just a handful of roads out, seemed poised to one day face disaster. The town studied evacuation routes after a 2008 wildfire in the area. The Paradise mayor, Jody Jones, is a traffic specialist who spent years working for the state agency that manages roads. But the mayor and other law enforcement officials argued that the Camp Fire spread so quickly at one point moving the equivalent length of a football field per second that it overwhelmed the ability of emergency workers. After the 2008 wildfire, a Butte County Grandy Jury report noted the difficulty residents had in evacuating, and advised that the authorities find ways to make it easier for residents to escape. Instead, the authorities narrowed Skyway in the center of town to improve pedestrian safety, reduce traffic and promote commerce a decision that is sure to be scrutinized in the aftermath of the Camp Fire. Eric Reinbold, the police chief of Paradise, was skeptical that removing a lane from parts of the downtown area made the evacuation more difficult. I dont know that it would have made a difference or not, Chief Reinbold said. You just cant evacuate that many people in minutes or hours. A recent editorial in the The Chico Enterprise-Record described the towns preoccupation with emergency evacuations in recent years. People prepared. Fire prevention officials planned. They drilled. They worked with homeowners. They invented fire-safe councils and Fire on the Ridge and sent fire prevention officials to schools via a program called Fire Pals. They raised money to keep fire lookouts open when the state said it wouldnt. Eventually, geography and topography proved to be the trap everyone thought it was. John Owens counts himself among the lucky residents of Paradise. He and his wife and their dog are now sleeping in a friends car in the parking lot of a Burger King in Chico. Their home in a trailer park in Paradise was destroyed, as was his Ford pickup, for which he had no insurance. But were alive, man, said Mr. Owens, 57, a welder. He said he had been working in Chico on the day of the fire when he got a call from his wife, who was at home.","In the frenzied first hours of the Camp Fire as it bore down on Paradise, Calif., only a fraction of residents received emergency alerts or evacuation orders from local authorities.",2018-11-21T18:40:32Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","A Frantic Call, a Neighbor’s Knock, but Few Official Alerts as Wildfire Closed In",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/us/paradise-fires-emergency-alerts.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/21/us/00firealert-01/00firealert-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,evacuation,0
Shannon Connellan,"Durian, the pungent (and highly polarising) fruit has often caused people to dry-retch when its odour hits their nostrils, but over the weekend, the fruit caused an entire police-assisted evacuation. In Australia, approximately 500 students and teachers were evacuated from Melbourne's RMIT university on Saturday, after a ""smell of gas"" was reported within the library. Turns out, it was just a rotten durian fruit. SEE ALSO: Woman eats two entire durian fruit because she couldn't bring them onto a train According to a statement from Melbourne's Metropolitan Fire Brigade, firefighting crews were called to the campus just after 3 p.m., and an evacuation was managed by Victoria Police as a precaution while ""an investigation was launched into the source of the smell."" The library, known to store ""potentially dangerous chemicals"" according to the MFB (yeah, someone look into that please), was searched, and firefighters identified the smell not as chemical gas, but gas generated by the offending durian, described as ""an extremely pungent fruit which had been left rotting in a cupboard."" Once it found its way out of the cupboard, the smell moved into the library's air conditioning system and ran amok. Durian fruit, often described as having the smell of gym socks or rotting meat, has been banned on Singapore's public trains. You can see why Melbourne students freaked. Dramatically, the troublesome, rotten durian will be managed by the Environment Protection Authority. The library has now reopened and hopefully staff and students are getting a big memo on leaving certain stinky fruits at home. RMIT representatives told Mashable, ""We apologise for any inconvenience caused to those on campus."" The whole thing polarised Twitter, with some folks lamenting the waste of good durian, and others empathising with those evacuated. 1) this is the most white people reaction to durian ever 😧😑 2) this is why hotels tell you not to bring it into the room, lest you freak out everyone else 3) the real crime is someone leaving durian uneaten to the point where it could rot 😲 https://t.co/E7kRlxJLtY — Susan Tsang (@batgirl_susan) April 29, 2018 Next exam I’m going to call in a rotting durian scare — Martine Marich (@drmartinemarich) April 29, 2018","Durian, the pungent (and highly polarising) fruit has often caused people to dry-retch when its odour hits their nostrils, but over the weekend, the fruit caused an entire police-assisted evacuation.

SIMON ROMERO,"Mr. Jeys said he gave his debit card to a radio reporter who recently made it through the roadblocks to survey Paradise. The reporter returned with several packs of Pall Malls, his preferred brand of cigarettes, and some mouthwash. For sustenance, Mr. Jeys said that members of work crews in Paradise had given him sandwiches and bottles of water. Theyve also doled out other essentials, like batteries and bags of cat food. He repeatedly praised the generosity of those going house to house in the town looking for the remains of missing people who may have died in the fire. Since the fire hit, Mr. Jeys said he found himself grappling with feelings of guilt and bewilderment. He said he had listened to radio reports on the staggering number of people who died in the fire, now at 83, as well the hundreds listed as missing. I know people who escaped with only the clothes on their backs, he said. Others didnt make it out at all, and here I am. I find myself asking how that can be sometimes. Mr. Jeys said he was also pondering the apparent randomness of which structures were razed in the fire and which ones remain unscathed. Nearby, on Skyway, the commercial strip winding through the town, the Pelicans Roost Restaurant, Dutch Bros. Coffee and Meehos Mexican restaurant somehow remain standing. The same cannot be said for the Main Event styling salon, Maria Celestes Gastropub or Jack in the Box, all destroyed. Meanwhile, Mr. Jeys is still reading each morning and spending time with his pets. He smiled while explaining that he named one of his cats after Porius, a 1951 historical novel set in Wales during the Dark Ages by John Cowper Powys, a British philosopher and novelist.

KAREN ZRAICK,"Giving to the Cajun Navy Numerous volunteer rescue groups go by some variation of Cajun Navy. One registered nonprofit, Cajun Navy Relief, said that its volunteers, who include boaters, EMTs and firefighters, have extensive training and have conducted rescues in previous storms, like Hurricane Harvey last year. As Hurricane Florence approached the Carolinas, the Cajun Navy Relief deployed to an area near Lumberton, N.C., with bass boats, airboats and other vessels, said Josh Richard, a spokesman for the organization. The group has a PayPal account for monetary donations, which are needed to fill fuel containers and buy meals for boat teams and evacuees, among other costs. Go here to donate supplies. Animal shelters Before the storm hit, many local animal shelters scrambled to transport their charges to safe locations, or to get them adopted. The Atlanta Humane Society was caring for dozens of cats and dogs from Beaufort, S.C., and rushed to get other animals in shelters on the Carolina coast out of harm’s way. After Irma last year, the organization put up 1,000 animals in an emergency shelter, and if needed, it could reopen such a facility, said Christina Hill, a spokeswoman for the group. That protects animals in case shelters are damaged, and also frees up space for lost or displaced animals that come in after the storm. (Shelters that reach capacity are sometimes forced to euthanize animals after natural disasters.)","Avair Vereen, 39, left, her fiancé and one of her children at a Hurricane Florence evacuation shelter at Conway High School in South Carolina on Thursday.",2018-09-15T15:43:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Hurricane Florence: How to Help,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/15/reader-center/how-to-help-hurricane-florence-victims.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/15/us/15xp-shelters/15xp-shelters-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,evacuation,0
MEGHAN MINER MURRAY and CHRISTINA CARON,"The gases are released from magma when the pressure of the earth is no longer able to contain them, similar to opening a bottle of champagne or a can of soda, said Esteban Gazel, an associate professor at Cornell University, who studies volcanoes. Inhaling the gas is dangerous because it turns into an acid when it comes in contact with the upper respiratory tract, he said, adding, “You’re going to feel like you’re burning.” Elena Cabatu, a spokeswoman for the Hilo Medical Center in Hilo, Hawaii, the main hospital that was prepared to treat affected patients, said on Saturday there had not been an increase in emergency room visits, adding that people so far appeared to have stayed away from the areas with the highest concentration of gases. Residents of the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens subdivisions were ordered to evacuate, officials said. The Hawaii Police Department and members of the National Guard were helping to enforce road closings where gas levels were deemed unsafe. As of Friday night, there were 58 National Guard soldiers working in three shifts and some 75 police officers working in 12-hour shifts, officials said. There had been no reports of injuries or death, according to officials. As of Saturday afternoon, at least five homes had been destroyed by lava, said Janet Snyder, a spokeswoman for the office of the mayor of Hawaii County. New fissures were also reported on Saturday. Officials said firefighters were not responding to fires within the subdivisions because of the high levels of gas. The volcanic eruptions on the southern end of the island of Hawaii prompted about 66 residents to go to shelters on Friday night and forced the closing of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Lava began bubbling up through a new crack in the Kilauea volcano on Thursday evening. The eruptions came after days of small earthquakes, capped by a more powerful one with a magnitude of 6.9 that struck the south flank of the volcano on Friday at 12:33 p.m. Hawaii time. At a standing-room-only meeting attended by residents on Friday night, officials provided updates about what to expect from the eruptions. Residents expressed concerns about leaving their homes and the potential for looting. Others worried about the lava’s uncertain path and about pets left behind in their haste to evacuate. “At one point I moved here with a pallet full of stuff trying to, I guess, seek the adrenaline rush or whatever it was that led me to the Ring of Fire,” said a resident, Tiffany Edwards Hunt. “And at some point I started to acquire possessions. I rooted. This became my beloved community and it’s so hard to remember the basic premise that everything is so temporary.” She added, “I keep reminding myself that we’re clinging to an active volcano.” Meghan Miner Murray reported from Pahoa, and Christina Caron from New York.

Photo The former King Edward VIII, then the Duke of Windsor, and Wallis Simpson on their wedding day in France in June 1937. Credit Associated Press The British news media largely blacked out coverage of Edward’s yearslong affair with the American socialite Wallis Simpson, who by that time was divorcing her second husband. Pages were reportedly even torn from foreign magazines, which were writing freely about the couple. The average Briton was unprepared for the looming constitutional crisis when the affair was publicly revealed and Parliament refused to allow the marriage. As The Times wrote, “Public in London Is Bewildered.” In a changed world, the royal family has struggled against the intrusive media attention, particularly in the marriage and divorce of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and in Diana’s death. But Harry and his brother, William, have tried to establish a respectful relationship with the news media ( despite the occasional warning ). Ultimately, the news of Harry and Ms. Markle’s engagement received a far warmer reception than that of Edward, the brother of Harry’s great-grandfather.

Multiple ships and helicopters are taking part in the evacuation; the Joint Rescue Centre for Southern Norway shared video of the rescue to YouTube.
To complicate matters, a cargo ship with nine people on board hit the same rough waters as the Viking Sky and some of the rescue helicopters had to be diverted for assistance.
A member of the rescue crew told Reuters that eight people had suffered minor injuries and that the rescue attempt will take a while, continuing into the night and maybe even into Sunday. Photos of passengers waiting for their turn at evacuation also hit social media. 
Mashable reached out to Viking Cruises for a statement and updates on the ongoing rescue and received the following message in response:
We can confirm that on March 23rd at 2pm (Norwegian time) the vessel Viking Sky a 47,800 tonne ship travelling from Tromsø to Stavanger, carrying 915 guests and 458 crew experienced a loss of engine power off the coast of Norway near Molde. We are working closely with the relevant authorities and all operational procedures were followed in line with international regulations. In addition Viking has dispatched an operational task force, including the companys owner, to Molde.
Our first priority was for the safety and wellbeing of our passengers and our crew, and in close cooperation with the Norwegian Coast Guard, the captain decided to evacuate all guests from the vessel by helicopter. The ship is proceeding on its own power and a tugboat is on site. The evacuation is proceeding with all necessary caution. A small number of non-life threatening injuries have been reported. Guests are being accommodated in local hotels when they arrive back on shore, and Viking will arrange for return flights for all guests.
The statement also added that anyone with questions or concerns about specific guests aboard the Viking Sky can find more information right here.","Incredible videos shared on Twitter are showing the wild rough seas that have led to the evacuation of 1,300 people from a cruise ship off the coast of Norway.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption The bomb was found by workers on a construction site in Heidestrasse A large-scale evacuation is to take place in Berlin on Friday morning to allow experts to defuse a World War Two bomb. Buildings will be cleared from 09:00 (07:00 GMT) in an 800m (2,625ft) radius from the construction site where the bomb was discovered. The zone includes government ministries, a hospital and the city's central railway station. Thousands of unexploded bombs from the 1939-45 war are found every year. Police say there is no immediate danger from the 1,100lb (500kg) British bomb, which was found on Heidestrasse last Wednesday. The area to be cleared includes Berlin Hauptbahnhof - the central railway station - an army hospital, the economy and transport ministries and the embassies of Indonesia and Uzbekistan, according to police quoted by AFP news agency. Image copyright AFP Image caption The zone to be evacuated includes Berlin's Hauptbahnhof It is understood the operation to defuse the device will take place around midday. Rail company Deutsche Bahn and other transport operators have warned of large-scale disruption for trains, trams and buses in the area. Flights to and from Tegel airport - about 7km (4.5 miles) away - will not be affected, authorities said on Thursday, although planes coming in to land will avoid flying over the site. Tegel, which is Berlin's busiest airport, was briefly closed last August after the discovery of a Russian World War Two bomb.

Britain is already bitterly divided over Brexit, and more than it has been on anything for generations, Mr. Featherstone wrote in an email on Sunday. But talk of riots in the streets is misconceived, he said.
He added that Brexit had to do with identity politics, not economics. And riots would not start over whether Britain would end up with a Canada- or Norway-type deal, he said.

Sidney Fussell,"A misplaced fruit prompted the evacuation of around 500 students from a Melbourne university this weekend, BBC News reports. On Saturday, Melbourne’s Metropolitan Fire Brigade was called to RMIT University after a gas smell was reported in the library. As the library houses potentially dangerous chemicals, there were concerns of a gas leak. It was rotting fruit. In a statement, the fire brigade said that a “comprehensive search” determined that the noxious fumes were actually coming from an “extremely pungent” durian, a Southeast Asian fruit with a notoriously powerful scent. Firefighters say they found the fruit rotting in a cupboard in the library. The scent “moved around the building via the air conditioning system,” according to the fire brigade, not unlike Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible if he were made out of onions and gym socks. The building was reopened within a few hours and authorities say Victoria’s Environment Protection Authority will now oversee the storage of the offending fruit. Was this an elaborate, Ocean’s Eleven -style move to get out of a term paper? A Dark Knight -inspired, Joker-esque paean to chaos? No one seems to have publicly taken the blame for the Durian Gas Attack of 2018 and life continues on campus. In researching its distinctive scent, scientists have detected 50 chemical compounds in durian that contribute to creating its infamous odor.

George Dvorsky,"With powerful Santa Ana winds gusting as high as 80 miles per hour, firefighters are bracing themselves for another challenging day in Southern California. Over the course of the week, destructive wildfires in the state have forced the evacuation of more than 230,000 people, destroyed hundreds of homes, and torched over 80,000 acres of land. Since the wildfires began on Monday evening, at least 14 different blazes have swept through a region extending from San Diego to the San Fernando Valley. The fires are being fueled by unusually strong Santa Ana winds and large amounts of dry vegetation—ironically caused by heavy rainfall earlier this year—which are now parched and dried out. The fires have caused severe traffic disruptions, closed schools and museums, and triggered power outages. The largest of the fires, the Thomas Fire, encompasses an area measuring 115,000 acres, and it’s just five percent contained. States of emergency have been declared in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, including the city of LA itself. To date, some 230,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. No deaths have been reported, but several firefighters have sustained injuries. Flying above California aboard the ISS, Russian cosmonaut Sergey Ryazansky took these photos of the wildfires. Earlier this week, California’s Office of Emergency Services sent a broadcast text alert to 12 million people across seven different counties warning of the wildfires. It’s the largest alert the office has ever sent. The state is hoping to avoid a repeat of early October 2017 when wildfires killed 44 people in the state. The text didn’t ask people to evacuate, but instead advised of dangerous conditions. Meteorologists have had to adjust to the severe conditions. A color-coded system used to convey wind strength reached uncharted levels, going past the red “high” level, moving into the purple zone, which indicates “extreme” winds. Incredibly, at 80 mph (130 km/h), the winds reached hurricane-force levels. “The forecast for tomorrow is purple,” said Ken Pimlott, director at the California Department of Forestry and Fire protection. “We’ve never used purple before.” These winds are fueling existing fires, turning small brush fires into raging infernos in a matter of minutes, and blowing hot embers into adjoining areas, potentially starting new fires. These high winds are also making it difficult—if not impossible—for firefighters to do their work. On Thursday, the wildfires swept through northern San Diego county, moving toward Oceanside and other coastal communities. The Lilac fire, which extends for 4,100 acres and is zero percent contained, made its way through the Bonsall area, torching areas along State Route 76 corridor and destroying 20 buildings. Earlier this week, 29 horses— including elite thoroughbred race horses worth hundreds of thousands of dollars—were killed when the fire reached the San Luis Rey Training Center. Those rescued endured severe burns, and were treated for smoke inhalation, dehydration, and stress. In Bonsall, around 500 horses had to be rescued when the Lilac Fire began to threaten the region some 45 miles north of San Diego, according to CNN. “There was so much smoke it was difficult to see,” Dan Durhan, a horse trainer, told the Associated Press. “Some of the horses were turned loose so they could be safe. They were scattered around.” Despite these losses, firefighters are making some progress. Of the 14 wildfires, five are now classified as contained (the Oak, Riverdale, Little Mountain, Meyers, and Paper fires). In Bel-Air on Thursday, the 475-acre Skirball Fire failed to get any bigger, largely the result of firefighting crews who worked along its western and northern edges near the 405 freeway and several luxurious, multi-million-dollar homes. Fire crews are also testing new technology. On Thursday, the LAFD tested a drone that used thermal imaging to sniff out hot spots, directing firefighters to areas in need of attention. Sadly, southern Californians will have to stay alert, as high winds are projected to persist until Sunday. This year’s wildfire season can’t end soon enough.

Camper Dwayne Martin said he believes officials want to “mow this place down,” and vowed to fight the evacuation.
“The fire department, they won’t give us any kind of means of keeping warm,” he said.
“For two years I’ve asked the fire department, what can I use, two years they say, ‘Nothing.’ All they say is what I can’t have. Well they can’t have my place, they can’t come in my place no more.”
In a media release on Saturday, the City of Maple Ridge said it had evacuated its Emergency Support Services (ESS), which would register campers and ensure they had somewhere warm to sleep for the next 48 hours.
Campers will be temporarily moved to a property on Lougheed Highway under the management of the Salvation Army. The city said the Salvation Army will then gear up “local resources to provide support services.”
Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing Selina Robinson also released a statement on Saturday, pointing to “dozens” of former Anita Place campers that were moved into modular housing in Maple Ridge last fall.

“The safety of the community, and the residents being evacuated, is our immediate focus,” said Robinson.
“In the longer term, this reinforces the need to act quickly and build more supportive housing in Maple Ridge… We must move quickly and work together to get more people into the safe and supportive homes they urgently need.”
The evacuation order was issued by the provincial fire commissioner over “an imminent and serious danger to life and property” in the wake of three fires this week at the two-year-old camp.
No one was hurt in the fires, but the city says a number of propane tanks were found on site in the wake of the fires.
On Friday, the city also said it was doubling the security presence around the site, in the wake of growing conflict between neighbourhood residents and campers.
Campers allege that some of the recent fires may have been caused by arsonists.

Alliance Against Displacement, an activist group that frequently speaks for the camp, said that move actually made the camp more dangerous, and could have contributed to the fires this week.

George Dvorsky,"US Marine Corps stationed in Hawaii are now on standby to help with evacuations should lava flows cut off the only remaining escape route from the beleaguered Puna neighborhood. The latest threat comes as the Big Island enters its fourth week of eruptions, and as a third lava flow reaches the ocean. At a base near Honolulu, a pair of CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters have been readied in case encroaching lava flows reach State Highway 130. If blocked, residents living in Leilani Estates and the surrounding neighborhoods would be cut off from grocery stores, schools, and hospitals. Around 2,000 people have already been evacuated from this coastal community, and another 2,000 would have to flee should the lava reach the highway or if large cracks open up in the road. The US Marine Corps says its two helicopters can carry up to 50 passengers at a time. “We now have the capacity to evacuate all of the estimated population of lower Puna south of the lava flow within a few hours,” Brigadier General Kenneth Hara of the Hawaii National Guard said in a statement. Road crews have been dumping material into cracks on the highway and covering them with steel plates to keep the road accessible. Meanwhile, a third lava flow has reached the ocean just east of Mackenzie State Park, the USGS has confirmed. “The extent of fountaining and lava flows is about two miles and that’s going from fissure 8 all the way up to fissure 22,” explained USGS volcanologist Wendy Stovall in Hawaii News Now. “There’s two main channels of lava that are issuing from those vents and it went down to the coast. And one of the channels, the furthest channel to the east, is bifurcating so it’s splitting into two and now we have three ocean entries at the coast.” The lava pouring into the sea is creating large plumes of laze—clouds of gas and tiny shards of glass—that pose a risk to nearby residents. Indeed, air quality is a growing concern, as those living near the lava bursts are being exposed to high levels of sulfur dioxide. Residents may have to flee should the air quality deteriorate further. In addition, explosive eruptions at Kilauea’s summit crater have released clouds of ash, which are drifting onto communities downwind. Officials are also warning about worsening ground cracking, which has already badly damaged one home. The cracks have torn roads apart in some places, and created gaps as wide as three to 10 feet. Geologists with the USGS say this is a sign that magma is continuing to enter the rift zone and that additional eruptive activity is likely. Since the Kilauea eruptions began on May 3, more than 20 vents have appeared in the Puna region, and they’re collectively pouring out lava at the astonishing rate of 40 to 60 cubic feet each second. The fissures extend for two miles, and lava has now covered more than 1,700 acres in lower Puna, though the actual figure is probably higher. To date, over 50 structures have been wrecked, around half of which are homes. The Big Island is now bracing for a second phase of evacuations, with no end to the eruptions in sight.

Beth Skwarecki,"A hurricane’s category only tells you about its wind speed, but much of its devastation comes from flooding. With Hurricane Florence, some areas could see as many as 30 inches of rain plus ten feet of storm surge. What is a storm surge? The winds of a hurricane push water around, even while the storm is still in the ocean. Water that is pushed onto land becomes the storm surge. Think of how the tide can roll in from the sea and cover up land that was previously bare. It’s like that, except you have tides in addition to the storm surge, raising water levels even higher. Where does the storm surge happen? It’s not just an issue at the coast. Storm surges can cause flooding in upstream rivers, or in any low-lying areas the surge water reaches. North Carolina is so flat that the surge is expected to cause flooding many miles inland. How much flooding should we expect? Total flooding depends on the storm surge, including storm tides, plus rainfall. It varies depending on the exact contours of the land. And your safety in the storm depends on other factors as well: perhaps your house will be dry, but if all the roads are flooded, that doesn’t help you much. Bottom line, if you or a loved one are in the area, the most important map is an evacuation map. But if you’re curious about the predicted flooding, here is the storm surge prediction map from the National Hurricane Center. Predictions change as more information comes in, and the NHC notes that the map “includes many assumptions and has limitations, and it cannot tell you what amount of flooding will definitely occur at any given location.” Hurricane Florence is expected to make landfall along the Atlantic coast as early as this coming… Read more Read Rainfall predictions are shown on a separate map, and those predictions are likewise going to change as forecasters watch the storm approach.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The confirmed death toll in the Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, has risen to 76, with nearly 1,300 names still remaining on an ad hoc list of missing individuals. The town of Paradise, which a firestorm overtook in a matter of hours on Nov. 8, is more or less totally destroyed. According to a report in the Los Angeles Times, one question after the disaster is whether officials did enough to prepare for the eventuality of one of the states rampaging wildfires sweeping through the town. Paradise officials had seen one prior fire result in disaster a decade ago, the Times wrote, after a fire stopped at the edge of Paradise and three of the four major roads out of the region were ablaze. The result was hours of gridlock, leaving evacuees defenseless on the road and leading to many trying to outrun the fires on foot: A grand jury report and county fire plans said Paradise needed a way to get everyone out quickly at once. Instead, Paradise leaders divided the town into evacuation zones that could be emptied a few at a time. Following the lead of other fire-prone counties, Butte County contracted for a private warning system to alert residents in dangerif they had the foresight to sign up. The Paradise emergency operations director estimated no more than 30% of citizens were on the list. According to the grand jury report, the Weather Channel wrote, many vehicles carrying evacuees had an effective speed of four miles per hour. The new system didnt work out that much better as the Camp Fire approached Paradise this month. While firefighters issued an evacuation order at 7:46 a.m. local time, that order only applied to the eastern zone of the town, the Times wrote. By the time they issued a general evacuation order applying to the remaining residents almost an hour later, the paper added, the situation had ended up much like the prior fire: The result was that as the Camp fire entered Paradise, the evacuation order issued at 7:46 a.m. covered only the eastern quarter of town. Evacuation orders werent given to the rest of the city for nearly an hour. Within two minutes of the broader warning, the first major traffic jam was reported. Then the evacuation corridors caught fire, as they had a decade before. According to the Times, the main four-lane road for Paradise, the Skylane Boulevard, was designed for 1,200 cars per hour during rush hour, while almost 27,000 residents were subject to the evacuation order. The ensuing chaos saw people fleeing stalled cars on roadsone survivor told the paper her steering wheel began to meltor simply ending up trapped, with emergency services overwhelmed and officers allegedly telling evacuees to commandeer any available vehicles. The problem in Paradise is that you cant get out, NPR reporter Paige St. John explained....Once they needed to move and you had an entire town that needed to get out all at once, the roads quickly turned into parking lots. 36-year-old survivor Eric Smith, standing outside the charred rubble of his childhood home, told the Daily Beast, It looks like a bomb went off. My childhood has burnt down. How could they have organized it? Smith added. The fire was burning 80 football fields a minute. Theres one way in and out of here. I dont know how anyone could have organized anything. A Cal Fire worker told the Beast that many individuals died in their cars. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea added that the evacuation was as orderly as could be under such a very, very frightening situation and that emergency personnel were able to save tens of thousands of lives. However, per the Mercury News, the sheriffs department has conceded that they could have alerted more residents to the danger. Many reported receiving news of the evacuation too late, or not at all, due to an opt-in emergency warning system and a complicated protocol for carrying it out that moved slower than the spreading flames. It got to point where this thing was outrunning us before we even knew we were in race by that time we started trying to message and get that information out there, Honea told the paper. The Mercury News reported: Others also said they didnt get messages from the countys Red Alert program Thursday. No news was delivered over the Amber Alert wireless emergency notification system, or through Nixle, they said. There was nothing on local radio. Television did not interrupt programming with an emergency broadcast system warning. There were no sirens. On Facebook, Cal Fires first post was at 10:07 a.m, and it was general, describing acreage and saying Multiple evacuation orders have been issued. We didnt get a robo call, announcement or any notice from Cal Fire or city, We had to find out about it second-hand, said Ethan Silverman. Neighbors they came up and down the road telling us to leave, said Gabriel Wilcox. Mayor Jody Jones pointed towards the decision of many residents not to opt into the emergency alert system, telling the Mercury News: There isnt a town anywhere that could build the infrastructure so you would not have gridlock when you are evacuating everyone all at once. Had we not had that plan, had we not practiced the plan, we would have lost so many more lives. [L.A.

Ed Cara,"One of the world’s deadliest diseases—tuberculosis—made a rare stateside appearance Thursday. This afternoon, the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland reported that a small amount of the infectious germ was potentially released in its facilities while being transported. The incident initially prompted the evacuation of several buildings, but hospital officials now say no one is at risk of contracting the disease. According to WBAL, the incident involved a small vial of a frozen sample of tuberculosis being dropped onto the floor and having its lid fall off. The drop occurred in the internal bridge that connects the hospital’s Cancer Research Building 1 to its Cancer Research Building 2—a non-patient area of the hospital. Soon after, a fire alarm was pulled and employees were evacuated. “The Baltimore City Fire and Rescue unit initiated hazmat protocols and, out of an abundance of caution, both research buildings were evacuated. Public safety officials as well as infectious disease experts have now cleared the buildings, and the evacuation has been lifted,” said John Hopkins in a statement to Gizmodo. “We have confirmed that there was no risk to anyone on campus. We want to thank our employees for their quick response to the situation as well as the Baltimore City Fire Department.” Tuberculosis, usually caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide, infecting 10 million and killing at least 1.7 million people in 2016 alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control. In the US, however, it’s steadily become a rarity. In 2016, only 9,272 TB cases were reported, the lowest toll recorded yet. TB is spread through the air and typically attacks the lungs. It can cause a hacking cough that lasts for weeks, chest pain, and a tell-tale coughing up of blood familiar to anyone who’s watched Moulin Rouge. More often, it instead lies dormant in the body, incapable of causing disease or being spreadable. While many people with latent TB never go on to develop symptoms, though, the germ can emerge later in on life, usually when a person’s immune system is weakened. Because of its knack for picking on the immunocompromised, TB is much more dangerous and occasionally fatal for people who also have HIV. TB can be treated through a months-long course of antibiotics, but its hardiness and poor antibiotic management on the part of doctors and patients had enabled incredibly resistant strains to start cropping up. As much as 20 percent of TB strains are multi-drug resistant (MDR), meaning they can rebuff the two frontline drugs used for treatment, rifampicin and isoniazid. Two percent are extensively drug-resistant, meaning they can resist nearly every available antibiotic in modern use. And some strains, doctors have speculated, are even totally untreatable. Luckily, it seems, that’s a scenario we won’t have to worry about here. [ WBAL ]","One of the world’s deadliest diseases—tuberculosis—made a rare stateside appearance Thursday.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","I’m no expert, but I feel like our planet is trying to tell us something. In addition to every corner of the globe being on fire, doused in rain, or cooked by heat, a new volcanic eruption is adding heavy ash to the list of calamities befalling humanity. The Manaro Voui volcano popped off in Vanuatu, a small island nation in the South Pacific, prompting the evacuation of the entire island of Ambae. The eruption occurred on Thursday and sent ash flying into the sky. The plume of debris was clearly visible from space, but its impacts were equally dramatic viewed from Earth. The Vanuatu Red Cross released images showing an inky sky and cars driving with their headlights on as ash essentially blocked out the Sun. The deteriorating conditions have led the government to issue evacuation orders for the island’s 10,000 residents. A similar order was issued in September last year when the volcano rumbled to life, but Red Cross officials told ABC Australia the current eruption “is becoming more critical” compared what they’ve seen over the past year. The heavy ash has made the evacuation and response process even more difficult. “We tried to travel to the South today but we have to turn back, because trees are falling, visibility is very very poor, we cannot see far more than 2 meters,” Augustin Garae, a Vanuatu Red Cross disaster coordinator, wrote in a Facebook post. Indeed, photos show that the ash has bowed palm trees, clogged rivers, and smothered roads. Janine Krippner, a volcanologist at Concord University, likened the weight of the ash to a bucket of sand or shovel full of wet snow. “It is literally rock, pulverized rock that has been blasted apart during the eruption,” she told Earther. “When it rains and the ash gets waterlogged it is even heavier.” In addition to hampering evacuation efforts, ash also poses a huge health threat. The tiny particles and shards of volcanic glass it contains can get caught in lungs, aggravating respiratory problems. The volcano has been simmering since last year. But it seems it wanted to join the volcano frenzy of 2018. Eruptions have rocked Hawaii, the Philippines, and Guatemala, taking lives and causing extensive damages. Despite that there have been multiple high-profile eruptions over the past few months, I cannot stress enough that they are not related —nevertheless, I hold that it sure as hell seems like the Earth is trying to get rid of us.","I’m no expert, but I feel like our planet is trying to tell us something.

Michelle Woo,"Half of house fires happen between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., a time in which most of us would not be conscious enough to know somethings going on. This is terrifying, but theres an easy thing you can do to help you survive: Close your bedroom door before you go to bed. This message comes from the UL Firefighter Safety Research Institute (FSRI), which found over a decade of research that the simple act could have a potentially life-saving impact. The more oxygen a fire has, the faster it spreads, so a closed door can offer protection. (Also, if you ever must exit a fire, close the door behind you to slow down its growth.) Between a room with an open door and one with a closed door, there can be a 900-degree difference. Watch how a fire impacts these two bedrooms, which are located side by side, adjacent to a burning living room. These days, house fires are more dangerous than ever, as the synthetic materials we use allow fire to spread more quickly than it did in previous generations. (Thirty years ago, you would have had about 17 minutes to escape. Now you have just three minutes.) In addition to having everyone in your family to close their doors before going to sleep, make sure you have working smoke alarms, review your evacuation plan and check for common household fire hazards.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Both ends of California are on fire. While firefighters battle the Camp Fire in Northern California, their compatriots in Southern California are facing an equally harrowing situation. Spurred by the Santa Ana winds, the Woolsey and Hill fires are wreaking havoc just north of Los Angeles with an estimated 75,000 homes under evacuation orders. The number is likely to rise as winds conditions pick up again on Friday. The twin blazes began in Ventura County on Thursday, forcing widespread evacuations in a region reeling from a deadly mass shooting earlier this week. As of late Thursday night, the Woolsey Fire had burned 7,500 acres and the Hill Fire was up to 10,000 acres. Both are running completely wild with zero percent containment as flames race up and down the steep hillsides. Powerful Santa Ana winds blasting up to 60 mph have made conditions even worse. The winds are annual occurrence in Southern California. As they flow from east to west, rolling down the mountains and into valleys, the air they move becomes compressed. That heats it up and dries it out, which in turn can create dangerous fire conditions. Pile that on top of a severe drought thats gripped the region for months, creating loads of fire fuel, and you have a recipe for the disaster currently unfolding. Mandatory evacuations went up overnight in large parts of Ventura County. The countys fire department reported that there were 30,000 people under evacuation orders, many forced to flee in the dead of night. The evacuation orders have spread to Los Angeles County as firefighters have been unable to keep pace with the fires racing across the landscape. The Woolsey Fire jumped the 101 Freeway on Friday morning and began to descend on the multi-million dollar homes of Malibu. The Los Angeles County Fire Department tweeted that it posed an [i]mminent threat! Fire season is changing in Southern California in a variety of ways that are not good. That includes the global warming rigamarole every corner of the planet is dealing with to bizarre local impacts like the region losing its cooling cloud cover. Add in densely populated areas like Malibu and, well, you have a trappings of a very, very bad situation. Update November 9, 12:31 p.m. ET: Local officials held a press conference to update reporters on the state of the Woolsey and Hill fires. Los Angeles County Chief Deputy David Richardson said there are more than 2,000 firefighters currently battling the blazes in Southern California and that up to 60,000 homes could see mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders over the course of the day. If you have a mandatory evacuation order, leave., Linda Parks, a Ventura County Supervisor, said. We dont want any tragedies, any deaths, any injuries. In addition to the challenging conditions, theres also a resource challenge. Firefighters are being stretched thin between these fires and the Camp Fire, making it tough to set a proper fire line. Thats in part why the Woolsey Fire jumped the 101 Freeway and Malibu is being evacuated. The perimeter now is the Pacific Ocean, Richardson said.","Both ends of California are on fire.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"Photo Gloria Andruskewicz evacuated her home in Ventura, Calif., on Thursday, as wildfires closed in. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times For the latest news on the wildfires, read our Thursday live updates here. Dangerous wildfires burning around Los Angeles have forced the authorities to tell nearly 200,000 people to flee their homes, some with little time to prepare. It is never too early to plan for a potential evacuation, even if you’re not in an area immediately affected by the flames. Wildfires can quickly travel great distances and move erratically — especially when driven by the wind, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokeswoman, Amy Bastman, said. “I know it can be a scary time, but when it’s time to go, we want to make sure people have all the things they need, all the essentials,” she said. “You don’t know how long you might be away, or whether there will be a home for you to come back to.” Here’s are some suggestions to prepare for such an emergency. Before the fire Make a plan. Families should set a meeting point in case they are not all together at the time of evacuation. Someone should be responsible for grabbing the emergency kit from home. Designate an out-of-area friend or contact, and let that person know that the family is evacuating, and to where. If family members are separated, or phone systems are overloaded, sending a text message to the contact might be the only way to let others know you are safe. Map at least two evacuation routes. Prepare an emergency supply kit. Think beyond a flashlight, batteries, and food and water, Ms. Bastman said. “It’s like imagining you’re going on a camping trip for a week,” she said. “What things would you have to take with you?” Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency, recommends gathering a three-day supply of nonperishable food and three gallons of water per person. Also pack a change of clothes, prescription medications, and extra eyeglasses or contact lenses. If you have pets, do not forget about pet food and medication. “In the Northern California fires, a lot of people didn’t have a pack all ready,” said Brandi Richard, public affairs officer for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “Having those basic things that we discussed in a bag that you can just take with you really quickly is important.” Identify irreplaceable family photos, jewelry or heirlooms, and make room for them in the evacuation kit as well. Keep important documents together. Gather birth certificates, property titles, insurance records and other crucial paperwork. In addition to being difficult to replace, some of the documents could be needed to file claims with insurers or FEMA after the fire. Keeping a digital copy of the files, either on a hard drive in the emergency kit or available online, is also wise. Families that have time to plan might consider sending older photos and videos to an outside company to scan and transfer to a DVD, suggested Julie Sanchez, a New York Times reader who lives in Santa Maria, on California’s Central Coast. The DVD can then be stored in a bank safety-deposit box. “We’ve been doing that in my family for a while,” Ms. Sanchez, 56, said. “That usually seems to be the major thing that people want to save. Those are the irreplaceables.” When the fire approaches Prepare your home. If you have time, remove flammable items like wood piles, brush and propane tanks at least 30 feet away from your house. Patio furniture and umbrellas should also be placed at the same distance. Attach garden hoses to spigots to give firefighters a water source if they need it, but don’t turn the water on. Shut all windows and doors, but leave them unlocked once you evacuate, so firefighters can get in. Turn on outdoor lights so firefighters can see the house through the smoke. Shut off the gas at the meter, and turn off the air-conditioning. Fuel up. Keep the family car topped off with gas to avoid any delays. Go to the ATM. Cash is key after emergencies. Keep your credit cards handy, too. Tune in to local media. There is no better source for information on evacuation orders, routes and shelters, Ms. Richard said. “Monitoring their websites is really important, because as things come in, they’re sharing them on social media,” she said. She recommended following the emergency management agencies for Ventura and Los Angeles counties. Once you decide to evacuate You don’t need to wait for an order. If your home is threatened by fire and you’re able to leave, “there’s no need to wait for warnings,” Ms. Bastman said. “History shows us that those who leave the earliest often fare the best,” she said. That is especially true in densely populated Los Angeles, she added, where roads are jammed and firefighters have little space to move. When you decide to leave, dress in pants, long sleeves and sturdy shoes. A bandanna can help shield your face from smoke. Grab your electronics. Cellphones, personal computers, backup hard drives and chargers should all go into the car, along with the emergency kit, personal documents, family keepsakes, cash and credit cards. Don’t forget the pets. They will be scared. Be smart in the car. Close your windows and use recirculated air-conditioning. Tune in to local radio to hear about safe routes, or follow those identified by the California Department of Transportation or Los Angeles Department of Transportation.

"Michael Waters on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Jose Herrada, an inmate at Floridas Gulf Correctional Institution, first heard news about Hurricane Michael on the radio. Initially, Herrada thought little of it. Although the state of Florida had issued a mandatory evacuation order for nearby Panama City and surrounding areas, officials at Gulf CI hadnt brought up the possibility of evacuating the prisons 1,500 inmates. Herrada assumed that meant he would be safe. We thought [the hurricane] was not coming close when they did not evacuate us, Herrada told Earther by email. If officials at Gulf CI reached a similar conclusion, they were dead wrong. The prison took a direct hit from Hurricane Michael as the historically-powerful storm surged across the Florida Panhandle on October 10th. The damage to was immediate: The facility lost power, and phone lines stopped working. Water started flooding in through cracks along the windows. The wind was so strong that it cleaved off several dormitory roofs and a section of the perimeter fence, according to Herrada and The Miami Herald, and inmates had to rush to keep their belongings dry as water flooded in. Buzzfeed reported that many dorm rooms were destroyed and that some windows were entirely blown off. We were scared, Herrada told Earther. Most of us are scarred emotionally. I myself have nightmares. Although the Florida Department of Corrections evacuated six prisons prior to Hurricane Michaels arrival, Gulf CI is one of a number in the path of the storm were not evacuated in advance. Four days after the storm, on October 14th, Gulf CI and other hard-hit prisons were fully evacuated until further damage assessment can be completed, per the department. Michelle Glady, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Corrections, told Earther the department makes determinations about what facilities should be evacuated in the best interest of public, staff and inmate safety based on wind speed, flooding history, building age, road safety, and other factors. Glady added that much like many North Florida communities, our facilities sustained damage but, in all prisons, our staff and inmates were safe, and no one was injured during the storm. Herrada takes a different view. They took a gamble with our lives, he told Earther. In recent years, a spate of mishandled hurricanes has exposed the failures of the U.S. prison system to account for those it incarcerates during natural disasters. The problem was on full display during the two most destructive hurricanes of 2018. A month before Michael, in September, Hurricane Florence bore down on the Carolinas. While North Carolina and Virginia evacuated prisons under threat, the South Carolina Department of Corrections refused to evacuate facilities that lay within high-risk zones. And climate change, which expected to produce bigger and deadlier storms, could place already-vulnerable incarcerated people in even greater danger. Thats not only because their personal safety is consistently ignored during storms, but also because prisons themselves are often at greater risk from hurricanes than other housing structures. According to Yale researcher Hannah Hauptman, who mapped out prison geographies in a recent paper, prisons are disproportionately located on low-lying land that remains vulnerable to storm impacts, in part because many U.S. prisons are former slave plantations. The state approves of and constructs prisons significantly closer to dangerous floodplains than it does for other forms of settlement, Hauptman notes. Even today, private companies sometimes fail to consider storm risks when choosing the locations for new prisons. Washingtons Northwest Detention Center, which opened in 2004, houses up to 1,575 immigrants in one of the nations riskiest tsunami zones. In the event of a tsunami, according to The Seattle Globalist, the prison will fill with as much as two meters of water in less than eight minutes. (Northwest Detention Center did not immediately return Earthers request for comment.) We tend not to prioritize the needs of people who are incarcerated, Keramet Reiter, a professor of criminology at the University of California Irvine School of Social Ecology, told Earther. In a disaster they are maybe the last priority. The problem is deeply entrenched, beginning with the fact that many prisons do not even have clearly stated emergency evacuation plans during natural disasters, and there is no state or national requirement that they do, as noted in a recent paper by Columbia Law student William Omorogieva. (Some states require other forms of emergency planning, but none mandates plans specific to natural disasters.) Shaundra Young Scott, director of the ACLU in South Carolina, told Earther that part of the issue is funding. Evacuations are expensive, and in South Carolina, where the state has already slashed mental health programs in its prisons in the last eight years, its pretty clear the state legislature is loath to spend money on prisoners, and quite frankly, they arent worried about evacuation because they dont care about prisoners. When voters also tend to lack empathy for people in prison, there is no political will to change the system. Reports of inmates stranded by devastating hurricanes date back to at least 1937, when the Kentucky state reformatory broke into riots after days without drinking water. Following Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans prisoners who were not evacuated smashed windows to let air in as the floodwaters rose, and they lit their shirts on fire so aid workers would know they were trapped. Last year, during Hurricane Harvey, Houston inmates in multiple prisons were left in cells flooded knee-high with water contaminated by urine and feces without enough food or drinking water, according to The Nation. Texas inmate Deidre McDonald wrote for The Marshall Project about waking up to the sound of thunder cracking and officers screaming for everyone to get to the second floor the morning that Harvey made landfall. Though the state had issued an evacuation warning for Dickinson, Texas, where she was held, the prison did not relocate the group of predominantly disabled inmates living there. McDonald noted that her prisonlike so many otherswas structurally unequipped for a dangerous hurricane: Given the way the Texas Department of Criminal Justice built this place, the sidewalks overflow during even the lightest rain, creating a constant slip-and-fall hazard for the predominantly disabled offender population here, McDonald wrote. We tend not to prioritize the needs of people who are incarcerated. In a disaster they are maybe the last priority. Last year, after Hurricane Irma struck her 700-person Miami prison, Homestead Correctional Institute, inmate Natalie Price went two weeks without power. Around her, people were crammed three to a room. Two inches of water lined the floors, Price told Earther, and more leaked in through the walls. All things considered, Price feels the prison administration handled things well for our state emergencymost of the problems, she said, came not from the administration but from the old age of the buildings, which were prone to leaks. Most of the families of inmates around her also didnt understand what was happening, according to Price. Although the state notified them that the Homestead Correctional Institute would be evacuated, it never was. This fall, even Florida prisons located further from the shore than Gulf CIlike Apalachee Correctional Institution, which houses up to 1,300 peoplefelt the effects of Hurricane Michael. Michael Henderson, an inmate at Apalachee CI, told Earther that the prison is so old that even before Hurricane Michael, some windows were broken or outright missing. When the storm arrived, rain rushed in through the open windows, and inmates scrambled to salvage their belongings. For some of us, like myself that meant vital legal work that if destroyed would have left me at a major disadvantage, Henderson said. Yet the worst part was not the flooding itself but the unrest after. Inmates were stuck in lockdown and unable to leave their dorms, Henderson said, recalling that they ate only cold sandwiches served at odd hours. On October 14th, four days after Hurricane Michael, the dorm across from Hendersons broke into a full on free for all that resulted in officers armed with tactical gear detaining inmates. About thirty men were removed and taken to confinement or transferred, Henderson said. (Apalachee CI did not respond to Earthers request for comment on this incident, but verified a near riot over food to the Florida Times Union in October.) The officials knew this hurricane was coming and did little to prepare, Henderson added. The systemic failures of the prison system to account for the people it incarcerates during major storms has not escaped the notice of inmates. Before a hurricane, more experienced inmates often warn newer ones about the unique dangers they face. Back at Gulf CI, Shamar McCullum, another inmate, calls this the talk. McCullum told Earther that a group of older inmates sat him and others down before the storm and warned them that officers may leave to save themselves; that after the hurricane, each person should eat light; and that each inmate should save his most valuable property because it may get flooded out. (According to McCullum, the last two concerns proved to be true.) McCullum also told Earther that, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Michael, he had little access to drinking water because the pipes burst. Food came infrequentlyon the third day, he was fed only one meal. McCullum recalls that when an inmate asked an officer when their meal was coming, the officer responded, Better hope you even get feed at all. Thats when I knew it was not looking good for us, McCullum said. Inmates who asked to be seen by nurses were refused and threatened with disciplinary reports because of the lockdown, according to McCullum. He and the other inmates had no way of communicating with their families, though Gulf CI did relay a message that everyone was OK, McCullum said. They spent long days sitting in their cells without possibility of leaving. When presented with these allegations the Florida Department of Corrections told Earther that although it could not confirm or deny individual claims, all inmates had access to food and drinkable water and medical needs were addressed and prioritized, and inmates have access to routine care. Only two days after Hurricane Michael made landfall, Gulf CI was reduced to such disrepair that the first set of inmates were finally evacuated. Adam Baird, a Gulf CI inmate, said that when the evacuation order finally came, many inmates had gone a day without food. 50 or 60 officers came in around 10:30 pm and told everyone to grab their toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, and deodorant, and tie the rest of our property in a sheet and leave it in the cell, Baird told Earther, recalling the evacuation. McCullum, for one, was relieved. Now that it is all over I still find myself day dreaming about just how bad things could have been if I stayed one more day at that place, he said. What I and the others went through is a experience I dont want anybody thats locked up to go through because officers dont care about inmates, especially at the time of a hurricane. McCullum and the other Gulf CI inmates have been moved to a patchwork of neighboring prisons, including Mayo CI and the Northwest Florida Reception Center. They do not know whenor ifthey will return to Gulf, but because of the damage, they dont expect it will be anytime soon. (Maintenance crews are currently working on repairs, according to the Florida Department of Corrections.) Whether their experiences will propel policy changes remains to be seen. Some researchers, like Omorogieva of Columbia Law, have proposed that FEMA create a special coordinator for incarcerated populations who could craft new requirements to evacuate inmates during natural disasters. There is even a mechanism for doing this: Congress could expand the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, which created a Disability Coordinator within FEMA, to also address the needs of incarcerated people. But that requires political will. And although during this years National Prison Strike incarcerated activists highlighted the importance of environmental issues, and a disparate group of protesters convened outside the South Carolina State House to demand evacuations during Hurricane Florence, few lawmakers have even acknowledged the risks that incarcerated populations face during major storms.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"California is entering its sixth day battling dangerous wildfires. They have been driven by extreme weather conditions: low humidity, high winds and parched ground. Authorities issued a purple alert - the highest level warning - amid what it called ""extremely critical fire weather"". Fanned by high winds, six large fires, and other smaller blazes, swept through tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours. About 5,700 firefighters have been battling the fires, with many drafted in from neighbouring states to help. The Thomas fire in Ventura County is the largest, and has destroyed more than 430 buildings. Nearly 200,000 residents were evacuated from their homes, with many forced to flee in the middle of the night as the flames rapidly spread. Three firefighters have been injured and hundreds of buildings destroyed. One death was reported after a 70-year-old woman was found dead in her car on an evacuation route. Satellite imagery shows the vast Thomas Fire, north of Los Angeles, which has spread as far as the Pacific coast. US President Donald Trump issued a state of emergency in response to the fires. There are fears the blaze will hurt California's vast agricultural industry. Much of the state's avocado crop has been destroyed. About 90% of US avocados are grown in California and the industry is worth millions to the economy. The fires have destroyed homes and scorched residential areas. In the wealthy Los Angeles enclave of Bel Air, firefighters were seen removing belongings from luxury homes as the flames spread.

Rod Nickel,"MEXICO BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Search-and-rescue workers scoured a stark scene of devastation on Thursday looking for hundreds of people who defied evacuation orders in Mexico Beach, Florida, “Ground Zero” of Hurricane Michael’s onslaught. Nearly entire blocks of small two-story beach homes were razed to their tile floors, likely by the storm surge. Furniture, dishes and hot water tanks were strewn about roads and yards. Stands of pine were flattened. Army personnel used heavy equipment to push a path through debris to allow rescuers through, as Blackhawk helicopters circled overhead looking for survivors. At least six deaths, including four in Florida, have been blamed on Michael, the third-most powerful hurricane ever to hit the U.S. mainland. The tiny tourist town of Mexico Beach in northwest Florida took a direct hit from Michael’s 155-mph (250-kph) top sustained winds and a storm surge of up to 9 feet (2.7 meters). Mexico Beach’s city administrator said on Wednesday that 285 of the town’s 1,000 or so residents had defied evacuation orders. “We survived the wind and rain,” said Terry Fuller, 57, who works at a rental car business and stayed through the hurricane. “It was like being in a car wash for an hour and a half.” Tom Adams, 65, runs a charter fishing business. But his two boats have disappeared with Michael. “Right at the end, it got very tough,” he said. “It was the tornadoes more than anything.” For rescuers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, searching for survivors brought special challenges. On Thursday, supported by dogs, drones and GPS devices, they found homes in places where they were not a day before, making it difficult to do a methodical house-to-house survey. “We prepare for the worst and hope for the best. This is obviously the worst,” said Stephanie Palmer, 48, a firefighter and FEMA rescuer from Coral Springs, Florida. “All the training we do doesn’t remove the human part of us. My heart goes out to these people.” One FEMA rescuer stopped to help Bianna Kelsey, 56, out of a house that served as the office to a family construction business. She returned on Thursday to pick up family photos and needed help from FEMA to open the front door to get out. The hurricane had turned the house sideways off its foundation, scrambling its contents. Afterward, she sat in the shade and broke down. “I know, but we can rebuild it,” a FEMA rescuer said, putting his arm around her. FEMA has no idea of the likelihood of rescuers finding survivors, or bodies, said spokesman Ignatius Carroll. “We can’t search every pile of rubble.” Reporting by Rod Nickel and Devika Krishna Kumar; Editing by Bill Tarrant and Peter Cooney","Search-and-rescue workers scoured a stark scene of devastation on Thursday looking for hundreds of people who defied evacuation orders in Mexico Beach, Florida, ""Ground Zero"" of Hurricane Michael's onslaught.",2018-10-11T21:09:21Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Rescuers look for survivors after Michael obliterates Florida beach town,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-michael-devastation/rescuers-look-for-survivors-after-michael-obliterates-florida-beach-town-idUSKCN1ML2XI,https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png,reuters,Reuters,evacuation,1
Devika  Krishna Kumar,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (Reuters) - Hurricane Michael strengthened into a Category 4 storm early on Wednesday before it was expected to plow into Florida’s Gulf shore with towering waves and roof-shredding winds as 500,000 people were under evacuation orders and advisories. Hurricane Michael was packing winds of up to 130 miles per hour (210 km per hour), hours before it was set to make landfall on Florida’s Panhandle or Florida’s Big Bend where it potentially could unleash devastating waves as high as 13 feet (4 meters), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned. “THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE to evacuate before conditions start deteriorating within the next few hours,” said Florida Governor Rick Scott in a Tweet early on Wednesday. President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for the entire state of Florida, freeing up federal assistance to supplement state and local disaster responses. Michael gathered greater strength over warm Gulf of Mexico waters throughout the day on Tuesday as it jumped from a Category 2 to Category 3 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson wind scale. The last NHC report said the fast-moving storm was about 180 miles (325 km) from Panama City, Florida. Winds as strong as Michael is producing can inflict substantial damage to roofs and walls of even well-constructed homes, according to the National Weather Service. NHC Director Ken Graham said Michael represented a “textbook case” of a hurricane system growing stronger as it drew near shore, in contrast to Hurricane Florence, which struck North Carolina last month after weakening in a slow, halting approach. Hurricane-force winds extend about 45 miles from the center, with tropical storm-force winds reaching 175 miles, the NHC said. The storm is likely to dump prodigious amounts of rain over Florida, Alabama and Georgia, as well as the Carolinas - still reeling from post-Florence flooding - and into Virginia. Up to a foot of rainfall (30 cm) is forecast for some areas. The region should brace for “major infrastructure damage,” specifically to electricity distribution, wastewater treatment systems and transportation networks, Jeff Byard, associate administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), told reporters on a conference call. Byard said an estimated 500,000 people were under evacuation orders and advisories in Florida, where residents and tourists were fleeing low-lying areas in at least 20 counties stretching along 200 miles (322 km) of shore in the Panhandle and adjacent Big Bend region. Among them was Betty Early, 75, a retiree who joined about 300 fellow evacuees huddled on makeshift bedrolls of blankets and collapsed cardboard boxes at an elementary school converted into an American Red Cross shelter in Panama City, near the storm’s expected landfall. She was unsure how well her old, wood-framed apartment block would hold up. “I’m blessed to have a place to come,” she told Reuters. “My greatest concern is not having electricity, and living on a fixed income, losing my food.” “THIS STORM COULD KILL YOU” A hurricane warning was posted along more than 300 miles (483 km) of the coast from the Florida-Alabama border south to the Suwannee River. “If you don’t follow warnings from officials this storm could kill you,” said Scott, a Republican running for the U.S. Senate in November’s congressional elections. While the swiftly moving storm is not expected to linger over Florida for long, widespread heavy downpours will likely track inland to flood-stricken areas of the Carolinas even as rain-gorged rivers there begin to recede, National Weather Service meteorologist Ken Widelski told the conference call. Some of the storm’s most significant early impact was to offshore energy production. U.S. producers in the Gulf cut oil production by about 40 percent and natural gas output by 28 percent on Tuesday, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. Scott declared a state of emergency in 35 Florida counties, mostly encompassing rural areas known for small tourist cities, beaches, wildlife reserves and Tallahassee, the state capital. Georgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency on Tuesday for 92 counties in his state. About 2,500 National Guard troops were deployed to assist with evacuations and storm preparations, and more than 4,000 others were on standby. Some 17,000 utility restoration workers were also on call. In Panhandle counties, most state offices, schools and universities were closed for the rest of the week. Lines at gasoline stations grew as people left. Those who stayed emptied grocery store shelves of water and other supplies. The last major hurricane to hit the Panhandle was Hurricane Dennis in 2005, according to hurricane center data. Torrential downpours and flash flooding from the storm over the weekend caused 13 deaths in Central America.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"LOS ANGELES — Fires continued to ravage much of Southern California on Friday, as fast-moving flames scorched more than 159,000 acres across four counties, blackening the air and forcing closures of schools and roadways. In San Diego County, where a small grass fire that broke out Thursday morning had grown by night to 4,100 acres, residents near Bonsall and Oceanside scrambled to heed evacuation orders. At least six people were injured, and at least 20 structures destroyed. Brian Jones, a concrete contractor from Bonsall, dropped off his horses at the county fairgrounds after fleeing his home. “I didn’t want to leave,” Mr. Jones said. And then the flames “started coming over the ridge, right at the edge of our development, and it was ‘Oh, boy — time to go.’” Evacuation orders were lifted late Thursday in parts of Los Angeles and Riverside Counties, but the situation remained dire in Ventura County, where 132,000 acres had burned and more than 430 structures were destroyed. That fire, just 10 percent contained, threatened to cross on Friday into Santa Barbara County, where new evacuations had been ordered. Here’s the latest: • A fire near Murrieta, in Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, has burned about 300 acres. Seven buildings were destroyed, officials said, and the fire was 10 percent contained. • The threat was so severe that for the first time, state officials used the highest category in their color-coded fire hazard warning system. They painted much of Southern California purple on Thursday, for extreme danger, and many people received warnings to be ready to flee. Here’s what to do when you’re preparing to evacuate. • Late Thursday, with the fire that began in Ventura threatening scores of homes, Gov. Jerry Brown extended a state of emergency declaration to Santa Barbara County. He also requested an emergency declaration from the president that would make it easier for federal aid to reach Southern California. • Some residents who were forced to evacuate their homes because of the fires in the San Fernando Valley and in Bel-Air were told they could return on Thursday night. • Eric M. Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, said late Thursday that he was not aware of any deaths connected to the Los Angeles fires. (Want to get California Today, our daily newsletter on the state, by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Graphic Wildfires burned near and in Los Angeles and other parts of Southern California, forcing thousands to evacuate. An official warns of a ‘very dangerous’ time in San Diego County. The fire near Bonsall in San Diego County ignited on Thursday and within hours spread to more than 4,000 acres with zero containment. Many parts of the Bonsall area were under evacuation orders, and officials encouraged residents with livestock to take their animals to the county fairgrounds. The area is known for its equestrian facilities. Ron Lane, San Diego County’s deputy chief administrative officer, said a large portion of a mobile home park had been destroyed, along with other houses in the Bonsall area. “This is a very dangerous period of time we’re going through in the County of San Diego over the next 24, 48 hours,” Mr. Lane said. “We have to be resilient.” A couple escapes the flames in Ventura on bicycles. Evacuees have also been talking refuge at the county fairgrounds in Ventura. Among them on Thursday was Patricia Hampton, 48, who lost her home near Ventura’s City Hall on Tuesday night. Ms. Hampton said that she and her boyfriend had gone to bed unaware of the approaching calamity. “I wasn’t feeling well and so I went to lie down,” she said. “We woke up in the dark hearing helicopters and what we thought was rain pelting the roof,” she said. The rain turned out to be embers, ash and debris falling as the fire raged across Ventura. The couple got on bicycles in the black of night, the glow of the fire as their only source of light, and rode toward the fairgrounds. “I got out with clothes on me and the bikes and that’s it,” she said. “I don’t know what we’ll do next,” she added. “I really couldn’t say.” Video In Bel-Air, a chance to return home. By Thursday night, several top local and state officials said they were encouraged by improving conditions in the city and county of Los Angeles. And as a result, officials announced that some Angelenos would be allowed to return home starting Thursday evening. The focus in the Bel-Air hills had turned to digging out burning embers and cooling down any hot spots that could easily ignite. It was easy to see how quickly the neighborhood could go up in flames: sprawling estates on narrow streets were surrounded by towering elms and bitterly dry pine needles. Blackened embers of tree trunks had tumbled down — one had hit a firefighter and burned him around the neck. Many of the towering iron gates that guard the mansions had been broken open by firefighters who needed to get to the slopes burning below. Some driveways were covered with splatters of pink from the fire retardant that had been dumped from aircraft above. Captain Brian Ferreira, a firefighter from Oakland, had helped mop-up on a hillside near a winery owned by the media mogul Rupert Murdoch. While small patches of the hillside and the wine storage had suffered some damage, most of the winery seemed fine, he said. “Rupert will be glad to hear that, he paid a lot of money for that property,” said Hugh Siegman, 71, who lives just above the winery. Mr. Siegman and his wife returned to their undamaged home Thursday morning, before the evacuation had been lifted. “I would rather be here and be vigilant myself and get these guys to help if they need it,” he said.

This latest incident came on the heels of two other fires and an explosion earlier this week.
I have been provided with a preliminary briefing on last nights fire and thankfully none of the camp occupants or first responders sustained any injuries in this fire. The fire department is conducting their investigation on the cause of the fire, said Mayor Mike Morden in a statement.
I want to make it very clear that I, and all members of council, share the citizens concerns for the safety of the camp occupants, the surrounding neighbourhood and our front line responders.
All of those incidents occurring despite the city enforcing a court injunction last weekend removing nearly 100 propane tanks and other fire hazards.
Part of the focus of that injunction was seeking out dangerous heat sources and for exactly this reason there have been major concerns over those propane tanks inside tents onsite.
Officers are back on scene Friday morning, monitoring the situation and keeping the peace.

Mount Agung has been hurling clouds of white and dark gray ash about 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) into the atmosphere since the weekend and lava is welling up in the crater, sometimes reflected as a reddish-yellow glow in the ash plumes. Its explosions can be heard about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) away. Videos released by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency showed a mudflow of volcanic debris and water known as a lahar moving down the volcano's slopes. It said lahars could increase because it's rainy season and warned people to stay away from rivers. The agency raised the volcano's alert to the highest level early Monday and expanded the danger zone to 10 kilometers (6 miles) in places from the previous 7.5 kilometers. It said that a larger eruption is possible. Spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference in Jakarta that the extension of the danger zone affects 22 villages and about 90,000 to 100,000 people. He said about 40,000 people have evacuated but others have not left because they feel safe or don't want to abandon their livestock. ""Authorities will comb the area to persuade them,"" he said. ""If needed we will forcibly evacuate them."" About 25,000 people were already living in evacuation centers after an increase in tremors from the mountain in September sparked an evacuation. Lava rising in the crater ""will certainly spill over to the slopes,"" Sutopo said. The volcano's last major eruption in 1963 killed about 1,100 people. Villager Putu Sulasmi said she fled with her husband and other family members to a sports hall that's serving as an evacuation center. ""We came here on motorcycles. We had to evacuate because our house is just 3 miles from the mountain. We were so scared with the thundering sound and red light,"" she said. The family had stayed at the same sports center in September and October when the volcano's alert was at the highest level for several weeks but didn't erupt. They had returned to their village about a week ago. ""If it has to erupt let it erupt now rather than leaving us in uncertainty. I'll just accept it if our house is destroyed,"" she said. Bali's airport was closed early Monday after ash, which can pose a deadly threat to aircraft, reached its airspace. Flight information boards showed rows of cancelations as tourists arrived at the busy airport expecting to catch flights home. Airport spokesman Air Ahsanurrohim said 445 flights were canceled, stranding about 59,000 travelers. The closure is in effect until Tuesday morning though officials said the situation will be reviewed every six hours. Bali is Indonesia's top tourist destination, with its gentle Hindu culture, surf beaches and lush green interior attracting about 5 million visitors a year. Some flights to and from Bali were canceled on Saturday and Sunday but most had continued to operate normally as the towering ash clouds were moving east toward the neighboring island of Lombok. ""We now have to find a hotel and spend more of our money that they're not going to cover us for when we get home unfortunately,"" said Canadian tourist Brandon Olsen who was stranded at Bali's airport with his girlfriend. Indonesia's Directorate General of Land Transportation said 100 buses were being deployed to Bali's international airport and to ferry terminals to help travelers stranded by the eruption of Mount Agung. The agency's chief, Budi, said major ferry crossing points have been advised to prepare for a surge in passengers and vehicles. Stranded tourists could leave Bali by taking a ferry to neighboring Java and then travel by land to the nearest airports. Indonesia's tourism ministry said member hotels of the Indonesia Hotel and Restaurant Association will provide a night's free accommodation to people affected by the airport closure. Ash has settled on villages and resorts around the volcano and soldiers and police distributed masks on the weekend. In Karangasem district that surrounds the volcano, tourists stopped to watch the towering plumes of ash as children made their way to school. Indonesia sits on the ""Pacific Ring of Fire"" and has more than 120 active volcanoes. Mount Agung's alert status was raised to the highest level in September following a dramatic increase in tremors from the mountain, which prompted more than 140,000 people to leave the area. The alert was lowered on Oct. 29 after a decrease in activity but about 25,000 people remained in evacuation centers. ___ Wright reported from Jakarta.

Rollo Ross,"REDDING, Calif. (Reuters) - The “fire tornado” that ripped through Northern California last week forced residents to flee their homes chaotically, many with their pets and little else, people sheltering in Red Cross evacuation centers said. The blaze, the seventh most destructive in California history, roared suddenly into Redding and adjacent communities after being whipped by gale-force winds into a fire storm that jumped the Sacramento River. The erratic blaze forced 38,000 people from their homes. Most of them are staying at hotels or with friends and relatives. But nearly 300 are at Red Cross shelters in the Redding area, including retired firefighter Steven Bailey. Bailey and others at the shelter said the fire’s towering inferno bewildered them. “It’s tough being on the other side. Being on the engine and going in, that was tough but it was a different type of tough when you get told to leave and you don’t know anything, yeah, so it’s different. I don’t wish anyone to have to experience (it).” Rob McDonald said he left his home in Shasta County hoping the fire would not make it up the hill where he lives, taking only a few personal items with him. “Wish I would have grabbed a few other things. I was thinking it wasn’t going to get up there, it was a just ‘in-case’ thing. And it did. And so I’m in limbo, total limbo as to what’s going on up there,” McDonald said. As the fire approached, people grabbed what they could. For many, that included their furry friends. Volunteers set up a special hall at the Shasta College evacuation center to cater for people with pets, not only dogs and cats but also rats, pot-bellied pigs and a giant tortoise. Frank Williams, who managed to bring his dogs but had to leave his pet birds behind, was emotional when recalling how noisy the animals were when they arrived last Friday. “I can tell you about how quiet it was last night, after the animals being stressed from when we got in here on Friday. You could have heard a pin drop, finally, last night because all the animals were dead tired from barking,” Williams said. Wildfire evacuations have become a fact of life in California, which is bearing the brunt of an extreme run of wildfires across the U.S. West. At least 10,000 people have been dislodged in Mendocino County in California’s wine country from two wildfires. Hundreds were evacuated from the Cranston Fire in Riverside County east of Los Angeles last week. Erratic winds and record high temperatures have fueled blazes that blackened nearly 410,000 acres in California, the state’s highest year-to-date level in a decade.

 Cyclone Oma hit Queensland in February, bringing severe flooding
It is only the second time in history that two cyclones are predicted to strike the country at the same time. 
Having already lashed the far north of Queensland, Tropical Cyclone Trevor is expected to hit the communities of Numbulwa and Borroloola in the Northern Territory on Saturday morning. 
The storm could bring a year's worth of rain in just a couple of days.

In the biggest ever evacuation ahead of a cyclone, people living in its the path have moved into tented sites in Darwin and Katherine. 
Emergency services and the military were called in to rescue residents from the island of Groote Eylandt, off the north coast on Thursday. 
The last evacuation of a similar scale was for Tropical Cyclone Tracy, which killed 49 people in Darwin in 1974. 
Cyclone Veronica is due to hit the northwest coast of Australia between Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning. 
Very strong gusts are expected and the Bureau of Meteorology in Western Australia said a ""severe impact"" is likely. 
In the mining town of Port Headland, where the storm is set to strike first, supermarkets have been stripped bare as residents stockpile in preparation, ABC News reported.

Fanned by winds, the resurgent Thomas fire now threatens the coastal city of Santa Barbara and nearby Carpinteria. Firefighters earlier reported progress in containing the blaze, said to have devastated an area the size of Chicago. But while other fires hitting the state are largely controlled, the Thomas fire is just 15% contained. Image copyright NASA/EPA Image caption Satellite imagery shows the vast Thomas Fire, north of Los Angeles, which has spread as far as the Pacific coast ""The winds are kind of squirrely right now,"" Santa Barbara county fire spokesman Mike Eliason was quoted by the Associated Press as saying. ""Some places the smoke is going straight up in the air, and others it's blowing sideways. Depends on what canyon we're in."" Evacuation orders were issued overnight for parts of Carpinteria close to Los Padres National Forest, about 100 miles (160km) northwest of Los Angeles. Forecasters said wind speeds were expected to increase throughout the day, before dying down again overnight. The local fire department tweeted pictures of a wall of flames advancing on homes on the outskirts of Carpinteria early on Sunday morning. Meanwhile, actor Rob Lowe, who lives in Santa Barbara, a city of close to 100,000 people, tweeted that he was praying for his town as fires closed in. ""Firefighters making brave stands. Could go either way. Packing to evacuate now,"" Lowe added. California has spent the past seven days battling wildfires. Six large blazes, and other smaller ones, erupted on Monday night in southern California. Fanned by high winds, they swept through tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours, driven by extreme weather, including low humidity and parched ground. The authorities issued a purple alert - the highest level warning - amid what it called ""extremely critical fire weather"", while US President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency. Media caption Large parts of southern California have been affected On Saturday, California Governor Jerry Brown described the situation as ""the new normal"" and predicted vast fires, fuelled by climate change, ""could happen every year or every few years"". The current fires have forced the evacuation of some 200,000 people across the state, and seen more than 800 structures destroyed. Several firefighters have been injured, but only one person has died - a 70-year-old woman who was found dead in her car on an evacuation route. There are also fears the blaze will seriously hit California's multi-million dollar agricultural industry.

Mallory Locklear,"Here's what seems to have gone down. Two individuals were playing Call of Duty and got into an argument online over a game with a $1.50 wager. One of them, a person with the Twitter handle @SWauTistic, threatened to swat user @7aLeNT. The latter then provided an address that wasn't actually their own in response to the threat. Shortly thereafter, @SWauTistic allegedly called in the false report, which led to a police response at the provided address. Andrew Finch, who lived at the address, reportedly went to the front door in response to the commotion and was shot. ""As he came to the front door, one of our officers discharged his weapon,"" said Livingston. The police haven't said whether Finch had a weapon at the time, but his family has said there were no guns in the house. The officer who fired the shot is a seven-year department veteran who will be put on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. Once the story began attracting media coverage, @SWauTistic tweeted that the house he swatted was on the news, which was then followed by a tweet saying he didn't get anyone killed because he wasn't the person who shot Finch. KrebsOnSecurity reports that the individual then changed his Twitter handle to @GoredTutor36, but not before KrebsOnSecurity got its hands on weeks' worth of the original account's tweets. The person behind the account has claimed credit for a number of swatting hoaxes and other threats including one that led to the evacuation of the Dallas Convention Center earlier this month, a bomb threat at a Florida high school in November and the threat that caused the FCC to pause its net neutrality vote a couple of weeks ago. In direct message conversations with KrebsOnSecurity, the person running @GoredTutor36 said that they had remorse over Finch's death but that they would not be turning themselves in. ""People will eventually (most likely those who know me) tell me to turn myself in or something. I can't do that; though I know its [sic] morally right. I'm too scared admittedly,"" they wrote. They also said, ""Bomb threats are more fun and cooler than swats in my opinion and I should have just stuck to that. But I began making $ doing some swat requests."" The person also noted that the thrill of such hoaxes ""comes from having to hide from police via net connections.""

"Colin Atagi, Nicole Hayden","The Cranston Fire in the Idyllwild area of the San Jacinto Mountains began on Wednesday, July 25, 2018. Palm Springs Desert Sun Firefighters knock down hot spots along HWY 74 on Thursday, July 26, 2018 during the Cranston Fire. (Photo: Richard Lui/The Desert Sun) Buy Photo Two firefighters helping to battle the Cranston Fire have been injured, while a second blaze, the Ribbon Fire, which popped up Thursday morning about 25 miles from the Cranston, is prompting evacuation warnings that could send those who comply to a newly established shelter at Palm Desert High School, according to information updates issued by officials late Thursday. No details were released about how the firefighters were injured or the extent of their injuries, but theirs are the first and, so far, the only injuries reported as a result of either blaze. Mandatory evacuations due to the Cranston Fire have forced as many as 6,000 people from homes in a number of San Jacinto Mountain communities. More than 4,900 structures are now being threatened by the blaze, which grew to 7,500 acres Thursday and was 5 percent contained, according to the U.S. Forest Service- San Bernardino National Forest. As a result of the Ribbon Fire, which grew to 200 acres and was 5 percent contained Thursday night, evacuation warnings were in place for the communities of Alpine Village, Pinyon Crest and Pinyon Pines, according to CAL FIRE/Riverside County Fire Department. In anticipation of some residents complying with the warnings, a Care &amp; Reception Center has been set up at Palm Desert High, 74910 Aztec Road, according to a tweet from the Riverside County Emergency Management Department. No word on how many people have left their homes because of the Ribbon Fire, but CAL FIRE said ""the evacuation warning will be re-evaluated"" Friday. On Thursday, Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency that enables state and Riverside County authorities to take extraordinary measures to fight the Cranston Fire. Brown's move gives the state latitude in buying and moving equipment and providing assistance to the county in fighting the Cranston Fire. In addition, the public was given a breather in common matters like license renewals and unemployment insurance until the fire's impact is resolved. Standing on an overpass along California Highway 243 near Idyllwild, overlooking the canyon below, passers-by could see layers of fire movement on Thursday – the now-skeletal trees that were lush with life just a day earlier were draped in layers of bright pink fire retardant, which also covered nearby homes and other vegetation. As the day wore on, the horizon began to glow as the fire spread, cresting over Tahquitz Peak. Helicopters whirled above while sirens screamed through the streets. As flare-up fires crept closer to the roads, the crackling of flames could be heard before they were seen. With the wildfire raging in their backyard, Idyllwild residents and business owners were paying close attention to any information updates. The area's downtown appears to have escaped the Cranston Fire, but while the fire still burns nothing is certain. More than 1,000 firefighters remained on the scene Thursday, battling a fire that spans nearly 12 square miles, as the day's temperatures teetered into the triple digits. Eight structures had been destroyed, officials said. Brandon N. McGlover, 32, of Temecula has been arrested on suspicion of starting multiple fires in southwest Riverside County, including the Cranston Fire. He is jailed on $1 million bail. (Photo: Courtesy CAL FIRE) Brandon N. McGlover, 32, of Temecula, remains jailed with bail set at $1 million. He is accused of setting the Cranston Fire and others in southwest Riverside County, officials said. McGlover was arrested shortly after noon Wednesday on suspicion of five counts of arson, five counts of arson to an inhabited structure and three counts of maliciously setting a fire. He is being held in the Robert Presley Detention Center in Riverside, according to jail records, which also state that he is expected to appear in court in Murrieta Friday. More: Arson suspect Brandon N. McGlover cited twice in past year for driving infractions More: Cranston Fire: When the fire started on Wednesday The Cranston Fire damaged two miles of Southern California Edison power lines, causing electrical outages in Anza and surrounding unincorporated areas in Riverside County. The Anza Electric Cooperative will host a town hall Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Anza Community Hall to discuss the outages, solicit feedback on community needs and provide information on the availability of backup generators, cooling centers and regional clean water supply. Authorities noted on Thursday that cellphones and internet connections are or soon will be down because cell towers were without power and their batteries would soon die. Thursday morning, officials with the San Bernardino National Forest added communities to the list of those facing mandatory evacuations: Fern Valley, Pine Cove and Cedar Glen were added to the previously ordered communities of Idyllwild, Apple Canyon, Mountain Center, Lake Hemet and Hurkey Creek. Already, the mandatory evacuations had cleared nearly 5,000 homes of as many as 6,000 people. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway’s Mountain Station was ordered closed by the sheriff’s department due to the Cranston Fire. Those at the Tramway Mountain Station are being transported by tram car to the Valley Station, the service said in a statement. It will remain closed until conditions are deemed safe. Hundreds of firefighters worked since Wednesday, with no respite from the heat in sight. An excessive heat warning that was expected to end Thursday was extended to midnight Friday, according to the National Weather Service. But the Idyllwild community was trying to help the first responders, with some businesses providing food and drinks. La Casita Mexican Restaurant was briefly open for the benefit of firefighters. Staff showed up at 4 a.m. and made 250 breakfast burritos for the first responders. The effort took about 90 minutes. Last Slide Next Slide The Village Market was handing out coffee to firefighters, and workers at the Idyllwild Bake Shop and Brew were rounding up people to help cook breakfast for the firefighters. Fratello's Ristorante &amp; Pizzeria also prepared food for firefighters on Thursday afternoon. ""We all help out each other. That's one of the things about Idyllwild,"" La Casita owner Robert Garcia said. Palm Springs American Legion Post Commander Michael Templeton said Thursday the post was going to open its facilities up to people displaced by the fires who didn't have anywhere else to go. Templeton said the post on Belardo Road didn't have beds or cots, but people were welcome to bring sleeping bags and blankets and stay there. ""We're going to turn the AC up and provide food and comfort,"" he said. ""We're open and going to help in any way we can."" Some hotels also have discounted rates for people who have been forced to evacuate. A group of about 70 children along with staff from an Idyllwild Arts Academy camp evacuated to the Motel 6 in downtown Palm Springs. The group drove down the mountain to Banning High School on Wednesday, where an evacuation center had been set up for residents. The Idyllwild Arts Academy in southwest Idyllwild was evacuated in less than 90 minutes Wednesday and Pamela Jordan, Idyllwild Arts president and head of school, said in a statement all summer school students, staff and faculty have left the hill. “While a few students opted to return home until the summer workshops resume in a few days, most are enjoying the unplanned trip to Palm Springs,” she said. “Local restaurants are catering their meals, and the on-site swimming pool is extremely popular.” Jordan said there has been no loss of school property. She credited firebreaks recently created around the campus and “the quick response of firefighters from all over California and neighboring states” with keeping the campus safe. She said, “We are deeply grateful to the first responders who are taking care of our campus.” But the remaining children, ranging in age from 5 to 18, were in good spirits, Davis said, and may soon be picked up by their parents. No medical assistance was necessary for any student or staff member, Davis said. The students came from China, Germany, Slovakia and other states across the country to attend the camp, he said. The Beaumont Lions Club provided breakfast for the children Thursday morning, and a food bank in Banning provided snacks, fruits and water. There has been no loss of school property, according to Jordan. She credited firebreaks recently created around the campus and “the quick response of firefighters from all over California and neighboring states” with keeping the campus safe. “We are deeply grateful to the first responders who are taking care of our campus,” Jordan said. Downtown Idyllwild was mostly quiet Thursday morning, untouched by the fire. Shops were closed, except for the few using generators. Billowing smoke rose from the surroundings and hand-written ""closed"" signs were posted on businesses. About two dozen cars were parked downtown, along with two fire trucks -- one from Manhattan Beach and one from Redondo Beach. The Red Kettle Restaurant had about 15 people eating breakfast in the morning. Suzanne Coffer, 67, said she has lived in Idyllwild nearly 40 years and knows when to stay and leave. She has been through three similar fires. She dined on oatmeal, toast, fruit and coffee and husband Steven Coffer had pancakes and eggs. At the Village Market, Todd Koetter, 54, of Idyllwild, said he was told to evacuate but has no plans to do so. The fire hasn’t come close to his property, he said. Still, he packed up his car just in case it spreads his way and he needs to get out quickly. He sent his wife and her daughter to safety, but spent Wednesday sitting on his rooftop watching the smoke and the planes buzzing around. “They are doing a great job out there, they drop the water or suppressant and then you see white smoke billow up.” He said while people in Idyllwild tend to keep to themselves, the community really comes together during times like these. More: Smoke advisory extended for Cranston Fire area, including the Coachella Valley Suzanne Coffer said she lives on Deerfoot, near where the fire raged. While some neighbor homes were burned to the ground, hers was not. She said while they didn’t leave town, Wednesday was still traumatic. They quickly began packing when they saw the black smoke head in their direction. They gathered their dogs and belongings and slept in their car in the parking lot of Queen of the Angels Roman Catholic Church. This morning they went back to their home and firefighters let them take a few minutes to walk through, but not stay. Their cats were still inside and safe, but the house was covered in a thick layer of red fire suppressant dropped by airplanes. She said it looked like a thick sheet of red plastic draping their one-story, three-bedroom home. “A couple houses were burned to the ground, ours was just covered in the red suppressant, which is how we know the fire got real close to our home,"" she said. A handful of evacuees had gathered at Banning High School, and the fire was the topic of discussion. ""At that point, it was (about) our lack of information,"" said Idyllwild resident Arena Coulter, who estimated she was joined by about 50 people. ""Mainly, it was just wondering how long we would have to be here."" She added, ""I'm surprised I slept at all."" Her community appeared mostly unscathed as the fire entered its second day. A clear, blue sky hovered above town and residents who opted not to leave could be seen walking around as if nothing happened. Paul Kell, 65, said he has a cabin in Idyllwild. About 2 p.m. Wednesday, Kell’s neighbor told him he needed to evacuate, though smoke and flames were not yet visible. He packed his photos, clothes and art into his trailer and tried to leave. But his trailer became stuck in the loose gravel and he wasn’t able to get it out so he walked a mile to the road with his dog Indy, an 11-year-old female black shepard mix, and waited until someone offered him a ride to Banning. He just had a small backpack with his medicine and dog food. He slept in a grassy area outside of the evacuation center, as they wouldn’t let him in with his dog. “It could be worse,"" he said. ""I’m looking at the horizon and I see white smoke now, which is a good sign. I’m anticipating there not being bad damage to my home.” Kell said he’s hoping he will be told he can go home on Thursday. He said it was a disruptive experience though. “I went from a normal world to an evacuation,” he said. Corinne Kennedy, Natalie Anderson and Palak Barmaiya contributed to this report.

Associated Press,"(MANILA, Philippines) — The Philippines’ most active volcano spewed fountains of lava and massive ash plumes overnight and Tuesday morning after authorities warned a violent eruption may be imminent. Lava fountains reached up to 700 meters (2,300 feet) above Mount Mayon’s crater and ash plumes rose up to 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) during the night and before daybreak, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. An explosive eruption Monday was the most powerful since the volcano started acting up more than a week ago. Disaster officials in Albay province, where Mayon lies, say more than 30,000 people are staying in evacuation centers. Officials raised Mayon’s alert level to four on a scale of five, meaning a violent eruption is possible within hours or days. The danger zone expanded to 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the crater, affecting thousands more residents. The eruptions have shrouded nearby villages in darkness and sent lava, rocks and debris cascading down Mayon’s slopes toward the no-entry danger zone. There have no reports of deaths and injuries. Airplanes have been ordered to stay away from the crater and ash-laden winds and several flights have been canceled. Volcanic ash fell in about a dozen towns in coconut-growing Albay province and nearby Camarines Sur province, with visibility being heavily obscured in a few towns because of the thick gray ash fall, Jukes Nunez, an Albay provincial disaster response officer, said by telephone. “It was like night time at noon, there was zero visibility in some areas because the ash fall was so thick,” Nunez said. More than 30,000 ash masks and about 5,000 sacks of rice, along with medicine, water and other supplies, were being sent to evacuation centers, Office of Civil Defense regional director Claudio Yucot said. Mayon lies about 340 kilometers (210 miles) southeast of Manila. With its near-perfect cone, it is popular with climbers and tourists but has erupted about 50 times in the last 500 years, sometimes violently. In 2013, an ash eruption killed five climbers who had ventured near the summit despite warnings. Its most destructive eruption, in 1814, killed more than 1,200 people and buried the town of Cagsawa in volcanic mud. The belfry of Cagsawa’s stone church still juts from the ground in an eerie reminder of Mayon’s fury. The Philippines lies in the “Ring of Fire,” a line of seismic faults surrounding the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes and volcanic activity are common. In 1991, Mount Pinatubo in the northern Philippines exploded in one of the biggest volcanic eruptions of the 20th century, killing about 800 people.","Disaster officials in Albay province, where Mayon lies, say more than 30,000 people are staying in evacuation centers",2018-01-23T02:24:06Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",The Philippines’ Most Active Volcano Is Spewing Fountains of Lava and Massive Ash Plumes,http://time.com/5113723/philippines-mount-mayon-volcano-erupts/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/philippines-volcano_wong.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,evacuation,1
Eric M. Johnson,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co suspended operations on Tuesday at the South Carolina plant where it assembles 787 widebody jetliners following evacuation orders for coastal areas threatened by powerful Hurricane Florence, a company spokeswoman said. In advance of workers evacuating the facility, Boeing flew several 787 Dreamliners from the South Carolina factory across the country to an airport near Boeing’s widebody plant in Everett, Washington, north of Seattle, Boeing spokeswoman Libba Holland said. Hurricane Florence grew on Tuesday and was expected to bring days of rain, deadly flooding and power outages lasting weeks after it slams into the U.S. Southeast coast this week. Winds of up to 130 miles per hour (215 km per hour) and massive waves will pound coastal North and South Carolina when Florence makes landfall on Friday, and its rains will take a heavy toll for miles inland, the National Hurricane Center said. Holland did not have an estimate for when operations would resume. The hurricane-related closure comes as Boeing grapples with production logjams due to shortages of parts from suppliers that have rippled across the aerospace industry. “Boeing has suspended operations at Boeing South Carolina so our teammates can properly evacuate,” Holland said. “We will resume operations once it is safe to do so.” Flight tracking website Flightradar24.com said eight 787s made the cross-country exodus to the Pacific Northwest. One of the planes, according to the website, was a 787-10 for United Continental Holdings Co, the first North American customer for Boeing’s largest 787 model, which sells for around $326 million at list prices. The 787-10 is built exclusively at the North Charleston plant due to its large size, which prevents the transfer of sections to Boeing’s Everett factory for final assembly. Reporting by Eric M.

ALAN BLINDER,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The center of Tropical Depression Florence has left the Carolinas. But the chaos that the storm unleashed is nowhere near finished. Days of record-breaking rain have pushed rivers over their banks, and water levels — still rising in some places — are unlikely to recede fully for days. The authorities and volunteers in North and South Carolina are carrying out rescues by air and water, curfews are in effect, and many thousands of people remain out of their homes. Here are the latest developments: • Wilmington, N.C., a city of about 119,000 residents, has been cut off, with roads leading to it submerged.

Jennings Brown,"When FBI agents told local law enforcement to “standby” after the closure and evacuation of the National Solar Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico, on September 6, Otero County Sheriff Benny House did not hide his confusion. “The FBI is refusing to tell us what’s going on,” House told Alamogordo Daily News at the time. “We’ve got people up there (at Sunspot) that requested us to standby while they evacuate it. Nobody would really elaborate on any of the circumstances as to why. The FBI were up there. What their purpose was nobody will say.” The mysterious closure drew national attention as others echoed the sheriff’s bewilderment. Citizen sleuths theorized that the agency was hiding military testing or proof of extraterrestrial life. Then on Sunday the agency that runs the observatory—the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA)— finally explained that the reason behind the closure was an investigation into criminal activity that happened on the premises. But Sheriff House is still aggravated and concerned. “Is there a bomb threat? Is there an active shooter? Is it chemical? We need to know so we know what kind of man power to send up there, and with out knowing, it’s dangerous for everybody,” House told ABC 7 KVIA, “We have a duty to protect and we can’t protect them if we don’t know what is going on.” Reached by Gizmodo, Frank Fisher, a public affairs officer at FBI’s Albuquerque Division, would not comment on House’s statements or provide any information about the investigation. He referred Gizmodo to AURA’s statement from Sunday. House did not mince words in his criticism of the federal agency. “I think it’s chicken shit the way the FBI handled it. I have a responsibility to protect my citizens,” he told the local outlet. “We’ve asked and asked (the FBI) and they will not tell us anything.” [ ABC 7 KVIA ]","When  FBI agents told local law enforcement to “standby” after the closure and evacuation of the National Solar Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico, on September 6, Otero County Sheriff Benny House did not hide his confusion. “The FBI is refusing to tell us wh…",2018-09-18T14:37:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}","New Mexico Sheriff Demands Answers, Calls FBI 'Chicken Shit' Over Handling of Mysterious Observatory Closure",https://gizmodo.com/new-mexico-sheriff-demands-answers-calls-fbi-chicken-s-1829135907,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--oh0XHgUy--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/nkgzyminmdwpx7kqvcdy.jpg",,Gizmodo.com,evacuation,1
MARGERY A. BECK / AP,"(OMAHA, Neb.) — Authorities were using boats and large vehicles on Saturday to rescue and evacuate residents in parts of the Midwest where a recent deluge of rainwater and snowmelt was sent pouring over frozen ground, overwhelming creeks and rivers, and killing at least one person.
Rescue efforts in eastern Nebraska were hampered by reports of levee breaches and washouts of bridges and roads, including part of Nebraska Highway 92, leading in and out of southwest Omaha. Authorities confirmed that a bridge on that highway that crosses the Elkhorn River had been washed out Saturday. In Freemont, west of Omaha, the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office issued a mandatory evacuation for some residents after floodwaters broke through a levee along the Platte River. And in Mills County, Iowa, authorities ordered people in some rural areas to evacuate after the Missouri River overtopped levees.
The flooding followed days of snow and rain — record-setting, in some places — that swept through the West and Midwest. The deluge pushed some waterways, including the Missouri River, to record levels in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota. The flooding was the worst in nearly a decade in places.
The family of farmer James Wilke, 50, of Columbus, Nebraska, said he was killed Thursday when a bridge collapsed as he was using his tractor to try to reach stranded motorists on Thursday. His body was found downstream, his cousin Paul Wilke told the Columbus Telegram. Gass Haney Funeral Home confirmed James Wilke’s death.
At least two other people were missing in floodwaters in Nebraska. Officials said a Norfolk man was seen on top of his flooded car late Thursday before being swept away in the water and another man was swept away by waters when a dam collapsed on the Niobrara River.
Officials in Sarpy County, south of Omaha, said Saturday that power may be shut off to communities along the Missouri, Platte and Elkhorn rivers for safety reasons. They warned those who choose to ignore calls to evacuate that rescues would be attempted only during daylight hours. Some cities and towns, such as North Bend on the banks of the Platte River, were submerged. Others, such as Waterloo and Freemont, were surrounded by floodwaters, stranding residents in virtual islands with no access in or out.
“There is no way out of here unless you’ve got a helicopter — or a boat,” the Rev. Mike Bitter, pastor of Christian Church of Waterloo, told the Omaha World-Herald.
Officials in western Iowa and eastern Nebraska were urging people not to drive unless necessary. In Iowa, a section of northbound Interstate 29 that runs parallel to the Missouri River was closed due to flooding. Authorities were rerouting motorists at Kansas City, Missouri, using a detour that took people almost 140 miles (225 kilometers) out of the way.
Farther east, the Mississippi River saw moderate flooding in Illinois from Rock Island south to Gladstone. Meteorologist Brian Pierce with the National Weather Service’s Quad Cities office in Davenport, Iowa, said flooding on the Mississippi could get worse a few weeks as more snow melts in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
“What we’re having now is the dress rehearsal for the main event that’s going to happen in early April,” he said of the flooding on the Mississippi.
Rising waters along the Pecatonica and Rock rivers flooded some homes in the northern Illinois cities of Freeport, Rockford and Machesney Park. The National Weather Service said record crests were possible along the rivers, with water levels forecast to continue to rise over the next several days and remain above flood stage through most of the weekend.
Freeport resident Mary Martin told the (Freeport) Journal-Standard that she went to the store to get milk and bread when she saw floodwaters were rising Friday.
“Within an hour of going to the store, I could not get back in. That’s how fast the water was coming up,” Martin said.

SARAH MASLIN NIR,"Unlike a pileup or a road closed for construction, the blazes are also a breaking news event, throwing traffic reporters into the same mix as their news anchor counterparts, said Sioux-z Jessup, a freelance traffic anchor. “What’s really challenging is that there are so many fires burning right now, and I am trying to get the most accurate information to the most amount of people,” Ms. Jessup said. Along with street closings and alternate routes, she said, she has spent days posting tips on Twitter, like the safest kind of gas mask to wear. “You want to give them the evacuation centers, and the school closures, and the wind conditions,” she said. “I’m trying to provide anything that they need.” At 3:10 p.m. on Thursday, Ms. Jessup went live on the air. “Folks, we have now six fires burning in Southern California,” she said, facing the camera. She rattled off the closings, followed by a list of evacuation centers and the number of structures and acres threatened by a fire that had erupted that morning. The conditions have introduced tremendous reporting challenges. The buffeting winds of up to 60 mph that have fed the fire have grounded some traffic aircraft. Only the hardiest helicopters (more expensive ones usually operated by television stations) can withstand the current air conditions, said Desmond Shaw, who reports for both radio and TV. It has been too dangerous to fly the Cessna he reports from for KNX 1070 radio since the fires ignited. Like many of his colleagues, he must cover the story from the ground this time. “I definitely feel kind of hamstrung or helpless,” he said. “My city is burning and people are trying to get out of town and I wish I could be up above that helping people out.” Instead, he and other reporters work the phones, monitoring reports from the state Department of Transportation and Cal Fire. The news feeds flickering on viewers’ screens across the state — stark pictures of amber flames licking across mansions, horse farms and highways — belie what the reporters went through to capture them, Mr. Shaw said. “The shot is steady, but you’re not seeing the chopper getting knocked around because of the stability controls the camera has,” Mr. Shaw said. “Meanwhile you’re getting knocked around by turbulence like crazy.” Los Angeles is a city of gridlock. But the fires, which have consumed more than 100,000 acres and are still raging, create an entirely different traffic scenario. “You can Google and look in Hollywood and see these are the closures for the Oscars,” said Ginger Chan, a KTLA traffic anchor. “The difference is it’s fluid, it’s changing, the wind can shift, it can pick up.” Ms. Chan said officials from the Los Angeles Police Department had warned reporters on Wednesday that app-based GPS risked taking drivers into fire-affected areas. “For people who are not familiar, they are kind of trusting this blindly,” said Ms. Chan, who is married to Mr. Kono, the traffic pilot. “You’re running into a situation that will change on a dime, and then it’s putting you in areas that could be danger zones.” On Thursday afternoon, Ms. Chan was picking up her twin 3-year-old children at school after a workday that began at 1:30 a.m., extended hours for round-the-clock fire coverage. Few of the city’s veteran traffic reporters said they had ever dealt with so many simultaneous fires. “It’s indescribable,” said Scott Burt, an airborne traffic reporter for the radio station KNX 1070 News Radio. “I have seen this before, to a certain degree, but not probably this extreme.” The work is taxing, but rewarding, he said. “That’s what I’m here for, to help people,” Mr. Burt added. “And who doesn’t at work like a good challenge?” Continue reading the main story","As fires rage in Southern California, airborne reporters have become guiding lights in the chaos.",2017-12-08T14:00:14Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Where There’s Smoke, There Are the Traffic Reporters of Los Angeles",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/08/us/la-fires-traffic-reporters.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/08/us/09traffic/09traffic-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,evacuation,0
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Syrian Red Crescent / Twitter Image caption The Syrian Arab Red Crescent posted photos to Twitter of the delivery The rebel-held Syrian region of the Eastern Ghouta has received its first aid delivery in almost three months. It comes after weeks of appeals from the United Nations to allow aid deliveries and the evacuation of hundreds of critically ill people. About 400,000 people live in the besieged enclave, east of Damascus, under frequent artillery bombardment. Hundreds have been killed in recent weeks after government forces stepped up attempts to seize the area. Wednesday's aid delivery had enough food and supplies for 7,200 people, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. The Syrian Arab Red Crescent, which jointly handled the delivery, said the nine trucks would cover about 1,440 families. The World Health Organisation (WHO), meanwhile, said it had sent 1.8 tonnes of medical supplies - enough for about 10,000 treatments - in the delivery. WHO's representative in Syria, Elizabeth Hoff, told Reuters news agency the supplies included antibiotics, dialysis sessions, insulin, trauma kits, pneumonia treatments and hospital beds. But Wednesday's aid delivery to the Eastern Ghouta was relatively small by UN standards. Jakob Kern, Syria director for the World Food programme, tweeted: ""We need much more such convoys."" Those comments were echoed later by UN Syrian special envoy Staffan de Mistura, speaking to the UN Security Council, who said: ""This is fine. But let's think about it - that is less than 2% [of the population]... we need much more."" There has been no movement from the Syrian government on the United Nation's appeal to allow the evacuation of some 700 critically injured and severely ill patients. The UN - backed by the United States - has called for a cessation of hostilities after four days of heavy shelling this month killed more than 200 people in the Eastern Ghouta. But Russia, the Syrian government's main ally, has said the request was ""not realistic"". Now, Sweden and Kuwait have jointly prepared a draft resolution for the Security Council, to force a ceasefire and guarantee continued humanitarian access and medical evacuations. ""The humanitarian situation remains one of the worst the world has seen,"" the Swedish government said in a statement. ""When international law, including humanitarian law, is violated on a daily basis, it is our duty to act."" Russia, as one of the council's five permanent members, holds the power of veto on such resolutions. ""Gaining support for the resolution will not be easy - but we must try,"" Sweden said. The Eastern Ghouta has been under siege since 2013. It is a strategically important area, lying on the outskirts of Syria's capital, Damascus - which can be hit by rockets fired by rebels in the nearby enclave. It is completely surrounded by areas of Syrian government control - with the result that any aid delivery requires the approval of government forces. But inside the Eastern Ghouta, the humanitarian situation is rapidly worsening. In December, the International Committee of the Red Cross warned that the crisis had hit a ""critical point"". Then, in January, reports emerged of an alleged chlorine gas attack on the area, alongside claims that hospitals had been deliberately targeted. The Syrian government and its allies deny such claims.","The Eastern Ghouta gets its first aid delivery in months, but agencies say it is not enough.",2018-02-14T16:23:32Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Syria war: First aid delivery in months reaches Eastern Ghouta,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43062438,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D0A5/production/_100031435_dv_khctwaaubn96.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,evacuation,0
Jennifer Calfas,"A chaotic scene unfolded at the Statue of Liberty during the Fourth of July holiday Wednesday when several protestors were arrested for unfurling an “ABOLISH I.C.E.” banner before a woman started scaling the monument itself. The ordeal prompted an evacuation of the island that holds the national monument, forcing park officials to usher 3,000 to 4,000 visitors off Liberty Island in ferries as U.S. Park police and the New York Police Department attempted to coax the woman off the statue, Jerry Willis, a National Park Service spokesperson, tells TIME. The protestor still sat at the base of the Statue of Liberty, near the foot of the monument, as of 5 p.m., he says. Willis couldn’t confirm whether similar of protests have involved climbing Lady Liberty in the past, but he says, “It’s very unusual in recent history — I can tell you that.” It is unclear whether the woman who scaled the statue was part of the group of protestors who unfurled the “ABOLISH I.C.E.” banner at the base of the Statue of Liberty moments before. Seven of those protestors were arrested, Willis says. They came from Rise and Resist, a New York-based activist group created to protest the election of President Donald Trump and his policies. The stunt came days after protestors around the country participated in Families Belong Together rallies in response to the President’s immigration policies. The protests were sparked by the separation of families at the U.S.-Mexico border under the Trump Administration’s zero-tolerance policy. “ICE has proved to be a threat to our liberty and way of life, and should be abolished,” Leon Kirschner, a Rise and Resist member, said in a statement the group released about the protest. “Abolish ICE” has become a growing rallying cry for opponents of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Last month, Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) introduced a bill in the House that would abolish ICE, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic candidate for Congress in New York who rose to national fame when she defeated a longtime incumbent in the primary, made abolishing ICE. part of her platform.","One woman tried to climb the statue, sparking the evacuation of Liberty Island",2018-07-04T21:42:33Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Protestors Arrested After Unfurling ‘Abolish I.C.E.’ Banner at Base of Statue of Liberty,http://time.com/5330512/rise-and-resist-statue-of-liberty-abolish-ice-arrested/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/abolish-ice-statue-of-liberty.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,evacuation,0

Some lanes on the infamous 405 near the Getty Center in LA were also closed due to a mud and rock slide. Cars in the region were seen caked up to their rims in sludge. Firefighters, meanwhile, shared images of dramatic rescues, including the safe removal of a 14-year-old girl from a collapsed home and another young person from a wide mudslide.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - A suspicious package addressed to CNN’s Atlanta headquarters was intercepted on Monday morning, the network said, five days after one of 14 pipe bombs sent to some of U.S. President Donald Trump’s leading critics forced the evacuation of CNN’s New York office. The latest package was intercepted at an Atlanta post office, CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker said in a post on Twitter. The FBI’s Atlanta bomb squad and other law enforcement personnel responded after being notified by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Kevin Rowson, an FBI spokesman, said in a statement. Zucker said there was no imminent danger. Since a pipe bomb turned up at CNN’s New York office in the Time Warner Center on Wednesday, all mail to the network has been screened offsite, he said. News of the latest package surfaced with just over a week before highly charged Nov. 6 elections, in which the Democrats are battling to seize control of a Congress now held by Trump’s Republican Party. Last week’s bombs were sent to a range of prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, and other frequent targets of Trump’s scorn. Cesar Sayoc, a former male stripper and part-time pizza deliveryman accused of mailing those bombs, was scheduled to make his first appearance before a federal judge on Monday afternoon. Sayoc, 56, is charged with five felony counts: interstate transportation and illegal mailing of explosives, threatening a former president, making threatening interstate communications and assaulting federal officers. The case is expected to be moved to New York, where he will be prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office there, officials said. A public defender listed as Sayoc’s attorney of record in New York, Sarah Baumgartel, could not immediately be reached for comment. Sayoc, a New York native, has been held without bond since his arrest in south Florida on Friday by federal agents following a four-day nationwide manhunt for the person who sent the homemade pipe bombs to Trump critics, who also included former Secretary of State and first lady Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated in the 2016 presidential race. Trump’s supporters have accused Democrats of unfairly suggesting the president was to blame for the bomb scares. Trump himself accused the press of using coverage of the investigation to score political points against him. Sayoc, a registered Republican, has railed on social media against Democrats, Muslims and liberals in Facebook and Twitter posts. Public records show that Sayoc has numerous arrests over the years for domestic violence, theft and other charges, including an alleged bomb threat against a utility company. He was arrested outside an auto parts store in Plantation, Florida, near Miami. Authorities also seized a white van that Sayoc appeared to live in. The van’s windows were plastered with pro-Trump stickers, the slogan “CNN SUCKS” and images of Democratic leaders with red crosshairs over their faces. Fingerprint and DNA evidence helped identify the suspect, officials said. The bombs were sent in manila envelopes lined with bubble wrap and consisted of plastic 6-inch pipes packed with explosive material and wired to small clocks and batteries, a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan said. The complaint accused Sayoc of sending 13 bombs to 11 individuals, starting with billionaire Democratic donor George Soros. A package surfaced on Monday near his home in Katonah, New York. A 14th package was found on Friday at a post office outside San Francisco addressed to another wealthy contributor to the Democratic Party and liberal causes, Tom Steyer. All were sent through the Postal Service and intercepted before reaching their intended targets without exploding. No one has been hurt.

Mark Kaufman,"After leaping over California's Sacramento River, the swiftly-moving Carr Fire entered the City of Redding, home to more than 90,000 people, on Thursday night. The firestorm melted transmission lines, sent a towering, mushroom-like cloud into the sky, and prompted the evacuation of entire communities in the western part of the city. And two people have already lost their lives while fighting the fire. ""It easily moved across the river,"" Brenda Belongie, lead meteorologist of the U.S. Forest Service's Predictive Services in Northern California, who works and lives in Redding, said in an interview. SEE ALSO: The heat waves scorching Europe were given a serious boost by climate change ""The river is reasonably wide in that location,"" Belongie added. ""It’s normally a significant barrier — but not when you have that sort of fire."" Redding sits in a heavily-forested region of the state, a place rife in dry vegetation, like much of parched California. Making matters worse, the National Weather Service predicts temperatures in Redding will hit 110 degrees Fahrenheit on Friday, prompting the service to issue an ""excessive heat warning."" ""It is extreme fire behavior — and dramatic — just like you would see in the Hollywood movies, if you will,"" said Belongie. ""It's quite the disaster."" The forests around Redding are particularly fire-prone, as extended periods of warm weather have dried out the grasses and vegetation, turning them to tinder, said Belongie. The Western U.S., and California specifically, have been besieged by powerful fires this summer, which recently forced the closure of a smoke-filled Yosemite National Park. This follows on the heels of California's worst fire season on record — in 2017. This is part of a growing trend, as wildfires now burn substantially more land than they did 30 years ago. Burned forests are now releasing so much fine, burned material into the air that, during the worst events, a vast swathe of the Western U.S. now experiences worsening air quality, while the rest of the nation's air gradually improves. Wildfires may be common in the Western U.S. — sparked by lightning, downed power lines, or people acting foolishly — but their acceleration into massive, dominant fires is further stoked by human-caused climate change, say scientists. Warm air further dries out the land and provides blazes with more fuel, though gusty winds are hugely important contributors — if not the most important factor. Historic mismanagement of forests also play a significant role. If you live in NW #Redding GET OUT NOW, ! Run, walk just get out, streets are bottlenecked and clogged do not wait! #Carrfire — Bernie Deyo (@EPN473) July 27, 2018 As of Tuesday, the Carr Fire, which started on July 23, had expanded to over 44,000 acres, with barely any containment.

Belongie said she has prepared for the worst, if flames, edged on by winds pushing flames over parched land, continue moving through Redding.

CHRISTINE HAUSER,"Wildfires have burned across tens of thousands of acres of parched terrain in Colorado, spurring thousands of evacuations and compelling officials to seal off a national forest from the public on Tuesday. A total of six wildfires were still active in the state, which has endured months of dry weather and little snowfall. The largest, in southwest Colorado, was known as the 416 fire because it was the 416th incident to be called in to emergency officials this year. As of Tuesday morning, it had consumed more than 23,000 acres on the edge of San Juan National Forest and was only about 15 percent contained, according to an interagency team. The authorities said they will keep the national forest closed until it receives “sufficient moisture to improve conditions.” Detected at the beginning of the month, the fire has prompted evacuations of more than 2,160 residences so far and put residents of another 500 homes on notice for possible evacuation, according to the authorities. No deaths or injuries have been reported, officials said; residents have sought shelter in middle schools and local officials fear tourists usually drawn to the region for the summer may not come.","A total of six wildfires in Colorado, including the 416 fire, pictured on June 6 near Hermosa, were still active in the state on Tuesday.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption New York firefighters turn out for the funeral of Thomas Phelan on Tuesday When Thomas Phelan and Keith Young died within a day of each other last week, it was as a result of cancer, from which both had been suffering. But the underlying cause of the firefighters' deaths was the event which they both witnessed up close 17 years earlier: the 11 September attack on New York. Phelan and Young's names will not be added to the official tally of 2,977 people killed in the attacks, which also targeted the Pentagon and a plane that crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Their deaths were, however, a result of what happened at the World Trade Center that September morning. According to records maintained by the Uniformed Firefighters Association of Greater New York (UFANYC) union, theirs were the 172nd and 173rd deaths of firefighters to have occurred because of 9/11-related illnesses, and the sixth and seventh so far this year. Another former New York firefighter, Paul Tokarski, died of what was called a ""WTC-related illness"" on 10 March. Inevitability, sadly, their deaths will not be the last. About 400,000 people are believed to have been exposed to toxic contaminants, or suffered injury or trauma in lower Manhattan that day, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The president of the UFANYC told the BBC that roughly one in eight firefighters who were at Ground Zero have since come down with cancer. Image copyright UFANYC Image caption Thomas Phelan, a firefighting marine pilot, was diagnosed with cancer only two months ago Thomas Phelan was not working for the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) on 9/11, but played a critical role that stood him in good stead for his later career. At the time, he was working as a pilot for the tourist ferry service running between Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty. Soon after the attacks on the World Trade Center took place, all transport to and from Manhattan was shut down. Bridges, main roads and tunnels were closed, and people found themselves stranded on Manhattan, with no evacuation plan in place. What happened next was a mass evacuation by boat that was larger even than what happened in Dunkirk during World War Two. About 500,000 people are estimated to have been taken to safety by boat in only nine hours - the largest evacuation in New York City's history. Over several hours, Phelan carried hundreds of passengers from Manhattan to New Jersey, and transported first responders and supplies close to the ruins of the World Trade Center. ""When everybody was trying to get away, Thomas got that boat in position to help and evacuate,"" his friend Bryan Lang told ny1.com. ""And what's great is that he never talked about it. You would never ever know what Thomas did."" Many of the mariners who took part in the evacuation have since fallen ill - Phelan among them. He stopped working for the Statue of Liberty ferry in May 2003 and joined the New York City Fire Department (FDNY), eventually making his way back on to the water as a pilot on board a firefighting boat. Phelan, who was 45, was diagnosed with lung cancer only two months ago, not long after running his best marathon time. He died on Friday 16 March, and hundreds of firefighters lined the streets of the Brooklyn neighbourhood of Sunset Park for his funeral on Tuesday. Gerard Fitzgerald, the president of the firefighters' union the UFANYC, said Phelan, a friend for more than 25 years, was ""a very talented, very nice, good-hearted guy"". Among others to pay tribute was New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said Phelan's ""heroism saved hundreds of lives"". Keith Young joined the FDNY in 1998 and was stationed in Midwood, Brooklyn on the day of the attacks, when 343 firefighters were killed. He joined the rescue and recovery efforts at Ground Zero, which went on for nine months afterwards. While no emergency workers died during the recovery efforts, working in Ground Zero soon took its toll. The first 9/11-related death of a firefighter registered after the disaster is that of Gary Celentani, who took his own life 14 months after losing many of his close friends. Many others, like Young, were struck down with cancer attributed to the effects of being at the site. He first fell ill in December 2015, three years after his wife Beth died of breast cancer aged 47, and underwent surgery to remove a large tumour from his pelvis. Image copyright Kaley Young Image caption Keith Young was a celebrated chef as well as a firefighter After his treatment, he retired from duty, but died aged 53 on Saturday 17 March. ""He fought so hard and kept believing in miracles,"" his daughter Kaley wrote on Facebook after his death. ""There are so many adjectives we could use to describe my dad: funny, smart, kind. He was just an incredible human."" While working for the FDNY, he became well-known for his skills in the kitchen, and received a degree in culinary studies. In 2003, he published a book, Cooking With The Firehouse Chef, and he went on to win two titles on the Food Network television show Chopped. He leaves two daughters and a son, and his funeral took place on Saturday. According to the CDC, just under 70,000 people who helped during 9/11 have applied for medical aid after the disaster, as have about 14,300 people who were in New York City at the time. Among the main illnesses treated are chronic coughs, asthma, cancers and depression. In January 2011, the Zadroga Act - named after a police officer who died of a lung disease - was signed into law, authorising a fund for monitoring, treatment and compensation for 9/11 survivors. So far, close to $3.3bn has been paid out. New York's Committee for Occupational Safety &amp; Health says that about 6,000 of the 9/11 first responders are now living with cancer, with thousands more suffering breathing problems or mental health issues. Many, it said, had ""suffered severe exposure to numerous WTC-derived contaminants"". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cancer cases after the World Trade Center atack could be set to rise Gerard Fitzgerald, of the firefighters' union the UFANYC, told the BBC that of the 10,000 active firefighters and 6,000 retirees who attended Ground Zero on or after 9/11, about 2,000 had gone on to suffer some form of cancer. He fears the alarming rate of cancer cases among New York firefighters could soon increase substantially. It's feared that 9/11 first responders were exposed to significant amounts of asbestos, but cancers caused by asbestos exposure rarely emerge until 15 years later. ""We are living proof of the 9/11 effects, of that toxic soup we were breathing in,"" said Mr Fitzgerald, who arrived in Manhattan just after the second tower fell, before staying for 40 more hours. ""Every time, the thought goes through your head - could it be me next? Is it inside me? But you can't live like that.""",Thomas Phelan and Keith Young played key roles after the attack.

The volcano on Kadovar island began emitting smoke and ash last week, prompting the evacuation of more than 500 people to nearby Blup Blup island. But as the eruptions have become more violent, those who fled Kadovar will now have to be taken to the mainland. Papua New Guinea (PNG) is home to a number of active volcanoes. Witnesses on Blup Blup, to the north of Kadovar island, reported a large explosion from the volcano on Friday and a fiery red glow coming from the summit. Scientists later detected large amounts of toxic sulphur dioxide emitting from the volcano. PNG Red Cross Secretary General told Reuters news agency that funds had been made available to help evacuees move to the mainland. ""The people there, as the volcano erupted, they rushed immediately to escape. So they are in immediate need of food, water, shelter and clothing as well,"" he said.

 Pabuk was the region's worst storm in 30 years
Thousands of people in southern Thailand are emerging from shelter after the region's worst storm in 30 years passed into the Andaman Sea.
Storm Pabuk left Thailand at about midnight GMT on Friday after causing widespread flooding and blackouts. One fisherman died and one is missing.
The main tourist islands such as Koh Samui were spared the worst.
Flights and ferries are now resuming but tourists face delays due to a backlog of services.
The latest information on Tropical Storm Pabuk puts its peak wind speed at about 65km/h (40mph).
It passed over the coast of eastern Thailand near the island of Ko Phra Thong at 07:00 local time on Saturday (00:00 GMT), heading towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
It left behind a swathe of downed power cables and forced some 30,000 people into evacuation shelters.
Warnings of flash floods are still in force.
The fisherman died when his boat capsized early on Friday in southern Pattani province, with another crew member still missing.
There are unconfirmed reports a man also died when a tree hit his home in Nakhon Si Thammarat.
The main tourist islands of Koh Samui, Koh Phangan and Koh Tao were spared the full force of the winds and rain.
Koh Samui district chief Kittipop Roddon said: ""There were no casualties, there is some sunshine today and I'm confident some tourists will be able to leave.""
Koh Phangan district chief Krikkrai Songthanee said: ""It's all over. All 10,000 tourists are safe... I am relieved.""
Thousands of tourists had left before the storm it.
Media captionPabuk is the worst storm in decades to hit during the peak holiday season
Airports and ferry services, closed during the storm, are reopening although some ""red flag"" bans on swimming were still in force.
Koh Samui, Nakhon Si Thammarat and Surat Thani airports were resuming operations, with some extra flights allocated but travellers could still face delays.
Pabuk made landfall on Friday afternoon in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, leaving about 200,000 people without electricity. Some 30,000 had not been reconnected by Saturday.
One resident of Talum Puk, Boonchuay Chuaysri, told Agence France-Presse: ""The roofs on some rooms in my house are gone. The house is filled with mud.""

John Myers,"Essentia Health and St. Luke’s hospital officials said a combined 11 refinery victims were confirmed treated in Duluth and Superior facilities, one with a “serious blast injury.” No fatalities were reported, and all employees and hundreds of contractors working at the refinery were accounted for. No details were available on the extent of refinery damage or what caused the initial explosion that occurred just after 10 a.m., apparently in a tower near giant asphalt storage tanks. One of those tanks was punctured, spewing liquid asphalt onto the ground for hours. A second, larger fire erupted just after noon with multiple explosions throughout the afternoon, sending a much bigger black cloud billowing for miles. Kollin Schade, refinery manager for Husky, told reporters that the facility was preparing for a May shutdown for servicing and inspection at the time of the explosion and that most of the fire and smoke was from asphalt burning. Firefighters stood by for several hours until it was clear that a potentially dangerous toxic chemical, hydrogen fluoride, was not at risk of exploding and then went “into offensive operations” with foam and water. Superior Fire Battalion Chief Scott Gordon, shortly before 7 p.m. declared the fire to be out. Thursday evening a new fire ignited from a liquid Schade described as a “heavy material very similar to a bunker fuel that is not quite as heavy as asphalt but still very heavy,” which was pouring out of a valve that could not be shut off. Gordon said the fire would continue to burn until all of the liquid burned off. It was unknown Thursday evening how much liquid was left or how long the fire would continue. Gordon said he is confident that the fire is isolated and will not spread or get bigger. Evacuation At a 3 p.m. press conference, Paine said everyone within a 3-mile radius of the refinery should evacuate and stay out. City and county officials also said that everyone who lived or worked within 10 miles south of the fire also should evacuate due to the potentially toxic nature of the spreading smoke plume. “If in doubt … just leave. Find a place to go,” Paine said, later adding that “potentially all” of the city’s 27,000 residents may have to evacuate. Though Paine had said he hoped most residents could be allowed to return by sunset Thursday, he announced at a news conference late in the evening that the evacuation remained in effect and would be re-evaluated throughout the night. “We are hoping to lift that evacuation just as soon I feel satisfied and our team feels satisfied that the site is safe and that there is no further risk at the refinery or in the air surrounding the refinery, Superior and Duluth,” Paine said. At 8 p.m. the city of Duluth issued a “shelter in place” advisory for the area including the Fond du Lac neighborhood east to the CN ore docks in West Duluth, and to the top of the hill, as winds were predicted to shift in that direction during the night. “Residents with health concerns are advised to close windows and doors and stay indoors overnight as residual smoke from the refinery fire in Superior could be a respiratory irritant if inhaled,” a statement from the city read. Husky issued a news release saying that anyone affected by the fire could call 800-686-3192 for assistance with food, transportation or other concerns. Essentia Health closed all of its Superior locations including evacuating everyone from its Superior hospital with all patients going to Duluth facilities. The University of Wisconsin-Superior evacuated and sent students to the College of St. Scholastica in Duluth. Many of Superior’s main roads were clogged to gridlock with traffic through the afternoon as residents tried to move away from the smoke plume or retrieve loved ones who were evacuating. Residents who evacuated and needed shelter gathered at the Duluth Entertainment Convention Center as the primary site. Superior school officials said public school students in the city were evacuated to Amsoil headquarters in Superior where parents waited in traffic jams to pick up their children. Superior schools superintendent Janna Stevens said late Thursday afternoon that all students were either home safe with their families or were on their way home. The Duluth Transit Authority sent buses to help move evacuees to safety. UWS, all Superior public schools, Maple public schools and Wisconsin Indianhead Technical College all are closed Friday. Many businesses also closed and evacuated, including Superior Water, Light and Power and the Superior Family YMCA, gas stations and some grocery stores. The U.S. Coast Guard also imposed a closed safety zone near the Superior entry and Superior harbor due to the smoke dangers. It wasn't clear when that would be relaxed. Hydrogen fluoride a concern The Superior refinery is one of about 50 nationally that uses hydrogen fluoride to process high-octane gasoline. An acid catalyst, hydrogen fluoride is one of several federally regulated toxic chemicals at the refinery, such as propane and butane. The refinery can handle about 78,000 pounds of hydrogen fluoride, according to federal Environmental Protection Agency records. Schade, the refinery manager, would not answer specific questions on hydrogen fluoride Thursday, only saying its presence at the refinery was one reason the evacuation was underway. A Superior Fire Department official said having the fire spread to the hydrogen fluoride tank would be the worst-case scenario for the situation to worsen, with other experts saying the fumes could spread a toxic cloud of gas for miles downwind. Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources spokesman Jim Dick said the DNR had a spills coordinator on site, along with a team from the Environmental Protection Agency. A 2011 report from the Center for Public Integrity called hydrogen fluoride an ""extremely toxic"" chemical that, if released into the atmosphere, can spread rapidly. “It’s like chlorine gas. It’s an extremely toxic gas cloud that can move for miles downwind,” Fred Millar, a Washington, D.C.-based independent consultant and activist on refinery toxicity issues, told the News Tribune. “If your local officials aren’t explaining how concerned they are about that, then they should be. It would be a disaster. That’s what the evacuation (distances) should be based on.” Mayor says city was prepared The mayor said city agencies and refinery crews have trained jointly for disasters at the facility, calling Thursday’s event “the nightmare scenario’’ for which they train. “This community is aware we have an oil refinery. We’re prepared for this. We’ve done extensive training,” Paine said. “We’ve invested in equipment and infrastructure. We probably have the best fire department in the country to respond to an event like this.” Mel Duvall, manager of media and issues for Calgary-based Husky Energy, said he had no information on where inside the refinery the initial explosion occurred. The company was planning a five-week turnaround starting in May, meaning parts or all of the plant would be shut down. Officials at Enbridge Energy, which owns a massive oil pipeline terminal and storage facility with millions of gallons of petroleum products stored near the refinery, said their facility was not impacted. “The Husky Terminal is across the street from Enbridge’s Superior Terminal. This incident has not impacted Enbridge’s Superior Terminal operations. Most Enbridge terminal employees have been evacuated except for a small crew who continue to monitor the situation,’’ said Jennifer Smith, an Enbridge spokeswoman. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Husky employees and their families.” Refinery had past violations In 2015 the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined former refinery owner Calumet $21,000 over emergency response and flammable-liquids violations. Those violations were marked as settled and the problems solved by the end of that year. It was the only OSHA enforcement action taken against the refinery in the past 20 years, according to a search of the agency’s database. In 2012 and 2013 there were four reports of hydrogen sulfide releases due to power outages, according to the National Response Center. The refinery has not been fined over hazardous waste since 1999, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The refinery’s most recent Risk Management Plan was submitted to the EPA in 2012 and states: “In the unlikely event of a catastrophic release, the refinery, working in conjunction with local emergency management staff, is well prepared to respond and mitigate adverse consequences to the community or the environment.” Husky took over in 2017 Husky Energy concluded its purchase of the refinery in November, spending $492 million to acquire the refinery from Calumet. The Canadian refiner said there were no changes planned for the facility, but it was planning to continue a $30 million upgrade started by Calumet. About 180 people are employed at Wisconsin's sole refinery, which provides the Northland with gasoline, asphalt and other specialty petroleum products. About 50,000 barrels — or 2.3 million gallons — of oil per day can be processed at the refinery, located at 2407 Stinson Ave. Along with the refinery, Husky took control of two asphalt terminals and two product terminals, a marine terminal, 3.6 million barrels in storage and a marketing business. The Superior refinery was built in 1950, acquired by Murphy Oil in 1958 and sold to Indianapolis-based Calumet for $475 million in 2011. Husky Energy said the Superior refinery had averaged 37,000 barrels per day of production in the first three months of this year, according to an earnings statement released Thursday morning. News Tribune reporters Brooks Johnson, Jimmy Lovrien, Jana Hollingsworth, Peter Passi and Adelle Whitefoot, and Superior Telegram reporter Maria Lockwood, contributed to this story.","Duluth News Tribune UPDATE: Refinery fire out, but evacuations holding for time being Duluth News Tribune A series of explosions and fires rocked the Husky Energy oil refinery in Superior Thursday, sending a black plume of acrid smoke across the city, forcing…",2018-04-26T21:38:25Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Duluthnewstribune.com'}","UPDATE: Refinery fire out, but evacuations holding for time being - Duluth News Tribune",https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/fires/4437298-superior-oil-refinery-rocked-explosions-fire,https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_1240/public/field/image/042718.N.DNT_.CALUMET.C04.JPG?itok=t8K8va5B,,Duluthnewstribune.com,evacuation,1
JOHN LOCHER and BRIAN MELLEY / AP,"(PARADISE, Calif.) — Brad Weldon lost his home to fire when he was a kid, so when a deadly wildland blaze came roaring toward his ranch house in the pines where he lives with his 89-year-old blind mother, he wasn’t going to let disaster strike twice. Weldon and his mother’s caregiver, armed only with a garden hose and buckets, successfully fought the flames for 24 hours. At times, they had to lie down in the dirt to “avoid burning up” as 60 mph (97 kph) winds drove flames through the forest. Having saved his home in Paradise, Weldon’s not leaving what he now calls the “hell zone.” “If they take me out of here, it will be at gunpoint,” Weldon said. “My mom says they’ll have to beat her ass, too. She ain’t going without a fight.” Weldon is among a small group of fire survivors who have defied orders to leave and decided to stick it out in the blackened and smoldering landscape. Flames leveled the town of Paradise, which is about 140 miles (225 kilometers) north of San Francisco, and much of the surrounding area, killing at least 77 people and destroying more than 10,500 homes. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said he didn’t know how many people were living in the evacuation zones. Deputies who encounter someone in the area will confirm they live there, but won’t necessarily take other action. “We’re not dragging them out,” he said. “If some guy stayed at his house, I’m not going to arrest him if he’s not creating some kind of problem. I’m trying to treat people with respect and compassion.” Honea said he was hesitant to spread that message because it might encourage people to ignore evacuation orders, which can create problems even if they survive the initial danger. He said deputies have encountered people who stayed behind and ran out of food. It’s an audacious endeavor to stay behind in the smoky ruins with all the challenges that remain: There’s no power, no public water supply and there’s nowhere nearby to get supplies. Residents who leave to get groceries, drinking water or fuel for generators, aren’t allowed to return. The fire continues to burn and the sheriff has said there’s no timeline for when people will be allowed back in the area because the scope of the destruction is unprecedented. Patrick Knuthson, who managed to save his large metal workshop that has a small apartment inside, said he’s not planning to leave and has plenty of food and fuel to provide electricity to his living space and to pump water from his well. Knuthson has appointed himself as a guardian in his neck of the woods on the outskirts of Paradise where only two of 22 houses remained standing on his road. He has spray painted a sign saying “Looters will be shot!!” “I got my neighborhood locked down,” Knuthson said. “We’re all armed. We’ll ask questions later.” Weldon also feared looters would break into his “hicktorian” style house — a one-story ranch with ornate Victorian details inside. “It’s a ghost town, buddy,” he said. “It’s pitch black. If you hear something, you better be on your toes because somebody’s outside your house.” Knuthson said he knows about 40 people still living in the hills and added that he’d welcome anyone who wants to park a trailer on his large plot of land. For a while, his cousins, Phillip and Krystin Harvey, who lost their mobile home, had been staying with their three teenage daughters in a camper, trying to hang on to a piece of the life they had known. At night, the victims of the so-called Camp Fire stood by the glow of a campfire to stay warm. When someone offered to bring supplies, 16-year-old Arissa Harvey only wanted textbooks so she wouldn’t fall behind. Eventually the family gave up and moved to Oroville to stay with friends to have some stability and security, Knuthson said. “They had to get out of the smoke,” Knuthson said. “To have some kind of life.” Some stayed because they had nowhere else to go. Troy Miller, who had tried to evacuate from his Concow home but was turned back by flames, was camping in a truck next to the metal frame that remained of his home. His horse and three dogs survived, but he has no money or insurance to rebuild. Some passing firefighters gave Miller some drinking water, but he was hoping someone would get through the roadblocks and bring him a flashlight and some tarps for rain in the forecast. “I’m alive and I’m still up here. There are plenty of other people worse off than I am,” he said. “I’ve got a lot of faith in God. I think things will be OK.” Weldon said he was also staying put because he didn’t think there was anywhere safe he could take his ailing mother — especially now that norovirus has broken out in some shelters. He’s confident they can keep going for months with an ample pantry, gas he’s siphoning from work vehicles to power his generator and a 3,000 gallon (11,356 liter) swimming pool he’s carefully rationing for bathing and water for the toilet. “Flush it as little as possible,” he said. “Every gallon you put down there, you can’t get back.” There’s also the stealthy “good old mountain boy underground” network of locals that has replenished drinking water and perishable food. “Just out of amazingness it shows up every once in a while,” Weldon said.

Ian Stewart,"Jerry and Joyce McLean, wearing hazmat suits, look for sentimental items as they sift through the remains of their home Wednesday in Paradise, Calif. Don Thompson/AP For Seth Roberts and other residents of Paradise, Calif., Wednesday marked a sad homecoming. ""I'm in my backyard and it's all gone,"" Roberts told NPR. ""My house is gone, my shop's gone, my sheds are gone.... Nothing left, just a bunch of charred stuff."" Nearly a month after the Camp Fire decimated the Northern California town, officials lifted evacuation orders across a stretch of the eastern portion of Paradise, allowing people to return and see what is left of their homes and businesses. The wildfire California's deadliest and most destructive killed at least 85 people, forced the evacuation of more than 50,000, and destroyed thousands of structures in Paradise and neighboring communities. Eleven people are still missing, according to the Associated Press. Those who returned found a landscape of blackened trees and debris. Charred chimneys and strips of driveway were the only evidence that some piles of rubble had once been homes. Roberts lived in a newly renovated two-story house with his wife, Tamara, and their daughter and son-in-law. He says they had only a few moments to evacuate when the fire raced toward them last month; now they'll start digging through the ash, looking for any mementos that might have survived. Roberts hopes to find his daughter's wedding ring, which was left behind. Tamara and Seth Roberts stand in front of the remains of their home in Paradise during a short visit on Nov. 10. It was destroyed in the Camp Fire two days earlier. Courtesy of the Roberts family On Sunday, residents of Magalia, which borders Paradise to the north, also got their chance to return home. ""It really looks like a bomb went off,"" Manny Carrasco told The Wall Street Journal. ""All the houses in the neighborhood were leveled. It was total devastation."" Although the fire was fully contained 10 days ago, officials cautioned residents of continuing dangers. ""There is evidence from recent fires in California that homes and property destroyed by fire contain high and concerning levels of heavy metals, lead, mercury, dioxin, arsenic, and other carcinogens,"" says a warning on the Butte County fire recovery website. ""Some property may have the presence of radio-active materials."" Officials said they would be distributing protective gear including full-body suits, rubber gloves and face masks to those returning. With most of the area destroyed, they also encouraged residents to bring their own food, fuel and water. The lifting of the evacuation order is an early step in the long process of rebuilding and repopulating Paradise. With so much housing destroyed, area officials say there is no clear road map for how that process will play out. Displaced residents pitched tents in a Walmart parking lot in the aftermath of the fire. And locals have been critical of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for not moving more quickly to establish temporary housing in trailers. Ryan Buras, the head of FEMA's Housing Task Force in California, defended the agency's work in an interview with NPR. ""I do not believe this was a slow response,"" Buras said.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","In news that’s become all too common, a massive wildfire swept into a California city overnight. Hundred-foot walls of flames and traffic jams created a nightmare scenario in and around Redding, California, a city of 90,000. Neighborhoods and even entire surrounding towns have been evacuated, including a news station that stayed on the air until they were force to leave mid-broadcast. In their update late last night, CAL FIRE said that the hard work of nearly 1,750 firefighters couldn’t contain the flames due to “extreme fire behavior and unfavorable weather conditions.” As of midnight, the fire ballooned 50 percent overnight to 44,450 acres and was only three percent contained. “This fire is extremely dangerous and moving with no regard to what’s in its path,” CAL FIRE Chief Brett Gouvea said at a news conference late last night. Up until Thursday, most of the damage played out west of Redding, with the Sacramento River acting as a buffer between the city and the flames. Residents there have seen signs of the fire for days as it whipped up smoke and towering pyrocumulus clouds, as well as news reports of its trail of destruction. But on Thursday night, the fire jumped the river, sparking an evacuation of the neighborhoods on the western edge of town that caused bumper-to-bumper traffic. Around 2:30 a.m. local time, CAL FIRE also issued a mandatory evacuation for Shasta Lake City, a town of 9,000 on the northern edge of Redding. As fire started to rampage through the neighborhoods, firefighters stopped their containment efforts and began doing everything they could to get residents to safety. Local news report indicate that entire neighborhoods were ablaze. CAL FIRE is reporting that only 15 structures have been destroyed and another five have been damaged, but those numbers will surely rise as the sun comes up on the Redding area and firefighters begin to assess the damage. There has also been at least one fatality (a bulldozer operator who was working to contain the fire). That number that may unfortunately rise given the speed with which the fire tore into town. KRCR, the local NBC affiliate, was in one of the mandatory evacuation zones. Visibly uneasy anchors signed off, saying “we are going to leave the station because it is now unsafe to be here” as they cut to the station’s webcam showing the quintessential suburban view of street lights and trees lit by the bright glow of fire burning in the night. A scorching heat wave has helped create such dangerous conditions. Temperatures reached 112 degrees Fahrenheit in Redding yesterday and are forecast stay above 110 degrees Fahrenheit all weekend. The 10-day forecast shows 100+ degree Fahrenheit heat is likely to continue throughout next week. The heat, coupled with the moderate drought gripping the western portion of Shasta County, is a potent combination. But the fire has burned so intensely that it also appears to have created its own weather, as the heat from the flames rises and stirs the atmosphere. Towering pyrocumulus clouds, basically fire-driven thunderstorms, were clearly visible on satellite images during the day. The powerful winds that come along with those clouds likely spurred the Carr Fire on over dried-out brush and forest. The fire is one of three large blazes that have lit up California. The Cranston Fire continues to burn largely out of control about 100 miles southeast of Los Angeles, while the Ferguson Fire forced Yosemite National Park to evacuate visitors for the first time in decades. They come a year after the state had both its most destructive and largest wildfires ever recorded. The major blazes are a reminder that we’re living in a changed climate that’s increasing the odds of wildfire conditions. Wildfire season in the West is now 105 days longer than it was in the 1970s, and large fires are becoming more common, according to research by Climate Central (full disclosure: I used to work there). Climate change is responsible for half of the uptick in fires from 1984 to 2015, according to a 2016 study. In California in particular, recent research shows that precipitation in spring and fall—the shoulder seasons to California’s wet winter—is likely to dry up, further lengthening wildfire season. All this is happening as more people move into wildfire-prone areas, raising the risks of devastating consequences like the ones playing out in Redding. And it’s of course why we need to start preparing now for more intense urban fires.","In news that’s become all too common, a massive wildfire swept into a California city overnight.

KENNETH R. ROSEN,"“You should have a general evacuation plan as well as a communication plan. You should sit down with your family and discuss,” said Mr. Booher, the FEMA spokesman, “but also share with your friends and colleagues in case something was to happen — someone outside your immediate family would be able to track you down.” Here are some items to keep on you or at the ready in your home or office, in addition to the basics. A Multi-Tool: “I have one I bring climbing, one I bring camping/hiking and one for rafting/SUPing,” Mr. Egensteiner said, referring to stand-up paddling. “They can do everything, and the list of tools packed into the big ones today is staggering.” These tools, like The Wirecutter’s favorite, the Leatherman New Wave, can also help with performing first-aid, making fires and repairing machinery or electronics. The best come with everything from a sharp knife and pair of pliers or tweezers to a can opener. Spare Clothing: Consider your climate and pack for the most common weather. From an extra coat and gloves to a pair of walking shoes, consider the three basic layers for weatherproofing: base, insulation and shell. The base layer should include something that wicks away moisture and maintains body temperature such as synthetics or merino wool. Insulation layers can include puffy jackets stuffed with wool or down, or a fleece hooded sweatshirt or vest. The shell layer should be wind- and rain-resistant, but also breathable. A Weather/Emergency Radio: Wirecutter suggested the Midland ER310, “an emergency radio that can tune in to AM/FM and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration channel.” In the event of an emergency, especially a weather-related emergency, radio is your best bet to get up-to-date information on weather patterns, evacuation orders or official news from the authorities. A portable, easily powered radio like this one can keep you connected to the outside world even if you’re stuck in a cellar, or a shelter. This one can be powered by battery, hand crank, solar energy or USB. If you’re packing for a family, including children, build off the basics and necessities for one person, and make sure you pack enough supplies for everyone. Here are some more items to include if you’re considering more people. Mylar Blankets: Full sleeping bags are too cumbersome for an emergency kit, so these are a lighter alternative. “Mylar thermal blankets or bags are windproof, waterproof and capable of reflecting more than 90 percent of your body heat,” Mr. Paul, of The Wirecutter, said. “Inexpensive and easy to store, this should be the minimum you carry for warmth.”",It is never too early to talk with friends and family about emergency plans — and how to build the perfect go-bag in case disaster strikes.,2018-09-11T20:53:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",How to Pack an Emergency Kit for Any Disaster,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/smarter-living/packing-emergency-kit-disaster.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/13/us/03bugout/03bugout-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,evacuation,0

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Riley MacLeod to Kotaku","Firestorm. Storm surge. EF-5 tornado. If you pay attention to the weather, these are undoubtably terms youve heard, along with dire warnings from meteorologists to heed any and all evacuation warnings. But the Weather Channel has upped the ante by creating what it calls mixed reality segments that drive home the risks in a way looking at maps just cant. While the effort launched in 2015, these videos have exploded from weather Twitter into the general populace in recent months. A storm surge video on Hurricane Florence garnered widespread media coverage and netted more than 2.3 million viewers on YouTube. The videos arent just a potent demonstration of the threat natural disasters pose. By weaving in climate change messaging, they drive home the risks of a warming world. The Weather Channels latest foray into mixed reality looks at wildfires. On-air meteorologist Stephanie Abrams stands amid a forest scene, describing how climate change has made fire conditions more explosive in the U.S. After laying out the weather conditions and sighting an errant ember, the forest lights up around her. The camera zooms out to capture the flames racing up the hillside and into a town on the other side. Along the way, facts appear like VH1's Pop Up Video. Abrams closes it out under a glowing red sky by noting that climate change means scenes like this could become a frightening new reality. In era of social media, images of burnt out homes and forests and neighborhoods washed away by storm surge abound. But they inevitably lack context and amid the cacophony of daily life, their warnings can slip from memory. As someone who has worked in the climate and weather for a decade, the videos take concepts I understand academically and make them feel incredibly visceral. I imagine the impact is even more powerful for people havent spent a ton of time thinking about weather or climate. It brings home the the risk of life and property more than anything I can think of, Greg Postel, an on-air meteorologist with the Weather Channel who has appeared in a mixed reality segment on storm surge, told Earther. To create the segments, the Weather Channel uses a green screen and special cameras coupled with graphics created by Unreal Engine, a graphics package behind Fortnite and other video games. Right now, the company is working with a Norwegian production crew called Future Group, and it takes about 3-4 weeks to produce a 1-3 minute video, according to Michael Potts, the Weather Channels vice president of design. He told Earther theyll ultimately be bringing production in-house and hope to be able to turn these out at a much faster clip. The Weather Channel can also repurpose visuals theyve already got down patthe storm surge scenario Postel starred in was modified during Florence and Michael, for instance. After showing National Hurricane Center inundation maps, both videos zoom out to show what the projected storm surge looked like in mixed reality. With Postel standing within a cone of dry studio like a modern day Moses, the waters rise around him, underscoring why you should evacuate if you have the means. I had all sorts of dreams maybe that someday we could have three dimensional animations of weather, Postel said of when he got his start in meteorology more than two decades ago. Were getting toward that. This winter offers a chance for new uses of mixed reality, from burying meteorologists in digital lake-effect snow to standing amidst the slurry of saltwater and ice that accompanies noreasters. But beyond showing the danger of various types of weather, mixed reality conveys the gravity of climate change. Its one thing for me to write that wildfire season is more than three months longer than it was in the 1970s or that storm surge is lifted by rising seas. Its another to layer that clear cut science within an immersive environment. I dont mean to get all hopeful, but it feels like the recent United Nations report warning the world has a decade to get control of the future climate coupled with the increasingly obvious impacts could be a turning point in how the public and media treat climate change (jurys still out on elected Republican officials ). The Weather Channels augmented reality is yet another way to drive home just how dramatic the choices are.","Firestorm. Storm surge. EF-5 tornado.

"Jeremy Diamond and Kevin Liptak, CNN","(CNN) President Donald Trump believes next month's historic summit with Kim Jong Un could end the decades-old threat of North Korea's nuclear program. But earlier this year, just weeks before the Winter Olympics in South Korea that served as a critical diplomatic opening with Pyongyang, the President ordered his top national security officials to prepare to evacuate the families of all US military personnel living in South Korea, four current and former administration officials said. The order was a provocative step that, had it been fully implemented, would have heightened tensions with North Korea and could have sent the region spiraling closer to war. The presidential order is the clearest indication yet that Trump viewed war with North Korea as a real possibility, even as recently as the beginning of this year. At the time, Trump was convinced tensions could ultimately escalate beyond just rhetoric and was mulling military options against North Korea. The rapid shift from provocative steps to summit diplomacy illustrates the whipsaw approach the President has adopted on the global stage. The dynamic took another turn Tuesday, when North Korea said the US should carefully consider the fate of the summit in view of what the North called ""provocative military disturbances with South Korea,"" according to the North Korean state news agency. Trump issued the directive earlier this year to H.R. McMaster, his national security adviser at the time, during a daily intelligence briefing, evoking deep concerns among the administration's top national security officials, who worried North Korea would interpret the move as the US preparing to go to war. They worried the Olympics could also be scuttled along with its promise of opening diplomatic avenues between North and South Korea. McMaster directed his staff at the National Security Council to prepare a presidential memorandum ordering military dependents in South Korea to leave the country. Within a day, the memorandum made its way to chief of staff John Kelly's office. ""It was an order. It wasn't, 'I'm thinking about it,'"" one senior administration official said of Trump's directive. ""We saw it as a done deal."" Behind the scenes, Defense Secretary James Mattis and Kelly devised a compromise, according to two administration officials, and convinced the President to agree to a scaled-down directive that would bar military personnel in South Korea from bringing their families there during future tours, but avoid a dramatic evacuation, a senior administration official said. A new memorandum was drafted, but it too was never implemented. Former US officials and North Korea experts said ordering the nearly 8,000 military dependents living in South Korea to leave the country would have set off alarm bells, heightening concerns about potential US military action at a time when Trump's bellicose rhetoric already had the region on edge. ""All chaos would have broken out,"" said Jung Pak, a former CIA official and deputy national intelligence officer at the National Intelligence Council. ""This would have been a sure signpost for Kim (Jong Un) that the US was preparing for a military attack."" Christopher Hill, a former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and US ambassador to South Korea, said an evacuation of military dependents would be a ""huge step"" that would ""get everyone's attention."" ""You bet it would be seen as a precursor to military action,"" Hill said. The White House didn't respond to requests for comment on this story. A senior US defense official said there were broad discussions within the administration about US military posture on the Korean Peninsula in the weeks leading up to the Olympics. The Olympics went forward unencumbered, giving way for Kim's sister to attend the games in South Korea and extend a personal invitation to the South Korean President to meet with her brother for the first top-level inter-Korean talks in more than a decade. That diplomatic entrée led to several more, with Trump receiving an invitation of his own in March to meet with Kim. It's not clear what prompted Trump to suddenly demand the evacuation of military dependents from South Korea. But the order came as the President and his advisers mulled the possibility of launching a "" bloody nose "" preventive strike on North Korea. One former senior administration official said they believed at the time that the President wanted to send a signal to Mattis and the top US military brass that ""he was serious about studying military options for North Korea."" ""Mattis and company were reluctant to give him options in case he said, 'Let's go with it,'"" the former official said. ""He wanted to wake them up."" Another administration official said Trump believed it would be foolish to keep the nearly 8,000 military dependents living in South Korea if there was a chance of tensions spiraling out of control. The official said the President wasn't preparing to strike North Korea, but believed North Korea might take military action. The idea of moving the families of US servicemembers out of South Korea was publicly floated by several hawkish Republican senators a month before Trump directed the action in January, namely Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Sen. Tom Cotton, of Arkansas. Both senators speak regularly with the President. Representatives for Graham and Cotton declined to comment on whether the senators discussed the matter privately with Trump. There are other signs the administration was at least contemplating larger scale evacuations on the Korean Peninsula in preparation for potential violence breaking out. The administration's pick for ambassador to Seoul, Victor Cha, was asked during meetings by NSC officials whether he felt prepared to manage diplomatic efforts that would surround a ""bloody nose"" US strike, including the potential evacuation of American civilians from Seoul, a source familiar with the dynamic told CNN. Cha expressed concerns about such a strike, and later was dropped from consideration. The President's directive on military dependents underscores the extent to which he was prepared to go to the brink of war with North Korea before a veritable diplomatic opening presented itself. While the administration was in sync on the need to apply maximum diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea, the President's bellicose rhetoric and contemplation of military action against North Korea stoked deep divisions in the administration's top ranks. That is partly why the President's advisers were stunned when he readily accepted Kim's invitation to meet for talks during an impromptu March meeting with the South Korean national security adviser in the Oval Office. Now, the President has abandoned his bellicose rhetoric and personal jabs at the North Korean leader. In its place, the President has turned strikingly optimistic about the prospects of reaching a peace deal with his North Korean counterpart, whom he has repeatedly praised.

PATRICK McGEEHAN,"Photo A helicopter crash in New York City on Sunday resulted in the deaths of five passengers. Credit Bebeto Matthews/Associated Press In the wake of the crash that killed five people in New York City, federal regulators on Friday afternoon ordered an immediate stop to all “doors-off” helicopter flights that attach passengers to the cabin with harnesses that cannot be removed quickly in an emergency. The Federal Aviation Administration said that the directive applied to all helicopter operators that offer such flights across the country. Riding in a helicopter with the doors off, or open, to allow unimpeded photography has become a popular adventure in certain areas, including New York City, Las Vegas and Hawaii. On Sunday, a helicopter that carried five passengers who were wearing harnesses that allowed them to lean out the open doors crashed into the East River. All five passengers drowned after the helicopter rolled over in the frigid water. Only the pilot survived. “Operators, pilots, and consumers should be aware of the hazard presented by supplemental restraint devices in the event of an emergency evacuation during ‘doors off’ flights,” the F.A.A. said in a statement released on Friday. “The F.A.A. will order operators and pilots to take immediate actions to control or mitigate this risk. Until then, the F.A.A. will order no more ‘doors off’ operations that involve restraints that cannot be released quickly in an emergency.” Continue reading the main story","Following a crash that killed five passengers in New York City, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered an immediate stop to the flights nationwide.",2018-03-16T20:28:25Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",F.A.A.

Associated Press,"LOS ANGELES – An intentionally set wildfire grew perilously close to homes in Southern California on Thursday as evacuation orders expanded to more than 20,000 residents, though some homeowners stayed behind to fend off the flames themselves. Firefighters fought a desperate battle to stop the Holy Fire from reaching homes as the blaze surged through the Cleveland National Forest above the city of Lake Elsinore and its surrounding communities. They were trying to keep the flames from devouring neighborhoods and taking lives, as gigantic fires still burning in Northern California have done. ""Our main focus this afternoon was getting everyone out safely,"" said Thanh Nguyen, a spokesman for the fire crews. As flames raged closer, some residents stood in driveways or on top of roofs and used garden hoses to keep their homes wet and to fight the flames as smoke billowed around them. Joe Rodriguez was using a power washer to wet down his patio in the McVicker Canyon Park neighborhood on Thursday morning. Although the neighborhood is under an evacuation order, the 38-year-old Rodriguez told the San Bernardino Sun that he decided to stay to help save his home. ""Until this thing is barking at my door, I'm going to stick with it,"" he said. He said a line of fire retardant dropped on the hill above his house has so far checked the fire's advance, along with helicopter water drops. Rodriguez's wife and two daughters evacuated. Fire crews worked in 100-plus-degree (38 Celsius) heat. Aircraft dumped bright pink lines of fire retardant to wall off the fire from homes. The 15-square-mile (39-sq. kilometer)blaze was only 5 percent contained. The fire is named for Holy Jim Canyon, where it erupted Monday and burned a dozen cabins. A resident of the canyon, 51-year-old Forrest Gordon Clark, was charged Thursday with arson and other crimes that could send him to prison for life. Clark refused to go to court Thursday and his arraignment was postponed to Friday. It's unclear whether he has an attorney. Winds gusting to nearly 20 mph (32 kph) at times drove the fire through dense chaparral on the foothill slopes and along ridgetops, sending up an enormous column of smoke that smeared the sky for miles around. The fire threatened communities near the inland resort of Lake Elsinore in Riverside County, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles. Hot, dry weather, gusty winds and tinder-dry vegetation are the same conditions that caused wildfires in Northern California to explode into deadly conflagrations in the space of two weeks. North of San Francisco, fire crews continued progress in corralling the twin fires known as the Mendocino Complex. Since starting on July 27, the fires — which are being fought together as a single incident — have destroyed more than 100 homes near Clear Lake and become the largest fire in recorded state history. The area burned by the blaze is now larger than the cities of Los Angeles. The fires were 51 percent contained. In the Redding area, the year's deadliest fire was nearly half surrounded and was burning into remote and rugged forest land but grass, brush and trees there are so dry from years of drought and recent heat that the potential remained for the fire to grow, state fire officials said. The Carr Fire, as it's called, killed six people, including two firefighters, and burned more than 1,000 homes. Two other people — a state fire heavy equipment mechanic assigned to the fire and a utility worker trying to restore power near the fire— have died in car accidents. ___ Michael Balsamo and Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this story.","Fox News Flames inch close to California homes as thousands evacuate Fox News LOS ANGELES – An intentionally set wildfire grew perilously close to homes in Southern California on Thursday as evacuation orders expanded to more than 20,000 residents, though som…",2018-08-10T01:00:30Z,"{'id': 'fox-news', 'name': 'Fox News'}",Flames inch close to California homes as thousands evacuate - Fox News,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/08/09/flames-inch-close-to-california-homes-as-thousands-evacuate.html,http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2018/08/09/flames-inch-close-to-california-homes-as-thousands-evacuate/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.png/0/0/1533857872146.png?ve=1,fox-news,Fox News,evacuation,1
Reuters Editorial,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The U.S. region most vulnerable to tsunamis - the massive waves of water unleashed by undersea earthquakes - is dangerously under-prepared, experts and officials in Oregon and Washington state said after a magnitude 7.9 earthquake this week. The quake that struck in the Gulf of Alaska late Monday, triggering a tsunami warning for Alaska and a tsunami watch for the U.S. West Coast, rekindled concerns that a seismic sea wave along the northwest coast could kill, injure or displace tens of thousands of people and cause billions of dollars in damage. In this week’s quake, the warnings and watches were quickly lifted, and there was no damage from the slight change it caused in the ocean. But experts worry that in some parts of the region there is too little information about where tsunamis might occur, and in others too much infrastructure built in locations known to face a threat. “There’s still a lot that needs to be done,” said Corina Forson, Washington’s chief hazards geologist. Scientists in the state have pinpointed just half the locations where a destructive tsunami triggered by the Cascadia subduction zone off the northwest coast might come ashore, and about 10 percent of sites that might be hit by a wave emanating from the Seattle fault zone, Forson said. She called the lack of information dangerous. A tsunami could send a wall of water 50 feet (15 meters) high crashing onto the coast, or a wave 16 feet (5 meters) high into Seattle, the state’s largest city, she said. “If there’s the real thing and people don’t have evacuation routes and plans, they won’t know where to get to safety and it could be life-threatening,” she said. In neighboring Oregon, officials have created evacuation plans and public awareness campaigns to help people prepare. But the state has not done enough to stop people from building in potential danger zones, said Jay Wilson, former chairman of the Oregon Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission. “There are about 30,000 people who live in the tsunami zones,” Wilson said. “If we do everything right, they’re going to run up to the top of the hill. And then they’re all going to be permanently displaced.” DEADLY THREAT Parts of Oregon and far northern California have up to a 37 percent chance of a tsunami from a rupture of the Cascadia subduction zone in the next 50 years, said Chris Goldfinger, a tsunami and earthquake expert with the Oregon State University. Tsunamis are generally produced when tectonic plates move against each other under the ocean in subduction zones, displacing ocean water through powerful quakes. They have a deadly history. The 2011 quake and tsunami in Japan killed up to 18,000 people and wrecked Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant, causing the worst meltdown since the Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union. The 2004 Asian tsunami killed 226,000 people. A big tsunami on the Oregon coast could kill up to 10,000 people, said Althea Rizzo, the state’s geologic hazards program coordinator. In recent years, Oregon has instituted practice drills at schools and hospitals, provided evacuation materials to tourists in their hotel rooms and in some areas painted blue evacuation lines to higher ground on roads and paths, Rizzo said. The city of Seaside, Oregon, voted in 2016 to fund a bond measure to move its schools out of the inundation zone. There are statewide restrictions on building essential facilities like hospitals in tsunami zones. But updated maps showing where those zones are located have not been incorporated into the law, meaning the restrictions might not apply in areas that are now known to be dangerous, Wilson said. “In the Northwest our biggest problem is not getting the word out, it’s that our built infrastructure is very vulnerable,” said Goldfinger. “Buildings within a tsunami zone are pretty much going to be destroyed.” California is considering adopting international zoning standards for tsunami zone construction, as well as “blue line” evacuation routes like those in Oregon, said Rick Wilson, senior engineering geologist for the California Geological Survey. In Manzanita on the Oregon coast, resident Kerry Driscoll said she has an evacuation plan and the cabins at the beachside resort where she works are equipped with pamphlets telling tourists how to prepare. But tsunamis can come with little warning, and she knows it might be hard to get out. “If we don’t have major advance warning I don’t think there’s much that we can do,” Driscoll said. “I can’t see running from giant tidal waves.” Reporting by Sharon Bernstein; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Frances Kerry","SACRAMENTO, Calif.

Kerry Flynn,"Mount Agung, a volcano on Bali, erupted three times over the weekend, sending a thick ash cloud into the sky over the Indonesian island. Over the weekend, Mount Agung had its first major volcanic eruption since 1963. The latest eruption sent ash more than 2,000 meters (1.2 miles) into the air on Sunday, Bali's Regional Disaster Management Agency told CNN. The volcanic ash plume following the eruption reached an altitude of more than 4.7 miles and activity is still ongoing. SEE ALSO: Drone captures dramatic footage of erupting volcano in Japan The first eruption occurred around 4:30 a.m. ET on Saturday with more continuing over the following day. The disaster management agency advised residents to evacuate from 224 points around the island, according to CNN. The agency recommended no public activities around 3.5 to 4.5 miles from the peak of Mount Agung. At least 14 flights were cancelled, affecting more than 5,500 passengers, the Wall Street Journal reported. Indonesia issued its highest-level aviation warning for flights around Bali, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Mount Agung has been rumbling for months and has shown activity throughout the last week. An eruption began last week and was followed by a low-frequency tremor signal, according to the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program. As of last week, the eruptions were only ""phreatic,"" meaning they did not include magma. But that appears to have changed over the weekend, and it is expected to continue to erupt. Last September, the volcano awoke for the first time in five years and led to an evacuation of 140,000 people from their homes. More than half of those who evacuated were advised to return home in October as activity decreased, Indonesian authorities told The Guardian. About 30,000 people in Bali are now living in temporary shelters, according to ABC.","Mount Agung, a volcano on Bali, erupted three times over the weekend, sending a thick ash cloud into the sky over the Indonesian island.

Two of the company's trains were involved in a collision near Lexington on Sunday night. Four people were injured after two freight trains collided and caught fire near Lexington, Kentucky, late Sunday night, forcing nearby residents to evacuate, authorities said. The two Norfolk Southern trains were traveling in Georgetown, roughly 15 miles north of Lexington, when they collided and derailed around 11 p.m. Four engineers onboard the trains were taken to a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries, WLEX reported. A fire that resulted from the crash led to an evacuation of nearby homes as well as a warning of a possible chemical spill, which WKYT reported turned out to be vegetable oil and diesel fuel.

SCOTT BRANSFORD and CHRISTINA CARON,"As of Saturday morning the fire, which is known as the Carr Fire, had burned more than 80,000 acres, up from more than 40,000 on Friday. It has destroyed 500 structures and forced the evacuations of approximately 39,000 people, the authorities said on Saturday. Mr. Kewley, who lives about two miles from the Bledsoes near the Sacramento River in Redding, about 160 miles north of Sacramento, said the family had been keeping track of the fire but did not receive evacuation orders on Thursday. Then he said he saw the fire “start chewing through the other side of the river.” “Eight o’clock rolls around and everything just exploded, and everything was on fire,” he said, adding that subdivisions a mile away were “lighting up like the Fourth of July.” In the neighborhood in Redding where Ms. Bledsoe and the two children perished, the smoldering wreckage of incinerated homes lined the streets, sometimes juxtaposed with dwellings that had remained intact or sustained only minor damage. Downed power lines snaked across streets, which were largely empty except for the police and fire personnel surveying the damage and utility workers making repairs. The topography of the area, a mix of rolling hills, canyons and flatlands, spoke to the combustibility of landscapes in this part of Northern California, where communities are often built into what fire experts call the wildland-urban interface. Interspersed between streets and cul-de-sacs were swaths of open space filled with drought-stressed oaks, manzanita and brush, all of which provide powerful fuels when ignited.","Ed Bledsoe left his wife and great-grandchildren to run errands and gather supplies.

ALAN BLINDER,"The language, familiar to people living along the Gulf, came as the state and local authorities readied for a storm whose primary threats appeared to be rainfall and storm surge. Some areas of the coast could record a foot of rain, forecasters said, and officials warned of the threat of flooding. The governors of Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi declared emergencies. Many schools along the coast were closed Tuesday morning, with others expected to shut down in the afternoon. Some districts announced that their classrooms would also be empty on Wednesday. The City of Biloxi, Miss., ordered its harbors and marinas evacuated, affecting about 300 vessels, but local leaders were plainly trying to avoid wide panic. “We’re asking people to do the same things that we’re doing: prepare,” Mayor Andrew Gilich said in a statement. “There’s no reason to be alarmed. We’re being told to expect rain and wind, and we’re preparing accordingly. We expected our citizens to be doing the same.” Although New Orleans, the economic and cultural center of the coast, was not expected to suffer a direct strike, the city’s new mayor, LaToya Cantrell, issued an emergency declaration and a voluntary evacuation order for certain neighborhoods.

JENNIFER MEDINA and PATRICIA MAZZEI,"The mudslides in Montecito wiped out entire blocks, killing at least 17 people with a brutal force that shocked residents and even emergency workers — in neighborhoods that survived fires just weeks ago. On Thursday, rescue teams continued to search for as many as 43 people, holding out hope that they could survive in the thick mud, as deep as 10 feet in some places. Photo Josie Gower was among the 17 killed. The area was ravaged by the largest wildfire in California history last month, and the mudslides were a direct result of the burned ground. Without any vegetation in the way, the hills were vulnerable to falling rock and debris. Parts of the hills still puffed with smoke from those fires as the rain came down Tuesday. Four children were killed by the mud; the youngest victim was just 3 years old, according to a list issued by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office on Thursday. Nearly all of those who died lived within a two-mile radius in the flatlands of this small wealthy community just south of Santa Barbara. Most of the area was under voluntary evacuation orders. Among those reportedly missing were the 25-year-old stepsister of 12-year-old twins, one who lived, one who died; a 28-year-old woman whose 10-year-old son died; and a teenage boy whose father died and 14-year-old sister was dramatically rescued Tuesday after firefighters slogged through the rubble for six hours. On Wednesday, Mr. Gower went to his mother’s home, where he had grown up and she had lived for decades. The mud around San Ysidro Creek had spread nearly 1,000 feet, he said, and there were boulders the size of cars. Last year, the front yard flooded when about four inches of rain came down in a day, Mr. Gower said. But Ms. Gower assured him on Monday that she had set out sandbags and was prepared. They had no idea that the mud would prove far more dangerous than the water. “The creek was not even there,” he said. “We’ve had nothing like this at all, nothing like this has happened in Santa Barbara’s history, and nobody was prepared.” Photo James and Alice Mitchell. Credit via Associated Press In the past 48 hours, Mr. Gower and his sister, Breezy Haigh, have gone over and over what could have been done differently — alternating between blaming themselves and blaming county officials. “The night before I told her, ‘Why don’t you come stay here?’ and now of course I wish I would have pushed her,” Ms. Haigh said Thursday. Like her children, Ms. Gower had been back in her home for only a few weeks. “I feel like the county let us down. During the fire, they took so much precaution. People didn’t take this seriously. If it had been a mandatory, she would still be here.” Some blamed the desire to stay put on “evacuation fatigue,” because so many residents had returned to their homes only in the days before Christmas. Officials from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But they have said that they notified residents of the danger and decided which areas to evacuate based on input from weather, fire and flood experts. Like several other victims in the neighborhood, Alice and James Mitchell chose to stay home because they were not under mandatory evacuation, said their daughter, Kelly Weimer. The couple, married more than 50 years, had left for the wildfire and were still packed in case the floods forced them to leave again. So the Mitchells stayed in for dinner to celebrate Mr. Mitchell’s 89th birthday and went to bed early. Their bodies were found Tuesday down the road from their house, which they had named Casa Contenta, the house of contentment. All that was left was its foundation. Photo Rebecca Riskin. Credit via Associated Press “Nothing else is recognizable,” said Clay Weimer, the Mitchells’ son-in-law. Another home nearby had apparently slid down the hill. “The house next to them? Who knows where that house came from.” The white poodle Ms. Weimer gave her father for his birthday last year, Gigi, is still missing. Another nearby neighbor, Rebecca Riskin, 61, was found by the freeway about a mile away from her home, said her ex-husband, Ralph Riskin. The couple’s 25-year-old daughter, Julia, was rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter from the roof of a cottage on Ms. Riskin’s property, Mr. Riskin said. “Robert, my son, called me and said that his sister Julia was O.K.,” said Mr. Riskin, before he was overcome with emotion. “But he said, and I’ll never forget it: ‘We can’t find Mom.’” Many residents were still stunned at the sight of massive boulders around the town Thursday. A huge hole had taken the place of the living room in Ms. Gower’s home. Initially, Mr. Borgatello tried to get himself out of the mud, using his arms to pull his body up. But after he began shivering, he told Ms. Haigh, he realized he would be warmer if he stayed covered in the muck. Mr. Borgatello was released from the hospital Wednesday, she said, and has repeatedly spoken with some confusion about the night. “She looked at least 10 years younger than she was,” said Ms. Haigh, 35, adding that her mother swam at the local YMCA daily and kept her hair platinum blond. “She would have lived to be 100. I’m too young to have a dead mother.” The child of Italian immigrants who settled in Santa Barbara, Ms. Gower had spent her entire life in the area and delighted in having her three grandchildren, who called her Nonna, all nearby. “She was the life of the party, every party,” Ms. Haigh said through tears. “For her, every party was the ‘party of the century.’” Ms. Haigh and Mr. Gower had only begun to think about making plans for a funeral Thursday, anxious that they would not be able to find a place big enough for all the mourners in town.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","Your pets breathe the same air you do. If youre putting on a mask and taking precautions against wildfire smoke, you should be taking precautions for your pets as well. How to Know If Smoke Is Bothering Your Pet Dogs and cats have similar reactions to the smoke as people do. The American Veterinary Medical Association says these are some signs to look for : Coughing, gagging, or open-mouthed breathing Faster breathing Eyes watering or looking irritated Nasal discharge Fatigue, disorientation, or reduced appetite Birds are even more sensitive to smoke, in part because their lungs are really good at pulling oxygen from the air. This also makes them more sensitive to irritating or poisonous things in the air (think of the canary in the coal mine, which was a real thing.) Keep Them Indoors Smoke-filtering masks arent made for pets, so your best bet is to keep them indoors and keep the air as clean as you can. These steps are similar to what you would do for yourself and your human family: Keep windows and doors closed. Turn off the fresh-air intake on your air conditioner, and set it to just recirculate the air thats already in the house. Use an air purifier. If you dont have one that can handle a whole homes worth of air, put it in the room your pets spend the most time in (or move your pets to the room with the filter). If your pet needs to go outside, limit the amount of time they spend in smoky air, and try to time those trips for the times of day when it seems to be less smoky. Outdoor pets may get a little bit stir crazy, so consider buying or making some new toys to keep them entertained. Plan for Evacuation If the smoke gets too bad, or the wildfires too close, you may have to pack up and leave home. Remember your pets when youre planning your trip: have a proper carrier for birds, cats, and small pets, and figure out what shelters, hotels, or friends houses can accommodate pets. If you have horses or other livestock, call around to find trailers you might be able to rent or borrow in a pinch; the AMVA suggests asking your neighbors, farmers, and haulers well ahead of time.","Your pets breathe the same air you do.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Syria and Russia deny targeting hospitals or other civilian areas Aid workers in Syria say that at least 10 hospitals in rebel-held areas have suffered direct air or artillery attacks over the past 10 days. An adviser to a coalition of medical charities told the BBC that the attacks had been the most intense for a year. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon said more than 100 children in Eastern Ghouta near Damascus needed medical evacuation. The Syrian government and its ally, Russia, have consistently denied targeting civilian areas. Among facilities hit by recent air strikes was a maternity hospital in Maarrat al-Numan, in Idlib province, which aid workers said was hit three times in four days. Five people died in the worst attack, on Wednesday, according to the Syrian American Medical Society (Sams), and the hospital was temporarily put out of service. Mr De Bretton-Gordon, who advises the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), said other attacks in recent days had targeted hospitals predominantly in Eastern Ghouta, on the outskirts of the capital. ""This has been at a level, again, we haven't seen,"" he said. ""There are over 125 children needing live-saving surgery, including three very young children [whose injuries are] too graphic almost to describe,"" he added. ""A six-month old who has lost an eye who will die if he doesn't receive surgery and an eight-year old girl who weighs only 8kg (17lb) who is dying of malnutrition.""

""This fresh wave of attacks on medical facilities is sickening and unacceptable,"" he said in a statement. ""These attacks force facilities to shut down, terrorise staff and result in undue hardship for patients already suffering.""

"Leanne Suter, bio, about","An unpredictable, wind-driven brush fire in south Orange County prompted neighborhood evacuations in Laguna Beach and Aliso Viejo amid a response from more than 275 firefighters Saturday afternoon, officials said. What was first reported as a 25-acre brush fire spread to at least 200 acres. Containment was at 0 percent, according to Laguna Beach fire and police officials. The so-called Aliso Fire burned in heavy brush in Wood Canyon, located behind Aliso Viejo's Soka University of America, an Orange County Fire Authority spokesperson tweeted at 1:46 p.m. There were no immediate reports of injuries or structural damage. At least six air tankers, four helicopters and two fixed-wing aircraft were used in the firefight, according to the OCFA spokesperson. OCFA Capt. Tony Bommarito said the wind shifted multiple times throughout the firefight, which caused several spot fires and difficulty for fire crews. Costa Mesa High School's prom at Soka University of America was postponed a week due to the fire, school officials said.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The southern Hajar al-Aswad district of Damascus has been devastated by the fighting The Syrian military has declared that it has taken full control of all areas around the capital, Damascus, for the first time in six years. ""Damascus and its surroundings… are completely secure,"" spokesman Gen Ali Mayhoub said on state television. The announcement came after troops cleared Islamic State (IS) militants from the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp and the Hajar al-Aswad district. Some jihadists are reported to have been evacuated by bus to eastern Syria. Syria's civil war began in 2011 with protests against President Bashar al-Assad. The following year, the government began losing control of parts of Damascus and large swathes of territory elsewhere to jihadists and mainstream rebels. The intervention in the conflict by Russia and Iran, both staunch allies of Mr Assad, has turned the tide of the war in his favour in recent years and allowed him to re-establish control over the capital and other major cities in western Syria. The fighting has left at least 350,000 people dead and displaced 11 million others. In a televised statement on Monday afternoon, Gen Mayhoub announced that ""Damascus and its surroundings, its countryside and its towns, are completely secure"" following ""a series of intensive and successive military operations"". He said operations to regain control of Yarmouk and neighbouring Hajar al-Aswad, in the south of the capital, had left a ""large number"" of IS militants dead. ""This concludes the complete cleansing of all of the towns in the Western and Eastern Ghouta from the scourge of armed takfiri terrorism"", the general added, using a term for extremists who see other Muslims as non-believers. The Western and Eastern Ghouta regions were once major rebel strongholds. The latter was recaptured in April by pro-government forces who had laid siege to it for five years before launching a major assault. The operation killed more than 1,700 people before rebel fighters and members of their families agreed to be evacuated to the north-west of the country. Earlier on Monday, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that IS militants had left Yarmouk and Hajar al-Aswad under a similar evacuation deal, despite Syrian state media denying that anything had been brokered. Image copyright AFP Image caption Syrian government forces began an assault on the IS-held enclave several weeks ago Thirty-two buses transported 1,600 people out of the areas on Sunday and Monday, and headed towards the Badiya region, a vast stretch of desert in south-eastern Syria where IS still controls pockets of territory, the monitoring group said. A US-led multinational coalition that is supporting Syrian rebel and Kurdish fighters battling IS in the Badiya said it was ""aware of reports of an evacuation"". An opposition activist also said another 200 to 250 civilians were travelling by bus to rebel territory in the north-western province of Idlib. BBC Arab affairs analyst Sebastian Usher says the price of victory in Damascus for President Assad, as almost everywhere else in Syria, has been high - in death, destruction and displacement. Residents of the capital will breathe a sigh of relief, our correspondent adds, but further south and to the north in Idlib, hundreds of thousands of people in rebel-held areas will be fearful that pro-government forces will come for them next.","The military declares the capital ""secure"" after clearing a small enclave held by IS militants.",2018-05-21T16:13:16Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Syria war: Army takes full control of Damascus after ousting IS,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-44198304,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C784/production/_101667015_mediaitem101667011.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,evacuation,0
"Elliot Spagat, Amanda Lee Myers / AP","(FALLBROOK, Calif.) — A brush fire driven by gusty winds that have plagued Southern California all week exploded rapidly Thursday north of San Diego, destroying dozens of mobile homes in a retirement community and killing race horses at an elite training facility. The fire exceeded 6 square miles (16 square kilometers) in a matter of hours and tore through the tightly packed Rancho Monserate Country Club community in the small city of Fallbrook, known for its avocado orchards and horse ranches. Three people were burned trying to escape the flames, said Capt. Nick Schuler of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The destructive blaze broke out as firefighters tried to corral the largest fire in the state that was burning around Ventura — 130 miles (209 kilometers) to the north — and destroyed 430 buildings as it grew to 180 square miles (466 square kilometers) since Monday. Fire crews also fought large fires around Los Angeles, though they made enough progress to lift most evacuation orders. Like other fires that have broken out this week, Fallbrook has a history of destructive blazes. Ten years ago, as a series of similar fires raced across Southern California, a blaze in Fallbrook injured five people, destroyed 206 homes and burned 14 square miles (36 square kilometers). Driven by winds above 35 mph (56 kph), Thursday’s fire wiped out rows of trailer homes in the retirement community and left behind charred and mangled metal where they had stood. The fire started from an unknown cause next to State Highway 76 and blew across six lanes to the other side. The highway was closed Thursday night. Evacuations were ordered in the area near the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base and schools and casinos were being used as shelters. Jim Peratt was in Las Vegas on business when his wife called and said she was rounding up their two horses and evacuating their property in Bonsall, a community of 4,000 amid the rolling hills of rural San Diego County. “She saw nothing but smoke and flames all around,” Peratt said. “I’m praying I’ll have a home when I get back.” As the flames approached the elite San Luis Rey Downs training facility for thoroughbreds, many of the more than 450 horses were cut loose to prevent them from being trapped in their stables if barns caught fire, said Mac McBride of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club. Horse trainer Scott Hansen said he knows that some of his 30 horses at the facility died. “I don’t know how many are living and how many are dead,” he said. “I guess I’ll have to figure that out in the morning.” Most of the horses were saved, McBride said, and were being loaded to go to the Del Mar Fairgrounds. Some ranchers posted urgent pleas on Twitter for help moving horses, including Rawhide Ranch, well-known for running riding camps for children. The fire and a smaller one 12 miles (19 kilometers) north in the city of Murrieta broke out the day after state officials sent an unprecedented alert to cell phones across seven Southern California counties warning that strong Santa Ana winds could cause extreme fire danger. Although hurricane-force winds predicted did not materialize, firefighters faced gusts that fanned flames and put thousands of homes in jeopardy. Along the coast between Ventura and Santa Barbara, tiny beach communities were under siege as fire leapt from steep hillsides across U.S. Highway 101. “We drove through a wall of flames,” Wendy Frank said, describing her ordeal after evacuating her horses from Ojai on Wednesday night. “I didn’t know if we’d make it. I just put the accelerator down. I know we were going over 100 mph (160 kph), we could have been going much more, and just hoped for the best.” Fires flared up Thursday along the highway, forcing an evacuation of dozens of homes at Faria Beach. “Anyone in your homes still, you need to leave now,” a California Highway Patrol officer said through a loudspeaker while driving down a smoke-shrouded street. “The fire is here, you need to leave.” Joseph Ruffner had left earlier in the week but returned and said he was staying put this time. “This morning there was a wall of fire back right over here,” he said. “I didn’t think it was no big deal, but it’s coming back to burn what it didn’t burn yesterday.” The highway, which runs the length of the state and is a major commuter corridor to Los Angeles, was closed intermittently along the 28-mile (45-kilometer) stretch between Ventura and Santa Barbara. The Ventura and LA-area fires have put tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and destroyed nearly 200 homes and buildings, a figure almost certain to rise. A woman was found dead in a wrecked car in an evacuation zone near the city of Santa Paula, where the Ventura County blaze began Monday night, but officials could not immediately say whether the accident was fire-related. The massive fire threatened Ojai, a scenic mountain town dubbed “Shangri-La” and known for its boutique hotels and New Age spiritual retreats. Most of Ojai’s 7,000 residents were warned to clear out late Wednesday and patients unable to walk were moved from the Ojai Valley Community Hospital because of unprecedented, hurricane-force Santa Ana winds in the overnight forecast. Ash fell like snowflakes on citrus orchards scattered around town and on Spanish-style architecture as firefighters parked their trucks around houses in anticipation of winds picking back up. Some businesses were closed, but staples could be found at Pat’s Liquor, where Hank Cheyne-Garcia loaded up with supplies to fuel through another edgy night keeping sentry on the fire. “It got a little too intense yesterday with the wind kicking up,” he said. “There was just so much smoke. Yesterday you couldn’t see the street.”",Tens of thousands of people under evacuation orders and the flames have destroyed nearly 200 homes and buildings,2017-12-08T07:40:05Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Californian Communities Are Under Siege as Destructive Wildfires Continue Their Rampage,http://time.com/5055646/california-wildfire-san-diego-ventura-los-angeles-highway/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/gettyimages-888021490.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,evacuation,1
AMANDA LEE MYERS / AP,"(LOS ANGELES) — An intentionally set wildfire grew perilously close to homes in Southern California on Thursday as evacuation orders expanded to more than 20,000 residents, though some homeowners stayed behind to fend off the flames themselves. Firefighters fought a desperate battle to stop the Holy Fire from reaching homes as the blaze surged through the Cleveland National Forest above the city of Lake Elsinore and its surrounding communities. They were trying to keep the flames from devouring neighborhoods and taking lives, as gigantic fires still burning in Northern California have done. “Our main focus this afternoon was getting everyone out safely,” said Thanh Nguyen, a spokesman for the crews battling the Holy Fire. Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for Orange and Riverside counties because the fire threatened thousands of homes. The proclamation directs state agencies to provide help to local governments. As flames raged closer, some residents ignoring evacuation orders stood in driveways or on top of roofs and used garden hoses to keep their homes wet and to fight the flames as smoke billowed around them. Joe Rodriguez was using a power washer to wet down his patio in the McVicker Canyon Park neighborhood on Thursday morning. Although the neighborhood is under an evacuation order, the 38-year-old Rodriguez told the San Bernardino Sun that he decided to stay to help save his home. “Until this thing is barking at my door, I’m going to stick with it,” he said. He said a line of fire retardant dropped on the hill above his house has so far checked the fire’s advance, along with helicopter water drops. Rodriguez’s wife and two daughters evacuated. Lake Elsinore Mayor Natasha Johnson and her family were among the families evacuating Thursday, Councilman Bob Magee said at a community meeting about the fire. Earlier in the day, Johnson told residents in a video posted on Twitter to stay vigilant and listen to evacuation orders. “Stay safe,” she said as smoke billowed behind her. “God bless.” Magee told residents at the community meeting to follow the mayor’s example and listen to evacuation warnings and orders. “I also want to remind you not to panic,” he said. “We are in great hands, the best in the world. “Pray for our town. Pray for our people,” he said. Fire crews worked in 100-plus-degree (38 Celsius) heat. Aircraft dumped bright pink lines of fire retardant to wall off the fire from homes. The 16-square-mile (41-square-kilometer) blaze was only 5 percent contained. The fire is named for Holy Jim Canyon, where it erupted Monday and burned a dozen cabins. A resident of the canyon, 51-year-old Forrest Gordon Clark, was charged Thursday with arson and other crimes that could send him to prison for life. Clark refused to go to court Thursday and his arraignment was postponed to Friday. It’s unclear whether he has an attorney. Winds gusting to nearly 20 mph (32 kph) at times drove the fire through dense chaparral on the foothill slopes and along ridgetops, sending up an enormous column of smoke that smeared the sky for miles around. The fire threatened communities near the inland resort of Lake Elsinore in Riverside County, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles. Hot temperatures, erratic and gusty winds, and tinder-dry vegetation are the same conditions that caused wildfires in Northern California to explode into deadly conflagrations in the space of two weeks. North of San Francisco, fire crews continued progress in corralling the twin fires known as the Mendocino Complex. Since starting on July 27, the fires — which are being fought together as a single incident — have destroyed more than 100 homes near Clear Lake and become the largest fire in recorded state history. The area burned by the blaze is now larger than the cities of Los Angeles. The fires were 51 percent contained. In the Redding area, the year’s deadliest fire was nearly half surrounded and was burning into remote and rugged forest land but grass, brush and trees there are so dry from years of drought and recent heat that the potential remained for the fire to grow, state fire officials said. The Carr Fire, as it’s called, killed six people, including two firefighters, and burned more than 1,000 homes. Two other people — a state fire heavy equipment mechanic assigned to the fire and a utility worker trying to restore power near the fire— have died in car accidents. ___ Michael Balsamo and Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this story.","Evacuation orders expanded to more than 20,000 residents, though some homeowners stayed behind to fend off the flames themselves",2018-08-10T04:56:07Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Flames Inch Close to California Homes, Prompting Evacuation Orders for 20,000",http://time.com/5363633/holy-fire-california-evacuation-homes/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/gettyimages-1014201812.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,evacuation,1
"Eric Levenson, CNN","(CNN) Just hours after Rachelle Sanders gave birth to a healthy baby boy via C-section at a hospital in Paradise, California, she had to prepare for a harrowing choice. Amid the November 8 evacuation from the Camp Fire, she was placed in a wheelchair and rushed to a car driven by a hospital employee named David. They attempted to flee, but the flames were flanking and sometimes in the middle of the road, and her surgery left her unable to run or even walk if the fire overtook the car. She and David were strangers, yes, but she still made a dramatic request, should they be trapped by the flames. ""I said I want you to take the baby and run,"" Sanders said. Sanders, speaking to CNN from Chico on Monday, said that it never did come to that point. She, David and baby Lincoln ended up driving the 20 miles to safety in about nine hours on the road. ""I thought I wasn't going to make it, for sure. I wasn't sure any of us were going to make it. It was very, very terrifying."" Sanders' story is just one of the many harrowing journeys for people across Butte County, where the Camp Fire rapidly engulfed the town of Paradise, leaving more than 77 people dead and hundreds unaccounted for. Adventist Health said its hospital, Adventist Health Feather River, will likely not be back in operation for many months. Sanders said that the combination of fire and wind created what looked like a ""windstorm of fire,"" and she heard explosions of propane tanks and witnessed flames across the road many times on their evacuation. They were forced to turn around several times when the fire cut off their route. During one retreat, they drove past her home -- or where her home used to be. Now, there was just a chimney. Sanders, her husband and their three children are now left homeless. ""It was like it never existed, except for the fireplace,"" she said. Because it was so soon after her surgery, she had intravenous lines still in. David, a hospital staffer with no medical background, hung it on the rear-view mirror and was able to get it dripping again. After hours of turnarounds, gridlock and prayers, they eventually made it to another hospital in a different city. Sanders learned that David and his wife were safe -- but she never did learn much else about his family. ""Never have I had a Thanksgiving come where I have had so little and felt more thankful and blessed,"" she said.","Just hours after Rachelle Sanders gave birth to a healthy baby boy via C-section at a hospital in Paradise, California, she had to prepare for a harrowing choice.",2018-11-19T18:34:55Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}","Hours after giving birth, she told hospital worker to take baby and run if flames closed in",https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/19/us/mother-newborn-camp-fire-escape/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/181119121423-rachelle-sanders-and-baby-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,evacuation,1
Patrick Lucas Austin,"Ever head into the office to find your chair at someone else’s desk? Or a new plant in the break room? What about a live explosive next to where you keep the server racks? That’s what Reddit user WhySoSadCZ appears to have found and photographed after attempting to perform some routine maintenance in a seemingly innocuous office building. According to the Czech Republic-based Redditor, who says they went to an office building to perform some work on an air conditioner unit, the device was discovered in a server room that had been locked for two months after the employee responsible for it left, taking the keys. WhySoSadCZ says they broke into the room and found the device. On Monday morning, WhySoSadCZ posted an image of the device on the Reddit community r/whatisthisthing, joking, “Farewell present from a former employee maybe?” Other users soon identified the object as a 9M14 Malyutka anti-tank guided missile originally developed by the Soviet Union. As a general rule with all unexploded ordnances, no one should not touch them under any circumstances, and they should be reported to authorities for immediate disposal or detonation (which would suck if you left your lunch in the company break room). WhySoSadCZ subsequently posted a series of rolling updates, detailing their call to police, the building’s evacuation, and the confiscation of bystanders’ phones. “Some black vans with no registration plates on the scene, few military cars,” wrote the Redditor. “It looks like a complete military lockdown.” According to WhySoSadCZ, the ordnance was identified as an active anti-tank missile, and was transported to a military base for detonation by a military bomb squad. Of course, as with any incident online, the whole story could be made up, but a reverse image search on WhySoSadCZ’s turned up no results. Gizmodo has reached out to the both the Czech Republic Armed Forces and the Police Presidium of the Czech Republic for further information on the alleged incident.",Ever head into the office to find your chair at someone else’s desk?

DANA GOLDSTEIN,"Some experts worry that schools are focusing too much on a single rare threat — an active shooter — and too little on adopting safety measures that could help prevent a wide range of threats. Two-thirds of school districts conduct exercises to prepare for an active shooter, according to a 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office. In 2015-2016, 92 percent of schools had a plan in place to respond to a shooting, up from 79 percent of schools in 2003-2004, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Chris Dorn, a senior analyst at Safe Havens International, said that after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, his organization saw an uptick in demand for its services, completing 1,000 school security assessments in one year. Interest is even greater now. By this fall, Safe Havens expects to have done 1,000 assessments just since the Parkland, Fla., shooting in February. The group tells schools that the biggest safety risks have not changed, and are less likely to be mass shootings than “petty theft, assault, child abduction due to custody issues or sexual predators,” Mr. Dorn said. Measures to cut down those risks, such as reducing the number of open entrances to a school building, asking teachers to work with their classroom doors locked and instituting sign-in procedures for guests, will also be helpful in the rare case of a mass shooting. Lockdown and evacuation drills should not be used to “test” or scare staff members and children, Mr. Dorn added; instead, they should be thought of as part of basic emergency planning for many kinds of events, like severe weather or a weapons search, as well as potential gun violence.","While homicide is among the leading causes of death for young people generally, killings at school are rare, compared with the home or the neighborhood.",2018-05-22T22:42:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Grim Tallies Aside, Schools Are Still Statistically “Safe” Spaces",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/us/safe-school-shootings.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/23/us/23safeschools1/23safeschools1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,evacuation,1
DAN LEVIN,"CHICO, Calif. Gabe Price was having another rough day. As he had every morning since escaping the deadliest wildfire in Californias history, the 17-year-old had woken up beside his father on a sagging air mattress at his grandparents house, now crammed with four extra people and a dog. Stress filled the cramped rooms like smoke, always on the verge of flaring into another argument. Home or what he had until recently known as home is a pile of ashes. Paradise High School, where he is a senior, is cordoned off in an evacuation zone. Lessons are now all online, and Mr. Price desperately needed to find a Wi-Fi signal. So there he was, walking through a Muzak-filled shopping mall, where the Paradise school district had converted a former LensCrafters into a temporary school, wedged between a JCPenney and a toy store. This is the most stressful environment Ive ever been in, said Mr. Price, over the buzz of Spanish and algebra lessons nearby. Theres nowhere I can get fully comfortable and Ive got so much work to do.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","All weather watchers’ eyes are on Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 beast on a collision course with the Carolina coast. But while the winds are generating headlines and there’s a lot of questions about what category it will be when it makes landfall, the real issue is the water. And there’s going to be lots of it. It’s not that Florence’s winds aren’t a big deal—they are likely to be extremely dangerous and produce deadly flying debris—but there’s going to be a potentially historic amount of rainfall inland and powerful storm surge along the coast. Together, they’re responsible for 76 percent of all direct hurricane deaths. “There’s an old saying that those that live near the water will eventually live in the water,” Stephen Strader, a geographer who studies disasters at Villanova, told Earther. So let’s talk about that water likely to inundate people. Florence is likely to be a copious rain maker owing to how it fast (or slow) it moves ashore. Unfortunately, the National Hurricane Center calls for it to slow down as it reaches the Carolinas and then crawl inland as the winds in the upper atmosphere steering it slacken. That means the storm will have more time to unload heavy rain over the entire area under its shroud. But the slowing also means the bands of the heaviest rain that swirl around the hurricane are likely to do what meteorologists call training, a phenomenon where rain bands pass over one location repeatedly. It’s essential a race track for rain and can cause massive amounts of water to pile up on the ground in a very short period. While the National Hurricane Center is currently forecasting a wide area of 15-20 inches of precipitations, higher localized totals are likely because of training. Some model runs show upwards of 40-50 inches could fall, obliterating the rainfall record for wettest storm set by Hurricane Floyd in 1999 when it dropped 24 inches of rain as it strafed the North Carolina coast. Models are but one piece of putting together a forecast, but the guidance they’re providing right now is really worrisome. “When these environmental wind patterns weaken, there is no mechanism to continue moving the [tropical cyclone],” Sarah Griffin, a tropical cyclone expert at the University of Wisconsin, told Earther. “A similar set-up happened with Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area last year, causing Harvey to move very little for about 2 days.” Harvey was, of course, the biggest rainfall event to ever hit the U.S. so this is an extremely worrisome comparison. Compounding the issue of flooding is the type of summer North Carolina has had. In a word, it’s been a rainy one. A number of weather stations right in the center of Florence’s cone of probability have had some of their wettest summers on record. That means soils are saturated and won’t be able to handle the deluge that’s coming. “A lot of regions are associated with soil that drains poorly to begin with,” Strader said. “One thing we do know is when you replace natural vegetation with parking lots and homes and impervious surfaces, you increase the runoff.” So the rain is a huge issue. But it will likely be compounded by powerful storm surge on the coast, which also has the potential to be exacerbated by the storm slowing down as it approaches land. “If it stalls offshore or near the coast, storm surge threat will increase dramatically,” Hal Needham, a storm surge expert and founder of Marine Weather and Climate, told Earther. Needham said the size of the storm will also play a big role. Right now, Florence is wrapping up an eyewall replacement cycle, a sign that the storm is re-intensifying and could grow larger. If it does grow, the bigger wind field will give it a wider reach to whip more water toward the coast. Since we’re more than two days away and surge is very localized, we don’t yet have specific forecasts from the National Hurricane Center. But again, there’s bad news preceding the storm. Areas in Florence’s path are already seeing floodwaters rising ahead of the storm and tides are projected to remain high in the run up to Florence’s arrival. You can in part thank sea level rise for that, as it makes sunny day floods more common. “Even if you don’t think you’ll have to evacuate, the best thing to do is treat this as a trial run.” We can’t talk about the potential impacts of this storm without talking about how many people now call the area in Florence’s path home. Strader pointed to the fact that since 1940, the population residing in Florence’s cone of probability grew 1,325 percent, including a large spurt in the wake of Hurricane Hugo—the last major hurricane to make landfall in the Carolinas—in 1989. That includes growth ringing metro areas like Myrtle Beach and Wilmington on the coast and Raleigh-Durham inland. “I’m concerned people may be taken off-guard by a change in forecast track,” Needham said. “People need to think not only about their elevation but their evacuation route. I’m also concerned for people inland who may think they will not be impacted by this event.” All the growth also means there’s a lot more of the pavement, which increases runoff and flooding. “It’s a backhand forehand slap with this event with the removal of natural wetlands that protect cities and landscape,” Strader said. Both Strader and Needham urged residents to have a plan in place before the hurricane arrives and pay attention to local authorities. South Carolina has already ordered the evacuation of a million people, and residents in the Outer Banks and elsewhere in North Carolina being told to go inland, ideally out of the river flood zone. If you live in these areas or anywhere else evacuation orders pop up, follow them even if you don’t feel you’re in harm’s way.","All weather watchers’ eyes are on Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 beast on a collision course with the Carolina coast.

Ernest Scheyder,"CAROLINA BEACH, N.C. (Reuters) - As Hurricane Florence bent trees and began to peel away part of his neighbor’s roof late on Thursday night, E.J. Griffin wondered if he had made a mistake by staying at his house in Carolina Beach in defiance of a mandatory evacuation order. “There were a couple of points when I was kind of questioning my decisions in life,” he said on Friday after a harrowing night of whipping winds and soaking rain as Florence bullied across the North Carolina coast. “But we made the decision, and now we just got to ride it out.” State officials spent most of the week issuing increasingly dire warnings to people about the need to flee their homes in the face of Florence’s fury. Residents cannot be forced to follow evacuation orders. “Don’t risk your life riding out a monster,” Governor Roy Cooper pleaded on Wednesday evening, as the storm neared the coast. But some hardy - or foolhardy - residents elected to stay, gambling that the storm would fail to deliver on the worst fears of forecasters. As of Friday morning, many of those holdouts appeared to have won that bet, with a handful of exceptions. In New Bern, on the Neuse River, more than 100 people had to be saved from floods, and the downtown area was underwater. Officials warned the weakened storm would still bring life-threatening flooding to huge swaths of the state over the next couple of days. “We’ve lucked out so far,” said Cory Summer, 47, a 25-year resident of Carolina Beach, a shore town on a peninsula south of Wilmington, wedged between the Cape Fear River and the Atlantic. It was virtually destroyed by Hurricane Hazel more than 50 years ago. Like many other holdouts, Summer said he had weathered numerous hurricanes in his house, evacuating only one time, for Hurricane Fran in 1996. He had bags packed just in case but decided to stay put on Wednesday, when forecasters downgraded the storm to a Category 2 hurricane. David Cain, who lives in Sea Breeze, just north of Carolina Beach, said he had two kayaks and life jackets on standby in case the storm’s flooding threatened his home, which sits a few hundred yards from Cape Fear River. “Fortunately, we haven’t found anything that’s come down on the house,” he said. “I’m pretty seasoned. We’ve done about 12 hurricanes.” Many holdouts said they were wary of leaving their houses to the mercy of the storm and then finding themselves unable to return for days, or even weeks, if flooding washes out local roads. In Morehead City, Jim Howell, 65, said he and his wife, Betsy, have lived through about 10 hurricanes, evacuating only once. That experience involved hours of bumper-to-bumper traffic and a days-long wait for authorities to reopen the bridge that connects the mainland to Carolina Beach. They were convinced staying was the better option, unless Florence strengthened into a Category 3 or 4 storm. Ryland Mason, who owns a roofing business in Carolina Beach, said he wanted to stay put so he could help neighbors – he has four-wheel-drive trucks, generators and chainsaws. “I just don’t feel like I can leave this island,” he said. “I just feel like I need to help my people. That’s the only reason we stayed.” But the potential threats presented by Florence are not yet over. With the National Weather Service predicting the slow-moving system could drop up to eight months’ worth of rain in two or three days, the risk of flooding is still real. Storm surge is another danger. “If the flooding comes from the storm surge, we could have problems,” said retiree Phil Auth, 76, who stayed behind on Hatteras Island on the Outer Banks, a string of barrier islands. Kathleen O’Neal, who lives on Ocracoke Island on the Outer Banks, was also feeling good about her decision to sit tight, having weathered more than 30 hurricanes in the past. She said the hurricane had passed by with little incident, though the howling wind kept her up much of the night and the power went out. “We made out very well here,” she said.

Associated Press,"SAN FRANCISCO – Motorists were warned to stay off Northern California mountain roads as a major winter storm was expected to bring heavy snowfall, powerful winds and torrential rains at lower elevations Thursday. Meanwhile predictions of widespread showers across the southern end of the state raised concern about flash flooding near wildfire burn scars later in the week. A blizzard warning was issued for parts of the Sierra Nevada, where winds could gust up to 125 mph (200 kph) on the ridges and 40 to 60 mph (65 kph to 95 kph) in some valleys, the National Weather Service said. The blizzard would help the snowpack, which is vital to the state's water supply and is only about a quarter its normal size for this time of winter. ""Totals will be measured in feet and mountain travel will become dangerous,"" the National Weather Service tweeted. ""Travel is highly discouraged."" Northern mountains were expected to receive 3 feet (0.9 meter) to 5 feet (1.5 meters) of snow, and up to 7 feet (2.1 meters) in localized areas. The storm was expected to reach Southern California in the early hours of Friday. Santa Barbara County issued a recommended evacuation warning for south coast communities including Montecito, where a Jan. 9 storm triggered flash floods that destroyed or damaging hundreds of homes. Twenty-one people were killed and two remain missing. The county is following a rigorous new system of alerts that emphasizes evacuations well in advance of storms rather than suggesting residents can use their discretion. Officials hoped to decide Thursday whether to issue a mandatory evacuation order. People cannot be forced to leave their homes under a mandatory evacuation order, but authorities said they should not be expected to be rescued while the storm event is occurring. ""Our intention is to make sure that you have a plan, that you are prepared, and that you are safe,"" said Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown, who warned people not to be lulled into a false sense of security because midweek weather was calm. ""Just because the skies are blue right now doesn't mean there isn't a threat."" People with mobility issues or those with large animals should get out now, officials said. There were no estimates on how many people may have left the area. Montecito and neighboring communities on the coastal foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains lie below slopes burned bare last year by the largest wildfire in recorded California history as well as other fires in recent years. Evacuation fatigue for some residents is a factor. Some evacuated multiple times during the wildfires, and then again when the mudslides hit.","Fox News Major storm to bring feet of snow to California mountains Fox News SAN FRANCISCO – Motorists were warned to stay off Northern California mountain roads as a major winter storm was expected to bring heavy snowfall, powerful winds and torrential rains …",2018-03-01T07:22:51Z,"{'id': 'fox-news', 'name': 'Fox News'}",Major storm to bring feet of snow to California mountains - Fox News,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/01/major-storm-to-bring-feet-snow-to-california-mountains.html,http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2018/03/01/major-storm-to-bring-feet-snow-to-california-mountains/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.png/0/0/1519888677643.png?ve=1,fox-news,Fox News,evacuation,1

ABS-CBN News,"MANILA - Hundreds of families were evacuated Monday night as tropical depression Chedeng roared closer to landfall over Davao Occidental.
Almost 500 families in Malita town in Chedeng's path took shelter in evacuation centers, many of them in schools.
State weather bureau PAGASA said Chedeng, the third tropical cyclone to enter the country this year, is expected to hit land early Tuesday.
In its 5 a.m. bulletin, Chedeng was last spotted 105 kilometers east of General Santos City, packing maximum sustained winds of 45 kilometers per hour (kph), with gusts of up to 60 kph. It is moving west-southwest at a speed of 15 kph.
Tropical cyclone warning signal no. 1 remains hoisted over the following areas, which could be whipped by winds of up to 30 to 60 kph in at least 36 hours:
-Compostela Valley-Davao City-Davao del Sur-Davao Occidental-Davao Oriental-eastern portion of North Cotabato-eastern portion of South Cotabato-eastern portion of Sarangani-eastern portion of Sultan Kudarat-General Santos City-southern portion of Davao del Norte, including Samal Island
PAGASA said Chedeng is expected to weaken into a low-pressure area (LPA) after landfall, but would still dump moderate to heavy rains over most of Mindanao.
Those with small sea crafts are advised not to venture out over the eastern seaboards of the Visayas and Mindanao.
Classes were suspended Tuesday in parts of Mindanao due to rains from the tropical depression.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Campaigners are covering their eyes in solidarity with baby Karim A senior UN official says he fears children waiting to be evacuated from a besieged rebel-held area of the Syrian capital, Damascus, are being used as bargaining chips. UN special envoy to Syria Jan Egeland told the BBC he understood that rebels had agreed to release government workers in exchange for the children. Another 12 patients were evacuated on Wednesday, following four on Tuesday. Thirteen more urgent cases are expected to be evacuated on Thursday. News of the latest evacuations from Eastern Ghouta came in a tweet from the Syrian American Medical Society (Sams). However, a doctor with Sams, Mohamad Katoub, told the BBC that it was hard to keep up with who urgently needed to be evacuated as people continued to die. ""The last one was a girl from the list, from the 29. This morning, when the local staff reached the family to tell them that finally the approval to evacuate your little daughter arrived, the family said that our daughter died a few days ago,"" he said. About 400,000 residents in the war-torn district have been under siege by government forces since 2013. ""Let's hope that the agreements are good when they come,"" Mr Egeland told the BBC. ""There can also be bad agreements. It is a not a good agreement if they exchange sick children for detainees that means children become bargaining chips in some tug of war. That shouldn't happen. They have a right to the evacuation and we have an obligation to evacuate them."" The main rebel group in Eastern Ghouta, Jaysh al-Islam, said earlier on Twitter that the government had agreed to the evacuations in exchange for the release of 29 of its prisoners. Mr Egeland said those still in Eastern Ghouta had very little left in the way of medical facilities. ""The Syrian war has been a war against the medical profession in many ways,"" he said. ""Too many hospitals have been bombed, have been hit on both sides, hundreds of doctors and nurses have been killed or wounded so what is left in Eastern Ghouta for the 400,000 civilians is not that much."" Eastern Ghouta has been designated a ""de-escalation zone"" by the Syrian government's main allies, Russia and Iran, along with Turkey, which backs the opposition. But hostilities intensified six weeks ago when the Syrian military stepped up attacks in response to a rebel offensive, reportedly killing dozens of civilians. There are also severe shortages of food, fuel and medicines, and the cold weather is threatening to worsen the hardship. On Wednesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed that four critically ill people had been taken with their families to hospitals in Damascus, and that it hoped a total of 29 people would be evacuated ""over the coming few days"". ""The operation is clearly a positive step that will give some respite to the people in Eastern Ghouta, especially those who are in dire need of life-saving medical treatment,"" spokeswoman Anastasia Isyuk told the BBC.

The devastating fire that began on Dec. 4 is responsible for two deaths, has destroyed at least 750 homes and burned about 423 square miles (1,095 square kilometers). LOS ANGELES (AP) — Ray and Curry Sawyer’s Christmas tree is up, still waiting for their grandkids to decorate it. The presents are hidden away in closets, waiting to be wrapped, the ingredients for gingerbread men are sitting in cupboards, and the kindling for the fireplace has been chopped. A monster of a wildfire burning in Southern California froze the Sawyers’ plans for a big family Christmas and has forced the couple from their Santa Barbara home for nearly two weeks. Even if their beloved home of five decades survives the next predicted onslaught of winds, the Sawyers are preparing for Christmas in yet another hotel. “This is getting ridiculous,” said the 82-year-old Curry Sawyer from her hotel in Goleta on Tuesday. “My husband has the feeling, ‘Why aren’t they letting us back in?’ but they’ve got hot spots up there and if we get more Santa Ana winds, we’re going to be back to square one,” Sawyer said. “I’m not sure we’re out of the woods.” The Sawyers are among thousands of frustrated evacuees who’ve been away from home for days or weeks, living out of hotels or evacuation shelters, or staying with friends or family. Some have no home to go back to while others are just hoping theirs survive. The Sawyers were planning a big family Christmas with their sons, who each are married and have a daughter, and live in Los Angeles and Amherst, Massachusetts. If their home doesn’t make it, or if a mandatory evacuation remains in place come Christmas, Sawyer said the family will make do in Los Angeles. Her son’s home can accommodate her other son’s family, but Sawyer and her husband would have to stay in a hotel. “We’ll be more just trying to cramp ourselves into a small space,” she said. “But at least we’ll be together.” As of Tuesday, 432 people were still staying at evacuation shelters run by the Red Cross, agency spokeswoman Georgia Duncan said. The shelters are preparing to stay open for Christmas and many agencies are donating toys so that the children there have presents to open. One company already donated more than 100 bicycles, mostly for children. And Christmas came early for one 5-year-old boy who was handed a Mickey Mouse doll. “He just grabbed it and cried because he had lost all of his toys and just thought there would be no Christmas,” Duncan said. “To him, yesterday was Christmas.” Marolyn Romero-Sim, her husband and their 9-year-old daughter have been at an evacuation shelter in Ventura for two weeks after they watched their home of four years, an RV, burn in the wildfire, along with their beloved dog, their Christmas tree and a few presents. The family is trying to save money for another RV but know they’ll probably be in the shelter for Christmas. “I try not to let my daughter know, but I feel horrible,” the 34-year-old Romero-Sim said through tears Tuesday. “She’s being so understanding. She’s just thankful we’re going to be together for Christmas.” The devastating fire that began on Dec. 4 is responsible for two deaths, has destroyed at least 750 homes and burned about 423 square miles (1,095 square kilometers), making it the third biggest in the state since accurate records were kept starting in 1932. Officials estimate that the Thomas Fire will grow to become the biggest in California history before full containment, expected by Jan. 7. A respite from powerful winds allowed firefighters to reach 50 percent containment on the fire, and crews were taking advantage of calm conditions Tuesday by performing a controlled burn to remove swaths of dry brush along the fire’s northern edge. “We’re going to take a lot of that fuel out of there,” fire Capt. Rick Crawford said. “That way when the winds come back there’ll be nothing left to burn.” Hot, gusty winds that caused a huge flare-up and forced more evacuations last weekend are expected to whip up again Wednesday. Although some evacuations were lifted Monday and more residents were being allowed to return Tuesday, hillside homes are still threatened in Santa Barbara, about 100 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Firefighter Cory Iverson, 32, died Dec. 14 of burns and smoke inhalation while battling the flames. The blaze is also blamed for the Dec. 6 death of a 70-year-old woman who died in a car crash on an evacuation route. More than 8,000 firefighters from nearly a dozen states are battling the blaze. The cause remains under investigation. So far, firefighting costs have surpassed $130 million. ___ Associated Press writer Christopher Weber contributed to this report from Los Angeles.",Mike Eliason/Santa Barbara County Fire Department via AP A monster of a wildfire burning in Southern California froze the Sawyers’ plans for a big family Christmas and has forced the couple from their Santa Barbara home for nearly two weeks.

CORAL DAVENPORT,"At 3.6 degrees of warming, the report predicts a disproportionately rapid evacuation of people from the tropics. In some parts of the world, national borders will become irrelevant, said Aromar Revi, director of the Indian Institute for Human Settlements and an author of the report. You can set up a wall to try to contain 10,000 and 20,000 and one million people, but not 10 million. The report also finds that, in the likelihood that governments fail to avert 2.7 degrees of warming, another scenario is possible: The world could overshoot that target, heat up by more than 3.6 degrees, and then through a combination of lowering emissions and deploying carbon capture technology, bring the temperature back down below the 2.7-degree threshold. In that scenario, some damage would be irreversible, the report found. All coral reefs would die. However, the sea ice that would disappear in the hotter scenario would return once temperatures had cooled off. For governments, the idea of overshooting the target but then coming back to it is attractive because then they dont have to make such rapid changes, Dr. Shindell said. But it has a lot of disadvantages.

Juliet C. Revita,"THE Office of Civil Defense (OCD)-Davao noted a total of 4,103 evacuees in Davao region who evacuated due to Tropical Depression (TD) Chedeng, but no casualties have been so far recorded during its onset.
Leslie Francisco, information officer of OCD-Davao, said based on their situation report issued Tuesday, March 19, around 8 a.m., there were 19 barangays affected with 978 families forced to leave their homes to seek safer ground. Some of these evacuees were temporarily sheltered in the gym and barangay hall.
Data showed that Davao Occidental, where Chedeng had made landfall in Malita around 5:30 a.m. on Tuesday, noted a total of 1,675 displaced individuals, Davao Oriental with 2,413, Davao City with 15 individuals. Their consolidated data for Compostela Valley province has yet to be determined. Figures may possibly go up as OCD is still gathering all reports from different provinces.
In the weather bureaus advisory at 4 p.m., Chedeng has weakened into a low pressure area; thus, all tropical cyclone warning signals have been lifted. However, they further advised that scattered to at times widespread moderate to heavy rains will still be experienced over Surigao del Sur, Agusan del Sur, Davao region, Soccsksargen, and portions of Northern Mindanao, Bangsamoro and Zamboanga Peninsula.
In preparation for Chedeng, OCD-Davao participated in the Simultaneous Pre-Disaster Risk Assessment Emergency Preparations for Response (PDRA-EPR) meeting spearheaded by National Disaster and Risk Reduction Management Council (NDRRMC) on March 17 to iron out plans and strengthen coordination with other government agencies.
The alert status of operations center in Regional Disaster and Risk Reduction Management (RDRRMC 11) has been elevated to Blue Alert Status. OCD 11 had issued memorandum to local DRRMCs to likewise hoist their respective operations center alert status to Blue to closely monitor their respective area of responsibility for the possible effects of the tropical depression.
All the RDRRMC-Davao Response agencies were also on guard and were advised to allow all local DRRMCs to optimize the utilization of their response assets including food and non-food assistance to the affected families or IDPs.
The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), meanwhile, prepared a total of 6,049 on-floor and readily available family food packs for the displaced victims and continuous repacking in the warehouse is ongoing. A P3 million disaster stand-by fund is also readily available for any eventualities.
In Davao City, the CDRRMO has conducted pre-emptive evacuation to landslide prone areas in Matina Crossing (Purok Guadalupe, Quiniones Compound, Pluto Street GSIS, Shrine Hills Diversion Road, Milky Way St. and Virgo St. GSIS heights; Barangay Mandug (DDF Village Mandug); Barangay Buhangin (Purok Damayan); Barangay Maa (Juario Village, Purok 9 Shrine Hills, Nacilla Village Shrine Hills, Dinaville Subdivision and Iñigues Village), Barangay 19 (Awhag Subdivision, Barangay Matina Pangi (Diversion Road Dumpsite; and Barangay Tigatto (Purok 16); Talomo (Bypass Road) to ensure the safety of the residents susceptible to disaser.
Davao Oriental Governor Nelson Dayanghirang has ordered all concerned agencies to fast track the repairs of the Masipit Bridge in Tarragona town which was damaged yesterday when Chedeng struck.
Governor Dayanghirang, who was joined by Vice Governor Niño Uy, ordered the Provincial Engineers Office to work and coordinate with the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) District Office and Municipal Engineers Office to fast track the repair as they inspected the site earlier today, the statement in their official Facebook page read.
The bridge was impassable Tuesday after the incessant downpour has made the bridge unstable and unsafe for vehicles. The statement added that the engineering teams from the province, municipal government, and DPWH are working together and consolidating efforts to build the embankment to make it passable.","Typhoon Chedeng displaces 4000 in Davao SunStar Philippines Families evacuate as Chedeng nears land ABS-CBN News Chedeng makes landfall in Davao Occidental, becomes LPA Rappler Davao orders preemptive evacuation ahead of 'Chedeng' SunStar Philippines Chedeng …",2019-03-19T14:28:30Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Sunstar.com.ph'}",Typhoon Chedeng displaces 4000 in Davao - SunStar Philippines,https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1797674,https://www.sunstar.com.ph/uploads/images/2019/03/19/132613.jpg,,Sunstar.com.ph,evacuation,1
MICHAEL COOPER,"“The government has always characterized the area as remote and uninhabited, but we know from the census data that there were thousands of people living in a 50-mile radius of the test site,” Ms. Cordova, a founder of the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium, testified. One of those people, she said, was her father, who was a 4-year-old living in Tularosa, about 40 miles from the Trinity site, when the bomb exploded. He died many years later of cancer. Mr. Sellars said that he planned to cast downwinders in his new production. Some will stand as silent witnesses in a scene in which General Groves explains that, to maintain secrecy, he will not send evacuation forces into nearby areas. (A medical officer tells him: “Sir, no cure has yet been found for the agonies that result from overexposure to fallout and radiation.”) Downwinders light candles each year to commemorate those who died of cancer; Mr. Sellars hopes to incorporate that ceremony into the opera as well.

Tom McKay,"Authorities evacuated tens of thousands of people from 224 points on the Indonesian island of Bali this weekend after the eruption of Mount Agung, which spewed gigantic clouds of potentially life-threatening ash into the atmosphere, CNN reported. Up to 7,000 air passengers are stranded on the island at the main Bali airport of Ngurah Rai, while Indonesia’s Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation raised its aviation alert status from orange to its highest possible red status, signifying extreme hazards to aircraft. According to CNN, the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency estimates the cloud was at least 4,000 meters (13,120 feet) tall, though the Australian Bureau of Meteorology later estimated a height of 7,600 meters (2,9430 feet). According to the BBC, increased volcanic activity this year sparked fears of an imminent full-scale eruption involving magma flows, costing “at least $110m in tourism and productivity during the major evacuation.” Per NPR, volcanologist Gede Suantika told Reuters “The activity of Mount Agung has entered the magmatic eruption phase, it is still spewing ash at the moment, but we need to monitor and be cautious over the possibility of a strong, explosive eruption.” The New York Times estimated about 75,000 people have been evacuated so far in total, while residents and visitors have been instructed to stay at least four miles away from the volcano. Government officials are insistent that the island remains safe for now outside of the area immediately surrounding Mount Agung. The last recorded eruption of Mount Agung in 1963 happened to coincide with a Balinese Hindu ritual performed once every hundred years, according to Oregon State University. When the volcano began to erupt just days after the ritual, an estimated 50 million cubic meters of magma flowed from the peak. Pressure continued build until weeks later, when a massive explosion occurred: The sub-plinian eruption was so strong, it was estimated that the top 100 m had been blown off, creating an eruption column almost 10 km high, which collapsed to form devastating pyroclastic flows. These pyroclastic flows travelled east and south at over 60 km/hr, wiping out several villages and causing the death of over 1000 people. Many Balinese believed the eruption, and particularly the survival of the temple where the ritual was performed, was a bad omen. However, according to Phys.org, while scientists believe Mount Agung will continue to smoke for up to a month or more, a similar eruption is not considered particularly likely now.

Witnesses described a scene of panic, with people running from the station, some in tears, with one woman having lost a shoe. Shopping bags littered the sidewalks.

Johnny Lieu,"Tell you what, it's certainly not everyday someone shoots at an asteroid.
Japan's space agency, JAXA, tried to do just that with its Hayabusa-2 spacecraft, which was launched in 2014. It's been hanging out on asteroid called Ryugu since June 2018, where it's been studying the surface. 
SEE ALSO: Astronaut Anne McClain shares stunning moonset from the International Space Station
A bit before midday Japan Standard Time (JST) on Friday, the spacecraft attempted to blast a new crater on Ryugu by firing something called a ""small carry-on impactor"" (SCI) toward the asteroid.
[SCI] April 5 at 11:56 JST. The SCI operation time has passed and we have confirmed there is no problem with the spacecraft during the evacuation operation.
 HAYABUSA2@JAXA (@haya2e_jaxa) April 5, 2019
The SCI is a 2 kilogram (4.41 pound) copper lump which was fired toward the asteroid at a speed of 2 km per second (4,473 mph). 
Shaped like a cone and containing an explosive, the SCI is designed to create an artificial crater on the surface. 
The SCI was shot from an altitude of 500 metres (1,640 feet) from the asteroid's surface, and the time from release and explosion was about 40 minutes.
In a press conference following the explosion, mission managers were worried about the potential debris from the operation, but said none of it made contact with the spacecraft.
You can catch the feed of the operation in its entirety below.
The purpose of the experiment is so researchers can analyse changes to the asteroid's surface after shooting at it, and capture materials that might be hidden underneath.
You can see what it looks like when they shoot the SCI into Ryugu, thanks to a ground test simulating the experience. 
The fragments of gravel are meant to simulate the asteroid's surface, but you can imagine the lack of gravity in space would make for a lot more debris floating about.
It'll be a few more weeks until the team goes hunting for the crater, with the search operation set to begin the week of Apr. 22.
Researchers will take images of the surface where they think the bullet has hit, then look through the images by eye to see where they've made their mark. 
As for Hayabusa-2, it's expected to make its return to Earth sometime between November and December, with landing set for late-2020.","Tell you what, it's certainly not everyday someone shoots at an asteroid.

Southern California Public Radio,"A powerful winter storm sweeping into Southern California that prompted evacuation orders brought periods of intense rain and reports of minor debris flows Friday, but officials said it was so far not a repeat of the January storm that brought deadly mudslides. As many as 30,000 people were under mandatory evacuation orders overnight in the foothill communities of Santa Barbara County, including areas devastated by the deadly mud flows in January. Compliance among residents ordered to leave was as high as 87 percent, according to Amber Anderson with the Santa Barbara City Fire Department. But as of 9 a.m., the worst of the storm was over, those evacuation orders had been lifted and only minor damages had been reported, according to county officials. ""Together we made it through the first winter storm since the 1/9 Debris Flow,"" Sheriff Bill Brown said in a statement. ""On behalf of all public safety and emergency officials, we want to thank you for staying informed, being prepared and following the evacuation orders issued yesterday. We know that being evacuated is a tremendous hardship and we did not make this decision lightly. Because of your cooperation we were able to get through this together."" As of 6:30 a.m., San Marcos Pass in the Santa Barbara Mountains had seen the heaviest amount of rain, with 3.35 inches over 24 hours. Officials had closely watched rainfall totals in anticipation of possible mudslides. Rainfall of more than.5 inches per hour could result in debris flows when coupled with steep and recently scorched terrain, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Bob Ludwick, a longtime Montecito resident who had to evacuate Thursday night, said he was glad authorities were being cautious after the January mudslides and didn't mind having to leave his home. He said most residents were quick to follow the evacuation order when it was issued. ""We have been on tender hooks for weeks and weeks. It's kind of PTSD, and it didn't take much for the population to say, 'OK, we're leaving,'"" Ludwick told Take Two. Some Montecito residents still hadn't returned to their homes after the initial January evacuation, Ludwick said, and those who had returned were still facing a long road ahead. ""Even if your home suffered no damage and your streets are fine there is a really palpable pall that hangs over the entire community today,"" Ludwick said. As president of the Coast Village Association that represents local businesses, Ludwick had also heard concerns from local shop owners who are continuing to lose revenues. ""Even today they're calling me asking, 'When can we get in? What should we tell our employees? Do they come to work? Do they not?' There's no playbook for this,"" Ludwick said. The storm system was the result of an atmospheric river — a giant conveyor of rain pushed forward by strong winds — making its way down the California coast.

The fire located north of Durango was 10 percent contained, the Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team said. The fire had burned about 9,000 acres by early on Saturday, according to an aerial survey. A mandatory evacuation order was issued on Sunday for approximately 675 residences, bringing the total number of homes under evacuation to almost 2,000, La Plata County, Colorado, spokeswoman Megan Graham said. Law enforcement officials are going door to door and residents have been warned to leave via calls to their phones, text message and emails, Graham said. Low humidity and high winds have left firefighters bracing for the fire to spread and the weather was expected to be dry and windy on Sunday. Images on social media showed large plumes of smoke disseminating above mountains against a backdrop of blue sky. A blaze known as the Burro fire prompted U.S. Forest Service officials on Saturday to close part of the Colorado trail in the San Juan National Forest. In addition, an air quality health advisory was extended on Sunday due to unhealthy levels of smoke, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. In 2017, a near-record 10 million acres (4 million hectares) were burned in U.S. wildfires, the National Interagency Coordination Center said. The same agency issued a June forecast for “above-normal significant large fire potential” in Southern California and the Four Corners region of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, because of a deepening drought and ample fuel for wildfires.

Michael Balsamo / AP,"Many Californians in the area hit hardest by this week’s deadly mudslides did not heed warnings for hours and days by emergency officials encouraging them to evacuate their homes — and then received cellphone alerts of imminent slides when the massive streams of debris were already heading toward them or had already hit their neighborhoods. Wireless emergency alerts are cellphone messages sent to everyone in a region, similar to the Amber alerts that are sent to cellphone users in specific areas when authorities are trying to find missing children. The alert sent by Santa Barbara County officials to all those in mandatory and voluntary evacuation areas went out around 3:50 a.m. Tuesday because of deteriorating conditions, Rob Lewin, the county’s emergency management director said Thursday. It followed a cellphone alert that was sent by the National Weather Service, he said. There has been no outpouring of complaints from people that wireless warnings should have been sent out earlier, and residents of affected areas who have spoken with The Associated Press said they knew they lived in evacuation areas but chose not to leave. The first slides tore through Montecito around 3:30 a.m. and then continued after the county cellphone alerts went out, destroying or damaging 400 homes and killing at least 17 people. The vast majority of those homes fell under areas that had already been designated by authorities as under mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders. The warnings for the residents to leave had been issued for days before the mudslides through social media, news media and community information emails about the potential for mudflows from the huge wildfire scar in the hills above neighborhoods. “We sent out many, many, many alerts,” Lewin said. Another emergency management official told the Los Angeles Times that county officials decided not to use the its push alert system to cellphones earlier out of concern that it might not be taken seriously. “If you tell everyone to get out, everyone get out, the next time people won’t listen,” emergency manager Jeff Gater told the newspaper. “If you cry wolf, people stop listening.” Experts say it is important for emergency management officials to warn as many people as possible about potential threats, but disasters can change course in an instant. “Disasters are very dynamic in danger. They can change from minute to minute,” said Scott Somers, an emergency management professor at Arizona State University. “Just because an area can be safe at 1 o’clock in the afternoon doesn’t mean it is going to be safe at 3 p.m.” Jim and Alice Mitchell, whose house was swept away when the flash floods cascaded through their neighborhood, had not left their home because their house was under a voluntary evacuation order and not a mandatory order, their daughter, Kelly Weimer said Wednesday. Nearly every home on their block was completely destroyed and others were lifted and tossed from their foundation. “They were in a voluntary evacuation area so they figured they were OK,” said Weimer, who has been frantically searching for her parents for more than a day. “They weren’t concerned. It’s not like anybody came around and told them to leave.” Officials said that generally when mandatory evacuation orders are issued, there is an imminent threat to life or property. For areas with voluntary warnings, the threat still exists but it is in the near future. Weimer, 53, spoke to her parents on Monday to wish her father a happy 89th birthday. The couple of more than five decades planned to stay at home because of the rain and have a quiet dinner. Weimer hasn’t heard from them since and pictures from the area show their home on Hot Springs Road was completely gone. Officials defended their decision not to issue a mandatory evacuation order for the area that was hit hardest by the storm. “This isn’t an exact science in terms of actually defining where something is going to happen,” Santa Barbara Sheriff Bill Brown said. “Obviously a lot depends on Mother Nature, on the magnitude of the rainfall, the magnitude of the mudslides and so forth, and I think what was put together by a team of people, meteorologists, Cal Fire, our Forest Service people, our firefighters and personnel from the flood district and so forth, made a best-guess estimate as to where this was going to occur, and as it turns out they were exactly right that this was going to hit.” Brown said sheriff’s deputies went door to door in the mandatory evacuation area, knocking on 7,000 doors to tell residents to leave their homes hours before the storm swept through. Some refused. Officials across California said it is critical for residents to heed evacuation warnings as early as possible and be prepared to immediately evacuate if they are in a warning area. In Los Angeles, teams evaluate potential threat areas by examining the potential road blocks, slope erosion and the possibility of deadly conditions and then decide which areas should be under mandatory evacuation orders or voluntary warnings. “We understand the impact there is to people to leave their homes and their belongings. We do not take issuing evacuations lightly,” said Capt. Erik Scott, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department. When their home of 40 years was under threat from the wildfire last month, Marco Farrell and his parents evacuated and remained away for more than a week. This time, a voluntary evacuation order was issued for their area and the family discussed leaving but decided to ride it out. “There was evacuation fatigue from the fire,” Farrell acknowledged. “I would have preferred for them to leave and in hindsight we should have left. I don’t know how I got lulled.” What will he do the next time there’s an evacuation warning? “Definitely go,” he said.",400 homes were damaged or destroyed in the mudslides,2018-01-11T19:57:20Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",‘This Isn’t an Exact Science.’ Many Received Cellphone Alerts as Deadly Mudslides Hit,http://time.com/5099534/california-mudslide-cellphone-alert/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/california-mudslide-santa-barbara-cellphone-alerts.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,evacuation,1
Ernest Scheyder,"CAROLINA BEACH, N.C. (Reuters) - As Hurricane Florence bent trees and began to peel away part of his neighbor’s roof late on Thursday night, E.J. Griffin wondered if he had made a mistake by staying at his house in Carolina Beach in defiance of a mandatory evacuation order. “There were a couple of points when I was kind of questioning my decisions in life,” he said on Friday after a harrowing night of whipping winds and soaking rain as Florence bullied across the North Carolina coast. “But we made the decision, and now we just got to ride it out.” State officials spent most of the week issuing increasingly dire warnings to people about the need to flee their homes in the face of Florence’s fury. Residents cannot be forced to follow evacuation orders. “Don’t risk your life riding out a monster,” Governor Roy Cooper pleaded on Wednesday evening, as the storm neared the coast. But some hardy - or foolhardy - residents elected to stay, gambling that the storm would fail to deliver on the worst fears of forecasters. As of Friday morning, many of those holdouts appeared to have won that bet, with a handful of exceptions. In New Bern, on the Neuse River, more than 100 people had to be saved from floods, and the downtown area was underwater. Officials warned the weakened storm would still bring life-threatening flooding to huge swaths of the state over the next couple of days. “We’ve lucked out so far,” said Cory Summer, 47, a 25-year resident of Carolina Beach, a shore town on a peninsula south of Wilmington, wedged between the Cape Fear River and the Atlantic. It was virtually destroyed by Hurricane Hazel more than 50 years ago. Like many other holdouts, Summer said he had weathered numerous hurricanes in his house, evacuating only one time, for Hurricane Fran in 1996. He had bags packed just in case but decided to stay put on Wednesday, when forecasters downgraded the storm to a Category 2 hurricane. David Cain, who lives in Sea Breeze, just north of Carolina Beach, said he had two kayaks and life jackets on standby in case the storm’s flooding threatened his home, which sits a few hundred yards from Cape Fear River. “Fortunately, we haven’t found anything that’s come down on the house,” he said. “I’m pretty seasoned. We’ve done about 12 hurricanes.” Many holdouts said they were wary of leaving their houses to the mercy of the storm and then finding themselves unable to return for days, or even weeks, if flooding washes out local roads. In Morehead City, Jim Howell, 65, said he and his wife, Betsy, have lived through about 10 hurricanes, evacuating only once. That experience involved hours of bumper-to-bumper traffic and a days-long wait for authorities to reopen the bridge that connects the mainland to Carolina Beach. They were convinced staying was the better option, unless Florence strengthened into a Category 3 or 4 storm. Ryland Mason, who owns a roofing business in Carolina Beach, said he wanted to stay put so he could help neighbors – he has four-wheel-drive trucks, generators and chainsaws. “I just don’t feel like I can leave this island,” he said. “I just feel like I need to help my people. That’s the only reason we stayed.” But the potential threats presented by Florence are not yet over. With the National Weather Service predicting the slow-moving system could drop up to eight months’ worth of rain in two or three days, the risk of flooding is still real. Storm surge is another danger. “If the flooding comes from the storm surge, we could have problems,” said retiree Phil Auth, 76, who stayed behind on Hatteras Island on the Outer Banks, a string of barrier islands. Tom Pahl, a commissioner in Hyde County who lives on Ocracoke Island on the Outer Banks, said he slept better on Thursday night in the midst of the storm than he had the previous three, when he was debating whether to evacuate. “It’s not true with every storm, but in this particular case, the anticipation was more agonizing than the storm itself,” he said. Kathleen O’Neal, 69, was also feeling good about her decision to sit tight on Ocracoke Island, having weathered more than 30 hurricanes in the past. She said the hurricane had passed by with little incident, though the howling wind kept her up much of the night and the power went out. “We made out very well here,” she said.

"Fergus Jensen, Reuters","LABUAN - Indonesian military and rescue teams fanned out across a stretch of coastline on Monday, hoping to find survivors of a tsunami triggered by a landslide from a volcano that killed at least 373 people.
Thick clouds of ash spewed from Anak Krakatau, a volcanic island where a crater collapse at high tide late on Saturday set off waves that smashed into coastal areas on both sides of the Sunda Strait between the islands of Sumatra and Java.
Rescuers used heavy machinery and bare hands to dig bodies out of mud and wreckage along a 100 km (60 mile) stretch of Java's west coast.
More than 1,400 people were injured, and about 12,000 residents had to move to higher ground, with a high-tide warning extended to Wednesday.
The vast archipelago, which sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", has suffered its worst annual death toll from disasters in more than a decade.
Earthquakes flattened parts of the island of Lombok in July and August, and a double quake-and-tsunami killed more than 2,000 people on a remote part of Sulawesi island in September.
""At least 373 people have died, while 128 people are currently missing,"" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency, said on Monday evening.
Saturday's tsunami destroyed more than 700 buildings, from small shops and houses to villas and hotels. It took just 24 minutes after the landslide for waves to hit land, and there was no early warning for those living on the coast.
""EVERYTHING IS DESTROYED""
Vehicles were crushed by waves that lifted chunks of metal, felled trees, wooden beams and household items and deposited them on roads and rice fields.
Nurjana, 20, ran uphill after the tsunami hit. Her beachside snack stall was washed away.
""I opened the door straight away and saved myself. I jumped over the wall,"" she said. ""Everything is destroyed.""
Out in the strait, Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was still erupting on Sunday night, belching white smoke and ash into the sky.
The meteorology agency that an area of about 64 hectares, or 90 soccer pitches, of the volcanic island had collapsed into the sea.
In 1883, the volcano then known as Krakatoa erupted in one of the biggest blasts in recorded history, killing more than 36,000 people in a series of tsunami, and lowering the global surface temperature by one degree Celsius with its ash. Anak Krakatau is the island that emerged from the area in 1927, and has been growing ever since.
The high waves isolated hundreds of people on Sebesi island, about 12 km from the volcano.
""We are completely paralysed,"" Syamsiar, a village secretary on the island, told Metro TV, calling for food and medicine.
President Joko Widodo, who is running for re-election in April, told disaster agencies to install early warning systems, but experts said that, unlike with tsunami caused by earthquakes, little could have been done to alert people that waves were coming.
MEMORIES OF 2004
""Tsunamis from volcanic flank collapse are generated right at the coast and often close to populations,"" said Eddie Dempsey, lecturer in structural geology at Britain's University of Hull.
""The interval between the volcanic collapse and the arrival of the waves is minimal.""
The timing of the disaster over the Christmas season evoked memories of the Indian Ocean tsunami triggered by an earthquake on Dec. 26, 2004, which killed 226,000 people in 14 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.
Families streamed out of the area on Monday for fear of further tsunami, jamming roads already blocked by debris.
Fishermen told how a light breeze was followed by a huge wave that smashed together wooden fishing boats moored off the coast and pulled down the trees they were tied to.
Excavators were being used to move debris including piles of steel roofing tangled like spaghetti. Medics were sent in with the military, while groups of police and soldiers reached remote areas.
One team used sniffer dogs to search for survivors at the beach club where a tsunami washed away an outdoor stage where the Indonesian rock band Seventeen were performing at a party for about 200 guests. They had already pulled out nine bodies that day.
At a village 20 km away, district chief Atmadja Suhara said he was helping to care for 4,000 refugees, many of them now homeless.
""Everybody is still in a state of panic,"" he said. ""We often have disasters, but not as bad as this.""
""God willing,"" he said, ""we will rebuild.""",Indonesia hunts for survivors as volcano tsunami toll nears 400 ABS-CBN News No warning meant no escape from Indonesia tsunami INQUIRER.net Rescuers dig through rubble for survivors after Indonesian tsunami kills 280 GMA News Indonesia tsunami death toll hits…,2018-12-24T16:51:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Abs-cbn.com'}",Indonesia hunts for survivors as volcano tsunami toll nears 400 - ABS-CBN News,https://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/12/25/18/indonesia-hunts-for-survivors-as-volcano-tsunami-toll-nears-400,https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2018/tvpatrol/12/22/20181224-tsunami.jpg,,Abs-cbn.com,evacuation,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","While dawn in California is still a few hours away, it will rise on a town completely changed. The 27,000-person community of Paradise was ravaged by the explosive Camp Fire last night. Early reports indicate the entire town was basically wiped out, and residents died or were severely burned trying to escape the inferno. Pretty much the community of Paradise is destroyed, its that kind of devastation, CALFIRE Captain Scott McLean said, according to the AP. The wind that was predicted came and just wiped it out. McLean estimated the fire had destroyed thousands of structures, which would immediately vault the Camp Fire into the record books as one of Californias most destructive fires in history. The nine worst fires the state have seen all burned at least 1,000 buildings, with the top three topping 2,000. Regardless of where it lands on the list, its clear that the Camp Fire has irrevocably changed the lives of thousands of people who stoodor still standin its path. The fire began in the Plumas National Forest, where it was first reported around 6:30 a.m. PT on Thursday. It grew explosively throughout the day as it marched westward. By 9:30 a.m., it had consumed at least 5,000 acres. Eleven hours later, that total was up to at least 20,000 acres, the flames urged on by powerful winds across a dry landscape. The town of Paradise sits right in the middle of the acres burned. As the fire unfolded throughout the day, reports on the police scanner recounted scenes of unspeakable terror. The speed that the fire grew caught residents off guard, and the evacuation slowed to a crawl in some places. Officials on the scanner reported abandoned cars and people running for shelter in local stores as the Camp Fire bore down on town. Residents confirmed the scenes to the AP. Things started exploding, Gina Oviedo told the AP. People started getting out of their vehicles and running. Videos posted to social media show heart-pounding footage of people driving through walls of flame and smoke in an effort to outrace the fire. Local news crews also spotted a fire whirlthe baby but no less terrifying cousin of firenados like the one sparked by the Carr Fire earlier this yearwhipping outside Paradise. With firefighters in full life-saving mode, the Camp Fire is essentially uncontained. Reports late Tuesday night indicate that it had jumped a highway and was spreading south and west including toward Chico, a town of 93,000. CALFIRE reports there are still 15,000 structures in harms way. Due to the fluid and rapidly changing conditions, residents are urged to stay updated through official sources for changes to evacuations and road closures, CALFIRE warned. Because of heavy web traffic, the Butte County Sheriff has been using Twitter to post the most updated evacuation information so if you live there, refresh it regularly. When the flames finally are put out and residents are able to return to Paradise, theyll find a vastly different place than the one they fled from. And theyll face a dilemma that more and more Californians have had to face : rebuild or leave. In a world where climate change is making wildfire season longer and fires more destructive, the former is an increasingly harrowing proposition.","While dawn in California is still a few hours away, it will rise on a town completely changed.

"Special to USA TODAY, Bill McGee, Special to USA TODAY","The need for better and more effective emergency evacuation procedures is more critical than ever. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Thankfully, in recent years we’ve often seen everyone onboard airline flights safely escape serious accidents. From Capt. Sully Sullenberger’s US Airways Flight 1549 “Miracle on the Hudson” in New York City in 2009 to an uncontained engine failure on American Airlines Flight 383 in Chicago in 2016, there were no fatalities in scenarios that in the past almost certainly would have been disastrous. In fact, an astounding 95.7% of occupants have survived scheduled airline accidents in recent years. As I’ve noted here many times before, the fatalistic “all or nothing” approach to flying — that either the flight lands safely or everyone is doomed — is not only dead wrong, but it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy that is harmful and even potentially life-threatening. The fact is, if the zero-fatality record is to be continued, the need for better and more effective emergency evacuation procedures is more critical than ever. That’s why we need greater awareness of how the Federal Aviation Administration oversees such procedures, and a government study could shed some much needed light on that oversight. A minute and a half... Since 1967, the FAA has required that new aircraft be safely evacuated in 90 seconds or less. Much has changed since then, as technology has greatly improved both accident avoidance and accident survivability. But it’s worth noting that in 1967 there were no commercial twin-aisle widebody aircraft in use, and average passenger loads were much lower, so the challenges were in some ways easier. Federal regulations mandate compliance on evacuation standards during both certification (aircraft manufacturers) and operational (airlines) testing. But in 1985 the FAA first amended its policies to allow “the use of analysis in lieu of a full-scale demonstration,” in an effort to reduce injuries during such drills. While the regs do require new evaluations for significant design changes to existing aircraft, such as additional seats and installation of certain equipment, drills have been largely replaced by computer modeling. There are valid questions about whether such analysis has kept pace with the real world. The FAA provides an online Fact Sheet entitled “ Stayin’ Alive: the FAA and Aircraft Evacuations,” but it has not been updated in 12 years, since March 2006, and the three “Improvements to Cabin Safety” detailed there were completed more than three decades ago, between 1985 and 1987. During those three years, the average U.S. airline passenger load factor was between 60.3% and 62.4%; in 2017 the average load was 83.5% (and 84.6% domestically). Last May, I was asked about evacuations while testifying in Congress and I expressed concerns that so many key factors about safely evacuating planes have changed in recent years. Among those concerns: • Both seat pitch (legroom) and seat width have shrunk, as I demonstrated here in 2014. More: Think airline seats have gotten smaller? They have • While seats are growing tighter, Americans are growing larger. • As noted, passenger loads are at all-time record highs, even worse than what I detailed in 2013. • Checked-baggage fees have led to record numbers of carry-on bags cluttering cabins. What’s more, a plethora of electronic devices causes new worries, including passengers who are distracted by them during crises and charging cords that could trip evacuees in an emergency. All these issues have combined to make real-world evacuations more difficult, despite the airplanes themselves being more safely designed. New challenges Last July, a federal court responded to a complaint from the consumer organization FlyersRights.org by ordering the FAA to prove that it shouldn’t regulate airline seat sizes. Judge Patricia Millett stated, “This is the Case of the Incredible Shrinking Airline Seat,” and the ruling chastised the FAA for a “vaporous record” of evacuation tests and “(at-best) off-point studies and undisclosed tests using unknown parameters.” The FAA responded by asserting that seat pitch is considered during testing. For its part, FlyersRights.org stated : “The FAA has not conducted, or alternatively has not released, any tests, whether computer simulations or rehearsed evacuations, that demonstrate that planes with modern seat sizes and modern passenger sizes would pass emergency evacuation criteria.” Earlier this month, the ranking members of the House Transportation Committee and Aviation Subcommittee — Reps. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) and Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) — wrote to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Inspector General (DOT-IG) and requested an investigation into the effectiveness of the FAA’s oversight of aircraft manufacturers’ certification process. The primary concerns: 1. Standards have not been updated since 1990, and 2. Airplane makers have increasingly relied on computer simulations and modeling rather than actual evacuation drills. The letter noted how large roll-aboard suitcases are so common in the age of checked-bag fees and also noted “behavioral shifts,” such as “the propensity to film evacuations on smartphones rather than focusing on actually evacuating.” So DeFazio and Larsen asked the IG to research if the FAA and the airlines are doing enough to enhance post-accident survivability. Improving airline evacuation protocols has a long history. Back in 1993, the U.S. Government Accountability Office examined the FAA’s standards amid concerns about injuries during live drills, but today there are new concerns. And in 2000 the National Transportation Safety Board issued or reiterated 23 specific recommendations to the FAA on this topic. In 2006, there was much media attention on the evacuation of 873 people during testing of the Airbus A380, in part due to the use of Airbus employees and a total of 33 injuries. Many industry professionals support examining how tighter seats can affect safety; the Association of Professional Flight Attendants recently stated : “We recognize that seating issues extend beyond evacuation safety, including the potential for increased incidents of air rage.” What you can do In 2016 I wrote about the need for passengers to focus on saving lives — their own and others — rather than retrieving their carry-on bags, with “ Emergency evacuation? Leave your laptop! ” But as vital as it is not to block the aisle of a burning aircraft to retrieve a carry-on, that is just one necessary step. Those injuries I referenced above that were sustained during evacuation drills? It’s educational to focus on them. Many were abrasions from direct skin contact on slides and many were broken feet, ankles and legs from wearing the wrong shoes. So what you do while flying can matter — a lot. • How you dress. Wear clothes that are comfortable and easy to move in but don’t bare too much skin; consider the weather on both ends of the journey in case the worst happens and you need to exit the airplane in harsh climates. Don’t wear flip-flops or other shoes that can easily fall off, but don’t wear spiky heels that will get caught on a slide. • What you drink (and pop): A lot of passengers — particularly fearful ones — like to immediately zone out with eye masks, alcohol and sleeping pills or other pharmaceuticals. Thanks to an exhaustive study by Boeing of all commercial jet accidents between 1959 and 2016, we know the most critical phases of flight are takeoff through climb and descent through landing, when 89% of all fatal accidents occur. Lesson: It pays to be particularly alert and cognizant at the beginning and end of each journey. • How you listen. Of course you’re a frequent flier and you can recite the safety briefing by heart. Really? Have you counted the number of rows to not one but both of the nearest exits, in case you need to feel your way through a cabin that has no lighting and is filled with smoke and will likely have as many as half of the available exits blocked? Please pay attention and be aware. • Keep yourself — and loved ones — safe. Stay buckled up until told otherwise. Follow instructions. And the ONLY safe way for a child under 2 to fly is in an approved safety restraint and not as a “lap child,” even though neither the airlines nor the FAA will mandate this.

KIRK JOHNSON,"Don Bee, a substitute teacher, said he came to school on the first day back just to be a steady presence. What theyve asked me to do is go around and see if teachers need a hand with anything and if someone needs reassurance, Mr. Bee said, as he sat by the front door of an elementary school on Monday morning. Mr. Bee, who retired from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, said he was walking his grandson, Tristan Travers, 6, to school when the earthquake hit. They both went down on all fours, unable to stand as the ground heaved. Tristan was brave, his grandfather said, at least until his mother arrived to get him. Then the tears came. Dawn Wilcox, who teaches second grade, said the quake and its many aftershocks were an essential topic for a conversation on the first day back about science and personal memory. Ms. Wilcox, who grew up in Anchorage, survived a 9.2-magnitude earthquake that shattered southern Alaska in 1964, when she was in third grade. It has been described as the second biggest earthquake in modern world history. I know their anxiety, and how it feels to be a child, and really not knowing when the next earthquake is going to hit, Ms. Wilcox said. The earth is a restless place, she told the children, and earthquakes, especially here in Alaska, are part of that story. This is what planet earth does, she said later. This kind of relieves some anxiety. Before the reopening of schools, officials had raced to be sure that the buildings were not only structurally sound, but also secure in other ways.

George Dvorsky,"The volcano that destroyed Pompeii in 79 AD affected both the citizens of the ancient Roman city and their animal companions, as a remarkable new discovery shows.
The remains of a horse, with its harness and saddle still attached, have been uncovered at the Villa of Mysteries at Pompeii Archaeological Park in Italy, the BBC reports. The formerly luxurious villa is a well-preserved suburban estate on the outskirts of Pompeii that once overlooked the sea. Massimo Osanna, the director general of the park, said the horse likely belonged to a high-ranking military officer, possibly a general, or a high-ranking military magistrate. 
In 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius erupted, peppering the ancient Roman city with ash and rock. A dense, fast-moving cloud of hot gas and debris locked many of its victims in their final death position. Thousands of residents were killed during the eruption, many of whom were trying to flee. Indeed, the condition of the newly discovered horse, with its harness and saddle attached, suggests the animal was being prepared for the evacuation. 
Along with the saddle and harness, archaeologists found fragments of wooden and bronze trimmings, in addition to two other thoroughbred horses, according to the BBC. The Villa of Mysteries and its stable was located along the northern outskirts of the city. 
Like many of Pompeiis inhabitants, the horses likely suffered a fierce and terrible end, in the words of Osanna, suffocating from the falling ash and hot, noxious clouds of volcanic gas.
Archaeologists have been exploring the remains of the Villa of Mysteries, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, since 1909, but the new discovery shows the ancient estate still has tales to tell.

Jared Keller,"A Republic of Korea soldiers from the ROK army 137th Infantry, and U.S. Soldiers from 1-2 Stryker Brigade Combat Team, load a casualty into a black hawk as part of medical evacuation training at Rodriguez Live Fire Complex, South Korea, March 15, 2016. US Army In a potential war with North Korea, the US has a limited ability to evacuate wounded service members from a battlefield in Korea. While the US would maintain an outsize wound-to-kill ratio, North Korea's air defenses could spell trouble for the US' traditional medevac efforts. To solve the problem, the US could add more maneuverable aircraft, improve upon its ground-medevac capabilities — or simply not go to war. With tensions between the U.S. government and North Korea at a historic high, the Department of Defense spent 2017 deterring an armed confrontation with Kim Jong Un’s regime on the Korean peninsula. The Pentagon deployed three carrier strike groups to the Western Pacific for the first time in a decade; stood up THAAD missile defense batteries in South Korea; and deployed squadrons of F-22 and F-35 fighter jets to patrol the skies near Pyongyang. All the stakeholders know that, even with overwhelming U.S. might and decades of wargaming, an invasion involving the 28,500 U.S. troops currently stationed in South Korea could bring massive casualties for military personnel and civilians, including an estimated 20,000 South Korean deaths a day from North Korean artillery. But according to a series of war games conducted last year at the Air War College on Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, the DoD also faces a limited ability to evacuate wounded service members from a battlefield in Korea — an obstacle that could send the U.S. military death toll soaring in an open conflict. The upshot: United States forces in a conventional ground war with North Korea could suffer an outsize wound-to-kill ratio due to those airlift difficulties, political science professor and war scholar Tanisha M. Fazal argues in today’s Washington Post. While the United States has endured nearly 7,000 combat casualties in the course of the military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, those numbers have remained relatively low and stable over time due to the DoD’s overwhelming air superiority in the region (an advantage best captured by the massive rise in bombing sorties against militants in the first year of the Trump administration). Under those conditions, evacuation of casualties by air — the fastest method, and hence the key to making injuries more survivable — is a no-brainer. The distribution of North Korea’s air forces, according to a Nov. 7, 2017 Congressional Research Service report on military options for the U.S. Defense Department Unlike al Qaeda or ISIS jihadists, however, North Korea is ready for an air war: A November 2017 assessment by the Congressional Research Service of the country’s military capabilities conclude that while Pyongyang’s air defenses are relatively outmoded, the North Korean Air Force possesses “a dense, overlapping air defense system of SA-2, SA-3, and SA-5” surface-to-air missile sites and other mobile and man-portable anti-air munitions — and that’s not even counting the Kim regime’s fleet of 1,300 Soviet-era aircraft intent on knocking U.S. assets out of the sky. Add it all together, and those air defenses spell trouble for an opposing force’s traditional medevac efforts. “Modern combat medicine has made great advances in stemming blood loss, for example, but those procedures are typically temporary measures, carried out to keep a patient alive until airlifted to a higher-level, trauma-care facility,” Fazal writes. “That was possible in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the United States had undisputed control of the skies. But it would not be true on the Korean Peninsula, at least at first.” Indeed, a 2012 assessment in Military Medicine found that late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein’s air defense command unit was effective enough during the initial months of the 2003 invasion that the U.S. military scrambled to develop forward-deployed medical and surgical teams to stabilize casualties near an injury point. It’s difficult to assess the DoD’s overall air evacuation capabilities in the event of war with North Korea, given the different system and structure of each branch’s various medical commands. (Air University and the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Task &amp; Purpose). But as part of the the Air War College simulation, the prospect of an aerial medevac for American troops was reduced to near zero through a conventional strike against a U.S. air base in South Korea; that, Fazal observed, forced a radical shift in how medics treat patients. via Scout Warrior “Certain casualties could be saved if air evacuation was possible — but would have little to no hope without evacuation, and thus would receive only palliative care,” Fazal wrote of the simulation. “A base commander would probably require medics to prioritize care for personnel essential to the mission, even if they had less severe injuries than others. Assuming that medicine and medical personnel would not be resupplied, medics would not be able to provide the standard of care to which the U.S. military has become accustomed.” Even without a direct strike on a U.S. staging area, air evacuations would remain a challenge. “Lift in the Pacific is always a problem and has been for years, simply because it’s just so big,” Lindsey Ford, a Asia Society fellow and former advisor to the Pentagon’s assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs, told Task &amp; Purpose. “To have the amount of lift you need to cover the tremendous amount of space, there is always a challenge, whether you’re talking about everyday operations or a unique medevac. Just think about that in the context of how many forces we currently have in the region.” Ford pointed to the 2006 evacuation of U.S. citizens from Lebanon, in which the Pentagon aided the Department of State in extracting 15,000 people over the span of two months in the largest overseas evacuation in U.S. history. While U.S. Central Command was responsible for extracting 90% of the U.S. evacuees to nearby Turkey and Cyprus, a 2007 Government Accountability Office review of the effort found that Israeli strikes on the Beirut airport and subsequent blockades of coastal ports seriously complicated air and sea evacuation efforts. The evacuations were primarily executed by U.S. and British naval flotillas, supplemented by contracted commercial or civilian ships; Marine CH-53 Super Stallion helicopters were used only for the most serious medical cases, primarily because Israeli munitions had “crippled airports, seaports and roads in retaliation for attacks by Hezbollah militants,” the New York Times reported at the time. A CH-53E Super Stallion, used by the Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 463, carries off an A-4 Jet during a sling load operation aboard Barber's Point Naval Air Station, Marine Corps Base Hawaii Thomson Reuters “That was just 15,000 [American civilians] evacuated,” Ford said of the Lebanon evacuation. “There are some 100,000 in Seoul, where, once war starts, there will be between 30,000 and 300,000 dead in just a few days.” There are two options available to the Pentagon to address this problem. The first simply involves improving medevac capabilities by adding more maneuverable aircraft. The Army is addressing this issue with the Future Vertical Lift project, designed to replace the iconic AH-64 Apache attack chopper and UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopter with an aircraft that combines speed and range with versatility and maneuverability. But since 2016, the Army’s Medical Research and Materiel Command has also been exploring the potential deployment of unmanned vehicles to conduct quick and relatively safe medevacs. Last March, Dragonfly Pictures unveiled the DP-14 Hawk as a potential one-man extraction craft; despite resistance to the deployment of robots downrange, a 2014 USAMRMC report stated that unmanned systems “can potentially conduct extraction and/or retrieval of combat casualties on behalf of the first responder and deliver the wounded Soldier (within a short distance) to a safer location.” But even the best aircraft can get held up in the skies or be too far from an extraction site, leaving the standard operating procedure for forward surgical teams as the next best option: Stabilize the patient and wait for the cavalry. The Pentagon has a long-established ground-medevac doctrine utilizing chains of medical outposts that connect a forward operating base to a secure medical facility in the rear. The Army’s Combat Casualty Care Research Program (CCCRP) is working overtime on new tech to accelerate diagnosis and treatment downrange, but the branch admits that “prolonged field care” is the primary capability gap of concern across the entire branch, according to the January/February issue of Army AT&amp;L Magazine. US Army “Experts say future battlefields will require medical efforts to be more assertive at the point of injury as opposed to standard forward aid locations,” Army AT&amp;L notes, “a shift that also radically changes the concept of the ‘golden hour’ standard of care, which relies on traditional medical transport to get service members treated within the first hour after injury.” Given the nature of defense planning, that shift in downrange medical treatment won’t come overnight, but it’s long overdue. Declassified documents from 1994 published by the Guardian last month showed that, while the Pentagon remained convinced it would eke out a victory in war with North Korea, a ground invasion would leave some 490,000 South Koreans and 52,000 U.S. troops wounded or killed in the first three months alone. After 15 years of air superiority in the Middle East and Southwest Asia, it appears the best strategy to avoid a breathtaking casualty rate in a conventional war with North Korea is the exact same as with a nuclear conflict with Pyongyang: The only winning move is not to play.","US Army In a potential war with North Korea, the US has a limited ability to evacuate wounded service members from a battlefield in Korea.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by AJ Dellinger to Gizmodo","Throughout western and central Japan, rains are terrorizing entire villages and triggering deadly landslides. At least four people have already died, and authorities ordered another roughly 210,000 people to evacuate their homes as of Friday. Another two million people are being advised to follow suit. Pacific typhoon season has begun, and it’s bringing “historic” rainfall to this part of the island nation, reports Reuters. The Weather Network connects the recent spate of intense rainfall, in part, to Typhoon Prapiroon, which churned through in the Sea of Japan earlier this week. These rains are set to continue through Sunday—and with them, potentially even more landslides. Meanwhile, another storm, Typhoon Maria, is now a Category 4-equivalent super typhoon, potentially endangering Okinawa and China next week. The entire country is essentially in some type of advisory state with the regions of Nambu and Hokubu seeing emergency warnings. Many other regions are on evacuation advisory. The landslide risk is real, too, with Japanese communities from the west to more central regions up north seeing the highest risk. Already, authorities have had to rush to rescue people buried in landslides, per Reuters. The deaths have been tragic: A 59-year-old man was sucked into a drainage pipe while a fatal gust of wind knocked down an elderly woman. Typhoon season is always scary for Japan. Last year, floods killed at least 30 people in the South. What sucks most is that these events won’t end and they won’t get better. Not with the way we’re warming the planet.

CBS News,"LOS ANGELES -- The devastating blaze that broke out in the densely-populated Sepulveda Pass area last week was caused by a cooking fire, authorities announced Tuesday. The Los Angeles Fire Department stated that arson investigators determined the Skirball Fire -- which broke out in the early-morning hours of Dec. 6 -- was caused by a cooking fire at an encampment in a brush area near the Sepulveda Pass and the 405 Freeway. CBS Los Angeles reports that when firefighters arrived on scene that morning, no one was found in the area, LAFD reports. No arrests have been made. It was unclear if the blaze was considered intentional in nature. LAFD cites the National Park Service as saying that approximately 90 percent of wildfires nationwide are human-caused. The 422-acre Skirball Fire broke out at 4:50 a.m. Dec. 6 on the east side of the 405 Freeway near Mulholland Drive. It destroyed six homes and damaged 12 others, and at one time prompted the evacuation of about 700 homes and an apartment building. It also shut down the 405 Freeway for several hours. One firefighter suffered neck burns and was treated at a hospital, authorities said. Another firefighter suffered minor injuries. As of Tuesday, the fire was 85 percent contained, CBS Los Angeles reports. About 70 firefighters were still working to fully extinguish the blaze. All mandatory evacuation orders were lifted Sunday afternoon for all areas affected by the Skirball Fire. All road closures were also lifted, with no restrictions in place. At its height, evacuation orders covered a 3.2-square-mile area bounded by Mulholland Drive to the north, Sunset Boulevard to the south, the San Diego Freeway to the west and Roscomare Road on the east. The exception to the evacuation order was the Bel-Air Crest housing development, which was not threatened, according to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. The Getty Center and the nearby Skirball Center, both on the west side of the freeway, reopened Friday, when classes at UCLA, Cal State Northridge, Los Angeles Valley College and Santa Monica College resumed. All Los Angeles Unified School District schools in the San Fernando Valley and some on the west side of Los Angeles -- a total of 265 district schools and charter schools -- were closed Thursday and Friday. The Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District closed all of its schools Wednesday and Thursday. The fire burned in the same general area as the devastating Bel-Air Fire of 1961. That blaze destroyed about 500 homes and led to various policy changes, including a prohibition on wood-shingle roofs and the strict requirement to clear brush around properties.","CBS News Illegal cooking fire caused devastating Skirball Fire in Southern Calif., officials say CBS News LOS ANGELES -- The devastating blaze that broke out in the densely-populated Sepulveda Pass area last week was caused by a cooking fire, authorities anno…",2017-12-12T21:40:00Z,"{'id': 'cbs-news', 'name': 'CBS News'}","Illegal cooking fire caused devastating Skirball Fire in Southern Calif., officials say - CBS News",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/skirball-fire-cause-illegal-cooking-fire-los-angeles-fire-department/,https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/12/12/66404cce-d2d9-4a90-a75a-7303855574b3/thumbnail/1200x630/e5542b1b6a542a8a0f2e3fb57d503ca4/gettyimages-887097084.jpg,cbs-news,CBS News,evacuation,1

Videos on social media showed the blaze and explosions on the horizon near Ichnya, Chernihiv region. Around 10,000 people were moved from the area around the depot, about 109 miles (176km) north-east of the capital Kiev, emergency services say. As yet there is no word on casualties or the cause of the blasts. Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman tweeted that local authorities would provide accommodation for the evacuated, and that emergency services were on hand to help people. The initial explosion at the base occurred at around 03:30 local time (00:30 GMT). From 04:22 a 20km radius airspace closure came into effect, emergency services say. Rail and road links in the area are also suspended. Ammunition depot explosions have happened before in Ukraine, as the country continues its fight against pro-Russian separatists in its eastern regions. In September 2017, 28,000 people were evacuated after a huge fire raged at a military arms depot in central Ukraine, while in March that same year an ammo dump at a base near Kharkiv suffered a series of explosions.

Lauren Hernandez,"Residents in Fairfield, Vacaville and dozens of inmates from a nearby correctional facility fled the area as a fast-moving grass fire swept through the area Friday night. The Fairfield Police Department released an alert around 5:30 p.m. announcing evacuations of residents near the Paradise Valley Golf Course east of Interstate 80 in the north part of the city, officials said. Evacuation orders extended as the erratic Nelson Fire started moving east late Friday night. Shortly before 7:30, residents in Vacaville’s Gold Ridge housing development were evacuated as the wind-blown blaze marched eastward. As residents heeded mandatory evacuation orders in both cities, roughly 45 minimum security inmates from the California Medical Facility in Vacaville were relocated to an undisclosed located before 8 p.m., according to Terry Thornton, the deputy press secretary of California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The minimum security inmates, who live outside the perimeter of the facility in dormitories, were the only inmates to be relocated as of 8 p.m. Friday. The facility houses roughly 2,400 inmates. The neighboring California State Prison Solano, which is adjacent to the facility, houses roughly 4,000 inmates and did not relocate any inmates by 8 p.m., Thornton said. “Things are moving so rapidly,” Thornton said. “There is really thick smoke in the area.” Thornton said corrections officials are monitoring the fire and smoke and will evacuate if needed. Some residents in the area evacuated on their own when Vacaville Police Department first advised residents to shelter in place around 6:45 p.m., officials said. In video posted on Twitter, flames and plumes of smoke could be seen running parallel to the tree line separating dozens of homes in Fairfield’s Paradise Valley. In another area, firefighters set up a post at a cul de sac, spraying the growing blaze creeping just a few hundred feet from homes. The grass fire, just off Interstate 80 in Fairfield, could be seen rising in the hills, video showed. Police officers were helping evacuate homes in those areas, according to the alert. Officials were also working to evacuate residents and staff of senior living facilities in the area, authorities said. Seniors are being transported to an evacuation center at Fairfield High School. Fairfield residents can also find shelter at the high school, officials said. Everyone should avoid the area while the evacuation alert is in effect, officials said.

Jennings Brown,"Nearly 30 workers at an e-cigarette plant in Salem, Massachusetts were hospitalized following a mysterious incident. Firefighters were first called to the Thermal Circuit plant around 3:30pm Sunday afternoon to investigate a chlorine leak. A hazardous material team then came to the plant and took care of the chlorine issue, acting Salem Fire Chief Gerry Giunta told Gizmodo. The hazmat crew waited until there were no more readings of chlorine in the building and then left at 8:25pm. As result, a building was closed and no injuries were reported at the time, said Giunta. Then, authorities got another call from the plant at 9:17pm, reporting that several workers had fallen ill and the building was being evacuated. Salem Deputy Fire Chief Alan Dionne told CBS Boston that “there seemed to be a panic in the building.” Workers fled out of the plant in what Dionne called a “mass hysteria.” Giunta said that all but one of the workers had been treated and released. One worker had a seizure, but Giunta could not say if that was related to the incident. He said HIPAA laws prevented the doctors from sharing information about the illnesses. The hazmat team returned after the alarming report of evacuation and illnesses, but found no traces of chlorine. “It’s not a standard thing by any means.” Giunta told Gizmodo. “I’m kind of bewildered at it because there were zero readings when we left [initially, at 8:25pm]. I’m at a loss to tell you exactly what happened.” Massachusetts fire services spokesperson Jennifer Mieth told Gizmodo that hazmat teams finally left the plant, for a second time, at 2:30am early Monday morning, after finding no traces of harmful chemicals. “Entry teams covered the entire building with a variety of meters and found no contaminant that would be hazardous,” she said. Mieth did offer another possibility for why workers might have fallen ill. “New carpeting was being installed in the building that did leave odors but no hazardous or dangerous readings were detected,” Mieth told Gizmodo. “Whether or not that was connected to the symptoms people experienced is unknown.” Both Mieth and Giunta said Occupational Safety and Health Administration planned on sending an industrial hygienist to the plant today to conduct a through investigation.

They steered around mailboxes, branches, pulverized decking and other debris that could blow out the propeller. When the water got too shallow and the boat scraped bottom, the men hopped out and waded, grabbing pieces of fence post and siding to sound the depth of the water in front of them. Finally, a blue two-story house on Summer Haven Lane emerged from the trees. As they approached, a woman’s palm pressed up against a dark second-story window. “Hey!

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"According to Delta’s upcoming new requirements for service and emotional support animals, only Very Good Girls and Boys are allowed. The airline announced in a press release on Friday that all owners must provide proof of their animal’s vaccinations or other health records 48 hours before traveling. They must also sign a document attesting that their animal is well-behaved—although no proof of training is required. A Delta spokesperson said in an email to Gizmodo that to prove their animal is well-behaved, a customer can sign a form available on the airline’s website. Delta noted that the new regulations, which will go into effect on March 1st, aim to create safer flights without negatively impacting passengers with legitimate needs. The airline noted that it recorded “an 84 percent increase in reported animal incidents since 2016” and that staffers had reported an uptick in acts of aggression last year. The Associated Press reports that one incident included a support dog repeatedly biting another passenger in the face. “The rise in serious incidents involving animals in flight leads us to believe that the lack of regulation in both health and training screening for these animals is creating unsafe conditions across U.S. air travel,” John Laughter, Delta’s senior vice president of corporate safety, security, and compliance, said a statement. Even passengers with documented needs aren’t allowed to bring certain animals on board, even if they are proven healthy and Very Good. The list of impermissible animals, according to Delta’s Service and Support Animals page, includes: hedgehogs, ferrets, insects, rodents, snakes and other reptiles, amphibians, spiders, sugar gliders, goats, non-household birds, smelly and dirty animals, and “animals with tusks, horns, or hooves.” According to Delta, the new rules aren’t intended to make it more difficult for those with real emotional needs and medical issues to bring their service and support animals on flights. It’s already illegal for airlines to charge passengers fee s for either service and emotional support animals as long as they don’t take up space in aisles or emergency evacuation areas, according to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Rather, the new regulations aim to ensure that people with misbehaved or dangerous animals aren’t creating an unsafe environment while also making it harder for people who may take advantage of lenient regulations to bring their pets onboard.

Typhoon Jongdari (or ""skylark"" in Korean), is expected to make landfall on the country's main island, Honshu, late on Saturday or early on Sunday. The storm comes less than a month after floods killed more than 200 people, and then a heatwave left dozens dead. Japan's Meteorological Agency has told locals to be ready for evacuation. At 18:05 local time (09:05 GMT) Jongdari was situated about 200km south of Tokyo and forecast to make landfall close to the city of Nagoya. More than eight million people were ordered to leave their homes earlier in July when torrential rain saw rivers burst their banks, but some became trapped after failing to heed the order. Critics said the official warning came too late, and officials are urging those in disaster-struck areas to stay vigilant.

Forecasters say the area around the capital could see 40cm (15in) of rain in 24 hours from noon on Saturday. The floods earlier in July were Japan's worst weather disaster in decades, and were swiftly followed by an unprecedented heatwave which has been declared a natural disaster. At least 80 people have been killed by the temperature, and more than 22,000 hospitalised with heat stroke.

Five people died in the accident, though the pilot survived, and investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board are on the scene. (Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA-EFE) WASHINGTON – The Federal Aviation Administration banned open-door helicopter tours Friday because of concerns that extra restraints could hinder emergency evacuation, after the deaths of five people in a New York City crash Sunday. The FAA said operators, pilots and consumers should be aware of the hazard created with extra restraints that hold passengers inside helicopters, but could hinder an emergency evacuation. “The FAA will order operators and pilots to take immediate actions to control or mitigate this risk,” the agency said in a statement. “Until then, the FAA will order no more “doors off” operations that involve restraints that cannot be released quickly in an emergency.” A Liberty Helicopters tour crashed into the East River, killing the five passengers and injuring the pilot. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating what caused the crash. But emergency responders said they had to cut passengers out of their restraints in the helicopter, which rolled over in the water. Investigators said Thursday that they’ve taken apart the Airbus AS350 B2 helicopter’s engine and found no abnormalities, along with no pre-crash damage to the helicopter. Investigators also have interviewed the accident pilot, who had told city officials that a passenger’s bag might have hit the emergency fuel shutoff. FAA also said it will conduct a top-to-bottom review of its rules governing helicopter flights, to examine any potential policies that could create safety gaps for passengers.

They later revised the affected streets to those along I-5 from Exit 707 to Exit 714. Underhill didn't know how many homes were evacuated, since she said it's a rural area with scattered residences. For those who did leave, an evacuation center is open at the Mount Shasta Community Building, 629 Alder Street. For the city of Dunsmuir, it's just an evacuation warning, which means residents don't have to leave yet — but should be ready to, just in case. Siskiyou County Sheriff Jon Lopey said the fire seems to have slowed, but since it's burning about 15 miles from the city, residents of Dunsmuir should make sure their cars are ready and their belongings are in place. He recommended making sure you have a full tank of gas, securing valuables and packing medications, important papers and heirlooms. People should also make arrangements for their pets to be safe, he said. Buy Photo The Delta Fire by Wednesday evening was burning more than 2,000 acres north of Redding.

She and her big rig were parked on the side of I-5 just north of Lakehead on Wednesday night because she said officers pulled her over and told her she couldn't leave until they gave her the go-ahead. Acevedo said she was driving her truck north from Chino, trying to get to Eugene, Oregon, when it all started. She said it was ""freaky"" because she had never been that close to a forest fire. ""It was like something in a book,"" Acevedo said. ""I really feel sad when fires start because they affect everybody — nature, people."" Acevedo found herself dealing with more than fire, though. When she turned her truck around, she said she had to drive across the highway center divider. When she did, she got a nail in one of the tires of her truck trailer. As the sun set and the night wore on, she could do nothing but wait alongside the highway and hope her tire didn't go flat. ""I don't like wasting time, and I'm wasting time standing still,"" Acevedo said. A truck driver got stuck trying to negotiate a hairpin turn on Highway 3 north of Trinity Center in Trinity County. Highway 3 was used as a detour around I-5 while it was closed Wednesday during the Delta Fire. (Photo: photo courtesy of Preston Arthur) Other truckers and motorists chose detours. Some trucks tried to go up Highway 3 through Trinity County and the Scott Valley in Siskiyou County, and at least one got stuck trying to make a hairpin turn on Highway 3 north of Trinity Center. Road closures and traffic jams Earlier, traffic was also backing up as major roads closed in the area of the fire — namely, northbound I-5 at the Fawndale exit and southbound I-5 at the intersection of Highway 89. There's no estimated time for the freeway to open again. Hauling out the wrecked vehicles will add to the time it takes for I-5 to open back up, Hinkson said. ""It's just too dangerous to let cars go through there,"" he said. The Caltrans camera on Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018 shows the Delta Fire as it burns north of the area. (Photo: California Department of Transportation) Officials later reported a new closure on Interstate 5 at Riverview Drive in the Lakehead area. At one point, a second fire broke out on a right shoulder of the road near the Delta Fire, but it wasn't clear whether it was related. Underhill said the same interagency team handling the Hirz Fire is taking over the firefight. ""They're the best of the best,"" she said. ""They handle the most complex incidents."" Vaccaro said people can call 530-498-0953 for fire information or email deltafireshf@gmail.com. In Siskiyou County, people with special needs, mobility issues or no transportation should call the sheriff's office at 530-841-2900.

Rebecca Ruiz,"The fires consuming parts of Southern California have moved rapidly since breaking out a few days ago. The Thomas Fire, a blaze in Ventura County, has already claimed 90,000 acres. The fires have collectively led to the evacuation of more than 200,000 residents, according to news reports. There are numerous efforts underway to aid survivors, who may have fled wearing only the clothes on their backs and may not know the fate of their homes for days. By Wednesday, the Red Cross had opened seven shelters to provide refuge for survivors in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties. SEE ALSO: The combustible mix behind Southern California's terrifying wildfires If you'd like to contribute to the rescue and recovery efforts, consider the following initiatives: 1.

Andrew Freedman,"Thursday looks to be a pivotal, frightening day in Southern California's battle against a wildfire siege that began early this week and has since spread out of control. At least three large fires are currently burning in and around Los Angeles, including one — the Thomas Fire — which has already burned at least 90,000 acres near Ventura. Early Thursday morning, authorities closed the 101 Freeway in both directions due to strong winds pushing fire close to the road, cutting off movement between Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. Evacuation orders have gone out for idyllic communities in the Ojai Valley, as well as parts of Santa Barbara, as flames move toward the coast, according to the LA Times. More evacuations are likely on Thursday. SEE ALSO: Wildfires lead to hellish scenes for Los Angeles commuters The weather conditions on Thursday are downright dire, with strong, damaging winds rushing through mountain passes and down hillsides toward the coast. This will create extraordinarily dry air, and make any new fires or ones that are already in progress extremely difficult, if not impossible, to control. California’s fire history is replete with Santa Ana-driven, damaging blazes. However, the combination of factors present on Thursday — powerful winds, preexisting fires, desiccated vegetation, and also population growth — make it stand out as an especially risky day for the state. According to news reports, more than 200,000 people have been evacuated due to the fires, and this number may climb as the winds interact with the fires to push them in new directions at a faster clip. According to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC), which forecasts the risk of wildfires based on anticipated weather conditions, fire weather is likely to be ""extremely critical"" — a rare designation reserved for only the most threatening situations — in a swath of Southern California on Thursday. These combustible conditions are going to affect about 9.5 million people, the SPC forecasts. Another 10.7 million people reside in a ""critical"" fire weather zone, including the city of Los Angeles. Elevated fire risk is forecast for Southern California straight through Saturday. ""Large fire spread and extreme fire behavior will occur with any new/ongoing fires,"" the SPC said in a forecast discussion. Average temperatures across California during the summer months (June, July, and August) in 2017. Image: NOAA The high winds may prevent aircraft, including helicopters and heavy water bombers, from doing their work, as well. This further inhibits firefighters' ability to contain these blazes. The National Weather Service is predicting strong winds to last all day on Thursday. The winds have already exceeded hurricane force in some high elevation areas, with gusts above 75 miles per hour. While wildfires are a typical occurrence in Southern California each fall, when the dry, offshore Santa Ana winds blow, the current blazes are occurring later in the year than normal. In addition, conditions in the region are far drier than they normally would be. These fires are an illustration of how short-term weather variability can interact with longer-term climate trends to create a precedent-setting, potentially deadly extreme event. A fire sends embers all over residential neighborhoods north of Ventura, Calif. on Dec. 5, 2017. Image: Marcus Lam/LA Times via Getty Images ""The risk of large wildfires in coastal California typically peaks in Autumn after the long dry summers — typical of California’s Mediterranean climate — increase the flammability of the vegetation that fuels wildfires,"" LeRoy Westerling, a scientist researching climate and wildfire at the University of California at Merced, said in an email. ""The overlap between the dry fuels and these warm dry wind events marks the peak fire risk for the year in coastal California,"" Westerling said. ""Usually, Autumn rains put an end to the fire season by wetting fuels and raising humidity, even though wind events may continue to occur."" The problem is, Westerling noted, it hasn't rained much in Southern California since March. The state also had its hottest summer on record, which dried out the vegetation that grew after one of its wettest winters, forming a perfect weather whiplash combo that is conducive to igniting large fires. ""Southern California has remained unusually dry through November and into December this year, extending the high fire risk fueled by the confluence of dry conditions and Autumn winds that are driving the large fires burning in coastal Southern California,"" Westerling said. While these fires cannot be directly tied to climate change, since they were most likely ignited by downed power lines or arson, they are consistent with what scientists expect to occur more frequently from a warming, drying climate in much of California. The entire American West, in fact, is likely to see — and in many cases has already seen — an increase in the size and frequency of large wildfires. ""Climate change is increasing the variability of precipitation as well as increasing temperatures,"" Westerling said. ""This means that the probability of extremely large wind-driven fires in California occurring later in the year is increasing.""","Thursday looks to be a pivotal, frightening day in Southern California's battle against a wildfire siege that began early this week and has since spread out of control.

Patrick Allan,"Plane travel is incredibly safe—your odds of dying on a commercial flight are about one in 11 million —but accidents still happen and travelers sometimes make it to a different kind of final destination. Many past fatalities may, however, have been avoidable. Here’s the safety info you should be up on in case you go down. https://lifehacker.com/six-airplane-facts-to-cure-your-fear-of-flying-1788654431 Before we get too far into this, you should know that no two airplane accidents are the same and incidents can vary wildly. There is no consistent way to avoid a plane crash, and no methods that guarantee survival. For example, a plane that nose-dives into the ground before bursting into a ball of flame isn’t a survivable incident no matter what you do. That said, most accidents are not like that. Even if your flight has an incident, the National Transportation Safety Board estimates there’s a 95% chance of survival. As John Hansman, director of the International Center for Air Transportation, puts it, “Riding on a commercial airplane has got about the same amount of risk as riding on an escalator.” Sit in the Back of the Plane Location, location, location. Where you choose to sit may greatly affect your odds of survival in a plane crash, depending on the incident. A few years ago, TIME magazine scoured Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aircraft Accident Database statistics and seating charts to look for trends over the course of 35 years. Here’s what they found : Seats in the rear third of the aircraft had a 32% fatality rate. Seats in the middle third had a 39% fatality rate. Seats in the front third had a 38% fatality rate. This suggests the safest part of the plane to sit is the rear third of the aircraft. Basic economy, baby. Moreover, the middle seats in that back third of the aircraft had the lowest fatality rate of all seats at 28%. Hope you like sharing armrests. The seats with the highest fatality rate were aisle seats in the middle third of the cabin at 44%. Popular Mechanics performed a similar study in 2007 with similar findings. Their analysis suggests that passengers sitting behind the wing of the aircraft had a 40% greater chance of surviving than the passengers in the front of the plane. The numbers regarding whether you should sit in the aisle, middle, or window seat aren’t exactly consistent, however. A separate study from University of Greenwich found that aisle seats actually provided a marginally higher chance of survival, so it’s honestly a bit of a crap shoot in that regard. Of course, as I mentioned earlier, it all depends on the incident itself. There are plenty of examples out there, like United Airlines Flight 232, where the front of the plane was safer, they’re just fewer in number. Wherever you choose to sit, just make it a seat on a big plane. Larger commercial planes have a larger number of redundant systems, have a lower accident rate, and can absorb more force during impact. Remember the “Five Row Rule” A majority of plane crash fatalities occur because passengers are unable to exit the plane in time after an emergency landing. To give yourself a better shot of getting out in time, always consider what Professor Ed Galea of the University of Greenwich calls the “Five Row Rule.” After studying 105 plane crashes and interviewing over 2,000 surviving passengers and crew members, Galea found that survivors move an average of five rows before escaping safely. Always pick a seat within five rows of an emergency exit. If you can, grab a seat right next to an exit, or one just a single row away. Galea says sitting more than five rows away from an exit means “the chances of perishing far outweigh those of surviving.” It’s no guarantee, of course, but the logic is sound. The further you have to travel inside a burning plane, the lower your chances of actually making it out. Regardless of where you sit, Cheryl Schwartz, a retired flight attendant for United Airlines, highly recommends you count how many rows you are away from the nearest emergency exit, no matter how familiar you think you are with the aircraft. Double check if you have to. That way, if the cabin fills with smoke and your visibility is impaired, you can still find your way out. https://lifehacker.com/where-to-sit-on-an-airplane-for-a-smoother-ride-1787059815 Dress Appropriately As I mentioned before, the impact itself isn’t what causes most fatalities in plane accidents. According to a report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the FAA, 68% of occupants involved in aircraft accidents die from post-crash fires—either from burn injuries or smoke inhalation. The European Transport Safety Council (ETSC) had similar findings. They estimated that 90% of aircraft accidents are survivable, and that at least 40% of the fatalities in past accidents were actually survivable. A large portion of those instances were fire-related. To limit your time on board a burning aircraft, and to avoid severe burns, Cynthia Corbett, a human factors specialist at the Federal Aviation Administration’s Civil Aerospace Medical Institute, suggests you should dress like you need to run away from a burning plane : “If you have to do that, how well are your flip-flops going to perform? How well are your high-heeled shoes going to perform? When you’re sliding down that fabric slide out of the plane, are pantyhose going to withstand? Shorts and skirts and high-heeled shoes just are not our preferred attire for flying, because it’s hard to run in those kinds of shoes and actually escape when you’re not clothed properly. We like to see tie-on shoes that you’re not going to run out of and long pants. Jeans are good. I know in the summer that’s really tough, but short-shorts are just real dangerous in that event...” It’s a good idea to have a long-sleeved t-shirt or jacket as well. Make sure your clothing is made out of 100% cotton or wool so they won’t melt. Do not wear synthetic fabrics. Sorry, I know they’re comfy. And it doesn’t hurt to pack a handkerchief in your jacket pocket just in case you need something to cover your face. You can wet it with the water they hand out and create a temporary breathing mask. Listen to Flight Attendants and Read the Safety Card I know, it’s a drag, and you’ve heard it a billion times, but it’s a good idea to listen to that speech the flight attendants give before takeoff. I get that you know how to put on a seat belt—I mean, you know how to read this right now so you must have the intelligence required to understand basic seat belt mechanisms—but flight attendants are still giving you valuable information. They show you where exits are, demonstrate how to use flotation vests and oxygen masks (which you definitely need to know how to do quickly), and the safety card will have evacuation routes on them that you should absolutely be aware of. But you know all that stuff, right? You’ve flown so many times you could repeat it all by memory! I doubt it. According to a report from the FAA, frequent fliers proved to be the least informed and most complacent of all passengers. Listen to the speech or video, look at the safety card, and develop a plan for yourself and loved ones so you can spring into action the moment something happens. You won’t have time to make a plan later. https://lifehacker.com/how-i-beat-my-fear-of-flying-1052703615 Follow the “Plus Three, Minus Eight Rule” It’s true that most plane accidents occur during takeoff or landing, and there’s a time window for when these incidents most commonly take place: sometime during the three minutes after takeoff; and sometime during the eight minutes before landing. In The Survivor’s Club, author Ben Sherwood explains that 80% of all plane crashes actually happen during this time. To increase your odds of survival during one of those incidents, you should pay attention be vigilant during those times. That means no sleeping, no listening to music, no taking off your shoes, no being sloppy drunk or drugged out, and no unbuckling your seat belt during that time window. Stay aware and be ready to execute your plan of action. Know How to Brace for Impact So it’s happening; you’re going down and the flight crew has warned you to brace for impact. What do you do? If you have time, Corbett suggests you remove sharp objects from your pockets (like pens, pencils, and keys), and stuff your carry-on belongings under the seat in front of you. This keeps the area clear for you and other passengers to walk after the impact, but it also pads the legs and blocks them from going under the seat in front of you. You’ll reduce the likelihood of breaking your legs and hindering your escape. Once you’ve prepared, it’s time to assume the position. First, put on your seat belt. Then, how you brace depends on where you are seated: If you have a seat in front of you : Cross your hands on the seat in front of and rest your forehead on top your hands. This will help reduce whiplash and head injuries. If you don’t have a seat in front of you : Bend over as far as possible, grab your legs around your knees, and keep your head down until you feel the plane stop. Place your hands on the back of your head, dominant hand first. If you’re unsure about your seat, review your safety card before takeoff. It will have the instructions you need to know for your specific aircraft. And make sure your seat belt is on tight. The more slack you have in your seat belt the more G-force your body will experience during impact. Be Ready to Get Out of the Plane Super Fast Okay, you’ve survived the impact of the crash landing and people are yelling and scrambling about. Don’t sit around in a daze. Schwartz says there’s a phenomenon where people sit around surprised they survived the crash, then wait for rescue: “Most crashes are survivable. Yet, with survivable crashes, crash scene investigators find passengers without a scratch on them still belted in their seats, dead.” Get out! Fire and smoke are almost certainly coming. As Sherwood explains in The Survivor’s Club, you have about 90 seconds to escape the cabin before the fire burns through the plane’s aluminum fuselage and gets to you. Ideally, you’ve got your capable shoes on, clothes that won’t melt into your skin, and you wet a handkerchief before the impact so you have something to breathe through. Now you need to follow your designated evacuation route. If you sat near an exit as planned, that’s good. If you didn’t, hopefully you’ve been hitting the gym. The FAA notes that fit young people tend to make it out alive more often than older, more heavy-set folks (evacuation times can differ up to 31%). https://lifehacker.com/how-to-tread-water-efficiently-1819386226 Why? You need to move quickly, slide through narrow aisles, clear wreckage and luggage strewn about, and possibly have to physically move blockage. Climbing seats to reach an exit isn’t ideal, as it can create more congestion at exits, but if it’s your only way out, take it. Once you’re out, get away from the wreckage as fast as possible. You don’t want to survive impact then manage to escape, only to be killed by shrapnel with the plane decides to explode. Now, take a deep breath, and thank your lucky stars you knew what to do.","Plane travel is incredibly safe—your odds of dying on a commercial flight are about one in 11 million —but accidents still happen and travelers sometimes make it to a different kind of final destination.

It is the second major emission from the Indonesian island volcano this week, and flights have been disrupted. The red warning means an eruption is forecast to be imminent, with significant emission of ash likely. Authorities have begun distributing masks in areas amid ash fall. Bali is a major tourist destination, although the main destinations of Kuta and Seminyak are about 70km (43 miles) from the volcano. The island's main airport is for now operating normally, but some airlines have cancelled flights over fears as volcanic ash can damage plane engines.

Eric Niiler,"The record-setting floods deluging the Midwest are about to get a lot worse. Fueled by rapidly melting snowpack and a forecast of more rainstorms in the next few weeks, federal officials warn that 200 million people in 25 states face a risk through May. Floodwaters coursing through Nebraska have already forced tens of thousands of people to flee and have caused $1.3 billion in damage.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its spring flood outlook Thursday, predicting that two-thirds of the country is at risk of ""major to moderate flooding,"" from Fargo, North Dakota on the Red River of the North down to Nashville, Tennessee, on the Cumberland River. The floods from the past two weeks have compromised 200 miles of levees in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers.
The rains and floods are expected to continue through May and become more dire, according to Ed Clark, director of NOAAs National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, Clark said, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities.
A combination of heavy snowfall in late February, tropical rains and wet snow from the bomb cyclone that swept across the country a week ago and frozen or saturated ground surfaces have set the stage for the floods. Ice jams on top of frozen waterways are adding to the problem by diverting floodwaters out of river channels and sending them onto land. Its not looking like we are going to see any dry stretches anytime soon, says Thomas Graziano, director of the water prediction center at the National Weather Service.
Officials say the entire Mississippi River basin has received 3 times as much rainfall as in a normal year.
And it's not done falling yet. More rainstorms are expected to hit the Midwest over the next eight to 10 days. That precipitation will be like water running over concrete, Graziano says. Graziano says he expects this years flood levels to top the disastrous floods that hit the Missouri River in May 2011 and the Red River in North Dakota and Minnesota in 2009.
This winters big snowpack is fueling the floods. In the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota, more than 20 inches of snow remains on the ground. The Missouri, Ohio and Mississippi Rivers drain the central United States, but it takes several weeks for the water to travel downstream. In the meantime, emergency officials are warning local residents to make an evacuation plan as well as purchase flood insurance in certain areas.
Climate scientists say it's too early to tell exactly to what degree human-induced climate change has affected this spring flood cycle, but they note that the watery disaster is following a pattern of extreme weather events across the United States. There's about 10 percent more moisture available in the environment as a result of global climate change, says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.
Under the right conditions, that extra moisture can be amplified into 30 percent more rainfall during an extreme weather event such as a hurricane, bomb cyclone or the series of storms that has hit the Midwest, Trenberth explains.
""The extra fuel from global warming is what keeps [a storm] going,"" he says. ""And it's what turns it from a billion-dollar disaster to a $10 to $50 billion disaster.""

NICOLE STEPHENS,"During survey interviews, survivors who stayed focused on interdependence, emphasizing themes of sticking together, religious faith and communal and family ties. In fact, over two-thirds of those who stayed explicitly discussed the importance of connections to others. “We had a good community” one Katrina survivor in the New Orleans area said. “All the people here help one another.” Another said, “I was worried and not only for myself, but for a lot of the people.” As critics of storm holdouts may suspect, nearly half of those who stayed also discussed the importance of being tough or strong in the face of hardship, but this was never the sole factor. The silver lining of residents weathering a dangerous storm with one another is visible in the ways communities come together in a chaotic aftermath to share boats, food, and emergency supplies. Such acts of neighborly bravery have been caught on camera, or retold on social media, during ad hoc rescue operations for multiple hurricanes. These benefits may especially resonate with working-class Americans, who are more likely to think of themselves as part of a broader social network, with responsibilities to vulnerable neighbors; in contrast, members of the middle- and upper-class, who tend to evacuate, are more likely to think of themselves as independent families, free to come and go as they please. Considering the government’s slow and inept response to recent natural disasters, it is not surprising that people — especially those in working-class and minority communities — frequently do not trust the government’s disaster preparation. When the sentiment that the government doesn’t care about “people like us” is widespread, the likelihood of those people complying with mandatory evacuation orders drops. Like Hurricane Katrina before it, the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, in 2017, was a tragic reminder that our government desperately needs to improve its ability to respond effectively to the immediate and long-term needs of citizens who endure natural disasters.","Jay Allen swam in the pool at his residence in Garden Beach, S.C., on Thursday, having decided to ignore an order to evacuate the day before Hurricane Florence makes landfall.",2018-09-14T10:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Why Do People Stay When a Hurricane Comes?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/opinion/hurricane-maria-staying-home.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/14/opinion/14nicolestephens/14nicolestephens-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,evacuation,1

"USA TODAY, John Bacon, USA TODAY","Rescuers airlift stranded cruise ship passengers off the coast of Norway.
 USA TODAY
Norwegian authorities on Monday began investigating why a cruise ship was sailing in stormy weather when it developed engine trouble that triggered a perilous helicopter evacuation effort for hundreds of terrified passengers.
""We don't know the reason why the ship sailed knowing such bad weather was forecast,"" Kurt Olsen, an acting director for Norway's Accident Investigations Board, told USA TODAY. ""We have a very good weather service in this country, so I would guess the crew knew everything about the forecast. How they responded will definitely be part of the investigation.""
Twenty-eight people were treated for injuries and nine remained hospitalized Monday, one critically, authorities said.
The Viking Sky was sailing from the northern city of Tromsoe bound for Stavanger in southern Norway when the ship began struggling with engine failure, started listing dangerously and then began taking in water. Norwegian media reported gusts up to 43 mph and waves over 26 feet. 
Cellphone footage from the ship shows furniture sliding across rooms as the boat rocks.

The crew issued a mayday call and a team of helicopters airlifted almost 500 of the 900 passengers to safety Saturday night and Sunday morning. The ship, aided by tow vessels, finally limped into the Norwegian port of Molde later Sunday, freeing the remaining 436 passengers and crew of 458.
""The ship drifted to within 100 meters of running aground before they were able to restart one of the engines,"" Hans Vik, chief of the Joint Rescue Coordination Center for southern Norway, told the nation's TV2. ""If they had run aground we would have faced a major disaster.""
Olsen would not speculate why the Viking Sky captain decided to sail despite the weather warning. He said ship operations were one part of the investigation, along with a technical study of why the engines failed and third review of how the rescue was handled.

""It's really early in the investigation, so we just don't know much yet,"" Olsen said.
Yngve Skovly, a police inspector in the Molde region, told the Verdens Gang tabloid there was no suspicion of criminal behavior and that the ship was too new to suspect maintenance problems. But he said crucial information could be obtained from the ship's computer logs.
Torstein Hagen, chairman of ship owner Viking Ocean Cruises, said his company would conduct its own investigation and support government agencies reviewing the mishap. All passengers were expected to be flown out on Norway by Monday night, police said. 
""The last few days have been both dramatic and hectic for guests and crew on board Viking Sky,"" Hagen said in the statement. ""I would like to apologize for all our guests having been through.""
The cruise had been scheduled to wrap up Tuesday in the British port of Tilbury on the River Thames. The passengers were mostly an English-speaking and many Americans were aboard.
Rodney Horgana said a huge wave crashed through the ships glass doors and swept his wife 30 feet across the floor.
When the windows and door flew open and the 2 meters (6 feet) of water swept people and tables 20 to 30 feet, that was the breaker,"" Horgan told the Associated Press. ""I said to myself, This is it.
Another American, Beth Clark, told Norwegian news outlet Dagbladet how she was plucked off the ship.
""The guy came down from the helicopter ... snapped my belt and said, 'Hold it,' and shot me up about 100 feet in the air,"" she said. Someone then ""grabbed me and pulled me in like a sack of potatoes and dragged me to the back of the helicopter.""
American Jan Terbruegn told Dagbladet there was little time for panic.
""We could see that we were getting blown in toward some rocks,"" he said. ""That was the most frightening thing I think. But luckily that wasn't our destiny.""

"For USA TODAY, Julia Thompson and Fran Golden, For USA TODAY","Norwegian authorities are investigating why the Viking Sky cruise ship sailed despite a weather warning, leading to engine failure, a mayday call and air evacuations.
 USA TODAY
When Viking Cruises announced an ocean cruise itinerary that would allow travelers the ""rare opportunity to explore the far north in Norways winter,"" it boasted of being ""the first U.S. cruise line to offer a full-length itinerary in the Arctic Circle in the winter season.""
The big attraction was what's happening the sky. Adventurous tourists head to Norway in the winter to get a glimpse of the Northern Lights, a magical natural light display also known as the aurora borealis. 
But passengers last week experienced more than they bargained for aboard a 12-day cruise on the Viking Sky as the ship met with engine failure in stormy seas, issued a mayday call, evacuated about half its passengers via helicopter and finally limped to safety into the nearby port of Molde, Norway. One crew member, who spoke exclusively to USA TODAY and requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, described a terrifying ordeal of broken glass, an airborne piano and the crew's human chain to distribute life jackets as the ship listed dangerously.  
Exclusive: Crew member recounts what happened on that Viking Sky cruise ship
The harrowing experience raises the question of whether Viking was adequately prepared for unusual circumstances in the far north. 
""The average ship undergoes dozens of announced and unannounced safety inspections per year, involving hundreds of man hours and covering thousands of specific requirements set by the International Maritime Organization and flag nations around the world,"" Sarah Kennedy, spokeswoman for the trade group Cruise Lines International Association, says in a statement sent to USA TODAY.
When asked if Viking Ocean Cruises took extra precautions in advance of the season to prepare for winter weather, Viking spokesman Ian Jeffries told USA TODAY: ""Viking Sky is an ocean-going vessel built to the highest standards. It is designed to sail worldwide. It had onboard two experienced local Norwegian pilots who were there to advise the captain.""
Norwegian officials opened an investigation into the incident Monday. 
Viking Sky cruise timeline: A breakdown of what we know happened
Will Viking continue winter voyages in Norway? 
The next scheduled trip for the Viking Sky, a visit to Scandinavia and Germany that was expected to leave Wednesday, has been canceled.
Viking Cruises was established as Viking River Cruises in 1997, and the ocean division began operating its first vessel in 2015. The Viking Ocean fleet includes six identical ships, including one that is scheduled to do the Norway route in early 2020.

""Viking Star is scheduled for next winter in Norway. Based on what happened, I would think Viking Ocean may be rethinking this,"" says Mike Driscoll, editor of leading travel industry newsletter Cruise Week.  
Passengers on such voyages tend to be veteran cruisers. ""These are passengers who have done 10 to 20 cruises with high-end lines. They are looking for other places to go, other cruise experiences,"" Driscoll says. ""That explains the acceptance of cruising in Norway in winter to see the Northern Lights, even at the risk of rough seas.""
""Of course, no one expected this incident,"" he adds, ""but they knew it's not the Mediterranean in summer.""
Driscoll says he doubts Viking will do the same itinerary next year. ""It would be foolish if they were ever going to do winter in Norway again.""

Questions abound regarding engine failure
Viking touts the ""Viking difference"" on its website: ""Ships are small to get guests closer to their destination, with more time in port and more overnights."" Viking Sky is a 745-foot, 930-guest ship. With the crew, the cruise ship was carrying 1,373 people on its hapless voyage. 
But the size of the ship may matter less than ship operations and what's under the hood when it comes to safety. 
""Everyone is wondering what happened. We don't have any answers yet,"" Driscoll says regarding Viking Sky's engine issues. ""When someone evacuates, it's usually because of a fire or water coming in through a hole, and none of those factors was apparent here.""

When asked how the four engines of the Viking Sky could go out at the same time, Jeffries, the Viking spokesman, said that a probe is underway. ""This is currently being investigated by us and the relevant authorities and at this stage, it is too early speculate.""
One of the Norwegian pilots on the ship said Tuesday the weather situation was made worse when the engine problems appeared, according to The Associated Press. The ship was caught amid wind gusts up to 43 mph and waves over 26 feet. 
Inge Lockert told the Vesteraalen newspaper that ""everything went as it should until we got engine problems.""  
""It was a very big team effort,"" he told the news outlet. ""When we got the engine running again, we realized we were going to save ourselves.""
The anonymous crew member says he believes the crew's training was up to the job of dealing with the emergency. ""We were well-prepared, we didnt panic at all, we knew what we were doing,"" he says. ""We trusted the company that we would be saved.""
Passengers universally hailed the crew's efforts.

Zoe Szathmary,"NOAA (Hurricane Florence is the sixth named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season.) Hurricanes can wreak havoc for coastal areas, but there are steps you can take to prepare before a storm strikes. In fact, there are things you can do at this very moment, Ready.gov says — like putting three days’ worth of supplies together and knowing local evacuation routes and where shelters can be found. Read on for other steps you can follow as Hurricane Florence becomes the first major hurricane of the year. Counting down Ready.gov recommends taking several steps when a storm is 36 hours away. “Restock your emergency preparedness kit,” the site says. “Include food and water sufficient for at least three days, medications, a flashlight, batteries, cash, and first aid supplies.” It also encourages going over evacuation routes and locations — as well as how to connect with loved ones when there are power outages. Vehicles should also be ready to go. “Keep your car in good working condition, and keep the gas tank full; stock your vehicle with emergency supplies and a change of clothes,” the preparedness site advises. Getting closer There are also other tips people can follow if they have 18 to 36 hours before a hurricane. Ready.gov advises people take in ""loose, lightweight objects"" like trash bins and trimming trees which could hit buildings. They should also conceal windows, like with shutters or boards. If a hurricane is closer — 6 to 18 hours away — cell phones should be charged. There are also tips for when the storm is just 6 hours away. “If you’re not in an area that is recommended for evacuation, plan to stay at home or where you are and let friends and family know where you are,” it says. Other tips include putting refrigerators and freezers on the coldest-possible option, and avoiding windows. People in both of these categories should also check for ""the latest weather updates and emergency instructions"" in half-hour intervals.","Fox News Hurricane Florence strengthens in Atlantic: Tips to prepare for the storm Fox News Hurricanes can wreak havoc for coastal areas, but there are steps you can take to prepare before a storm strikes.

Natasha Fouts-Noble, spokesperson for Cal Fire, confirmed the fire jumped the highway, but could not give a precise location. Fouts-Noble said the fire has been burning inside Yosemite National Park for a few days, and fire crews have burned defensively along Wawona Road, also known as Highway 41, inside the park to try to contain the fire. Fouts-Noble said the fire’s latest shift is not proving to be an imminent danger so far for Badger Pass Ski Area, where firefighters and other camp workers are staged in a satellite base camp. The blaze burned 73,560 acres by Friday morning and remained only 41 percent contained as the closure of Yosemite Valley remained in effect through Aug. 5, authorities reported. The fire, burning near Yosemite, consumed 4,120 acres overnight. Residents of Yosemite Valley were told they had to evacuate by noon Friday. Officials said Yosemite Valley is “NOT THREATENED by the fire at this time, but a mandatory evacuation has been issued due to multiple hazards along El Portal Road, Big Oak Flat Road, and Wawona Road, as well as power outages in Yosemite Valley.” A Red Cross shelter is located at New Life Christian Fellowship, 5089 Cole Road, Mariposa.

Lydia Dishman,"“Every single day there is some sort of event at a workplace.”
That’s Tracy Reinhold, and as the chief security officer at SaaS security company Everbridge, he’s not talking about a team celebration of reaching a milestone or even raising a glass for a colleague’s promotion.
He’s referring to recent tragedies such as the mass shooting at a warehouse in Aurora, Illinois that left five workers dead and injured six others. The shooter, an employee of 15 years, was called into a “termination meeting” where he opened fire and claimed at least two victims.
Such events are often perpetrated by an “active assailant,” a term that has evolved to include violence involving firearms and explosives or vehicles driven into crowds, often followed by attacks with knives. And they’re becoming more common. Research from the FBI indicates that between 2000 and 2007 there was an average of 6.4 incidents annually, while the last seven years show 16.4 incidents per year resulting in a total of 1,043 casualties (486 killed, 557 wounded—excluding the shooters).  More recently, the FBI designated 50 shootings in 2016 and 2017 as active shooter incidents with 20 occurring in 2016, and 30 in 2017.
Reinhold, who worked as a special agent for the FBI for 22 years, cites Forrester research that found these critical events are not only common, they’re becoming increasingly inevitable. Every one of the 214 global enterprise companies surveyed suffered at least one critical event in the past 24 months ranging from the most common natural disasters to active shooters. The latter is rare but still occurred in one out of 10 surveyed companies. And 14% of companies reported being victims of terrorism.
“The biggest challenge companies have,” says Reinhold, “are employees who have been disciplined or discharged.” He says they tend to have access to their employer’s facility, or in the case of the Aurora warehouse, are already in the building with their weapons.
Unfortunately, Reinhold points out, that while 75% of companies surveyed listed active shooter situations as the “top threat” they are preparing for (up from 64% in 2016), almost that many (62%) reported never running an active shooter drill and more than half (54%) have not conducted active shooter education.
Prepping for active shooters isn’t quite the same as running a fire drill or other evacuation procedure with on-site workers, he says, but it’s necessary to prepare employees for all kinds of emergency situations. That’s where the AI behind platforms like Everbridge comes in.
How AI beats human decision-making in threat situations
Reinhold points out that a human security officer is limited in the amount of information he or she could digest during the day. AI can take millions of data points and use algorithms to surface the most relevant information and target threats.
As Everbridge CTO Imad Mouline explains, this is a multilayered process. First, Everbridge’s AI reviews thousands of sources that can be mined automatically like social feeds, breaking news, weather feeds, earthquake data.
“The second is what we call expert crowdsourcing,” Mouline says. “Our platform is used by thousands of emergency management and public safety officials around the world, to propagate information,” says Mouline. Additional metadata on severity, urgency, and categorization of the crisis makes up their professional assessment of a situation, that some of these agencies place in the Everbridge platform. “That data feeds this ‘automatic intelligence engine’ that Everbridge offers,” says Mouline.
Both of those feeds are compared to remove duplicates and figure out what information is different from a variety of different sources. Mouline says automatic categorization determines “are we dealing with an active shooter situation” or “dealing with a traffic situation related to the active shooter.”
The third layer is made up of intelligence analysts that are fed risk intelligence information. “They can use their judgment and additional research to provide a more complete view,” he says. This holistic situational intelligence, Mouline notes, can be used for incident response.
As Reinhold points out, security officers can monitor incident reports from all over the world, which is valuable for global companies with offices in multiple countries and employees who travel like those Rackspace. He cited the recent terrorist attack at London Bridge which killed eight people.
He says Rackspace had six employees in London at the time who were located safely even before their CEO could call to check on them. “It’s a huge benefit to travelers,” Reinhold contends, “because active shooters are not always at your place of business, they’re spread out all over the world.”
Mark Terry, Rackspace’s, director of enterprise security, presides over a plethora of safety initiatives and tools. In addition to lockdown devices and safe rooms, Terry has employed gunshot detection sensors and has integrated the alerts with Everbridge so all employees can get updates via SMS text, voice, mobile app, digital signage or desktop alerts within 60 seconds in case there’s an active shooter. It also allows him to know who is in the building and communicate with them and automate evacuation rostering. Terry is also is teaching company employees how to stay safe outside of the workplace. “Our employees could get hurt while at the movie theater or the supermarket,” he says, “not just at work.”
Mouline notes that the global nature of threats has pushed Everbridge to add an automatic translation of the data sources it uses. “We do natural language processing, pull out landmarks, places of interest, or synonyms to categorize the type of threat that it is,” he explains.
The AI also eliminates the need for floor wardens and other volunteer point people to do sweeps of a facility to account for employees during crisis situations, says Reinhold. Using the data from heat maps, for example, a security officer could know who was still in the building just by looking at their phone. And of course, there is a tool that can alert all the workers in a certain facility, or region, of a potential threat via text or other messaging systems.
Big Brother is keeping tabs on you–to keep you safe
Brian Phillips, director of global security at Thermo Fisher Scientific, says they’ve been using Everbridge for the past six years. The company has more than 26,000 employees working across more than 400 offices, distribution centers, manufacturing sites, and at the company’s global headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts. He says Everbridge is often the first action a member of their team takes when learning of a potential crisis.
He admits that it’s been a slow start as employees become aware of what the tool does and become comfortable with sharing their location with their employer. “Once it permeates throughout the company,” Phillips notes, “the employees come to expect the message before it’s even sent and seem to be comforted by the fact that someone is looking out for them.”
Mouline points out that critical events losses cost companies $535 billion annually. Recent data from the ITIC, for example, found that 98% of organizations it surveyed say a single hour of downtime costs over $100,000. “This is when people, facilities, brand, IT systems or supply chain are impacted by threats such as natural disasters, hazmat, terrorism, active shooter, or cyberattacks,” says Mouline. Real predictive risk intelligence information, Phillips adds, has helped physical security departments transition from that “guns, gates, and guards” mentality. “This data is something you can make real business decisions on,” he says.",Prepping for active shooters isn’t quite the same as running a fire drill or other evacuation procedure but it’s necessary to prepare employees for all kinds of emergency situations.

Staff and wire reports,"Update (5:45 p.m.): Gov. Ralph Northam ordered a mandatory evacuation of people who live in the parts of Hampton Roads most vulnerable to flooding. The evacuations are set to begin at 8 a.m. Tuesday from what is known as Zone A — part of the state's new classification system. While not leaving during a mandatory evacuation is a Class 1 misdemeanor, state troopers will not be knocking on doors to force people to evacuate, Jeffrey Stern from the Virginia Department of Emergency Management said. There are 245,000 people living in Zone A who were told to find higher ground. The largest threat from the hurricane is the flooding, Northam said. The governor authorized the mobilization of the National Guard, which includes 6,000 troops. This is the first time in modern Virginia history that this has been done for domestic humanitarian operations, Stern said. Northam has also requested aid from other states. Stern advised that people should expect power outages that could last up to two weeks. Update (5 p.m.): Hurricane Florence is continuing to grow in size and strength. Sustained winds have reached near 140 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. Hurricane and storm surge watches could be issued Tuesday morning. Noon Monday update: Hurricane Florence is now a Category 4 storm with sustained winds near 130 mph. Previously... Florence rapidly intensified into a fearsome category 3 hurricane on Monday and could strike a direct and dangerous blow to the Carolinas later this week, possibly as a category 4, forecasters said. The first impacts were already being seen on barrier islands as dangerous rip currents and seawater flowing over a coastal road. A hurricane hunter plane found Florence strengthening quickly after it became a hurricane on Sunday. By 11 a.m. EDT on Monday, Florence became a major hurricane, with top sustained winds of 115 mph (185 kph). It was centered about 1,240 miles (2,000 kilometers) east-southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina, and moving west at 13 mph (20 kph). ""Further strengthening is anticipated, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday,"" the National Hurricane Center said. ""On the forecast track, the center of Florence will move over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean between Bermuda and the Bahamas Tuesday and Wednesday, and approach the coast of South Carolina or North Carolina on Thursday."" Hurricanes Isaac, which could hit Caribbean islands, and Helene, much farther out to sea, lined up behind Florence as the 2018 Atlantic season reached its peak. It's too early to know the exact path of Florence, but forecasters said it could blow ashore along a stretch of the U.S. East Coast that experts have already identified as the most vulnerable to rising sea levels due to climate change. Up and down the densely populated coast, residents were told to prepare, and not just for a direct blow. Florence could slow or stall on or near shore, scooping up massive amounts of seawater. Some forecasting models show it could unload a foot or two of rain in places, causing devastating inland flooding. Forecasters also warned of a rising threat of life-threatening storm surge, along with the damaging winds. On North Carolina's Outer Banks, Dawn Farrow Taylor, 50, was gathering photos and important documents and filling prescriptions Monday before heading inland. She grew up on the shore, and says this will be only the second time she's evacuated. Since reliable record-keeping began more than 150 years ago, North Carolina has only been hit by one Category 4 hurricane: Hazel, with 130 mph winds in 1954. ""I don't think many of us have ever been through a Category 4. And out here we're so fragile. We're just a strip of land -- we're a barrier island.... Already we're getting some overwash, the ocean is coming over 12,"" she said, referring to the islands' main road. The governors of North and South Carolina and Virginia declared states of emergency far ahead of the approaching storm. Navy ships off Virginia's coast were preparing to sail out of the path, a North Carolina university has already canceled classes and people have begun stocking up on plywood, bottled water and other supplies. Red flags have already been flying on beaches, warning swimmers to stay out of the water as seas began kicking up. People rushed to get emergency kits ready, map out escape routes, fill sandbags and secure their homes. ""Pretend, assume, presume that a major hurricane is going to hit right smack dab in the middle of South Carolina and is going to go way inshore,"" South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said. The state's emergency management agency said it is ""preparing for the possibility of a large-scale disaster."" In coastal Charleston, South Carolina, city officials offered sandbags to residents. Myrtle Beach Mayor Brenda Bethune urged people to secure their homes but said it was too early to know if evacuations will be ordered. Myrtle Beach hardware stores and supermarkets were busy ringing up sales of bottled water, plywood and generators. ""Literally, they are filling buggies full of water, shopping carts full of water,"" Ryan Deeck, grocery department manager at a Walmart, told The Sun News. ""They're coming in and buying water and plates, and that's about all they're buying."" North Carolina crews were getting bulldozers and chain saws ready. In Jacksonville, North Carolina, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) inland, some residents picked up hurricane supplies during their normal weekend shopping, The Daily News reported. Ilija Cesal told the newspaper he wouldn't worry about buying extra water or other supplies for a few more days. ""I'll see by Wednesday how that goes — we got over 48 hours before that happens,"" Cesal said. The University of North Carolina at Wilmington, near the shore, canceled its upcoming alumni weekend and all classes starting at noon Monday, encouraging its students to leave campus for a safer location. In southeast Virginia, Naval Station Norfolk told not to leave their vehicles at the sprawling base later this week because of the flood threat. The Navy planned to send ships from the Hampton Roads area of Virginia out to sea. Florida-based Carnival Cruise Line was re-routing its cruise ships, but there were other hurricanes to contend with. Lining up behind Florence, Isaac was about 1,150 miles (1,855 kilometers) east of the Windward Islands with top winds of 75 mph (120 kph) early Monday, moving west at 14 mph (22 kph). Isaac's forward movement was accelerating on a path to cross into the lower Caribbean on Thursday. Helene, meanwhile, was still in the Atlantic's spawning ground for hurricanes off the coast of Africa, swirling with 105 mph (165 kmh) winds and forecast to become a major hurricane, about 375 miles (600 kilometers) west of the Cape Verde islands.","Daily Press Governor orders Zone A in Virginia to evacuate Tuesday; Florence now a major hurricane, aims for US Southeast Daily Press Update (5:45 p.m.): Gov.

"USA TODAY, Doug Stanglin, USA TODAY","This image obtained June 2, 2018 from the USGS shows a view from the intersection of Nohea and Leilani Streets on June 1, 2018 and Fissure 8 lava fountain. (Photo: USGS, AFP/Getty Images) Authorities on Hawaii's Big Island warn that a new eruption of molten rock from a 220-foot high fountain of lava is channeling its way within a quarter-mile of a key escape-route intersection on the most threatened part of the island. The Big Island, also known as the island of Hawaii, is about 200 miles southeast of Oahu, where the capital, Honolulu is located. The U.S. Geological Survey reported late Friday that the molten rock was approaching the intersection of highways 132 and 137 in an area known as Four Corners on the southeast corner of the island. The lava, which the USGS said has covered a of 5.5 square mile area, has burned at least 400 power poles, cutting power to most of the area, according to Hawaii Electric Light Co. Hawaii Civil Defense spokesman Talmadge Mango said Friday that at least 87 buildings have been destroyed since the Kilauea volcano erupted May 3. As the threat of lava blocking planned the two highway escape routes, contractors have been bulldozing an alternative escape route through the adjacent Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Volcanic fibers, known as Pele's hair, and other lightweight volcanic glass were reported to be gathering in the Leilani Estates, the hardest hit community. ""Volcanic gas emissions remain very high from the fissure eruptions,"" the USGS said. ""Trade wind conditions are bringing vog (volcanic smog) to the south and west sides of the Island of Hawaii."" A new round of mandatory evacuations in Leilani Estates, where at least 40 homes have been destroyed went into effect Friday as authorities warned that any residents who stay behind could be held liable for rescue costs if they get trapped and call for help. “Persons remaining in the mandatory evacuation area … do so at their own risk with the knowledge that emergency responders may not respond,” Mayor Harry Kim has warned. “Persons in violation of this order are subject to arrest and will be liable for any costs associated with rescue operations in the mandatory evacuation area. Refusing to evacuate may put you, your family and first responders in danger.""

ABC News,"OCALA, Florida (ABC) -- A fisherman prompted the evacuation of a Florida Taco Bell when he put his catch of the day in the trunk of his car and drove to the fast-food restaurant, police said.
The angler, who was not identified, reeled in a rusted WWII hand grenade on Saturday while fishing with a magnet in Ocklawaha, according to police.
Instead of immediately calling for the bomb squad when he pulled in the explosive with other rusted pieces of metal, he put the vintage device in the trunk of his vehicle and drove 17 miles north to a Taco Bell in Ocala, according to the Ocala Police Department.

Further north, another huge wild fire destroyed the town of Paradise, leaving nine people dead and 35 missing. In all, three major fires are burning across the state. Among the towns under evacuation orders is Thousand Oaks, where a gunman killed 12 people in a rampage on Wednesday. Authorities say the Camp Fire in the North and the Woolsey Fire and Hill Fire in the south are being fanned by strong winds. Where is the Woolsey Fire? The blaze started on Thursday near Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles (64km) north-west of central Los Angeles, prompting the evacuation of 75,000 homes. Another blaze, the Hill Fire, started at about the same time, also near Thousand Oaks. Media caption 'How much more can this town endure?' - deadly wildfire hits Thousand Oaks, where 12 people were killed in a mass shooting Thousands more residents have since been ordered to evacuate towns to the west, including Calabasas, the south of Highway 101, and Malibu on the coast, as well as from the western edge of Los Angeles. On Friday, the flames jumped the highway and headed into coastal areas. The fire now covers an area of about 35,000 acres (14,150 hectares).

Jolyn Rosa,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Molten rock from several lava-spewing fissures opened by Kilauea Volcano crept toward clusters of homes and vacation rentals on the eastern tip of Hawaii’s Big Island on Wednesday, as authorities ushered residents from the area as a precaution. Evacuation of the Vacationland development and adjacent Kapoho community, rebuilt after a destructive eruption of Kilauea in 1960, came on the 28th day of what geologists rank as one of the biggest upheavals in a century from one of the world’s most active volcanoes. The Hawaii County Civil Defense agency issued the advisory as lava flows picked up speed late on Tuesday and early on Wednesday and threatened to cut off a key traffic route into the seaside area on the far eastern flank of the volcano. “Residents in the Kapoho area, including Kapoho Beach Lots and Vacationland, are advised to evacuate,” the agency said in a morning bulletin. “You are at risk of being isolated due to possible lava inundation of Beach Road.” On Tuesday, a lava stream crossed a larger east-west route, Highway 132, as it advanced toward Kapoho. A separate flow of red-hot molten rock was headed in the direction of the Vacationland Hawaii community to the south. Civil defense officials also cited the problem of widespread communication outages in the area due to downed power and phone lines, reinforcing the decision to proceed with evacuation plans immediately rather than wait for a potential emergency. Residents of the area, part of the Island of Hawaii’s Puna district, were urged to stay tuned to local radio stations for further updates. The numbers of people and homes affected by the evacuation were not immediately known. They join some 2,000 residents displaced due to lava flows and toxic sulfur dioxide gas emissions at the outset of the eruption nearly four weeks ago farther west, in and around the Leilani Estates community. Kilauea’s main crater at the volcano’s summit has continued to periodically belch ash high up into the sky. But National Weather Service meteorologist Tom Birchard told reporters during a conference call that most of the ash was blowing out to sea on the prevailing trade winds, then dissipating quickly. Nevertheless, some ash and fumes have been spouted high enough into the atmosphere to be carried far over the Pacific Ocean, with observers in the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Guam detecting traces of vog - a hazy mix of sulfur dioxide, aerosols, moisture and fine particles, Birchard said. Kilauea rumbled back to life on May 3 as it began extruding lava and toxic gases through a series of cracks in the ground on its eastern flank, marking the latest phase of an eruption cycle that has continued nearly nonstop for 35 years. The occurrence of new lava vents, or fissures, now numbering about two dozen, have been accompanied by flurries of earthquakes and intermittent eruptions from the summit crater. More than 40 homes and other structures have been consumed by lava flows since then.

An Associated Press journalist witnessed the event unfold. “My wife and I were waiting to drop our bags into the X-ray machine and go through the detector, and I heard a TSA agent scream, ‘Shut it down, shut it down, shut it down!’ Everyone was looking around, confused, and people were ordered to ‘Clear out now!’” the AP’s John L. Mone said. The TSA security line has been closed due to a suspicious device being found during screening. Please check with your carrier to see if your flight is being impacted by this delay. We will post updates as they become available. — Hobby Airport (@HobbyAirport) June 7, 2018 The Houston police bomb squad was called in to examine the “suspicious device,” which was ultimately determined to be a “fake hollow grenade,” Houston’s KHOU News reported. Authorities told Houston’s KTRK-TV the grenade was found in a bag belonging to a 17-year-old Boy Scout. The teenager is not facing state charges but could be subject to a federal fine, the AP reported. The incident caused roughly an hour’s worth of delays for more than a dozen departing and arriving flights, according to The Houston Chronicle. Flight passengers took pictures and tweeted about the security checkpoint delays caused by the investigation.. @SouthwestAir @HobbyAirport please don’t leave us!!

NBC 7 Staff,"A brush fire burning in San Diego's East County has destroyed several structures and prompted the evacuation of most of the foothill community of Alpine. Immediate evacuations were ordered Friday when the vegetation fire rapidly spread along Interstate 8 amid a dangerous heat wave that sent temperatures into triple digits. The brush fire sparked at about 11:30 a.m. near Willows Road and Alpine Boulevard and has burned multiple homes. As of 1:09 p.m., the West Fire had burned 150 acres. By 2:25 p.m., officials updated the damage to 350 acres.

Cleveland National Forest officials said at 1:30 p.m. that crews were attempting to hold the fire at S. Grade Road. Several homes have been lost, officials said. One firefighter was burned in the fire, according to a spokesperson for Cleveland National Forest. It was not clear which agency was associated with the injured firefighter. Cal Fire Deputy Director Mike Mohler said the weather is one of the major factors in fighting this fire. “We have put everything on this,” Mohler said. Through the I-8 corridor, winds can funnel through and push the wind, creating its own micro-climate. “Right now, we see smoke is laying down because we have a wind push behind it,” he said. Photos from the Alpine Fire The entire community near Highland Mobile Home park needed to evacuate immediately, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said. The evacuation center has been established at Viejas Casino at 5000 Willows Road. Overnight accommodations are being set up at Los Coches Creek Middle School at 9669 Dunbar Lane, El Cajon. For now, anyone advised to evacuate should head to Viejas Casino if they do not have a safe place to go. If there’s an evacuation, your family should already be prepared, Mohler said, and should plan to leave early. “Firefighters need to get in there and protect your property,” he said. Horses Run Through Smoky Field While Homes Burn The fire has damaged the electrical system servicing several communities in the East County. San Diego Gas &amp; Electric officials said the outage affects more than 3,000 customers in the communities of Dehesa, Alpine, Rancho Palo Verde, Harbison Canyon, West Descanso, Boulder Creek, Glen Oaks, West Alpine and Viejas. Two circuits were out due to smoke damage, according to SDG&amp;E. One circuit was de-energized as a precaution, a spokesperson for the utility told NBC 7. Alpine Boulevard at Tavern Road was shut down so crews could tend to the rapid-moving fire. All lanes of I-8 are open however the on-ramp from Tavern Road was closed and the off-ramp to Willows Road from eastbound I-8 was closed, according to the California Highway Patrol. ""If you’re not in Alpine and you live there, please stay out of it,” said CHP Officer Benjamin Demarest, adding that firefighters need the room to do their jobs. Crews with the Cleveland National Forest Service, Heartland Fire and Cal Fire were working under difficult conditions with temperatures around 108 degrees and humidity between 7 and 11 percent. Winds were about 15 miles per hour with some gusts up to 30 mph. The local chapter of the American Red Cross has not yet been called out to Viejas Casino but they are gathering items in preparation, spokesperson Emily Cox said. “For people who are in the area, it is time to prepare,” Cox said. Talking about people who are not yet evacuated she said, back your car into the driveway to leave at a moment’s notice. Anyone needing help moving animals can contact the county at (619) 498-2361. Lakeside Rodeo at 12584 Mapleview Street was accepting livestock, according to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. Alpine is a small community in the foothills east of San Diego located approximately 24 miles from downtown. The population is estimated at just over 14,000. The fire sparked as crews were battling a second brush fire that was moving at a dangerous rate of spread in Dulzura. The Building Fire had scorched about 10 acres and had burned one structure.
