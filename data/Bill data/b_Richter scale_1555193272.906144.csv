JONATHAN WOLFE,"Our city has a long history of attacks involving explosive devices. Here are just a few of them: The Black Tom Explosion. Black Tom is the name of an island near the Statue of Liberty that was a major munitions depot during World War I. On the night of July 30, 1916, there was an explosion on the island that was so forceful it registered as a 5.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale. Five people were killed. The culprits were German agents. The Wall Street Bombing. In September 1920, someone parked a horse-drawn cart loaded with explosives in front of the J. P. Morgan &amp; Company bank headquarters. The blast that went off around noon killed 30 people and wounded hundreds. The police never charged anyone in the attack. You can still see small craters from the shrapnel on the exterior of the building at 23 Wall Street. The Mad Bomber. George Metesky, a disgruntled former Con Edison employee known as the mad bomber, was linked to 37 bombs around the city beginning in 1940. During his 17-year reign of terror, there were injuries but no deaths. Cracking his case involved one of the first uses of criminal profiling.

Andrew Freedman,"A magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck about 170 miles southeast of Kodiak, Alaska early Tuesday morning, sending residents of the picturesque island fleeing to higher ground to avoid tsunami waves. The quake also prompted tsunami alerts along the West Coast of the U.S. and Hawaii, but those were canceled after data showed damaging waves were not expected. Since the first quake hit there have been several aftershocks, some of which have been strong earthquakes themselves, with a magnitude of up to 5.3 on the Richter Scale. Reports indicated water fluctuating by up to 1 foot in a channel that feeds into Kodiak Harbor, but no large, damaging waves. SEE ALSO: 2017 was one of Earth's top 3 hottest years on record, which should come as no surprise Tsunamis are caused by earthquakes, when sudden shifts in the seafloor displace enough water to set in motion waves at the surface that can travel across an ocean in a matter of hours. The magnitude 7.9 earthquake occurred along a ""strike-slip"" fault, where two plates grind past one another. These earthquakes don't typically give rise to large tsunamis, since they tend to involve horizontal, rather than vertical, motion. This morning's 7.9 earthquake occurred along a strike-slip fault.

Dean Takahashi,"Qumulo has raised another $93 million to meet rising demand for its modern scale-out storage for enterprises. Seattle-based Qumulo said the money will help it get through the next phase of “hyper growth” as it helps enterprises balance the demands and costs of public and private clouds, particularly as the demand for storage explodes with the rise in unstructured data, such as videos or sound. Qumulo is pioneering an entirely new category of enterprise storage that addresses the intersection of three important trends: the explosion of digital content impacting every aspect of our lives, the utilization of machine learning and next generation analytics to derive value from that data, and the standardization of cloud architectures in the enterprise. Qumulo helps customers store, manage, and access their file data at scale, on-premises and in the public cloud, anywhere in the world. “Our customers are demanding a fundamentally different approach to managing and storing the large and dispersed data that their businesses rely on. Legacy storage vendors can’t keep up, as they are built on 15- to 25-year-old architectures that optimized proprietary hardware, not software or the public clouds. They simply never contemplated today’s requirements,” said Qumulo CEO Bill Richter, in a statement. “This latest funding round is not only a testament to our team’s vision and accomplishments, but the capital also secures our plans for continued expansion, accelerated product capabilities, and long-term company sustainability. Everything we do is rooted in our commitment to meeting our customers’ growing and evolving data needs while advancing the entire industry through rapid and focused innovation.” BlackRock Private Equity Partners led the round, with participation from Goldman Sachs and Western Digital. The fourth round also included follow-on investments from all major existing investors, including Highland Capital Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB), the Madrona Venture Group, and Valhalla Partners. Above: Bill Richter is CEO of Qumulo. “The incredible expansion of file-based data in today’s cloud era presents companies with the daunting challenge of storing, managing, and accessing their digital content at scale,” said Muhammad Mian, managing director of BlackRock, in a statement. “Qumulo’s disruptive model has defined an entirely new category of enterprise storage, providing many of the world’s leading companies with the most advanced solution on the market.” The company has raised a total of $233 million over four rounds. Last year, Qumulo appointed EMC Isilon veteran Bill Richter as its CEO. Qumulo’s new funding will support the growth of its enterprise-ready, scale-out storage solution, as well as rapid expansion into vertical industries in North America, Europe, and Asia. The company says its Qumulo Core offering stores tens of billions of files with high performance and is the only product with full data management and real-time visibility into storage use at petabyte scale. Storage administrators can instantly see usage, activity, and throughput history at any level of the unified directory structure, no matter how many files are in the file system, allowing them to pinpoint problems and effectively manage how storage is used. Qumulo was founded in 2012 by Peter Godman, Neal Fachan, and Aaron Passey. It has 180 employees. With hundreds of petabytes of data, billions of files under management globally, and triple digit year-over-year growth, the company is positioning itself to be the leader in the next generation of file storage. Qumulo’s customers include 3 out of 5 of the largest companies on earth, 9 of the 10 top Hollywood studios, and many of the most admired Fortune 500 companies.

Tom McKay,"North Korea’s infamous nuclear test site, a facility in Punggye-ri in Kilju County, has long been reported to maintain the standards one might expect for a pariah government low on everything but zeal and weaponry. Outsiders can only get a limited picture of the country, let alone the test site, thanks to its isolation from the rest of the world. But concerns have included tunnel collapses at the facility and the possibility Mount Mantap, where it is located, could implode under stress from repeated nuclear tests and release large amounts of radiation. Per NBC News, some defectors say that radiation emanating from the Punggye-ri test site could be the cause of “ghost disease” ravaging the area, causing sicknesses like leukemia and birth deformities. Some 30 people who lived in the region are being tested by the South Korean government for signs of radiation poisoning, but so far authorities haven’t publicly released any information indicating the claims are true. “We thought we were dying because we were poor and we ate badly,” defector Lee Jeong Hwa, who fled North Korea in 2013, told NBC News. “Now we know it was the radiation.” As NBC noted, North Korea has only been testing nuclear weapons since 2006, when the country successfully detonated a bomb that registered 4.2 magnitude on the Richter scale. Tales of “trout dying in the mountain streams and the area’s prized pine mushrooms disappearing” began long before then, some as early as the 1980s, suggesting other military activities could be responsible for contaminating the county with some form of toxin. James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies scientist Ferenc Dalnoki-Veress told NBC that neighboring governments maintain equipment to detect the release of radiation, and that nothing particularly abnormal has shown up. He said that one incident in which authorities detected a small amount of xenon gas, a radionuclide, five days after the alleged test of a hydrogen bomb in September was “very, very unlikely” to have arisen from a detonation or leak from Punggye-ri; Dalnoki-Veress also ruled out groundwater contamination from the testing, saying it could have leaked via steam vents. Previous analysis by AccuWeather has concluded North Korean nuclear tests tend to be held when wind conditions are light, which could keep radioactive material from being dispersed outside its borders. At other times, regional newspapers have reported accounts of soldiers being treated for exposure following detonations. Chinese nuclear expert Wei Shijie told the Telegraph some kind of accident was probably “inevitable,” and “It is just a matter of time to detect it, because there are cracks on mountains where radioactive substances will leak.” [ NBC News ]","North Korea’s infamous nuclear test site, a facility in Punggye-ri in Kilju County, has long been reported to maintain the standards one might expect for a pariah government low on everything but zeal and weaponry.

Fox News,"A string of recent earthquakes off the West Coast of the U.S., ranging from 2.8 to 5.6 on the Richter scale, could help trigger the earthquake colloquially known as ""the Big One."" The map provided by the U.S. Geological Survey highlights 11 recent earthquakes, all occurring on the seabed of the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate, approximately 6 miles below the surface. The plate, which is described as ""small"" by the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network (PNSN), is fairly active, moving east-northeast at approximately 1.6 inches per year. To date, the USGS has not issued any warnings over this spate of earthquakes, given the fairly common nature of the caliber of quakes, Don Blakeman, a geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information Center told the Daily Mail. QUAKES AND ERUPTIONS SPARK TALKS OF YELLOWSTONE SUPERVOLCANO Part of the concern surrounding the plate is that it is not a smooth motion, but rather a motion described as ""sticky,"" causing strain to build up ""until the fault breaks and a few meters of Juan De Fuca slips under North America in a big earthquake."" PNSN noted that it would take a lot of slip (approximately 10s of meters) over a very large area to generate a M9 (magnitude of 9.0) level earthquake that could hit the region, but noted that it does occur approximately every 550 years on average. The cause for concern is what happens when the Juan de Fuca plate eventually submerges under the much larger Pacific plate. For approximately 330 years, the plate has continuously been pushed down, an activity that will eventually lead it to be pushed under the North America plate, causing the region to sink six feet on the minimum and may result in one of the largest earthquakes in human history. If the entire 650-mile long Cascadia Subduction Zone (which includes the Juan de Fuca plate) were to experience a full rupture, it could not only trigger a 9.0 earthquake, but a tsunami as well. The Juan De Fuca plate stretches from Northern California to British Columbia and the Cascadia Subduction Zone stretches from N. Vancouver Island to Cape Mendicino, California. SCIENTISTS FIND DOZENS OF HIDDEN EARTHQUAKES BURIED UNDER ANTARCTICA'S ICE Recent studies have highlighted how vulnerable we are to the proverbial ""Big One."" Last month, one study detailed that there is a 15- to 20-mile-long stretch of the San Andreas fault ‒ called the Durmid ladder structure ‒ that could result in an earthquake with a magnitude of 7 or greater. ""This newly identified Durmid ladder structure is a voluminous, right-reverse fault zone that broadens across Durmid Hill around rotating domains of regularly spaced, left- and right-lateral cross faults,"" a research article on the study reads. The research put the odds at 75 percent that it would occur in both northern and southern California sometime over the next 30 years. The ""Big One"" has been warned about several times before, with the USGS writing extensively on the topic, including how to use past earthquakes to better predict the future.

WESLEY MORRIS,"Political speeches might strive to nourish us, but lately nobody wants a salad; this president got where he is by slinging red meat. Trump could talk about comity and unity this time, but if you were watching his speech, you were also watching television a dramatically ripe encounter between two people who had just faced off over a historic, harmfully long government shutdown, and over whether this speech could happen in the first place. You would have wanted a moment that captured the conflict hiding behind the pleas for civility an emblem of the anomie sizzling beneath the surface of most politics at the moment. Something small and arguable and maybe a little bit beneath us that alluded to the stratospheric stakes of the discord. And this woman, clapping at this man, was the reddest meat. It was an image that registered on the Richter scale of beef.
The internet is great at rooting out, freeze-framing then fan-ficking this kind of interpersonal drama. It has become downright masterful during the Trump era: the meme-ing of his appearing to stalk Hillary Clinton during a presidential debate, of Melania swatting his hand away. Its a terrible way of following politics. But it might be the only sane mechanism for digesting the politics we have as must-share TV.
Pelosis clap ate both the internet and the national news, which ran endless stories parsing its meaning. Pelosis daughter Christine offered an interpretation: She knows, she tweeted, and she knows that you know. And frankly shes disappointed that you thought this would work. But heres a clap. #youtriedit. The clap became all things to lots of people. Most of them supposed some kind of triumph for Pelosi and humiliation for Trump. The clap was seen as loaded and self-amused and captivatingly sardonic. Saturday Night Live whipped up a 1970s-era action-TV sketch called Women of Congress, in which Pelosi was identified as Madame Clap Back. At a Grammys-weekend celebration for Dolly Parton, Pelosi herself stood between Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom, who got her to do the clap with them. Its possible that was the moment when the image started eating itself.","He tries to drop an anvil on her. She lures him over a cliff.

EditorDavid,"hcs_$reboot writes: ""Scientists say the number of severe quakes is likely to rise strongly next year because of a periodic slowing of the Earth's rotation,"" reports the Guardian. ""They believe variations in the speed of Earth's rotation could trigger intense seismic activity, particularly in heavily populated tropical regions. Although such fluctuations in rotation are small -- changing the length of the day by a millisecond -- they could still be implicated in the release of vast amounts of underground energy, it is argued."" The theory goes that the slowdown creates a shift in the shape of the Earth's solid iron and nickel ""inner core"" which, in turn, impacts the liquid outer core on which the tectonic plates that form the Earth's crust rest. The impact is greater on the tectonic plates near some of the Earth's most populous regions along the Equator, home to about a billion people. Scientists from the University of Colorado looked at all earthquakes registering 7 and up on the Richter scale since the turn of the 20th century. In this timeframe, the researchers discovered five periods of significantly greater seismic activity. The seismic activity follows a five-year period of slowing in the earth's rotatio, and ""This link is particularly important because Earth's rotation began one of its periodic slowdowns more than four years ago,"" according to the article. ""The Earth is offering us a five-year heads-up on future earthquakes,"" says one of the researchers, adding ""The inference is clear.

Dana Goodyear,"Dear Mr. Richter, the letter began. I have been working on the idea for a feature film, about which I would like to talk to you, if you can make that possible. Could you give me an hour of your time? The author, the German filmmaker Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, had been trying to get in touch with Gerhard Richter for quite some time. Mutual acquaintances had refused to make an introduction; no one wanted to jeopardize a relationship with the man widely considered to be the greatest painter alive. So Donnersmarck, who is full of what Ulrich Mühe, the lead actor in Donnersmarcks first film, The Lives of Others, called implacable friendliness, resorted to mailing a handwritten letter to an address listed on Richters official Web site. A few days later, Richter responded, with an invitation to visit him in Cologne.
It had been almost a decade since The Lives of Others, which explores the Stasi surveillance of artists in the waning days of the German Democratic Republic, was awarded the 2006 Oscar for best foreign-language film. Like many European auteurs before him, Donnersmarck, who was thirty-three when he won, found himself drawn centripetally toward Hollywood. He and his wife, Christiane, a lawyer who oversaw the international operations of Creative Commons and now facilitates Donnersmarcks career, moved to Los Angeles with their three children. The family rented a nineteen-thirties estate in the Pacific Palisades, near the house where Thomas Mann once lived.
In 2009, Donnersmarck, an unabashed admirer of Hollywood maximalismhe heaps praise on The Terminatorco-wrote and directed a hundred-million-dollar studio movie, The Tourist, in which a spy and her lover, played by Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, evade both the Mafia and Scotland Yard in the canals of Venice. Critics had applauded the previous film; now many were dismayed. In the Times, Manohla Dargis was gently damning. It takes an exceptional director to prevent an entertainment as flimsy as this from collapsing under its own weightlessness, she wrote. The Tourist went on to earn two hundred and seventy-eight million dollars worldwide, but Donnersmarck wasnt eager to repeat the experience. It was a bit like you had stayed at a super-luxurious spa, he told me. Its beautiful and objectively great, but it feels hollow. I didnt have that feeling of: Only I can do this. His friends began to worry. I told him he should be careful not to lose too much time, Jan Mojto, who financed The Lives of Others, told me. He said, Between Thomas Manns Buddenbrooks and Royal Highness there are nearly ten years. I thought, Hes losing his mind, so better bring him back. Then Florian tells me, I have an idea. 
Donnersmarck had been looking for a way to illustrate, in film, the healing power of art. Over breakfast in Los Angeles, he explained how Richter had turned a life of profound trauma and loss into creative grist. This man has lived through everything imaginable, he told me. Hes lived through his mother being raped by the Russians, his father committing suicide, his aunt being euthanized, both of his uncles being killed on the Eastern Front, his childhood classmates being killed in the bombing of Dresden, the experience of incredible impoverishment. Yet he manages to take all these things and charge them, in his paintings, with this mystical energy that comes from the suffering. In this way, Donnersmarck said, art becomes an emblem of resilience, even productivity: It gives us that wonderful feeling that our suffering can be of use.
At eighty-six, Richter, known for an astonishingly diverse practice that includes photo-realistic portraits, Romantic landscapes, and conceptual abstractions, hovers numinously over German art, at once omnipresent and nowhere to be found. Born in Dresden in 1932, he lived through Nazism, the Second World War, and the Communist occupation, before defecting to the West in the nineteen-sixties. But, when faced with curiosity about his person and his work, he has often deployed John Cages witty dodge: I have nothing to say, and I am saying it. His life story is a meticulously concocted living text, mediated by his paintings, which tell a story of their own.
In the sixties, Richter started making his photo paintings, recognizable by a characteristic blur. The paintings purportedly represented random snapshots of strangers, and their generic titlesFamily at the Seaside, Mother and Childencouraged this reading. As Richter grew more prominent, he began to refer to cuckoos eggs, biographical truths hidden in his work. Still, when an interviewer asked about the seeming banality of his source material, he replied, Its all evasive action. Sometimes he explained himself by saying, My paintings know more than I do.
I believe that great art is deeply biographical, Donnersmarck told me. Anthony Minghella, the director of The Talented Mr. Ripley, one of Donnersmarcks favorite films, had no direct experience of American expats on the Italian Riviera, but he drew upon the oppressive class consciousness of his English childhood to lend authenticity to Tom Ripleys striving. Studying Richters work, Donnersmarck learned that he had taken unusual pains to control its reception. Since the sixties, Richter has been compiling his own catalogue raisonné, an official list of works usually assembled by scholars and curators. Furthermore, he started the clock on his uvre in 1962, after his arrival in the West, erasing a period as a prominent socialist-realist artist in the East, where he had been commissioned to paint murals extolling the ideals of the republic. He was someone who was quite guarded about his personal things, Donnersmarck told me. Although, on the other hand, its also partly that he just tells us hes guarded about his personal things. Taken together, he felt, Richters feints amounted to a pixelated portrait. Here was someone who never really told the full story, and was steering people in a certain way, he said. Donnersmarck had set out to research a master of visual representation; now he was beginning to view Richter as what he calls a master of narrative.
One painting in particular troubled Donnersmarck. Ema (Nude on a Staircase) depicts a luminous nude, Richters first wife, Ema Eufinger, who, as Richter later noted, bore a resemblance to Brigitte Bardot. Art historians contended that the image was part of Richters dialogue with Marcel Duchamp, who had ostentatiously quit painting after completing his own Nude Descending a Staircase, in 1912. But Donnersmarck suspected that there was something more than the anxiety of influence at work.
Richter typically dates his canvases with only the year; this one is marked May, 1966, as if the month held special significance. Where the previous photo paintings relied mostly on a gray-scale palette, Ema glows with nacreous pink skin and golden hairher body seems to shine from within, as one critic put it. In fact, she was pregnant, with Richters first child, Betty, who was born later that year and would become the subject of some of his most arresting portraits. It was the convergence of two detailsEmas pregnancy and the datethat stuck in Donnersmarcks mind, suggesting a mystery that he was determined to solve. I thought, O.K., Ive now read the major texts on him. Ive researched this thoroughly. Im very familiar with his work. I have to at least throw my theory at him and see how he reacts, he said. I was thinking that Id maybe be thrown out after half an hour.
In January of 2015, Donnersmarck showed up at Richters home. The most extraordinary thing happened, he said. I outlined to him what I planned to do, really just thinking Id glean from his reactionWas I on a completely crazy path, or was there something true about it? Surprisingly, Richter didnt turn him out. That first day, I ended up staying seven hours or so. After several more sessions, Donnersmarck said, I asked him, I have a good memory, but I dont remember everything. Do you mind if I record this? 
Donnersmarck grew up stringently Catholic, a choirboy, and he still attends Mass; as an artist, he frames his goals transgressively. His intention, he says, is to write like Im wiretapping a confession booth. He told me that Richter accepted his presence, though he suspected that Sabine Moritz, Richters third wife and former student, opposed it. Richter went so far as to allow him to accompany the couple on an anniversary trip to Dresden. He told me everythingtruly everythingabout his life, and was amazingly open, Donnersmarck said. I ended up staying for one month and recording this stuff, which really I think makes any biography of his completely obsolete.
During the next three years, Donnersmarck wrote and directed Never Look Away, an epic spanning three decades of German history. (The German title, Werk Ohne Autor, or Work Without Author, is a tag that critics in the seventies applied to Richters art, because of its seeming lack of subjectivity.) The film hews closely to Richters youthful experiences, particularly his first marriage, but leaves room for conflation and outright invention. Donnersmarcks protagonist, Kurt Barnert, is a sensitive and talented painter from the East who marries into a family that, while outwardly conforming to the new postwar politics, privately adheres to the most repulsive aspects of Nazi ideology. I didnt want it to be a bio-pic per se, Donnersmarck told me. Sticking exactly to every fact and chronology tends to weaken something. Citizen Kane would be a lesser film if it were called Citizen Hearst. 
Never Look Away is on the shortlist for a best foreign-language Oscar and opens in New York and Los Angeles on February 8th. When I met up with Donnersmarck this past fall, in L.A., shortly after the films German theatrical run, he was perturbed. A rift had opened between him and his subject. Suddenly, there was this statement from him, Donnersmarck said. Richter had not seen the film, but, hounded for comment by the German press, he had let slip that he found the trailer too reißerisch, or thriller-like. The insult stung, a rebuke of the intimate understanding that Donnersmarck had felt existed between them.
Not long ago, I wrote to Richter, asking if he could tell me about his interactions with Donnersmarck. To my surprise, he wrote back within a few days:
I thank you for your kind letter about the film of Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. To recall all the events, I had a look into the quite hefty folder regarding the case von Donnersmarck. Unfortunately, this visualization of all the facts caused such bad feelings, and my dislike of both the movie and the person grew so much again, that I find it impossible to give you an answer.
I hope for your understanding, but I cant help it.
With best regards,
Gerhard Richter
Donnersmarck is six feet nine, with a baby face and an accumulation of gray-blond curls that look ready to dump raina cherub and his cloud. He has storybook grandeur, and an expansive sense of time. He lets weeks pass between e-mails, then sends novellas. Our first breakfast lasted four and a half hours, and earned me two parking tickets. He was unusually interested in being a subject. Free analysis, he called it.
Courtly manners, a social necessity for a giant living among humans, are also the inheritance of a family that traces its nobility back six hundred years; he says that Donnersmarck, which he translates as Thunder Marrow, is the name that his Saxon ancestor Henckel was given by Kaiser Matthias in gratitude for funding a war against the Turks. Donnersmarck, a count, has a booming laugh. He speaks five languages, including Russian, and has a whippet named Tsarevich. It is hard to find a car that can accommodate his size, but he makes the best of it. For a while, he drove around Los Angeles in a vintage white Rolls-Royce, until the brakes gave out in the hills above Sunset Boulevard. You cant buy a car like that in Germany, Thomas Demand, a German artist who lives in Los Angeles and is close to Donnersmarck, says. You would look like a pimp.
During the Second World War, the bankable part of Donnersmarcks inheritance vanished behind the Iron Curtain, with family castles reduced to ruins. The familywhich Donnersmarck describes as too cultured to have been Naziswas uprooted. His grandfather, a doctor of philosophy specializing in Thomas Aquinas, was drafted at the end of the war, and immediately found an American to surrender to. His father, Leo Ferdinand, had spent his childhood preparing to take over the Donnersmarck mining and agricultural operations in Silesia, an area that was once easternmost Germany and is now largely in Poland. In 1945, notices went up in Silesia: all Germans had to vacate immediately, leaving the keys in their locks, on pain of death. Leo Ferdinand became, at the age of nine, a refugee.
Because of all the terrible suffering Germany caused in World War Two, there wasnt a lot of focus on what the German people suffered, understandably, Donnersmarck told me. But many people were apolitical, and suffered the way Richters family suffered, and the way mine did. Donnersmarcks mother, Anna-Maria, remembers being four, fleeing to relatives in the West. Our mother made it an adventure, she said. Women in that time, they were all heroes. They had the children, their husbands were dead or captive and the women were in Berlin. They cleaned up the whole city with their hands. They made a mountain where people go skiing now, formed from the dirt and stones from the war.
Donnersmarcks father was among the first in the family to need a job. He became an executive at Lufthansa, and when Florian was one and his brother, Sebastian, was three the family moved to Roosevelt Island, as part of a social experiment to establish an economically diverse colony on Welfare Island. Florian was so blond that women in the city would annoy him by touching his hair, and so tall that his mother brought along his passport when they ran errands, in order to prove that he was young enough to ride the bus for free.
Leo Ferdinand was deeply religious, traditional, and intellectual. Walking through a European capital with him was a master class in declinism. Donnersmarck said, He found it hard to remember the names of those who werent from Catholic noble families. Anna-Maria, on the other hand, had been active in the leftist student movement in West Berlin, and collected sophisticated people. Her best friend in New York was John White, an Austrian Jewish émigré who directed the City Opera and was a mentor to Florian. I grew up in a world in which the objective quantification of intelligence and eloquence and erudition was valued above all else, Donnersmarck told me. Sometimes he performed too well for his audiences taste. He was pretentious, Anna-Maria said. When he was thirteen, I took him to the opera in Frankfurt. How did you like it? I asked. He said, I liked it, but I could do it better. 
Anna-Maria had high standards for art, which extended to her sons output. She told me, When they made pictures, I did not put them on the fridge unless they were good, and they were very rarely good. There were not many pictures on my fridge. Florian thought I was too critical, too strict. I said, Florian, do you want me to lie to you? This is my influencethat he wants to prove that he is the best in the world to his critical mother. He got the gift from Leo Ferdinand, and from me the drive to prove me wrong.
Last winter, I went to see Donnersmarck in Berlin, where he was finishing postproduction on Never Look Away. It had been eight months since Id last seen him in Los Angeleswhen he had read me the entire three-and-a-half-hour screenplay, in the course of two daysand he had been working twenty hours a day on the film. (He is a sleepwalker, imperfectly cured. Only the first floor of a hotel is safe for him, and he sleeps with the lights on.) His hair had turned whiter and wilder, and I got the impression that hed been sustaining himself with editing-room chocolates.
In a comfortable sound studio, overlooking the River Spree, Donnersmarck was doing dialogue replacement, rerecording some two hundred lines that hadnt come out well during filming. It is tedious work for most people, but Donnersmarck relishes the chance to tune and polish flaws. Suddenly, you can heal all those little wounds, he says. Its very, very joyful. For a scene in which one character subversively advises another to mutter Drei liter instead of Heil Hitler, Donnersmarck instructed the actor on the precise quality of the stifled laugh he was after. We have to bring up some of your tonality a notch, he said. It needs to be more nasal. It wants it to be more coming from the throat, so its rattling more. Try to do it as if youre just about to clear your throat, a bit more pressure.
Later that afternoon, the actor Sebastian Koch came to the studio. Koch, who played a writer under surveillance in The Lives of Others, returns in Never Look Away as Barnerts sinister father-in-law. In the scene that they were working on, he orders Barnert to paint his portrait. To prepare Koch for the line that needed to be replaced, Donnersmarck said, Du hast ein neues sujet, emphasizing certain words in the way of a choral conductor tweaking the phrasing of a song. Feel in yourself how superior you are compared to Kurt, he said. Be really aloof, almost arrogant: I descend to your pitiful way of life by even talking to you.  Koch told me later, Hes fully formed as a perfectionist. As in, Well do it again. No, well do it again. He believes strongly that, if an actor thinks something wrong, he can read those thoughts.
As Koch got ready for another line, Donnersmarck told him, Youre worried, and it should come through in your whole demeanor, but youre still controlled and that means your breathing is steady, yet there is a certain nervousness about it. Koch, visible through a glass wall in an adjacent sound booth, jumped up and down and fluttered his lips. Fifteen or twenty takes later, Donnersmarck quickly said, Sehr schön, and moved on.
In the evening, as the city turned pale, Donnersmarck and I got into a taxi. Youre best behind the driver, he said, as he claimed the front passenger side for himself, pushing the seat all the way back and reclining it as far as it could go. Its a very ungallant way to ride, but the only way it works, he said. We were going to meet his mother. I asked if I should call her Mrs. Donnersmarck. He said,  Mrs. is wrong. The correct formal address would be Countess Henckel. But shell want you to call her Anna-Maria. My mother is a big all-women-are-sisters kind of woman.
Leo Ferdinand died nearly a decade ago, and Anna-Maria, who has shoulder-length blond hair and vivid blue eyes, lives in a cozy apartment in Charlottenburg, the Upper East Side of West Berlin. Above the coatrack hangs a portrait of an ancestor Anna-Maria calls the family prince, a rake who married a French courtesan and built her a castle in Silesia, which was bombed by the Russians. Its like Gone with the Wind,  Anna-Maria told me. Nobody has any money anymore. They all work.
Anna-Maria showed us to the living room, where Donnersmarcks brother, Sebastian, a physics teacher at a high school in Berlin, was sitting. On a coffee table was a silver tray filled with dishes of macadamia nuts, malt balls, mini-Snickers, and sugary wafers. When Donnersmarck reached for a Snickers, his mother shot him a reproving look. Nicht gut für dich, she said. He ignored her, and took a wafer, too. She brought a board with rye bread and sliced ham. My big child should eat something, she exhorted him.
After leaving Roosevelt Island in 1981, the family moved to Berlin, a jarring experience for the two boys. My brother and I felt like wed been thrown into a harsher, colder, and poorer place, Donnersmarck said. All the American products wed grown up with were sold in stores here that you couldnt access as a German citizen. The American military areas were cordoned off. Those people could buy marshmallows and peanut butter.
American movies offered a reprieve and a way back, even if they were shown a year after release. The brothers, both tall, with long hair, would dress as girls so that they looked old enough to sneak into Clint Eastwood movies. Sebastian said, We grew up on Star Wars and Indiana Jones.  Anna-Maria turned to Florian. I pushed you into exhibitions, opera, theatre, she said. You hated exhibitions. Florian shrugged, and changed the subject. Seeing art with his parents, he later explained, was complicated. For a Catholic boy, the bald eroticism of German art in the eighties was both liberating and confusing. Small wonder if he squirmed in front of a self-portrait of an artist fellating himself. I asked Anna-Maria if he had evinced any inclination toward art. Not a bit, she said. He was always interested in psychoanalysis.
Donnersmarck attended Oxford, and, egged on by his brother, entered an essay-writing contest whose first prize was an apprenticeship with Richard Attenborough. He won. As he walked from the studio to the train station each day, Attenborough would pass in a beautiful Rolls-Royce. I always thought that one day he would pick me up, Donnersmarck says. He never did. I remember thinking, If I ever make enough money, Ill get exactly that car.
After university, Donnersmarck went to film school in Munich. In a book about The Lives of Others, he wrote that, while struggling to come up with movie premises for an assignment, he put on a recording of the Russian pianist Emil Gilels playing the Moonlight Sonata. While listening, he remembered reading that Lenin once said that, until his revolution was complete, he would not permit himself to listen to Beethovens Appassionata, because it inspired him to stroke the heads of people rather than to strike, strike pitilessly. Donnersmarck began to wonder how history might have been different if Lenin had been compelled to hear that music. An image forced itself into my mind, he wrote. A medium shot of a man in a desolate room; he has headphones over his ears through which comes the sound of wonderful music. This imagea listener overhearing something that might make him abandon his deepest beliefsgave rise to The Lives of Others, which became Donnersmarcks thesis project and, eight years later, his first feature.
The Lives of Others centers on Gerd Wiesler, a Stasi surveillance specialist, assigned to eavesdrop on a celebrated playwright and his actress girlfriend, who is the romantic obsession of a powerful Central Committee minister. Wiesler wires the couples apartment and installs himself in the attic of the building. The playwright believes in the basic righteousness of the German Democratic Republic, while his closest friends are punished for their doubts. When one of them commits suicide, he becomes disillusioned, and, convinced that his apartment is the last unbugged place in East Berlin, starts writing a treatise against the government, to be published in the West. Listening in, Wiesler finds his own loyalties shifting, and alters his reports to protect his subject. But, in a skillfully turned plot, the actress, having spurned the rapacious minister, is threatened by the Stasi and begins informing on the playwright, betraying what Wiesler has withheld.
The life story of the poet and songwriter Wolf Biermann echoes through The Lives of Others. Biermann, a Bob Dylan of the G.D.R., was placed under house arrest and banned from publishing. According to Donnersmarck, Biermann was among the first Germans to seek out his Stasi files after reunification. Biermann, who published parts of the files, has written that they contained a plan for how to ruin him, including destruction of all love relationships and friendships and faulty medical treatment. Donnersmarck read the published files, and managed to find and interview at length the agent who oversaw the investigation of Biermann. Like Wiesler in the film, the agent was a model of ideological correctness. Donnersmarck says that even twelve years after the Wall came down the agent was unsure what he was allowed to say about Biermann. He was, like, By what laws am I bound right now? Can I tell you details about this guys sex life? I was sworn to secrecy by a government that no longer exists,  Donnersmarck told me. It was total confusion of information loyalties, but he ended up telling me everything.
Biermann was far less forthcoming. Donnersmarck thought that he might gain entrée through Anna-Maria, who, in her student-movement days, had visited Biermann when he was under house arrest. But Biermann ignored his entreaties. So Donnersmarck, relentless, approached him in the book-signing line after a reading. I know exactly who you are, Donnersmarck recalled his saying. And Ill tell you one thing: If Im going to say something about the Stasi, Im going to say it myself.
The Lives of Others created controversy in Germany. Ulrich Mühe, who played Wiesler, had been a theatre actor in the East. When the film was released, he disclosed that he had read his own Stasi file, and found evidence that his former wife had served as an informant. (The documents, Donnersmarck says, showed that she had even asked the states permission before marrying him.) To critics, the revelation seemed to be part of a cynical marketing campaign. Mühes ex-wife sued him for libel and won, despite the documentation. Mühe, who had developed ulcers as a young man when conscripted as a border guard, died of stomach cancer soon afterward.
Easterners who had been oppressed by the Stasi found the character of the agent too sympathetic; those who hadnt been oppressed said the whole thing was sensationalized. Donnersmarcks experience of the East was limited to teen-age excursions through the checkpoint with his parents, to visit his mothers childhood friends. It embarrasses him now to remember how he and his brother, alert to the injustices suffered by fellow-Germans, would roll down the car windows and call out the lyrics of a popular song, Thoughts are free! No one can ever know them, no one can hunt them down! He was sixteen when the Wall fell, detractors often noted: What could Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck from West Berlin know about the G.D.R.?
I still meet people from the East who say, This is not a good film,  Sebastian Koch told me. But point for point they cant explain why not. The Lives of Others was denied a competition spot at the Berlin Film Festival, at Cannes, and at Venice. It made its première at Telluride, and, after winning the Oscar, became, with Das Boot, the most successful German-language film in history. It was loved everywhere except here, Koch said.
Biermann, however, praised the film. The political tone is authentic, I was moved by the plot, he wrote. But why? Perhaps I was just won over sentimentally, because of the seductive mass of details that look like they were lifted from my own past. Or maybe Biermann had already made his peace with up-close observation. In the seventies, not long before he was exiled while on tour in the West, he wrote The Stasi Ballad. Its refrain, Stasi is my Eckermann, refers to Goethes compulsive assistant, who documented his every utterance. Its an amazing ballad, where he said how incredibly grateful he is to the Stasi for recording everything he ever said for posterity, Donnersmarck told me. Theyre trying to destroy his life, but at least theyre paying attention, in the way that every artist wants people to pay attention.
Richters cuckoos eggs serve as a test of attentiveness: Did you catch that? One of his earliest photo paintings, a tender black-and-white portrait of a teen-age girl holding a baby, was first exhibited with the unremarkable title Mother and Child. It could be any mother and child, Dietmar Elger, the director of Richters archive and the writer of his authorized biography, told me. In the beginning, in the sixties, he was hesitating about making his art too personal. Later, Richter renamed the painting Aunt Marianne, and over time it emerged that the woman it depicted was his mothers younger sister. The baby was the artist himself, at three months old.
Richter, at eighty-six, hovers numinously over German art, omnipresent but resistant to inquiries about his life or his work. When pressed, he has often deployed John Cages witty dodge: I have nothing to say, and I am saying it.

Marianne Schönfelder, Richters aunt, was a delicate, attractive girl, who, by the time she was twenty, had been institutionalized with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Mental illness was a dangerous label to wear in Nazi Germany. Mentally ill and physically and intellectually disabled women were subjected to forced sterilization, and in 1940 the government established a medical-murder program, with six execution centers, equipped with showers, to destroy them. By 1941, when Hitler shut the gassing program down, some thirty-five thousand women had been killed at these sites, in what Donnersmarck described to me as a dress rehearsal for the greatest crime in history. By the end of the war, at least a hundred thousand women deemed unfit for procreation had been exterminated.
In 1938, Schönfelder was committed to a psychiatric nursing home in the eastern state of Saxony, not far from the town where Richters family had moved. While a patient there, she was involuntarily sterilized; later, she was transferred to a psychiatric hospital, where she was deliberately starved to death in 1945, and buried in a mass grave.
In a childhood riven by catastrophe, the tragedy of Aunt Marianne held a special place. According to Jürgen Schreiber, an investigative journalist who wrote a biography of Richter in 2005, she loomed over the household. If Gerd was unruly, Schreiber wrote, his mother would threaten him, Youll end up like Aunt Marianne.  On Richters Web site, where his works are categorized according to subjectClouds, Candles, Families, Aeroplanes, Snowscapes, Nudesthe Aunt Marianne painting falls under the heading Death.
While at art school, in Dresden, Richter met another Marianne, a fashion student nicknamed Ema, whose father was a prominent ob-gyn. The couple, who married in 1957, lived at her fathers house in Dresden. In the course of researching his book, Schreiber visited the house, and made a significant discovery. A woman came to me and said, Here lived a super-Nazi!  he wrote to me in an e-mail. I was highly alarmed. And then I started a new investigation.
In the federal archives, Schreiber discovered that Emas father, Heinrich Eufinger, had served as a lieutenant colonel in the S.S., Hitlers racial élite, a leadership squad entrusted with executing his Final Solution. Eufingers files referred to him as an irreproachable SS-man, who was meticulous about proving his Aryan ancestry. Later, when Eufinger was promoted and assigned to care for future S.S. wives in Saxony, he evaluated them for their suitability for marriage among members of the S.S.; to his superiors, he recommended a more exacting process, including a gynecological exam and, for the prospective groom, a mandatory sperm count. Otherwise, Eufinger wrote, no certainty can ever be obtained as to the effective functioning of the procreative organs.
For nearly a decade, until he was arrested by the Russians in 1945, Eufinger served as the director of Friedrichstadt Hospital, in Saxony, where nearly a thousand women were forcibly sterilized, most of them by him. The youngest victim was eleven years old. Eufinger did not perform Schönfelders sterilizationthat task was carried out by the doctor who had delivered Richter.
As Eufinger would surely have known, sterilization was a station on the road to death. Many of the women sterilized at Friedrichstadt Hospital were subsequently murdered by the state. After the war, other physicians from the regionincluding the doctor who oversaw Schönfelders casewere tried in Dresden for crimes against humanity, and some were sentenced to death. Eufinger, however, went on to have a distinguished career in the G.D.R. and then, after emigrating, in West Germany. Until Schreibers reporting, his portrait still hung on the wall of Friedrichstadt Hospital.
The natural question to ask is: What did Richter know? (Richter told Schreiber that Ema had seen her father preening before the mirror in his S.S. uniform and been appalled.) In Richters case, the more relevant question may be: What did his paintings know? Richter and Ema defected to the West in 1961, shortly before the Wall went up. Among the few possessions Richter took ",,,,,,,,,,0
,,,,,,,,,,1,0
ith him was an album filled with family pictures, which he soon started to use as source material.,,,,,,,,,,0
Within two years of painting Aunt Marianne, Richter painted his father-in-law, as well as an architect of the euthanasia program, who killed himself rather than face a war-crimes tribunal. The father-in-law painting is Family at the Seaside. Grotesquely, it depicts Eufinger at the beach with Ema, her sister, and one of his patients, all grinning in their bathing suits, around the time that Schönfelder was sterilized. Elger, Richters archivist, told me that the association among the three subjectsfather-in-law,0
Donnersmarck takes literally the idea that Richters paintings know something, and are trying to tell us, in spite of their authors confounding trail of crumbs. The things that are the most obvious and the most clear should never be forgotten, he said. If you look at Richters catalogue raisonné, you will see all the photo paintings. Suddenly, at the end, comes the largest paintingthe one of Ema descending the staircase nude. He says himself that its his wife, pregnant. Then you say, wait a minute, theyre thirty-four, which is very late for that generation,0
According to Donnersmarck, in order to elicit the most candor from Richter, he offered a strategy for presentation. When the time came, Donnersmarck wouldnt say what in the film was true and Richter wouldnt say what wasnt. While filming was under way, Donnersmarck wrote to Richter about his plans: Whenever the conversation turns to you, I will say that it is specifically not a bio-pic of Gerhard Richter but the story of the fictional painter Kurt Barnert. I will call the film something like a spiritual biography of our country, which was enriched by the biographies of other artists as well. I will say that the elements of your biography were merely the starting point for a free, fictionalized, story. He went on, As for things that are shown in the movie because you told me about them and that are not commonly known anyway and matters of public record, I will of course continue to be silent about them. May the journalists speculate over what is truth and what is fiction!,0
To me, Donnersmarck said, Unless he decides to reveal something thats true, which under the arrangement is permissible, he can always hide behind the fact that I invented things, and I can always hide behind the fact that something invented could be true. The understanding was precariousa touchy matter, Donnersmarck saidbut it had implicit safeguards. Richter could disown the film, and Donnersmarck could validate his sourcing. All this information is from Richter, he explained. He knows that I have all this incredibly sensitive stuff on tape. A lot of it involves his first wife, whos still alive, and has a right to privacy. (The former Ema Eufinger now runs a secondhand-clothing store in Düsseldorf and never discusses Herr Richter.) Its changed enough that one can say,0
Donnersmarcks hero, Kurt Barnert, has been profoundly affected by the death of his aunt, a psychiatric patient first sterilized and then murdered by the Nazis. At art school in Dresden, he falls in love with and marries a fellow-student, only to learn that her father, a former member of the S.S., is the doctor who presided over the aunts treatment, condemning her to death with a flick of his red pencil. Terrifyingly, the father-in-law, who sees Barnert as genetically undesirable,0
As a young artist, Richter was interested in the lottery: an everyday example of random elements acquiring unassailable significance. When Schreiber was researching the biography, Richter found his discoveries fascinating. He marvelled at the details of his father-in-laws S.S. past and, in particular, his participation in the sterilization program. Elger, the archivist, told me that Richter had coöperated closely with Schreiber, sharing unseen pictures and private family stories. But after the book came out Richter was not so happy, Elger said. Schreiber made it a crime story, made too much out of it. He made a lot of connections, put everything together. He lived on this street andsurprise,0
Richters provisional acceptance of interlopers, Donnersmarck believes, is rooted in his practice as an artist and in his psychology. He was both thrilled and shocked by Schreibers book, Donnersmarck said. Though he gave him quite a lot of access, he now considers him an enemy. Richter does not generally insist on propriety: he has painted, from magazine and newspaper images, murder victims, suicides, and Jackie Kennedy weeping at J.F.K.s funeral. He himself is so phenomenally indiscreet in his artoverstepping boundaries, overreaching, Donnersmarck said. Theres a German word,0
Donnersmarck knew that he had to tread carefully when he began interviewing Richter. All the factual information I was using was from Schreiber, and he knew that, he told me. But he expressed such incredible anger at Schreiber that I had to pretend that it came to me from the Holy Spirit. I was the Virgin Mary, impregnated by these facts out of nowhere.,,,,,,,,0
For an artist like Richter, whose sources are deeply biographical, inviting others to collaborate on the story of his life may be both irresistible and highly dangerous. Donnersmarck read the screenplay to Richter, as he did to me; in his view, Richter, frailer than when he had sat for the interviews, was profoundly moved. But he refused to go to a theatre to see the finished film. He said, Can you send me the DVD?  Donnersmarck recalled. I said, No, Ill rent you a theatre. Its like me saying I want to see a painting of yours on a stamp. ,,0
The relationship, which started off with such unexpected warmth, chilled as Donnersmarcks project came to fruition. Schreiber, for one, was unsurprised. Richters reactions to my book and to the film are equal, he wrote to me. First, he was happy and told me on the phone that a friend had told him, Now you have a biography like Picasso. Later, he was complaining.,,,0
After receiving Richters letter about the case von Donnersmarck, I wrote to him again, hoping to understand what had happened. He replied:,,,,,,,,,0
What to sayvery soon after his first or second visit I told him clearly that I would not approve of a movie about Gerhard Richter. I also suggested that the protagonist might have another profession, like a writer or a musician for example, as the family history that he wanted to tell did not necessarily need a painter as such. He left all his options open and I gave him something in writing stating that he was explicitly not allowed to use or publish either my name or any of my paintings. He reassured me to respect my wishes.,,,,,,,,,0
But in reality, he has done everything to link my name to his movie, and the press was helping him to the best of its ability. Fortunately, the most important newspapers here reviewed his concoction very skeptically and critically. Nevertheless, he managed to abuse and grossly distort my biography! I dont want to say more about this.,,,,,,,0
Elger told me, I would say, after the Schreiber book, he makes the same mistake twice. He went on, Hes interested in things like this, maybe. Donnersmarck, he knows how to approach people. Hes very smart, hes very gentle, like these film people are. They know how to get people to give them money. Donnersmarck, the Oscar winner, wants to talk to you. He wrote this letter by himself. Gerhard called him. They met. I dont really know why he let that in. He was so charming,0
Sometimes Donnersmarcks children play What superpower would you most want to have? The children wish that they could fly, or walk through walls, or turn invisible. No, he tells them, the only superpower you really need is the ability to read minds.,,,,,,,0
Interviewing Richter, Donnersmarck felt that he was coming close to a profound truth, and also that Moritz, Richters wife, might at any moment cut him off. He wished he could overhear their evening debriefing, in order to understand his prospects for continuing. One night, after leaving Richter, Donnersmarck turned on his phone and found a voice mail from him: a pocket dial. He listened to the sound of Richter walking down the corridor, calling his dog, Leica, and then sitting down with his wife and telling her about the days interview. It was as close to wiretapping the confession booth as Donnersmarck could hope to get,0
When I met up with Donnersmarck for lunch in Los Angeles, in December, and asked what he had heard Richter say, he told me, That is truly fruit of the poisonous tree. He was preparing for the films American release and hunting for a new house. The family had been based in Munich, with the kids accompanying Donnersmarck on location, while he made the film. He looked restedtrim, with his hair now darker and tamed. Even though it was wonderful and very useful fruit, even though it made it possible for me to continue interviews with him for a very long time, because I had a ten times better counterargument against anything his wife was objecting to. Now that he feels Richter turning against him, the recording is a comfort to his conscience.,0
When I told him what Richter had written, that he had explicitly objected to the films being about a painter, Donnersmarck was taken aback. Richter had listened to the screenplay, and even raised the possibility of making the paintings for the film himselfa notion that Donnersmarck, imagining long delays and the nightmare of insuring millions of dollars worth of original art, had declined. (Richter denies making this suggestion.) Instead, Donnersmarck hired one of Richters former assistants to re-create key works. It was a pity, he said, that I had not been able to get Richter to open up to me more, show the real self he had revealed during their interviews. What he was doing now was obfuscating, an octopus in a cloud of ink. I thought he would simply stay quiet publicly,0
At a public event not long ago, Donnersmarck told the audience, Any work that resonates in some way can only be autobiographical. It just comes in different crypto-forms. Only once the film came out was the hazard of the arrangement between Donnersmarck and Richter laid bare. Just as photographs replace and alter memoriesa transubstantiation that Richter complicates in his photo paintingsso, too, do films tend to replace facts. The details that Richter had shared with Donnersmarck, and those he had gleaned from Schreibers biography, made the inventions seem real. So many details were taken from his history, and on the other side there were so many things that were alternative facts, as you say in the States, Elger said. If you have fifty per cent historical details from Richters life, you think the others are true. You cant differentiate between what is true and what is not true.,0
In a Richter-like gesture, Donnersmarck had freighted the film with hidden meaning. I put in a lot of what computer-game programmers call Easter eggs, things only he would be able to decipher, little love letters to him, he told me. Its too bad he didnt see it, but I can understand it a little bit. If I imagine someone taking my life story and putting a spin on it, either it would be super-painful, because it would be so close to these painful chapters in my life, or it would be painful because it was not close enough. Richters story was complex and difficult; Donnersmarck could not truly fault him for wanting to maintain control of it. He said, Maybe the film is for everybody except him.,,0
Donnersmarck and I exchanged many letters in the next few weeks. He wanted to make sure that I had his motivations straightthat his goal was to exalt Richter, not to diminish him. If my film did not portray him as the hero, I would feel on morally problematic territory, he told me. It does portray him as a hero. Wouldnt you say?,,,,,,,,0
Charting the underpinnings of ones own creative impulses is a murky, perhaps counterproductive, business. Thats what interpretersjournalists, biographers, filmmakers, shrinksare for. Its impossible to do it for your own work, Donnersmarck told me at lunch. Even Richter cant do it for his own work. Thats why he wants Schreiber and me. In a certain way, Im being his analyst. And hes the kind of patient who can get super pissed-off at his analysts. In a way, the fact that he gets so super pissed-off at us shows that were pointing toward something correct. I think hes kind of, in a weird way, addicted to this type of analysis.,0
In the course of verifying details of his life for this piece, Richter declined to entertain Donnersmarcks ideas about the significance of the Ema painting. Ill leave that to the art historians to figure out, he said. He did allow that Emas father had been her gynecologist, and that there were mysteries and rumors around the treatment that he provided her. But that, he said, was not his story to tell. As for his time with Donnersmarck, Richter had not enjoyed hearing the screenplay read aloud. The only part of the encounters he took pleasure in was the tactful, penetrating questioning of the interviews. That had touched him deeply. Richter said," He was like a psychoanalyst.""","Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s new movie, inspired by Gerhard Richter, blurs the line between fiction and biography.

UBS,"Earths natural resources largely determine the global economys ebb and flow. As such, the effects of climate change continue to cause concern among economists and environmentalists alike. In 2018, professors William Nordhaus and Paul Romer won the Nobel Prize in Economics for their work exploring how climate change affects economic stability. Ultimately, the pairs research found the phenomena to be closely linked. The case for investment in sustainable ventures is clear: Without such commitments, both the planet and the global economic ecosystem will suffer. Sustainable investments may jump start the slow process of changing consumer habits. Below, we examine the economy-boosting benefits of environmentally friendly business models and how sustainable investment plays an important role. Rolling the DICE As part of Nordhaus research, he developed an economic model called Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model DICE. The acronym, he notes, acknowledges that ignoring climate change is a gamble with severe economic and environmental costs. The DICE model examines expenses related to crop failures, flooding, and other natural disasters. It considers the threat and frequency of environmental damage, as well as the economic harm associated with carbon emissions. The long story short: Climate change has potential to wreak havoc upon the global economy. Nordhaus research helped shape the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (PICC)s recent report. The findings have attracted attention from policymakers and economists worldwide. Preventing severe consequences of climate change is a matter of enacting strict environmental regulations and quickly. The UNs report says that such regulation on an international scale has no documented historic precedent. As one part of a solution at scale, Nordhaus and Romer have proposed that governments enact a global carbon tax. Earlier in 2018, at the UBS Nobel Perspectives Live! event in Shanghai, economist and 2007 Nobel Laureate Eric S. Maskin supported this notion. Climate change is not a problem that is going to take care of itself, says Maskin. Some progress has been made toward reducing [carbon] emissions. But not nearly enough... A carbon tax forces people and companies to pay directly for the damage theyre creating. Government action is, however, historically a process that moves at a snails pace time the planet doesnt have to waste. This is why private and institutional investment in environmental ventures is part of a realistic long-term plan to combat climate change. We must learn to do more with less Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, echoes Maskins sentiment that urgent action is no longer optional. We have been borrowing resources from future generations in order to raise our living standards today, Donovan says. Environmental constraints on economic growth are becoming increasingly visible whether that is the destructive power of natural disasters or simply a lack of resource. We must learn to do more with less, Donovan continues. That requires innovation and productivity. It also requires a climate where the existing way of doing things is challenged. Sustainable models: Saving the environment, boosting the economy Thankfully, a number of organizations are working to build sustainable business models both from an environmental and economic perspective. These smaller-scale initiatives can have major impact from the ground up. Ambri is a revolutionary battery technology founded by Dr. Donald Sadoway, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a UBS Global Visionary. Dr. Sadoway created the liquid metal battery based on his research with electrochemical processes. Ambris products are intended to reduce societys reliance upon the traditional power grid. Ambri hopes to bring a renewable energy source to the masses. The idea is to have a battery that is robust and long-lived, and ultimately very cheap, says Dr. Sadoway in a video for UBS. And so, I conceived of this device ultimately, we want to have something about the size of a ten-meter shipping container that would have a capacity to service 100 American homes. Image: VELAFRICA, UBS Velafrica, created by UBS Global Visionary Paolo Richter, is another company that blends economic growth with environmental progress. The organization collects and refurbishes bicycles and delivers them to rural areas of Africa. The bikes provide an efficient, affordable, and sustainable method of transportation that can help lift people out of poverty. Velafricas bicycles provide people in underserved areas with transportation and access to resources like food, water, and education. Today, the company has distributed more than 180,000 bikes in places like Ghana, Gambia, Madagascar, Tanzania, Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast. A recent study found that more than 80% of institutional investors are interested in customizable sustainable investments. Continued investment in organizations like Ambri and Velafrica may help ensure both environmental and economic benefits for future generations to come. Luckily, investors have expressed increasing commitment to sustainable ventures. A recent study found that more than 80% of institutional investors are interested in customizable sustainable investments. Donovan has seen this very trend firsthand at UBS. UBS clients tend to have a long-term view and often consider future generations, notes Donovan. It is natural that they will have a particular interest in managing the issues of the environmental credit crunch. The value of investments can go down as well as up. Your capital and income is at risk. ESG/Sustainable Investing Considerations: Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and in some instances integrate the analysis of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the investment process and portfolio. Strategies across geographies and styles approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a variety of ways. Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio managers ability to participate in certain investment opportunities that otherwise would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio consisting primarily of ESG or sustainable investments may be lower or higher than a portfolio where such factors are not considered by the portfolio manager. Because sustainability criteria can exclude some investments, investors may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as investors that do not use such criteria. Companies may not necessarily meet high performance standards on all aspects of ESG or sustainable investing issues; there is also no guarantee that any company will meet expectations in connection with corporate responsibility, sustainability, and/or impact performance.

Of course, the biggest hits on the industry Richter scale came from the top of Mount WPP, and we’re still a ways out from seeing how the aftershocks affect the work we actually see and the agencies that help create it. But there were two other big hits of the week that once again illustrate the power of finding just the right way to break into culture. Spotify and Uniqlo helped create two pop cultural pieces of art that were singular, accessible, events in their own right. MORE PLEASE. Onward!

Olivia Singh,"Justin Theroux has opened up for the first time since his split with Jennifer Aniston. In a profile for the New York Times that was published on Saturday, the ""Maniac"" actor shared his thoughts on the couple's shocking split — which was confirmed in February 2018 after two years of marriage. ""The good news is that was probably the most — I'm choosing my words really carefully — it was kind of the most gentle separation, in that there was no animosity,"" Theroux said. ""In a weird way, just sort of navigating the inevitable perception of it is the exhausting part."" The 47-year-old went on to say that he and Aniston don't have any bad blood. ""Again, neither one of us is dead, neither one of us is looking to throw hatchets at each other,"" he said. ""It's more like, it's amicable. It's boring, but, you know, we respected each other enough that it was as painless as it could be."" Theroux added that although they remain on friendly terms, their friendship changed as a result of their split. ""It was heartbreaking, only in the sense that the friendship would not be the same, as far as just the day to day,"" he said. ""But the friendship is shifting and changing, you know, so that part is something that we're both very proud of."" The actor also said that he doesn't go on Twitter because ""with the internet, it's too inelegant a machine to accurately carve truth"" — but he's aware of headlines written about his personal life. ""These are actually in reality small events that take place,"" Theroux said. ""But everything can feel like 10 on the Richter scale if you make the headline big enough and salacious enough."" When Theroux and Aniston revealed their separation in February, their statement indicated that they still valued their relationship and would ""maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another."" ""We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship. Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.

"Meghan Bartels, SPACE.com","Researchers looking for signals from technologically advanced aliens pick up countless strange pings—but so far, nothing has convinced them that a message really came from aliens. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t plenty of overblown media headlines about potential alien detections. So a team of researchers pursuing the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI, has decided to revive a scale meant to ground these detections in reality. They shared their scale, called Rio 2.0, in a new paper that takes aim at SETI researchers and the media for irresponsible coverage of potential detections. “It’s absolutely crucial that when we talk about something so hugely significant as the discovery of intelligent life beyond the Earth, we do it clearly and carefully,” lead author Duncan Forgan, a SETI scientist at the University of St Andrews in the U.K., said in a statement from the SETI Institute. “Having Rio 2.0 allows us to rank a signal quickly in a way that the general public can easily understand, and helps us keep their trust in a world filled with fake news.” [ 13 Ways to Hunt Intelligent Aliens ] The new study builds on a similar effort, called the Rio Scale, which was developed in 2000 and was presented at the 51st International Astronautical Congress held in Rio de Janeiro the next year. But since the original scale was developed, SETI scientists have decided that the evaluation needed some updating, particularly given the breakneck pace of online media. The new version of the scale creates the same output: a score ranging from 0 to 10 meant to convey the importance of a signal detection, with 0 representing a detection of no importance and 10 indicating one of extraordinary importance. But the new research proposes tweaking the way that score is calculated to try to make it a better representation of the factors that determine a detection’s true significance and to make the tool easier for scientists to use to evaluate their own signals and those of their colleagues. That initial score is then meant to be revised as additional data are gathered, the researchers explained. The co-authors of the new research, who include some of the same people behind the 2001 scale, hope that reviving the scale will help the public and the media evaluate the importance of a signal—sort of like the alien equivalent of the Richter scale, co-author Jill Tarter, a SETI researcher based at the SETI Institute, said in the statement. “The SETI community is attempting to create a scale that can accompany reports of any claims of the detection of extraterrestrial intelligence and be refined over time as more data become available,” Tarter said. “This scale should convey both the significance and credibility of the claimed detection.” The research was described in a paper published July 24 in the International Journal of Astrobiology, and the researchers have set up an online calculator to produce the scores. So far, the scientists wrote, the majority of the detections they’ve run through the calculator have come back with a score of 0, which means it’s still much too early to get excited about alien communications.

Scott Davis,"One month into the NBA season, TV ratings are down, and LeBron James is partly to blame, according to Austin Karp of Sports Business Daily. TNT's viewership is down 26%, and ESPN's is down 6%, with TNT averaging 1.79 million viewers per telecast, its slowest start in a decade, according to Karp. James' move to the Los Angeles Lakers has been a big reason why. With James now playing on the West Coast, the early time slots have been hit hard. Meanwhile, the later slots, usually featuring Western Conference teams, have done well. Via Karp: ""For TNT's early windows this season to date, the net is averaging 1.61 million viewers compared to 2.75 million viewers at the same point last season (zero James games this year vs. two in '17). But the late windows, which feature more prominent Western Conference teams, are seeing a less-pronounced drop, with two Lakers games to date. Meanwhile, ESPN is down 6% overall after 18 telecasts, averaging 1.69 million viewers compared to 1.79 million. But the net is up compared to the same time frame two years ago (1.61 million viewers for 14 games). James and the Lakers also have the top ESPN game this season, with 2.7 million viewers for the Nov. 8 matchup against the Celtics."" What also hasn't helped the networks is that the Eastern Conference's best teams don't register as high on the Richter scale. The Toronto Raptors own the NBA's best record at 17-4 (as of Monday), but Toronto's market isn't included in Nielsen's ratings. The Milwaukee Bucks and Indiana Pacers are in second and third place in the East but are two of the smaller markets. The Philadelphia 76ers can help boost the ratings, but the Boston Celtics have gotten off to a sluggish start, and the New York Knicks are only 7-14 and aren't featured as prominently on national TV. Of course, the fall is not the NBA's main season, particularly with NFL ratings up this year. The NBA's ratings may still increase around Christmas, then once the NFL season ends, particularly when the regular season gets closer to the playoffs.","NBA TV ratings are down to start the season.

Chris Ciaccia,"A large swath of earthquakes hit the Pacific's ""Ring of Fire"" earlier this week, prompting some to wonder if it is a precursor to the oft-discussed massive earthquake, colloquially known as ""the Big One."" Sixty-nine earthquakes, including 16 tremors registering 4.5 or above on the Richter scale, recently hit the area known as the ""Ring of Fire,"" according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which recorded the events, but did not issue a warning. Several of the quakes registered significant impacts, including one that hit 5.0 and shook the area on Tuesday morning. Fiji appeared to be the most impacted, as five tremors above a 4.5 magnitude hit the small island. 'BIG ONE' COMING? EARTHQUAKES OFF THE WEST COAST COULD TRIGGER A GLOBAL EVENT Luckily, the earthquakes did not reach the western coast of the U.S., which partially sits on the Cascadia subduction zone, a fault that stretches from mid-Vancouver Island to Northern California. The recent tremors have sparked concern that ""the Big One"" could be near, according to the Daily Mail, but the USGS has made no mention of this. Of the 69 earthquakes, 53 hit the area on Sunday, followed by the 16 subsequent tremors, impacting Indonesia, Bolivia, Japan and the aforementioned Fiji. ""The Big One"" ""The Big One"" is often described as an earthquake with a magnitude 8 or above, causing massive destruction to California, which some have said is overdue for a an earthquake of this magnitude. California sits on the San Andreas fault, a 750-mile fault that has been responsible for some of the state's most devastating earthquakes. The last earthquake that came close to a 8.0 magnitude in California was the great earthquake of 1906, which hit a magnitude of 7.9 and shook San Francisco to the ground, destroying 80 percent of the city and resulted in 3,000 deaths. A massive earthquake registering 8.2 was registered on Sunday, hitting 174 miles north-northeast of Ndoi Island, Fiji, according to the the USGS. Luckily, the massive quake did not cause any significant damage, hitting at a depth of 347.7 miles, too deep to cause a tsunami. “We are monitoring the situation and some places felt it, but it was a very deep earthquake,” Director Apete Soro told Reuters in an interview. CALIFORNIA MEGA-EARTHQUAKE FEAR: IS THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT AT RISK OF THE 'BIG ONE?' The Ring of Fire The Ring of Fire is a 25,000 mile horseshoe shaped ring, accounting for approximately 90 percent of the world's earthquakes, according to the USGS. The region also contains 452 volcanoes, more than 75 percent of the world's active and dormant volcanoes. Though the USGS did not issue a warning, the recent spat of earthquakes in the Ring of Fire could eventually cause some problems for the western part of the U.S. and other close regions. Speaking with Vox in February, University of California Santa Cruz professor Emily Brodsky said ""earthquakes and volcanoes can interact,"" before adding it's unclear how much the string of earthquakes we've seen in recent months are connected. Brodsky also said that having quakes and volcanic eruptions at the same time in an active area is not unusual. SCIENTISTS FIND DOZENS OF HIDDEN EARTHQUAKES BURIED UNDER ANTARCTICA'S ICE In late July, a string of recent earthquakes off the West Coast of the U.S., ranging from 2.8 to 5.6 on the Richter scale, also raised questions of whether the ""Big One"" could be near.

ABC News,"An explosion rocked Hawaii's Kilauea volcano early Tuesday morning, spewing ash nearly a mile into the air and sparking an earthquake that registered 5.5 magnitude on the Richter scale, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Interested in Volcanoes? Add Volcanoes as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Volcanoes news, video, and analysis from ABC News. The tremor occurred at around 4:30 a.m. local time, the agency reported. It was not clear if any damage was caused, but no tsunami was expected, officials said. Thousands of residents have been evacuated from the area and lava spewing from the volcano's fissures have destroyed more than 100 structures since the first eruption a month ago. The incident didn't trigger tsunami warnings due to the small size of the earthquake. ""It's not big enough,"" Cindi Preller, geologist and duty scientist at the Oahu office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told ABC News. Instead, tsunamis or tidal waves, become more serious threats if the size of the earthquake increases, Preller said. ""Anything above 6.9 [magnitude] is our threshold,"" she said, noting that it would warn people to stay clear of the ocean in such an event. On May 4, a 6.9-magnitude earthquake was centered near the south flank of Kilauea one hour after a 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck nearby, the U.S. Geological Survey confirmed. Eruptions like the one today may not wane anytime soon, Preller cautioned. ""This could go on for months,"" she said.

Chris Ciaccia,"A giant swarm of 153 earthquakes recently hit near the Yellowstone supervolcano, according to the latest data. The data, taken from the University of Utah Seismograph Station, shows a series of earthquakes happening all around Yellowstone, but none higher than a 2.5 magnitude on the Richter scale. Anything above a 5 is classified as a risk by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). While the recent string of quakes' intensity is not strong enough to pose a danger, they are a reminder that the area experiences frequent seismic activity. 'BIG ONE' COMING? EARTHQUAKES OFF THE WEST COAST COULD EVENTUALLY TRIGGER A GLOBAL EVENT ""Yellowstone earthquake activity remains at background levels,"" researchers wrote, according to The Daily Mail. The alert level continues to remain at ""normal,"" indicating the recent swath of earthquakes are not any cause for concern. Some have professed that a major earthquake could set off the Yellowstone supervolcano, which last erupted 630,000 years ago. In October 2017, researchers Hannah Shamloo and Christy Till analyzed minerals in fossilized ash from the most recent eruption. What they discovered surprised them — the changes in temperature and composition only took a few decades, much faster than the centuries previously thought. At the time, several media outlets suggested that the findings could mean that the supervolcano was going to erupt faster than Shamloo and Till expected, but that is not the case.

STANLEY REED,"The government has placed tight restrictions on the activity. For instance, Cuadrilla is required to put seismic monitors around the site to detect tremors. The threshold for shutting down operations is 0.5 on the Richter scale, a level that seismologists say is well below what could threaten life or property. Richard Luckett, a seismologist for the British Geological Survey, an agency that is monitoring the Cuadrilla site, said in a telephone interview that such tremors were predictable as a result of fracturing. The agency reported that the shudder on Tuesday had registered 0.4 He said tremors of that size could not be felt by people near the site and posed no threat of property damage, adding that 0.4 does not worry me as a seismologist. But the agency subsquently reported that a tremor on Wednesday had registered 0.5, athough Cuadrilla said that was a result of the reading being rounded up from 0.48. In an emailed statement, Britains Oil and Gas Authority described the tremors as low-level seismic activity that can only be detected with specialist equipment, and said that it was monitoring carefully Cuadrillas activities to ensure they remain in line with approved plans. Despite the tight scrutiny and obstacles like a lack of domestic hydraulic-fracturing expertise, Cuadrilla and other companies say they are confident they can make a successful business out of shale-gas drilling in Britain if the countrys rock formations prove suitable. They argue that more drilling and fracking is needed to discover what resources Britain has and whether they can be used commercially.","Cuadrilla Resources’ Preston New Road fracking operation in Lancashire, Britain.

Matthew Milan,"The best innovation teams dont work alone. They bring in partners from different backgrounds, countries, and even industries to help provide fresh thinking and ideas. The process of finding and forging partnerships and collaborations, however, is not easy to do well. The best teams Ive worked with have come up with a clever solution: They develop partnerships in much the same way they develop products. Rather than simply hiring vendors, the most innovative companies establish processes and frameworks that allow them to quickly validate whether a partner will be a good fit. Theyll get to work immediately, and focus together on the smallest tangible outcome that will provide proof that the partnership is actually working. I like to call it a Minimum Viable Partnership model. In this model, the partnership IS the project. The test and learn partnership model Most business partnerships are quid pro quo. An organization identifies a problem, and then sets out to hire a vendor to provide a solution. When it comes to innovation partnerships, however, the traditional model may not always produce the best output. Why? Because innovation teams dont have specific, concrete problems to solve. They have problem spaces to explore. In situations like these, paying another company to help explore the space with you doesnt make sense. Theres too much uncertainty to justify large commitments for an unknown payoff. So, the best internal innovation teams start by testing potential partners first, before getting down to business, so they find the right talent who can iterate on solutions together. Great innovators use this test and learn approach to partnerships no matter how big or small their company is. Using tools like the Lean Startup methodology, these innovators quickly explore and refine different partnership approaches with complementary companies instead of directly hiring firms to do a specific job. My team and I used this approach when we worked with a small healthcare startup. To reduce patient neglect in hospitals, the startup wanted to design an AI-based, wall-mounted device that monitors everything that happens in a patients room to help nurses and hospitals understand how well theyre taking care of patients. The startups founders realized that to build their product they needed outside expertise from technologists and healthcare practitioners to augment their core team. Our first few interactions demonstrated that we could work well together, and ultimately, everybody benefited from this approach. The small healthcare startup got the experts in the room they needed, the technology companies got exposure to a new, lucrative industry, and the healthcare providers got early access to new ways of thinking and technology that changed the way they thought about patient care. The resulting product, iN, is currently being implemented and deployed at a major academic medical center in New York City, and was just recognized by Fast Company as an Innovation by Design award winner. But you dont need to be a startup to use the Most Valuable Partnership model. The best example Ive found of a large company using this approach is Johnson &amp; Johnsons JLABS program. Melinda Richter, the global head of Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation, JLABS, recently told me that the goal of her program is to make it easy for the companys innovation team to start exploring partnerships without worrying about competition, IP, or budget. She said her team starts their partnership process by inviting startups, research labs, granting agencies, and even competitors to events around the world, where they discuss shared scientific challenges. Using these events, the innovation team identifies potential partners, and invites the most promising ones to collaborate even further by inviting them to work at one of its 12 JLABS incubators. These JLABS include shared laboratory equipment that only a company with the scale of Johnson &amp; Johnson could afford. The process doesnt end there. In some cases, JLABS will give partners access to additional talent, data, and even funds to run quick experiments. And they do all of this without taking any economic stake in the partners they work with. Investing in a partnership or collaboration without asking for equity or revenue-sharing may seem crazy, but thats precisely why this model works so well. Because JLABS doesnt have to worry about the ROI of every decision they make, they can try lots of unconventional collaborations quickly and cheaply, giving them access to research and ideas they would ordinarily never be exposed to. It turns out this approach pays off. The most extraordinary example Richter shared with me was a company called Arcturus, which was interested in rare diseases, an area of research that typically isnt profitable for large pharmaceutical companies. Richter met Arcturus founders at multiple JLABS events, where she grew to love the passion of the two founders. Because of JLABS unique no-strings attached approach, she had no problem giving Arcturus access to R&amp;D experts to develop a plan, and laboratories to conduct initial research. When they came back with promising data, Johnson &amp; Johnson helped them raise venture money by validating their results. A few months later, Richter asked Arcturus to present their data to Johnson &amp; Johnsons R&amp;D leadership. At that presentation, one of Johnson &amp; Johnsons leaders realized that the same technology Arcturus was developing for rare diseases could be used for Hepatitis B, one of the worlds deadliest, most debilitating diseases, and ended up partnering with the small company on technology that even eventually did more than $2 billion worth of deals and is now a public company. Not all JLABS partnerships are that successful, of course. But by creating a process where they can test out partnerships with minimal friction and risk, Richters team has developed a lean process that can turn networking events into billion-dollar innovations. A new partner discovery playbook The partnership-as-product approach isnt limited to big companies partnering with startups. In fact, sometimes it works best when you need to make sweeping changes across a large, slow-moving industry. To understand their approach, I called up Tina Wung, who was formerly a longtime corporate innovator and now consults for Fortune 1000 companies who are looking to innovate. She told me that innovation challenges at large corporations look very different than than they look at most companies. When they want to explore a new idea, they dont just need to explore it with end consumers; they need to work with manufacturers, marketers, distributors, retailers, even sports leagues. To innovate in such a complex space, she said she often deployed a tactic from lean product development playbooks: Im calling it Partner Discovery. Wung often started the process by identifying partners who were interested in working in an innovative way and were willing to experiment on solving any one of the companys core interest areas (i.e., improving sustainability in the supply chain). Once her team identified potential partners, they started discussing ideas and challenges across the industry that they might be able to solve together. As trust grew, they were able to be more transparent about what they were each developing internally, ultimately sharing ideas and product roadmaps that had previously been closely guarded secrets. In taking this approach, Wung was able to decrease the risk for all of her partners innovation teams by effectively spreading it across multiple organizations. This allowed the entire industry to cut losses faster and increase the pace of innovation. Whether youre a startup trying to get a complex product off the ground, a multinational business looking to explore moonshots outside your core business, or a conglomerate trying to make an industry more innovative, you should consider taking a lean, product-development approach to building partnerships. Theres no better way to navigate the complex world of innovation work that with the tried and true approach of build, test and learn to establish a fit between you and and a new partner.","The best innovation teams don’t work alone.

Gargi Verma,"Dhundalwadi Ashramshala students sleep inside a tent as Ullas Satvi keeps a vigil. Archive
ULLAS SATVI, headmaster of Dhundalwadi Ashramshala is dealing with distraught parents since morning. The Class X exams started today. The Class XII exams have been going on. The children are used to the tremors now, but the parents worry. So, many of them have landed up wanting to take their children home. Convincing them has been an uphill task, he said.
Since the earthquake measuring 4.1 on the Richter Scale hit on February 1, when a four-year-old girl died in Haladpada village, the quake Friday measuring 4.3 on the Richter Scale was the highest recorded in the area. While no structures have collapsed, various buildings have developed cracks.
The exams had started and within 15 minutes, the tremors struck. The children were scared a bit. Usually, we dont feel so much of the tremors, but this time it was real. It lasted hardly for a couple of seconds, but it was scary, an invigilator at Talasari civil school said.
The earthquake was felt over a region of around 40 km from where it originated at the Gujarat-Maharashtra border. The epicentre of the earthquakes are moving further away from Dhundalwadi, but the tremors are increasing too. It is scary, but we cant do anything until the exams get over, Satvi said. Three more earthquakes were recorded on Friday, but none of them were felt seriously overground.
Over 10,000 villagers of more than 40 villages in Dahanu have been sleeping outside their houses since November 2018. I was hoping that the February earthquake would be highest, but this was more scary. I felt the ground giving way under my feet and had to hold on to a tree, said Surya Ghoda, a resident of Karanjvira village near Dhundalwadi. His wife, Anita said, My first thoughts were about my children, two of whom were in school. The youngest, my daughter, was out playing. I ran to fetch her and asked my husband to bring back the other children.
Ghoda, however, refused to fetch children from the school. This keeps on happening. Cant keep getting them out of school after every tremor. I just want this to stop forever, he said.
Several villagers requested for tents from the collectors office, the local civic representatives said. Some people were living in their houses as they were cement structures and would just step out to sleep. But deep cracks have come up in all of the single-storey houses. So, most of the residents of Haladpada and Bajarpada are now setting up house inside the tents and dont want to go home, said Ananta Mahal, an anganwadi worker in Haladpada.
The 4.3 quake have left many geologists confused, as the shallow earthquake travelled far. Generally, shallow earthquakes dont affect a larger region. But we are studying the seismic activity and will have to understand the situation better, said a geologist at the station set up by the Palghar disaster management team near Dhundalwadi.
The ambulances made multiple rounds in the area well into the afternoon. I was worried that someone had been injured or worse. But they assured us that no one had been injured. Tell me, is it a good thing or should we worry that when injury and destruction come, it will be in bulk?

Christopher Intagliata,"On March 27th, 1964, a huge earthquake struck the Prince William Sound, off the coast of Alaska. &lt;&lt;CLIP: ""Out in the gulf of Alaska, the ocean bottom plunges, then heaves upward a full 50 feet, and a wave starts racing toward the shore…""&gt;&gt; The quake is the second most powerful ever recorded, at 9.2 on the Richter scale, and it killed more than a hundred people. And just like the devastating Sumatra quake of 2004… or the Chilean quake in 2010… the Great Alaska Earthquake struck right around the time of the full moon. Coincidence? In 2016, Japanese researchers concluded that large earthquakes might indeed be more likely to occur during times of significant tidal stress… when it's either a new or full moon. And the news rumbled through the media, despite the study's small sample size, of just a dozen large quakes. Now seismologist Susan Hough of the U.S. Geological Survey has done a much larger analysis. She plotted more than 200 big quakes--magnitude 8.0 or above--over the past four centuries, looking to see if they were more likely to strike on certain days of the year, or during key phases of the moon. The answer, neatly summed up in the study's one-word abstract? ""No."" The study is in the journal Seismological Research Letters. [Susan E. Hough, Do Large (Magnitude ≥8) Global Earthquakes Occur on Preferred Days of the Calendar Year or Lunar Cycle? ] That's not to say we don't know of certain factors that actually do increase the risk of quakes. Hough says the ground injection of wastewater, oil and gas production, fracking, and damming up waterways can in some cases cause quakes.

Meghan Bartels,"Researchers looking for signals from technologically advanced aliens pick up countless strange pings — but so far, nothing has convinced them that a message really came from aliens. But that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of overblown media headlines about potential alien detections. So a team of researchers pursuing the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI, has decided to revive a scale meant to ground these detections in reality. They shared their scale, called Rio 2.0, in a new paper that takes aim at SETI researchers and the media for irresponsible coverage of potential detections. ""It's absolutely crucial that when we talk about something so hugely significant as the discovery of intelligent life beyond the Earth, we do it clearly and carefully,"" lead author Duncan Forgan, a SETI scientist at the University of St Andrews in the U.K., said in a statement from the SETI Institute. ""Having Rio 2.0 allows us to rank a signal quickly in a way that the general public can easily understand, and helps us keep their trust in a world filled with fake news."" [ 13 Ways to Hunt Intelligent Aliens ] The new study builds on a similar effort, called the Rio Scale, which was developed in 2000 and was presented at the 51st International Astronautical Congress held in Rio de Janeiro the next year. But since the original scale was developed, SETI scientists have decided that the evaluation needed some updating, particularly given the breakneck pace of online media. The new version of the scale creates the same output: a score ranging from 0 to 10 meant to convey the importance of a signal detection, with 0 representing a detection of no importance and 10 indicating one of extraordinary importance. But the new research proposes tweaking the way that score is calculated to try to make it a better representation of the factors that determine a detection's true significance and to make the tool easier for scientists to use to evaluate their own signals and those of their colleagues. That initial score is then meant to be revised as additional data are gathered, the researchers explained. The co-authors of the new research, who include some of the same people behind the 2001 scale, hope that reviving the scale will help the public and the media evaluate the importance of a signal — sort of like the alien equivalent of the Richter scale, co-author Jill Tarter, a SETI researcher based at the SETI Institute, said in the statement. ""The SETI community is attempting to create a scale that can accompany reports of any claims of the detection of extraterrestrial intelligence and be refined over time as more data become available,"" Tarter said. ""This scale should convey both the significance and credibility of the claimed detection."" The research was described in a paper published July 24 in the International Journal of Astrobiology, and the researchers have set up an online calculator to produce the scores. So far, the scientists wrote, the majority of the detections they've run through the calculator have come back with a score of 0, which means it's still much too early to get excited about alien communications.

"Charlie Wood, Charlie Wood","Roads broke apart, cracks radiated up buildings, and books fell from shelves today when a magnitude 7.0 earthquake rocked Anchorage, Alaska and surrounding areas. The quake struck around 8:30 a.m. local time (12:30 p.m. on the East Coast), triggering a tsunami warning and driving some residents to evacuate inland. A number of aftershocks between magnitudes 4 and 5.8 continued to hit the Cook Inlet, just south of where the Aleutian Islands meet the mainland, before the tsunami warning was canceled. At press time, no injuries had been reported. The ground shook for more than a minute, forcing people to take shelter under desks and doorframes as seen in this footage taken by KTVA 11 from an Anchorage courthouse. The shaking substantially damaged infrastructure, reducing multiple roads to fractured slabs, cutting power, and sending cracks through buildings. The Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport has halted flights, and utilities warned residents to watch out for gas leaks and downed electrical wires. Anchorages geology may have exacerbated the effects, according to ABC News. The city sits on a sediment basinground closer in consistency to sand than to rockwhich can slow waves down and amplify them. The extent of the event is being compared to a 1989 earthquake that struck San Francisco during the World Series. Seismograph needles jumped as far away as Kentucky, underscoring the force of the event. On the Richter Scale, the magnitude represents how far the needle swings, but is measured logarithmically, so moving up one level brings a 10-fold increase in shaking and about a 30-fold increase in energy released. That means the original magnitude 7 shaking was 100 times more violent than any magnitude 5 aftershocks. Earthquakes also become much rarer as you move up the scale, with fewer than 20 of the size that occurred today taking place globally each year. Alaska, which sits at the top of the geologically active Ring of Fire, feels about 40,000 annual earthquakes, and experienced the most powerful earthquake in U.S. historya magnitude 9.2 that shook Prince William sound in 1962. That quake marked the second largest in recorded history, after a magnitude 9.5 that hit Chile two years before.","Science No injuries have been reported.

ANJALI MARAR,"Written by ANJALI MARAR | Pune | Published: November 23, 2017 8:54 am Six decades ago, a powerful earthquake had struck the area near this reservoir in Koyna. Scientists studying the seismic activity triggered at the Koyna-Warna reservoirs — located near Karad, 165 km from Pune — have observed that the epicentre of earthquakes recorded in the recent decades are shifting towards the southern direction, and are concentrated around the Warna reservoir. Six decades ago, a powerful earthquake measuring 6.6 on the Richter Scale had struck the area near the Koyna reservoir, causing massive damage in the locality. Apart from Koyna reservoir, there are only three other seismically-active reservoirs in the world — located in China, Zimbabwe and Greece — which have recorded earthquakes stronger than 5 on the Richter Scale. This dam, according to geologists and seismologists, is one of the 120 reservoirs in the world which are seismically active. Experts, after analysing data sets collected since 1967, found that the seismic activity peaked in this region during the monsoon. This is believed to be triggered by a sudden rise in the water level at the reservoir. Two earthquake data sets — from 1970 to 1990, and from 2003 to 2010, were used to conclude that higher the levels of water stored, higher the seismic activity, making it crucial for dam operators to store and release water appropriately. “But, in the recent decades, we have also found that most earthquakes, with an epicentre located at a depth ranging between 2-8 km, have been shifting away from Koyna reservoir, towards Warna reservoir. This could be due to shifting of the faultline in that direction,” said Dr Nitin Karmalkar, Vice-Chancellor of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and a senior geologist associated with the central government’s Borehole Drilling Project at the Koyna-Warna reservoirs. Karmalkar made the comments at a public talk organised by the India Meteorological Society, Pune chapter, recently. The team has been drilling at the site in order to identify the exact fault which is triggering frequent earthquakes in the region, though a majority of them have been within an intensity of 5 on the Richter Scale. However, the challenges involved are many, as the reservoir is built on hard basaltic rock. Despite this, the team, along with ONGC, has been carrying out drilling, and has so far managed to drill 14 boreholes, their depths ranging between 900 metres to 1.9 km, said Karmalkar. The team plans to drill to a maximum depth of 8.5 km in the coming years. “Our further course of exploration remains in identifying the direction in which the faultline is shifting, its dimensions in terms of length and breadth, and slippage movements between the faultlines. The idea is to identify the right spot to puncture the fault, where sensitive instruments can be installed, which can then be used to issue futuristic earthquake warnings systems,” explained Karmalkar. Yet another interesting fact about the Koyna – Warna reservoirs is that geologists believe that only 50 per cent of the residual stress or energy has been released in the form of earthquakes so far. “This means earthquakes up to an intensity of 5 would continue to take place at this location. And the real test for our team lies in actually tracing the exact spot where the fault is triggering shocks,” said Karmalkar.

Caroline Williamson,"PERPETUAL CALENDARS from Joseph Magliaro, designer and former co-founder of Table of Contents Marshall McLuhan believed that outmoded technologies often return as works of art. In that vein, I like to think of the perpetual desk calendar — a staple of pre-digital 20th century office life obviated by the smartphone and personal computer — as a form ripe for recuperation as an enabler of symbolic rites. The perpetual calendar offers no practical benefit today, functioning instead as an instance of memento mori. The only reason to turn its dials or click its buttons is to remind us that another day has passed, and that to take advantage of our openness to the world, we shouldn’t feel paralyzed by angst, but rather called to action, obligated to engage as many possibilities as we can in the time that remains. TRAVEL WINE COOLERS from Fabiana Faria and Helena Barquet, co-founders of Coming Soon The first time we saw the Travel Wine Cooler — designed in 1980 by Australian designer Richard Carlson for Décor, and in MoMA’s permanent collection — was a recent purchase a friend, Esteban Arboleda, made at a local vintage store while we were staying at his house in Shelter Island. We became obsessed with it and have tried to buy out the market of them to get the best colors. We ended up amassing quite a few of them. Some have a sleeve that you can freeze that keeps the wine cool, but you might just want that particular color. We also found one with the original box, which has an amazing image of the cooler on it. STONE FRUITS from Keren Richter, co-founder of The White Arrow I’ve always found fake foods fun, be they wooden kid’s toys, plastic display-case sushi, or oversized Oldenburg Burgers. My ‘stone fruit’ collection playfully elevates something kitschy into the realm of the Renaissance still life. The monochromatic pairings explore the subtle color and textural variations between marble and alabaster, while looking pretty, too. DIGESTIF GLASSES from Daniela Jacobs, founder of ARC Objects Digestif glasses have come into my world of possessions because I love small-scale home objects – especially glass or ceramic ones. I enjoy using these small vessels for a variety of things, like sipping espresso in the morning, or placing fresh herbs in the kitchen, or actually enjoying a digestif after a meal. BASKET THEMED OBJECTS from Daniela Jacobs, founder of ARC Objects Basket-themed objects have always attracted me, since I was tiny. This probably has something to do with always seeing them around at home, and with their ubiquity in Mallorca, where I grew up aside from New York. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve grown not only an aesthetic appreciation for how these materials look, but also for the care put into how they’re made. Something about basket textures are just visually calming. CLIP-ON EARRINGS from Mary Ping, founder of Slow and Steady Wins the Race We amassed a collection of various vintage clip on earrings sourced from eBay, Etsy, and thrift shops. We went in search of timeless, sculptural, architectural, and unusual takes on the clip-on, whether it be a 1960s Space Age Lucite starburst shape, or modernist silver-tone half-cylindrical bars. Our favorites are the 1950s pea-soup colored earrings with a pivot point connecting 3 blade-shaped pieces of Bakelite that you can wear closed or spread open. We haven’t seen anything quite like them, but we wish we designed them ourselves. ICE GLASS from Monica Khemsurov, co-founder of Sight Unseen and Tetra I only purchased my first piece of vintage Blenko ‘ice glass’ –thick, chunky cast-glass objects with a beautiful watery texture — last year, in the form of a half-cylinder bookend I found at a flea market in my hometown of Columbus, Ohio. But I quickly became obsessed with collecting it, both because it’s surprisingly inexpensive despite its ridiculous heft, and because transparent and cast-glass furniture and objects have been setting off my inner trend radar for almost two years now. BALANCING BIRDS from Matthew Sullivan, designer and former founder of AQQ Index Presumably the Egyptian god Horus — overseer of sky, war, and hunting — distilled down to a cheap Chinese trinket. Pretty elegant kitsch though, a real weird time-shrinker (progress?). CLAY PIPES from Matthew Sullivan, designer and former founder of AQQ Index These vintage pipes are probably all from the late 19th century or early 20th century, and Dutch. One has really beautifully rendered curls. It’s a strange concept, smoking tobacco out of a head. Apparently the mud of all European urban waters are full of them (the Thames, the Canals of Venice, and Amsterdam). PEPPERMILLS from Sabrina De Sousa, co-founder of Dimes I’ve been collecting peppermills for some time, which led me to design my own last year. I have a bunch more at home which I can’t part with, but the group that I chose for the show are a great representation of the more modernist mills. My favorite is the tall black one with the glass tube (maker unknown) — it’s a great example of Memphis design.

Kyla Mandel,"Two minor earthquakes hit the San Francisco Bay Area on Wednesday and Thursday, measuring 3.4 and 3.5 on the Richter scale respectively. While neither caused much damage, it prompts the larger question: What happens if a really big one hits while the government is shut down?
According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) shutdown contingency plan, a total of 75 employees are “excepted,” meaning they will remain on the job without pay because their work is required “for the protection of life and property.” This includes staff at the National Earthquake Information Center, where less than one-half of employees are excepted.
“Additional employees are on call as necessary to respond in the event of a natural disaster,” the contingency plan adds. There are roughly 450 employees on call in case of a natural hazard or other emergency — most of these are personnel from volcano observatories, geologic hazard science centers, and water science centers.
The California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) is currently working with USGS to develop an earthquake early warning system, including ShakeAlert, but doesn’t have a system in place yet. Los Angeles rolled out a new earthquake warning app this month, but it’s limited to residents of Los Angeles County. So, for many concerned citizens searching for information during the shutdown, little can be found beyond the basic measurements of the earthquake’s magnitude and depth.
The USGS homepage currently displays a red banner which reads: “Due to a lapse in appropriations, the majority of USGS websites may not be up to date and may not reflect current conditions. Websites displaying real-time data, such as Earthquake and Water and information needed for public health and safety will be updated with limited support. Additionally, USGS will not be able to respond to inquiries until appropriations are enacted.”
Searching for more information on the Department of Homeland Security’s earthquake emergency website yields the same result. A red banner at the top simply states that “Due to the lapse in federal funding, this website will not be actively managed.”
Phone calls and emails to USGS staff and media contacts went largely unanswered Thursday, with the requisite automatic reply stating: “Due to the lapse in appropriations, I am prohibited from conducting work as a Federal employee, including returning phone calls and emails, until further notice.”
The USGS Earthquake Science Center in Menlo Park — located an hour south of where this week’s earthquakes hit — also appears to be closed. According to KPIX CBS San Francisco Bay Area, a seismologist is “almost always available to discuss the seismic event.” But this week, calls and emails have gone unanswered.
Per the contingency plan, the USGS National Earthquake Information Center in Colorado, however, remains open and is answering calls. “I guess we’re just functioning as we normally would here,” a seismologist told ThinkProgress. “We’re still updating, providing information… and of course, we’re not getting paid.”
They explained that earthquake information will still be updated on the USGS website, and that during major events — such as a deadly earthquake — automatic notifications are sent to “important people” to ensure they’re notified and response efforts are coordinated. The two earthquakes in the Bay Area this week, however, were not major events.
When pressed for more details, the seismologist simply said, “we’re not being told a whole lot here.”
Emergency response efforts typically involve multiple arms of government. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) earthquake preparedness guide, while there is no advance notice given for an earthquake, “emergency information will be provided immediately after through radio and TV broadcasts and via Wireless Emergency Alerts text to cell phones.”
The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also broadcasts radio alerts for all hazards to the National Weather Service.
FEMA’s website, however, is not being actively managed during the shutdown. NOAA websites and social media channels “necessary to protect lives and property” are being maintained.
Outside of the federal government, there are additional experts responsible for helping with the initial data tracking for earthquakes during a shutdown. The UC Berkeley Seismology Lab has a standing agreement with the federal government that it will conduct the initial review of any earthquake that happens.
As Peggy Hellweg, operations manager for the siesmology lab, explained to ThinkProgress, under normal circumstances UC Berkeley and USGS Menlo Park collaborate to monitor earthquakes in the northern California region. “At any given time, each of us has a complete view of what’s going on,” Hellweg said.
Each office has an earthquake information computer system which gathers data that is shared with the other, and they take turns being the “master,” or the lead system. This allows the other computer system to undergo upgrades as needed, for example. During the shutdown, with Menlo Park closed, UC Berkeley is the master computer system (data is still being automatically collected at Menlo Park). UC Berkeley is therefore responsible for verifying the data and confirming the earthquake.
Meanwhile, the Colorado-based National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) monitors things to ensure no big earthquake goes unnoticed, and that the public website remains up to date. Should a big earthquake happen in northern California, UC Berkeley would coordinate response efforts with NEIC.
The USGS’s Earth Resources Observation and Science Center (EROS), another department in which staff are excepted, is also collecting data. For earthquakes, this includes the magnitude and depth, as well as details such as which tectonic plates were involved and the type of motion. According to the contingency plan, the center is operating at the “minimal necessary contingent to ensure 24-7 Mission Operation Center coverage to sustain computer support, antenna operations, and command and control of the LandSat satellites.”
This will allow the collection and storage of data to continue so that when the government reopens, or in the event of an emergency such as an earthquake, flood, fire, or landslide, the data can be processed and analyzed.
But for now, said Hellweg, the data for all earthquakes that have occurred since the shutdown began on December 22 is not being re-evaluated and improved — typically there are multiple stages of analyzing to ensure location data, for instance, is as precise as possible.
Now in it’s 27th day, the partial government shutdown is the longest in U.S. history. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees continue to go without pay, and the longer the shutdown drags on, the more challenging it becomes to maintain essential services.
And for Hellweg and her team at UC Berkeley, concerns over funding are mounting. Their work is funded in part by USGS on an annual basis, which restarts on February 1. Usually by now Hellweg knows whether they received all their requested funding or if their budget proposal to USGS for the new year needs to be revised.
“All of these people pushing the paperwork are also furloughed,” she said, “and it’s not clear to me that there will be time between whenever the government returns and February 1st to get the paperwork in place [for that start date].”
This means that if their budget isn’t confirmed soon, come February 1, they will need to find an alternative plan. “We are not allowed to bill the USGS for work that we have done in an interval when they have not authorized for spending the money,” Hellweg said. “If they finally come back on February 1st and it takes them until March 1st to get the money in place for us, then we have to find other ways to pay everybody between February through March 1st.”
Hellweg hopes that perhaps she can reshuffle funds to cover the cost of their earthquake monitoring if this happens, adding, “our intention is to continue to monitor.”
“But we also hope that the USGS will come back before [this happens],” she said, “their pockets are way bigger than our pockets.”","Two minor earthquakes hit the San Francisco Bay Area on Wednesday and Thursday, measuring 3.4 and 3.5 on the Richter scale respectively.

If any of that resonates with you, perhaps you’d like to check out Pocket Waifu, available for free on Nutaku. The game takes the dating sim concept of putting Kindness Coins into a woman until ice-cold cans of Sex come out the bottom, and shamelessly reduces it into a Tamagotchi-style girl-babysitting experience in which your— sigh —”waifu” requires sleep, snacks, showers, and video games to fall in love with you. You can also spend real world money on gifts, toys, furniture and outfits for your collection of waifus. On top of all that, you’ve been cursed by a nude demon woman (with a painful-looking clitoral hood piercing) who takes your soul in exchange for the power to... make women come over to your house? Unwillingly? It’s not entirely clear. Pocket Waifu is a massive ball of contradictions and nonsense. It’s clearly shameless enough to not care that it’s portraying women as helpless babes who are unable to shower themselves without your help, or to get food out of the fridge without posing like a porn star. And yet, from time to time, the aforementioned nude demon berates you for thinking that women are mere vending machines for sex. Shortly after saying this, I managed to poke a woman into showing me her labia. And I literally mean “poke,” here: the word “poke” comes up every time you click her, and her ample bosom (because it’s never not ample) bounces like a 7.5 on the Richter scale. I don’t want to seem prudish—I’m completely down with sex games being contrived and silly. Just as it’s completely fine to have lashings of poetic license in things like Twilight —”I love you because I’m a vampire and your blood smells delicious ”—I don’t particularly care if sex games need to tell me that women are only swarming around me because I’m cursed. Sure, I can get down with that. But to tell me that this game isn’t about kindness coins? I can literally buy an item called “Lust Dust,” or spend Gacha tickets on gifts that I can give to various women to make me like them more. There’s even a meter at the top that tells me how much they like me. Just be honest in your grubbiness. It’s not like I can judge, anyway—anyone who clicks on “Pocket Waifu” is probably not in any position to judge. Perhaps I’m blaming Pocket Waifu for the failings of sex games in general, but I’m finding it difficult to discover many sex games that don’t have a base level of disrespect for both their players, and the games themselves. It’s honestly fine if you enjoy grubby sex games. Everyone has their personal preferences, and as long as no one’s getting hurt, feel free to get your rocks off however you like. But when almost all sex games feature the exact same level of grubbiness, the exact same skinny-but-big-boobed women, and the exact same treatment of women as hopeless, shy creatures that nevertheless whap their baps out at the slightest provocation, I have to ask: is this really what the majority of people are into? Or is it just that it’s the only thing available, and therefore ends up shaping the fetishes of those who play games like this? I can see the argument that sex games don’t need to be a higher form of art, or to have greater respect for themselves. As long as they have the required effect of getting people off, who cares? But why shouldn’t we hold these games to a higher standard? Sex is something that a majority of the population does, or at least thinks about, and there should be more options, in the same way that you can buy furniture from IKEA, or you can buy a one-of-a-kind hand-crafted dining table made from rainforest hardwood. IKEA is great, but sometimes, don’t you want something a little… special? Or even something in a comfortable middle zone, between completely basic and totally unique? Pocket Waifu, I apologise for making you the target of this rant. You’ve not really done anything wrong, apart from being pretty tacky. But having played so many sex games that seem like repackaged versions of the same damn thing—virginal women with sizeable racks and a penchant for blushing all the damn time—I want more. I want to see artisan sex games. I want an industry that respects its consumers enough to give them something more substantial. I want the developers to realise that there is next to no market for anyone who’s into men, or even just smaller-boobed women, but that’s an argument for another day. If we can accept women as more complex beings than Pocket Waifu offers, which I hope we can, then perhaps we can accept men as more complex beings than Pocket Waifu caters to.",You know what really turns me on?

Cory Doctorow,"In Goldman Sachs's April 10 report, ""The Genome Revolution,"" its analysts ponder the rise of biotech companies who believe they will develop ""one-shot"" cures for chronic illnesses; in a moment of rare public frankness, the report's authors ask, ""Is curing patients a sustainable business model?"" The authors were apparently spooked by the tale of Gilead Sciences, who developed a Hepatitis C therapy that is more than 90% effective, making $12.5B in 2015 -- the year of the therapy's release -- a number that fell to $4B this year. The analysts are making a commonsense observation: capitalism is incompatible with human flourishing. Markets will not, on their own, fund profoundly effective cures for diseases that destroy our lives and families. This is a very strong argument for heavily taxing the profits of pharma companies' investors and other one percenters, and then turning the money over to publicly funded scientific research that eschews all patents, and which is made available for free under the terms of the Access To Medicines treaty, whereby any country that devotes a set fraction of its GDP to pharma research gets free access to the fruits of all the other national signatories. Humans have shared microbial destiny. If there's one thing that challenges the extreme libertarian conception of owing nothing to your neighbor save the equilibrium established by your mutual selfishness, it's epidemiology. Your right to swing your fist ends where it connects with my nose; your right to create or sustain reservoirs of pathogens that will likely kill some or all of your neighbors is likewise subject to their willingness to tolerate your recklessness. Goldman Sachs's analysts suggest three ""cures"" for the problem of one-shot cures; and taxing the rich to fund socialized pharma research isn't among them; rather, they propose eschewing rare diseases, to ensure that the pool of patients is large enough to produce a return on their investment, or developing one-shot cures fast enough to ""offset the declining revenue trajectory of prior assets."" ""The potential to deliver 'one shot cures' is one of the most attractive aspects of gene therapy, genetically-engineered cell therapy and gene editing. However, such treatments offer a very different outlook with regard to recurring revenue versus chronic therapies,"" analyst Salveen Richter wrote in the note to clients Tuesday. ""While this proposition carries tremendous value for patients and society, it could represent a challenge for genome medicine developers looking for sustained cash flow.""

Valerio Farris,"I mean, it’s only a matter of time before robots overtake us. And we’re approaching the singularity at neck-breaking speeds. Just last week a robot was hired to flip burgers and then it was fired for being too good at its job! If that’s not a narrative arc dripping with humanity, then I don’t know what is. We’ve invited robots to take care of so many of our daily tasks, it only makes sense that we invite them into the kitchen, too, right? Uhhh, I don’t know. Robots doing human tasks actually kind of scares me. Call me old-fashioned, call me fearful, call me stuck in the past. Whatever, I’ll shrug my shoulders. The robot takeover is not something I will ever warm up to. But every once in a while, a robot comes along that reminds us just how special we humans are, how perfectly inimitable our actions can be. This matcha-making robot is one such example. The video first appeared on Twitter and stars a three-pronged machine making a cup of matcha tea. Its movements are a bit clunky and stop-and-go, but it’s able to fill a bowl with water and matcha powder. Then, the bamboo whisk lowers itself into the bowl of water and powder. What happens next you should see for yourself: Wow, mixed enough for ya? The whisk shakes so vigorously that the whole machine shoots off the Richter scale—it’s a vibration of seismic proportions. When I first watched this video, I grabbed my seat to make sure I, too, wasn’t violently convulsing. After the whisk goes to town, it kind of just slowly retracts from the bowl as if expecting some words of praise or a conciliatory gold star. The camera zooms on the freshly rattled bowl of matcha. To no one’s surprise, it looks whisked. Like beyond a shadow of a doubt. In theory, the machine does its job. It produces a cup of ready-to-drink matcha from raw ingredients. But it’s the process that has me tripped up. I’d much rather put in the extra time to whisk my own matcha than have some machine aggressively vibrate in front of me. But maybe that’s just me. The future of this mysterious machine has yet to be specified. Some tweets hinted that this is a prototype and its makers are collecting critiques and working on a redesign. Hopefully the second version is a bit chiller. Where do you stand on robots in the kitchen? Tell us your thoughts in the comments below.

Text description provided by the architects. The new museum houses an internationally significant boat collection on the shores of Windermere in the Lake District National Park. It includes exhibition spaces for the display of steam launches, motorboats, yachts and other vessels telling the stories of their construction and use on the lake. The site repurposes a historic gravel-extraction plant, continuing the working life of the place with an active conservation programme of the boats. Emphasis is placed on the visitor experience amongst buildings in a park landscape that creates a connection between people, boats and water, as well as providing a reinterpretation of the sites picturesque and industrial heritage.
© Christian Richter
Rather than a singular huge building, a granular ensemble of smaller buildings that are square on plan creates a more fitting scale with its context. The museum therefore has a strong topographical relationship with the land and the water. The wet dock forms the centre-piece of the museum and brings the lake into the heart of the experience to present the collection at water level. Other buildings making up the visitor route including: main entrance, conservation galleries, interpretation, education and cafe, all cluster around the wet dock but are elevated on a podium away from the risk of floodwaters. A conservation workshop is a standalone building placed closer to the water level on the working boatyard.

The architectural language of the museum is characterised by the vernacular typology of the roof, taking reference from the pronounced overhanging eaves of Broadleys, Voyseys grand house on Windermere, as well as more archetypal agricultural and industrial buildings of the Lake District. The building forms are somehow familiar, but made special by the overhanging canopies which extend the inside spaces of the building with all-weather shelter into the landscape. Internally, each individual building is organised with a large principal room centrally orientated to face the lakeshore, with ancillary spaces and the external canopy spaces balancing each side of the symmetrical sectional composition.
© Christian Richter
The museum is seen and approached from all sides, from land and water and from a number of points of elevation. Roofs and walls therefore assume equally important status in the formal composition. Oxidised copper is used as the determining material to give architectural consistency to these elements and to the museum buildings working together as a cohesive whole. Copper is folded and pinned with a regular pattern of brass fixings gives the elevations a unique texture, which is further reinforced by the patina gained by weathering over time. Very large windows and doors enable boats to be easily moved between outside and inside and allows the museum route between buildings to be clearly legible.

Clear tectonic expression of the natural copper cladding gives levity to the forms in strong contrast to the monolithic concrete podium that they sit upon. The repeated horizontal grammar of the claddings string courses which wrap the buildings exterior further references the lateral datum of the beautiful lake context.

Jillian Ambrose,"F racking laws on earthquakes could be relaxed to encourage more drilling, the energy minister has suggested. Homeowners living near Britains shale gas sites may have to put up with more powerful earth tremors under plans revealed in a letter by Claire Perry. The current rules can force frackers to down tools following even a minor quake measuring above 0.5 magnitude on the Richter scale. A tremor of this intensity would be barely perceptible to most residents, but would register as a red on the Governments fracking safety traffic light. A red light would bring all fracking work to an immediate stop, and even seismic quivers below 0.5 magnitude would be considered an amber signal to proceed carefully. However, the explicitly cautious system may soon be overhauled to allow stronger quakes measuring between 1.5 to 2 on the Richter scale to ripple through local communities without the risk of suspending shale gas drilling.","Fracking laws on earthquakes could be relaxed to encourage more drilling, the energy minister has suggested.",2018-10-09T19:36:36Z,"{'id': 'the-telegraph', 'name': 'The Telegraph'}",Fracking earthquake laws could be relaxed to encourage more shale gas sites,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/09/fracking-earthquake-laws-could-relaxed-encourage-shale-gas-sites/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000176952943-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqniLs_ck1w-iIu15kYzVq2d6IZZiXNIhc2shoXJuYYgE.jpeg,the-telegraph,The Telegraph,Richter scale,0

A.O. SCOTT,"Richters mid-60s paintings, and the similar canvases that Kurt executes at the climax of the film, are haunting, challenging attempts to plot the intersection of personal and historical experience, a zone composed almost entirely of gray areas. Exact reproductions of ordinary photographs with faces and other details blurred, they are troubling and suggestive studies in unspoken guilt and suppressed memory, heavy with meanings that they refuse to disclose.
That is not the way von Donnersmarck operates. He is not a man to choose nuance when a statement of the obvious, preferably accompanied by an orchestra and tasteful nudity, is available. Never Look Away traffics in all kinds of thorny, ambiguous material: Its about family secrets, psychological misdirection, the sometimes uncanny harmonies between artifice and reality. But its methods are almost defiantly literal, engineered for accessibility and sentimental impact.
This is not entirely a bad thing. Von Donnersmarcks first feature, The Lives of Others, unpacked some of the moral baggage of the former East Germany and laid out the contents in clear, conventional cinematic language. Part melodrama and part Cold War thriller, that film won an Oscar in 2007 and was embraced by many critics, including this one, for its blend of suspense and ethical precision.
Never Look Away, working on a grander scale in muddier genre territory not quite a biopic, it hovers between psychological drama and period romance tries to achieve a similar blend of clarity and excitement. Even when it stumbles, it remains watchable and engaging, partly because von Donnersmarck possesses an old-fashioned Hollywood showmans sensibility. In addition to the lush music (composed by Max Richter), it has rich, velvety images (for which Caleb Deschanel has just received an Oscar nomination) and emphatic performances by highly attractive actors.","This film, based on the life of Gerhard Richter, follows a German artist from the Nazi era to the 1960s.",2019-01-24T19:01:59Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","‘Never Look Away’ Review: A Lush Adventure in Sex, Politics and Painting",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/movies/never-look-away-review.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/25/arts/25neverlookaway1/25neverlookaway1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Richter scale,0
Justin Worland,"A large majority of Washington state residents believe climate change is happening and understand that humans are to blame. But, even as the state passed a measure to tighten gun control and supported congressional Democrats, voters clearly rejected a chance to take a bold step with a first-in-the-nation carbon tax. In rejecting the measure, which would have forced companies to pay for their carbon dioxide emissions, Washington voters rebuffed the policy mechanism that experts say is best equipped to stop global warming. They also underscored a central challenge of addressing climate change: even the most committed activists cannot agree on the best way to address the issue. “Washingtonians agree that we must address global warming by weaning our state off of fossil fuels,” says Bruce Speight, director of advocacy group Environment Washington. But “voters reminded us that we don’t all agree on how to do that.” Washington state has become a parable for the challenge. In 2016, voters rejected a ballot measure to create a carbon tax in large part because progressive groups did not support it, arguing that its approach was too conservative. The measure would have used the revenue from a carbon tax to fund a tax cut. After defeating it, a coalition that included labor, civil rights and environmental groups among others got together to push this year’s measure. Instead of cutting taxes, the ballot initiative, known as I-1631, would have funded a slew of progressive causes and projects, from clean energy to relocating tribal lands threatened by rising sea levels. Ultimately, the same features that made it a win for progressives made it a no-go for others. The editorial board at the state’s largest newspaper, the Seattle Times, called it “porous, lacking accountability and larded with special-interest payouts” and recommended a no vote. And, while big local players like Microsoft and REI endorsed the measure, many others sat out the race. Likely the most significant impediment for the measure remained the longtime foe of any climate change legislation or regulation: the fossil fuel industry. A group of oil and gas companies pumped tens of millions of dollars into the campaign to defeat I-1631, far dwarfing the money raised in support. But, cleverly, that campaign did not center on denying the science of climate change like companies have in years past. Instead, it poked holes in the specifics of the carbon tax proposal and played into the skepticism of how government might distribute the tax revenue. The defeat represents a setback for those desperately concerned about reducing emissions. Approving the Washington state measure would have sent a powerful signal to other states that a carbon tax that funds government programs can be politically viable. And, at the federal level, it could have fueled proposals for programs along the lines of a so-called green New Deal favored by many progressives. Washington voters weren’t alone in their rejection of environmental measures aimed at tackling climate change and related environmental issues on Tuesday. In Arizona, voters soundly rejected an expansion of the state’s renewable energy standard, and Colorado voters turned down an opportunity to reduce significantly the scale of fracking in the state. Nevada approved a measure to increase renewable deployment while Florida voted to ban offshore drilling. The defeat of the Washington measure doesn’t mean that a carbon tax will disappear from the national discussion. Indeed, the failure plays into the narrative of supporters of a so-called revenue-neutral approach to putting a price on carbon. Such a measure, like the one Washington voters rejected in 2016, would give the funds raised with a carbon tax back to taxpayers. Crucially, supporters say, such a measure has bipartisan backing, support from industry and the endorsement of some, though not all, environmental groups. “To make it politically viable, we need a plan that Republicans and Democrats, industry and environmentalists can all get behind,” says Ted Halstead, who heads the Climate Leadership Council, a bi-partisan group formed to push for what it calls a “carbon fee and dividend.” That measure, which has support from energy companies and some environmental groups, would give revenue raised by a carbon tax back to taxpayers. And, with Democrats now controlling one house of Congress, some climate change advocates plan to redouble their lobbying push with the goal of advancing legislation — perhaps not next year but after the next presidential election. “We’re also wasting no time getting the ball rolling,” says Danny Richter, government affairs vice president at Citizens Climate Lobby, a group that advocates for a carbon tax. Whatever the result, science suggests that resolution to the carbon pricing debate needs to happen sooner rather than later. An October report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations climate science body, found that the temperatures have already risen 1°C as a result of human activity and are set to rise another half a degree as soon as 2030 if we don’t change direction quickly. That level of temperature rise would drive a number of devastating impacts, from more frequent drought and heat waves to the potential disappearance of some island nations. With that in mind, some groups are looking to advance carbon pricing wherever they can. Economists say that a price on carbon, if it is high enough, will reduce carbon dioxide emissions regardless of what happens to the revenue. “It’s critical to bring all voices into the room,” said Mo McBroom, director of government relations for The Nature Conservancy in Washington State, ahead of Tuesday’s election. The Nature Conservancy supported the Washington state measure and continues to back the CLC’s carbon dividends plan even as other groups call it a giveaway to the fossil fuel industry. “We need action on climate and we are agnostic” on what it looks like, she said. “There are many different ways to accomplish good carbon reduction policy.” Write to Justin Worland at justin.worland@time.com.","A large majority of Washington state residents believe climate change is happening and understand that humans are to blame.

Yulia Grigoryants,"Gyumri, Armenia - In Gyumri time is measured as ""before"" and ""after"" the earthquake. On December 7, 1988, an earthquake measuring a magnitude of 7.0 on the Richter scale struck northern Armenia, killing at least 25,000 people and injuring hundreds of thousands more. A countless number of people were left homeless as high-rise apartment blocks collapsed like dominoes. Gyumri, Armenia’s second largest city, suffered much of the damage. Soon after the tragic event, the Soviet Union collapsed and in 1991, Armenia gained its independence, but this transition was full of turmoil. A war with neighbouring Azerbaijan, with consequent energy shortages and an economic blockade, left the landlocked country and its inhabitants in dire conditions. A quarter of a century later, although the situation has improved for Armenia, the city of Gyumri has the highest poverty rate in the country at about 45 percent. The city has lost nearly half of its population since 1988, due in part to unemployment and emigration of the labour force. According to local NGOs, a few thousand families live in makeshift shelters because they cannot afford to buy or rent the newly built apartments that were erected in the city after the earthquake. During the Soviet era, Gortsaranayin 2A and 2B, twin buildings on the outskirts of Gyumri, accommodated around 120 families. Although they did not collapse in the earthquake, due to significant structural damage, most residents abandoned the buildings. But, four families continue living here among decaying walls and corridors, with no hope for a better life.","With the highest poverty rates, many of the city's inhabitants are still struggling to make ends meet.",2017-12-07T06:45:15Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",The forgotten survivors of the Gyumri earthquake,http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/forgotten-survivors-gyumri-earthquake-171004083707018.html,http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/10/4/0d1a417b1bfc4873aefd8e39c050c16c_18.jpg,al-jazeera-english,Al Jazeera English,Richter scale,0

Yves Smith,"Yves here. Despite Lambert’s daily fear v. greed index reading at super low levels, meaning fear is high, the super tight corporate spreads Wolf discusses below says that there is still a lot of complacency among the investing classes. And note that the pattern he is noticing is abnormal. Risky credit market assets usually sell off months before you see a stock market correction. By Wolf Richter, a San Francisco based executive, entrepreneur, start up specialist, and author, with extensive international work experience. Originally published at Wolf Street Market still blows off Fed, Treasury selloff, and volatility in stocks. Leveraged loans,” extended to junk-rated and highly leveraged companies, are too risky for banks to keep on their books. Banks sell them to loan mutual funds, or they slice-and-dice them into structured Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) and sell them to institutional investors. This way, the banks get the rich fees but slough off the risk to investors, such as asset managers and pension funds. This has turned into a booming market. Issuance has soared. And given the pandemic chase for yield, the risk premium that investors are demanding to buy the highest rated “tranches” of these CLOs has dropped to the lowest since the Financial Crisis. Mass Mutual’s investment subsidiary, Barings, has packaged leveraged loans into a $517-million CLO that is sold in “tranches” of different risk levels. The least risky tranche is rated AAA. Barings is now selling the AAA-rated tranche to investors priced at a premium of just 99 basis points (0.99 percentage points) over Libor, according to S&amp;P Capital, cited by the Financial Times. Also this week, New York Life is selling the top-rated tranche of a CLO at a spread of less than 100 basis over Libor. And Palmer Square Asset Management sold a $510-million CLO at a similar premium over Libor. In the secondary markets, where the CLOs are trading, red-hot demand has already pushed spreads below 100 basis points. These are the lowest risk premiums over Libor since the Financial Crisis. These floating-rate CLOs are attractive to asset managers in an environment of rising interest rates. If rates rise further, Libor rises in tandem, and investors would be protected against rising rates by the Libor-plus feature of the yields. Libor has surged in near-parallel with the US three-month Treasury yield and on Monday reached 1.83%. So the yield of Barings CLO was 2.82%. While the Libor-plus structure compensates investors for the risk of rising yields and inflation, it does not compensate investors for credit risk! These low risk premiums over Libor are part of what constitutes the “financial conditions” that the Fed has been trying to tighten by raising its target range for the federal funds rate and by unwinding QE. It’s supposed to make borrowing a little harder and a little more costly in order to cool off the credit party. One of the measures that track whether “financial conditions” are getting “easier” or tighter is the weekly St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index. In this index, zero represents “normal.” A negative number indicates that financial conditions are easier than “normal”; a positive number indicates that they’re tighter than “normal.” The index, which is made up of 18 components – including six yield spreads, including one based on the 3-month Libor – had dropped to a historic low of -1.6 on November 3, 2017. Despite the Fed’s rate hikes and the accelerating QE Unwind, it has since ticked up only a smidgen and remains firmly in negative territory, at -1.35. The Financial Stress Index and the two-year Treasury yield usually move roughly in parallel. But since July 2016, about the time the Fed stopped flip-flopping on rate hikes, the two-year yield began rising and more recently spiking, while the Financial Stress Index initially fell. The chart below shows this disconnect between the St. Louis Fed’s Financial Stress Index (red, left scale) and the two-year Treasury yield (black, right scale). Note the tiny rise of the red line over the past few weeks (circled in blue): The horizontal blue line marks zero of the Financial Stress Index (left scale). At or above zero is where I — after reading the tea leaves — think the Fed would like to see the index at this point. But the index is far from it. And the CLOs mentioned above are examples of just how ebullient corporate credit markets still are at every level. A similar ebullience is still visible in junk bonds as well. The corporate credit markets are starting to take into account the risk of slightly higher inflation – hence the appetite for these floating-rate CLOs. But the risk premium over Libor and other risk premiums show that credit markets are still totally in denial about the bigger risk for junk-rated credits: the risk of default. And this risk of default surges when rates rise and financial conditions tighten as these companies have trouble refinancing their debts when they come due. But for now, investors are blithely ignoring that they’re in for a big reset. The chorus for more rate hikes is getting louder. But no one will be ready for those mortgage rates.

Bobby Finger,"This week, Taylor Swift and her English boyfriend who may or may not dream of electric sheep, Joe Alwyn, were spotted hiking in Malibu, California. This is news because the two have rarely been photographed together in the roughly 16 months of their relationship, and also because Page Six managed to get some quotes from the funniest witness imaginable. Of the 90-minute hike (because Jezebel didn’t have rights to the photos, I chose a visually similar stock image), the anonymous witness said Taylor and Joe “seemed very intimate and deep in conversation — despite having her bodyguard trailing 20 feet behind them,” adding: “The other thing that struck me is that they kind of look exactly like each other, which is weird.” Who could the Witness be?! [ Page Six ] Today’s wildest and most shocking celebrity news item is about Colin Firth, if you can believe it. While news about Firth’s personal life generally registers a solid 0.00000000 on the Richter scale, a recently leaked court document revealed the surprising and intense detail about his marriage to Livia Giuggioli. Per E! News, Giuggioli had a brief fling with a man named Marco Brancaccia when she and Firth temporarily separated some years ago. OK! Whatever. They were separated. No big whoop. Well! Apparently this guy Brancaccia subsequently “carried out a frightening campaign of harassment over several months.” Simply put: Giuggioli claims he started stalking them. But Brancaccia says it wasn’t stalking, per se. It was a real relationship that she’s trying to cover up! (Yeah, OK!) In an interview with The Times, he said : “We were romantically involved, she wanted to leave Colin for me...I wrote an email to Colin about my relationship with Livia, which I now regret sending, and she filed a complaint against me for stalking out of fear that I could go public with what she had revealed to me about her marriage and work. In a year she sent me hundreds of messages of love, photos and videos, even a diary.” This man sounds both proud and prejudiced. [ E! News ] Happy Friday.

Please join us and participate via our donation page, which shows how to give via check, credit card, debit card, or PayPal. Read about why were doing this fundraiser and what weve accomplished in the last year, and our current goal, more original reporting By Wolf Richter, a San Francisco based executive, entrepreneur, start up specialist, and author, with extensive international work experience. Originally published at Wolf Street US bank stock index down 17% from January. EU bank stocks crushed, crushed, crushed since Financial Crisis. Monday early afternoon, the US KBW Bank index, which tracks large US banks and serves as a benchmark for the banking sector, is down 2.5% at the moment. It has dropped 17% from its post-Financial Crisis high on January 29. If the index closes at this level, it would be the lowest close since September 18, 2017: While that may be a nerve-wracking decline for those who have not experienced bank-stock declines, it comes after a huge surge that followed the collapse during the Financial Crisis: The second chart is on a different scale than the first chart above. So this years decline is small fry compared to the movements since 2006, including the dizzying plunge toward zero in early 2009, and the subsequent boom when it became clear that the Fed would pull out all stops to save the banks with all kinds of mechanisms, including ruthless financial repression forcing interest rates to 0% that it waged on depositors and savers for a decade. Profits derived from these mechanisms effectively recapitalized the banks. The 55% jump in bank stocks after the 2016 election through the peak in January 2018 was a reaction to promises for banking deregulation and tax cuts from the new Trump administration along with signs of lots of goodwill toward Wall Street, as top positions in the new administration were quickly being filled with Wall Street insiders. However, the Trump bump for banks is now being gradually unwound. But unlike their American brethren, the European banks have remained stuck in the miserable Financial Crisis mire a financial crisis that in Europe was followed by the Euro Debt Crisis. The Stoxx 600 bank index, which covers major European banks, including our hero Deutsche Bank, has plunged 27% since February 29, 2018, and is down 23% from a year ago: But note how minuscule this years 26% drop is in the overall collapse-scenario in the chart below going back to 2006: The Stoxx 600 Banks index never got anywhere near recovering after the Financial Crisis, as after each hopeful partial recovery, it kept falling off the wagon, and is once again falling off the wagon: Its not exactly a propitious sign that the banks in the US, after nearly recovering to their pre-Financial Crisis highs Close, but no cigar! are once again turning around and heading south as the Fed is gradually removing accommodation, which results in higher funding costs for banks and greater credit risks on outstanding loans. And the European banks remain a mess and have an excellent chance of getting still get messier. Why does this sell-off smell different?

Barbara Kollmeyer,"As we near the finish line of a long week in politics, the Fed is swinging back on the radar for investors. Minutes published by the central bank on Wednesday, which showed a September rate increase is firmly on the cards, have helped distract from some legal heat circling former Trump advisers. Jackson Hole here we come. Those Fed musings also took a bit of steam out of the S&amp;P 500, something that could continue this morning as the buck stomps ahead. And it could muddy the waters for those wondering whether to dive into the longest bull market on record. Our call of the day, from Saxo Bank's Peter Garnry, advises opting opt for the latter strategy as he warns of a “dangerous trade” that’s been making a comeback, and which he says could blindside the market. He says investors have been buying stocks and pushing the S&amp;P 500 to new highs while paying “record premium” for hedging against downside risk in the index via the Cboe SKEW Index SKEW, -0.66% That’s shown in the following chart: “The most popular ETN engaging in shorting short-term VIX futures is up 25% from its April lows,” said Garnry, in a follow-up email to a recent webinar where he laid out those concerns. He says this structure was in place during all of 2017—notable moments are here and here —and then earlier this year. “It is a big worry for me that we are back to this market structure again…with the U.S. equity market having outperformed massively all other markets on top of compressed implied volatility,” says Garnry. He says it “sets the stage for a violent drop in U.S. equities should we get some exogenous shock to the system.” One alternative? Emerging markets. Garnry acknowledges that emerging markets have lots of structural issues, but maintains they can still yield attractive returns. To be sure, there are plenty of emerging-markets haters out there, which some could be a reason to dive in. Don’t count Deutsche Bank in that camp. They’ve got a laundry list of reasons why it is too soon to seek out those far-flung stocks.

Matt Soniak,"Residents of Panama City and other areas in the Florida Panhandle are in the midst of Hurricane Michael, a Category 4 storm that Governor Rick Scott warned is the ""worst storm"" to hit the area ""in a century."" Given that North Carolina is still battling the effects of Hurricane Florence, which made landfall less than a month ago, we've become accustomed to hearing about hurricanes, and to predicting what sort of damage they might cause based on their category number. But how do meteorologists categorize these often-deadly storms, and how does that scale work? First, a quick primer: Hurricanes are tropical cyclones that occur in the Atlantic Ocean and have winds with a sustained speed of at least 74 mph. A tropical cyclone, in turn, is a storm system that develops in the tropics and is characterized by a low pressure center and thunderstorms that produce strong winds, rain, and storm surges. Tropical cyclone is a generic name that refers to the storms' geographic origin and cyclonic rotation around a central eye. Depending on their location and strength, the storms are called different things. What gets dubbed a hurricane in the Atlantic, for example, would be called a typhoon if it happened in the northwestern Pacific. WHATS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HURRICANE AND A TROPICAL STORM? Simply put: Wind speed. When tropical cyclones are just starting out as general areas of low pressure with the potential to strengthen, theyre called tropical depressions. Theyre given sequential numbers as they form during a storm season so the National Hurricane Center (NHC) can keep tabs on them. Once a cyclones winds kick up to 39 miles per hour and sustain that speed for 10 minutes, it becomes a tropical storm and the NHC gives it a name. If the cyclone keeps growing and sustains 74 mph winds, it graduates to hurricane. ONCE WE CALL IT A HURRICANE, HOW DO WE CATEGORIZE IT? In order to assign a numeric category value to a hurricane, meteorologists look to the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which was developed as a classification system for Western Hemisphere tropical cyclones in the late 1960s and early '70s by structural engineer Herbert Saffir and his friend, meteorologist Robert Simpson, who was the director of the NHC at the time. When Saffir was working on a United Nations project to study low-cost housing in hurricane-prone areas, it struck him that there was no simple, standardized way of describing hurricanes and their damaging effects, like the way the Richter scale is used to describe earthquakes. He created a five-level scale based on wind speed and sent it off to Simpson, who expanded on it to include the effects on storm surge and flooding. Simpson began using it internally at the NHC, and then in reports shared with emergency agencies. It proved useful, so others began adopting it and it quickly spread. HOW DOES THE SCALE WORK? According to the NHC, the scale breaks down like this: Category 1 storms have sustained winds of 74 to 95 mph. These very dangerous winds will produce some damage: Well-constructed frame homes could have damage to roof, shingles, vinyl siding, and gutters. Large branches of trees will snap and shallowly rooted trees may be toppled. Extensive damage to power lines and poles likely will result in power outages that could last a few to several days."" Category 2 storms have sustained winds of 96 to 110 mph. These extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage: Well-constructed frame homes could sustain major roof and siding damage. Many shallowly rooted trees will be snapped or uprooted and block numerous roads. Near-total power loss is expected with outages that could last from several days to weeks."" Category 3 storms have sustained winds of 111 to 129 mph. This is the first category that qualifies as a major storm and devastating damage will occur: Well-built framed homes may incur major damage or removal of roof decking and gable ends. Many trees will be snapped or uprooted, blocking numerous roads. Electricity and water will be unavailable for several days to weeks after the storm passes."" Category 4 storms have sustained winds of 130 to 156 mph. These storms are catastrophic and damage includes: Well-built framed homes can sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls. Most trees will be snapped or uprooted and power poles downed. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months."" Category 5 storms have sustained winds of 157 mph or higher. The catastrophic damage entailed here includes: A high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed, with total roof failure and wall collapse. Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months."" While the Saffir-Simpson scale is useful, it isnt the be-all and end-all for measuring storms, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) pointed out on Twitter in 2013:. @itsalleternal We don't emphasize Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Instead focus on specific hazards at your location. #Hurrichat -RK NOAA Live (@NOAALive) August 13, 2013 IS THERE ANYTHING WORSE THAN A CATEGORY 5? Not on paper, but there have been hurricanes that have gone beyond the upper bounds of the scale. Hypothetically, hurricanes could up the ante beyond Category 5 more regularly. The storms use warm water to fuel themselves and as ocean temperatures rise, climatologists predict that potential hurricane intensity will increase. Both Saffir and Simpson have said that theres no need to add more categories because once things go beyond 157 mph, the damage all looks the same: really, really bad. Still, that hasn't stopped several scientists from suggesting that maybe the time has come to consider a Category 6 addition. Timothy Hall, a senior scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, recently told the Los Angeles Times that if the current global warming trends continue, he can foresee a timelikely by the end of the centurywhere wind speeds could blow past 230 mph, which could create conditions similar to a F-4 tornado (which has the power to lift cars off the ground and send them hurtling through the air with relative ease). If we had twice as many Category 5sat some point, several decades down the lineif that seems to be the new norm, then yes, wed want to have more partitioning at the upper part of the scale, Hall said. At that point, a Category 6 would be a reasonable thing to do.""

Yves Smith,"By Wolf Richter, a San Francisco based executive, entrepreneur, start up specialist, and author, with extensive international work experience. Originally published at Wolf Street I don’t think there has ever been an entire sector that skyrocketed as much and collapsed as quickly as the cryptocurrency space. The skyrocketing phase culminated at the turn of the year. Then the collapse phase set in, with different cryptos choosing different points in time. It doesn’t help that regulators around the world have caught on to these schemes called initial coin offerings (ICOs), where anyone, even the government of Venezuela, can try to sell homemade digital tokens to the gullible and take their “fiat” money from them and run away with it. There are now 1,596 cryptocurrencies and tokens out there, up from a handful a few years ago. And the gullible are getting cleaned out. And it doesn’t help that the ways to promote these schemes are being closed off, one after the other. At the end of January, Facebook announced that, suddenly, “misleading or deceptive ads have no place on Facebook,” and it prohibited ads about ICOs and cryptos. On March 14, Google announced that it will block ads with “cryptocurrencies and related content,” including ICOs, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading advice. Its crackdown begins in June. On March 26, Twitter announced that it would ban ads of ICOs, cryptocurrency exchanges, and cryptocurrency wallet services, unless they are by public companies traded on major stock markets. It will roll out its policy over the next 30 days. On March 29, MailChimp, a major email mass-distribution service, announced that it will block email promos from businesses that are “involved in any aspect of the sale, transaction, exchange, storage, marketing or production of cryptocurrencies, virtual currencies, and any digital assets related to an Initial Coin Offering.” This broadened and tightened its policy announced in February that promised to shut down any account related to promos of ICOs or blockchain activity. The overall cryptocurrency space, in terms of market capitalization, peaked on January 4, when market cap reached $707 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Less than three months later, market cap has now plunged by 65% to $245 billion. $462 billion went up in smoke. Here’s how the top five cryptos did over the past few months. Together they account for 76% of the total market cap of the space: Bitcoin plunged 67% from its peak of $19,982 on December 17, to $6,573 at the moment. In just over three months, its market cap collapsed by $225 billion, from $336 billion to $111 billion. But as this chart shows, nothing goes to heck in a straight line (chart via CoinMarketCap ): Ethereum plunged 74% from its peak of $1,426 on January 13, to $367 at the moment. Market cap collapsed by $102 billion, from $138 billion to $36 billion (chart via CoinMarketCap): Ripple plunged 88% from its peak of $3.84 on January 4 to $0.47. Over the period, its market cap went from $148 billion to $18 billion. On March 28, when I last wrote about the collapse of Ripple, it was at $0.57, but has since plunged another 18% (chart via CoinMarketCap): Bitcoin Cash plunged 85% from its peak of $4,138 on December 20 to $632 at the moment. Market cap dropped from $70 billion to $10.8 billion. It was split from Bitcoin last August. On November 12, I featured Bitcoin Cash, in an article subtitled “ Peak Crypto Craziness? ” I was observing, practically in real time, how it quadrupled in two days to $2,448. It is now back where that quadrupling had started out: Litecoin plunged 70% from its peak of $363 on December 19, to $110 at the moment. Curiously, its founder admitted on December 20 that he’d wisely cashed out at or near the peak by selling his entire stake. The true believers who bought the tokens have been eating losses ever since. Market cap went from $19.7 billion to $6.2 billion. EOS plunged 71% from its peak of $18.16 on January 12, to $5.30. Market cap went from $11 billion to $4.1 billion: I pooh-poohed it on December 18 with “ The Hottest, Largest-Ever Cryptocurrency ICO Mindblower.” The purchase agreement that buyers in the ICO had to sign – the ICO was not offered in the US due to legality issues – stated explicitly that holders of EOS have no rights to anything related to the EOS platform, and that they get nothing other than the digital token. Here is what the chart of this scam looks like: And the blockchain technology (the distributed ledger technology) has nothing to do with cryptos. Cryptos merely use it. There have been a number of efforts underway for years to find large-scale commercial use for blockchain, outside of the crypto space. Those efforts have yet to bear fruit, though they may someday. All we have for now are small-scale experiments. Even if blockchain finds large-scale use, it will do nothing for these collapsing cryptos. But the ancient theory that nothing goes to heck in a straight line still holds true, borne out by the charts above, and we can expect sharp volatility and a good amount of whiplash on the way there. And here is an update on the hated “fiat” currency, the US dollar that cryptos were supposed to annihilate or at least obviate.

Each of the five offences for which the 77-year-old was found guilty carries a maximum 10 years imprisonment, and the judge outlined they were serious charges.
But Robert Richter, Pell's lawyer, told the court his client's crimes were on the low end of offending, describing them as ""no more than a plain vanilla sexual penetration case where a child is not volunteering or actively participating"".

Lawyers representing Pell, a former top adviser to Pope Francis, presented 10 character references, including one from former prime minister John Howard, in an attempt to convince the judge the maximum sentence was not appropriate.
His legal team have appealed his conviction and Pell has maintained his innocence.
During the trial one victim described how Pell had exposed himself to them, fondled their genitals and masturbated and forced one boy to perform a sex act on him.
""I see this as a serious example of this kind of offending,"" Judge Kidd told the Melbourne County Court.

The Vatican has opened its own investigation into accusations against Pell following his conviction, which was made public just two days after the end of a major meeting of Church leaders on how to better tackle the abuse of children by clergy.

"Felicity Carter, Contributor, Felicity Carter, Contributor https://www.forbes.com/sites/felicitycarter/","Renowned gallery, Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac London (also host to today's Victoria Beckham catwalk show) is now exhibiting a body of work by the Berlin-based artist, Daniel Richter. The show, I Should Have Known Better is his first solo exhibition in London following his major mid-career retrospective which opened at the Louisiana Museum, Humleb&amp;aelig;k in Denmark two years ago. Bold in both its content, color (and sound), the large-scale oil paintings celebrate the visual language which the artist has developed over the past twenty years. I Should Have Known Better by Daniel Richter Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac Richter spent his early years designing record sleeves for radical German punk bands; contemporary culture has not only formed the basis of his thinking but has continually informed his works as they transcend elements that make up today's landscape. There's a nod to art history, mass media, politics and&amp;nbsp;of course, the overiding theme of desire and sex. And this exhibition takes its title from a 1979 song by the British Post-Punk band, Wire. Music acts as the framework for his painting process, &amp;quot;I don’t care about colors, it’s more like a sound that I think of...there can be systemic elements, quiet elements, and variations on a theme&amp;quot; says Richter. Lines of crayon-oil reveal body-like silhouettes to show legs, arched backs, grasping hands and wide-open mouths can be deciphered. “My concern is with the surface, this flat, tangled, never-changing scheme of figure constellations, in and out”. The figures seem to levitate and collide. The cannibalizing shapes convey a sense of abstraction, which is reinforced by the background’s subtle gradations of colors. I Should Have Known Better by Daniel Richter Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac You're based in Berlin, has the city shaped your work? And if so, how? Berlin actually has no particular influence in my work, although I’ve lived there for many years. From 2004-2006 I taught at the Universit&amp;auml;t der K&amp;uuml;nste in Berlin, but since then I’ve been spending more time in Vienna, teaching at the Akademie der &amp;nbsp; bildenden &amp;nbsp; K&amp;uuml;nste. Although there’s a group of my new works that resemble maps, they aren’t about any place in particular. They’re more about the idea of invasion – invasion &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; exclusion. Which makes nations parallel to the bodies in the other group of &amp;nbsp; paintings, &amp;nbsp; because nations get invaded, as do bodies. They are both also iconic iconographical systems, instantly recognizable as the signs that we are surrounded by. What is the standout moment of your career? I honestly don’t know if there was one. I Should Have Known Better by Daniel Richter Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac “What interests me about people is the spirit they embody. On the one hand the spirit as the soul and on the other as the idea of the non-self, the Other.&amp;quot; What is the other to you? Any stranger is 'Other' until you get to know them. The idea of the spirit relates to the way I paint bodies, as stencil-like forms. I am interested in the body as a spirit, a speck, a formula. I don’t make any effort to paint the body as flesh. Is it the spirit you're trying to capture in your art? No. My work has undergone changes based on different observations and desires than just that one. I Should Have Known Better by Daniel Richter Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac What are you wanting to communicate, and make the viewer think and feel? I mainly try to figure out and work through what I think and feel while painting. I speculate about how viewers may react to it, but without having evidence of how they actually do respond. That’s part of the surprise. In the end, it’s not entirely up to me what the paintings communicate, it’s also up to the viewer. I Should Have Known Better by Daniel Richter Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac How has your style evolved? Evolution is a necessity since change is unavoidable. I found I’d lost interest in my previous, tried-and-tested methods. You have to paint against your own routine. I didn’t want to return to the figurative and narrative style, because everything I associated with them had been completed. Simply to change the subject, to paint corpses instead of flowers, is not necessarily interesting. I also think that there should be a moment of surprise for myself. I don’t know where a painting is going until it’s finished, so I’m surprised by the things that accidents happen. The main thing I’m interested in and that keeps me going is the relationship between beauty and drama. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER running until 28 September 2018 at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac.

I Should Have Known Better by Daniel Richter Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac Richter spent his early years designing record sleeves for radical German punk bands; contemporary culture has not only formed the basis of his thinking but has continually informed his works as they transcend elements that make up today's landscape. There's a nod to art history, mass media, politics and of course, the overiding theme of desire and sex. And this exhibition takes its title from a 1979 song by the British Post-Punk band, Wire. Music acts as the framework for his painting process, ""I don’t care about colors, it’s more like a sound that I think of...there can be systemic elements, quiet elements, and variations on a theme"" says Richter. Lines of crayon-oil reveal body-like silhouettes to show legs, arched backs, grasping hands and wide-open mouths can be deciphered. “My concern is with the surface, this flat, tangled, never-changing scheme of figure constellations, in and out”. The figures seem to levitate and collide. The cannibalizing shapes convey a sense of abstraction, which is reinforced by the background’s subtle gradations of colors. I Should Have Known Better by Daniel Richter Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac You're based in Berlin, has the city shaped your work? And if so, how? Berlin actually has no particular influence in my work, although I’ve lived there for many years. From 2004-2006 I taught at the Universität der Künste in Berlin, but since then I’ve been spending more time in Vienna, teaching at the Akademie der bildenden Künste. Although there’s a group of my new works that resemble maps, they aren’t about any place in particular. They’re more about the idea of invasion – invasion and exclusion. Which makes nations parallel to the bodies in the other group of paintings, because nations get invaded, as do bodies. They are both also iconic iconographical systems, instantly recognizable as the signs that we are surrounded by. What is the standout moment of your career? I honestly don’t know if there was one. I Should Have Known Better by Daniel Richter Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac “What interests me about people is the spirit they embody. On the one hand the spirit as the soul and on the other as the idea of the non-self, the Other."" What is the other to you? Any stranger is 'Other' until you get to know them. The idea of the spirit relates to the way I paint bodies, as stencil-like forms. I am interested in the body as a spirit, a speck, a formula. I don’t make any effort to paint the body as flesh. Is it the spirit you're trying to capture in your art? No. My work has undergone changes based on different observations and desires than just that one. I Should Have Known Better by Daniel Richter Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac What are you wanting to communicate, and make the viewer think and feel? I mainly try to figure out and work through what I think and feel while painting. I speculate about how viewers may react to it, but without having evidence of how they actually do respond. That’s part of the surprise. In the end, it’s not entirely up to me what the paintings communicate, it’s also up to the viewer. I Should Have Known Better by Daniel Richter Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac How has your style evolved? Evolution is a necessity since change is unavoidable. I found I’d lost interest in my previous, tried-and-tested methods. You have to paint against your own routine. I didn’t want to return to the figurative and narrative style, because everything I associated with them had been completed. Simply to change the subject, to paint corpses instead of flowers, is not necessarily interesting. I also think that there should be a moment of surprise for myself. I don’t know where a painting is going until it’s finished, so I’m surprised by the things that accidents happen. The main thing I’m interested in and that keeps me going is the relationship between beauty and drama. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER running until 28 September 2018 at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac.

Photo: Valentin Jeck, commissioned by The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2017. The Museum of Modern Art will explore the architecture of the former Yugoslavia with Toward a Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia, 1948–1980, the first major US exhibition to study the remarkable body of work that sparked international interest during the 45 years of the country’s existence. The exhibition will include more than 400 drawings, models, photographs, and film reels culled from an array of municipal archives, family-held collections, and museums across the region, introducing the exceptional built work of socialist Yugoslavia ’s leading architects to an international audience for the first time. + 5 The architecture that emerged during this period—from International Style skyscrapers to Brutalist “social condensers”—is a manifestation of the radical pluralism, hybridity, and idealism that characterized the Yugoslav state itself. Exploring themes of large-scale urbanization, technological experimentation and its application in everyday life, consumerism, monuments and memorialization, and the global reach of Yugoslav architecture, Toward a Concrete Utopia will feature work by important architects, including Bogdan Bogdanović, Juraj Neidhardt, Svetlana Kana Radević, Edvard Ravnikar, Vjenceslav Richter, and Milica Šterić. From the sculptural interior of the White Mosque in rural Bosnia, to the post-earthquake reconstruction of the city of Skopje based on Kenzo Tange’s Metabolist design, to the new town of New Belgrade with its expressive large-scale housing blocks and civic buildings, the exhibition will examine the unique range of forms and modes of production in Yugoslav architecture and its distinct yet multifaceted character. Organized by Martino Stierli, The Philip Johnson Chief Curator of Architecture and Design, The Museum of Modern Art, and Vladimir Kulić, guest curator, with Anna Kats, Curatorial Assistant, Department of Architecture and Design, The Museum of Modern Art. Generous funding for the exhibition is provided by the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts. Additional support is provided by the Annual Exhibition Fund.

Built in the 1960s and 70s under former president Josep Broz Tito, these monuments commemorate the communist resistance during the German occupation. For many years, Yugoslavia's futuristic ""Spomenik"" monuments were hidden from the majority of the world, shielded from the public eye by their remote locations within the mountains and forests of Eastern Europe. That is, until the late 2000s, when Belgian photographer Jan Kempenaers began capturing the abstract sculptures and pavilions and posting his photographs to the internet. Commissioned by former Yugoslavian president, Josip Broz Tito in the 1960s and 70s to commemorate sites where WWII battles took place, these now forgotten structures stand empty and without the significance it once had decades ago.","The Museum of Modern Art will explore the architecture of the former Yugoslavia with Toward a Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia, 1948–1980, the first major US exhibition to study the remarkable body of work that sparked international interest during…",2018-01-22T16:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Archdaily.com'}","MoMA to Explore Spomenik Monuments With ""Toward a Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia, 1948–1980""",https://www.archdaily.com/887548/moma-to-explore-spomenik-monuments-with-toward-a-concrete-utopia-architecture-in-yugoslavia-1948-nil-1980,https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/5a66/531b/f197/cc69/0100/01a1/large_jpg/monument_to_the_battle_of_sutjeska.jpg?1516655381,,Archdaily.com,Richter scale,0
Matt Jones,"Gabriele Maltinti/Getty Images Kalidou Koulibaly's late winning goal for Napoli against Juventus on Saturday shook up the Serie A title race. But it appears the defender's towering header literally shook the city of Naples. As relayed by Tom Dutton of the Evening Standard, the Euro-Med Seismological Centre, which monitors seismic activity across Europe, picked up some ""significant ground movement"" in the Neapolitan suburb of Fuorigrotta at the point Koulibaly scored. The organisation's Facebook account posted the following snap of a seismograph and noted the point at which the centre-back fired home: Koulibaly's last-gasp goal in the 1-0 win set up an enthralling finish to the Serie A season, as the Partenopei seek to reel Juventus in and become champions for the first time since 1990.

"Yudith Ho, Rieka Rahadiana","A 6.1 magnitude earthquake rattled Indonesia’s Java island, forcing evacuation of office and residential buildings in Jakarta and its suburbs. The epicenter of the quake was near Lebak in Banten province at a depth of 10 kilometers, Indonesia’s Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency said on Twitter. There were no immediate reports of any loss of lives from the impact of the quake, which initially measured 6.4 on the Richter scale, the agency said. The temblor was relatively shallow and triggered no aftershocks, it said. More than 100 buildings were damaged on the outskirts of Jakarta, Kompas TV reported, citing Kaprawi, Banten head of the nation’s disaster mitigation agency. Indonesia’s 17,000 islands are especially prone to earthquakes because the country straddles the Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines and volcanoes that causes frequent seismic upheavals. Waves unleashed in 2004 by the undersea earthquake off the Sumatran coast caused the deadliest natural disaster this century, taking more than 220,000 lives and leaving more than 1.5 million homeless. “We were immediately evacuated once the earthquake happened,” said Josua Pardede, chief economist at Bank Permata, who worked at the 28th floor of a building in Jakarta’s main Sudirman business district.

India Block,"Italian architect Renzo Piano has offered to design a structure to replace the collapsed Ponte Morandi bridge in his hometown of Genoa. Piano told the Observer magazine it was too early to talk about the particulars of the new design, but that the new bridge must stand as a both a memorial and an embodiment of a ""positive moment of unity and cooperation"". The Ponte Morandi, in Genoa, collapsed in bad weather on the morning of 14 August 2018, killing 43 people. A large section of the structure gave way, plunging vehicles down a 45-metre drop. Piano, the architect behind the Shard in London and the Centre Pompidou in Paris with Richard Rogers, grew up in the city. New bridge to signal ""truth and pride"" ""One thing for sure is that it must be beautiful – not in the sense of cosmetics but in conveying a message of truth and pride,"" said Piano. ""It must be a place where people can recognise the tragedy in some way, while also providing a great entrance to the city. All this must be done without any sign of rhetoric – that would be the worst trap. But I think we will stay away [from that] and instead try to express real pride and values. That is what Genoa deserves."" A 12-month state of emergency has been declared in the region. A 200-metre section of the bridge collapsed in a storm, killing 43 people. Photo is courtesy of Getty Images Piano said rebuilding the bridge, which was a vital part of Italy's main A10 motorway, is imperative not just because it would restore a major piece of infrastructure but because it would stand as a landmark for hope. ""A bridge is a symbol and should never fall, because when a bridge falls, walls go up. So it’s not only physical but metaphorical – walls are bad, we should not build walls, but bridges are good, they make connections."" Piano sees work as his ""mission"" The architect was in a meeting in Geneva when he heard about the disaster, and soon offered his assistance to the Italian government. ""I've already said I would be happy [to be involved] because that's my mission. I'm also a senator for life and so it is one of my duties to respond to such a disaster in some way,"" said Piano, who was appointed a member of the Senate of the Republic in the Italian Parliament in 2013. In 2016 Renzo Piano was called upon to lead the reconstruction efforts after several towns in Italy were devastated by an earthquake, which measured 6.2 on the Richter Scale. The bridge pictured before the collapse. Photo from Getty Images Italian engineer Riccardo Morandi built his eponymous cable-stayed bridge in 1974, during Europe's postwar construction boom. The concrete structure was unconventional due to it's low span to stay ratio and the choice of prestressed concrete encasements for the cables rather that traditional steel. ""Morandi was a great engineer for sure, and he made something audacious, clever and brave but, of course, very fragile,"" said Piano. ""Fragile in the sense of a beauty that is fragile – it's not a criticism. The bridge demanded an extremely high level of attention during its lifespan."" Government blames contractor for bridge collapse Constant maintenance was required to keep the Ponte Morandi operational, and its location near a steel factory in a port town meant it was weathered by pollution and the salty sea air. Reinforcement work was being done to the bridge's foundations, with another round due to begin in October, but a complete rebuild had been dismissed as too costly and disruptive. Italy's new coalition government has blamed Autostrade per l’Italia, the private company that has the contract to maintain the country's motorways, for the disaster. Ministers have attempted to revoke the government contract with Autostrade and impose a £136 million fine. The Milan-based firm released a statement saying it was confident it had monitored and maintained the bridge to the ""best international standards"", reported Reuters. ""At this stage it is not possible to provide any reliable explanation on the reasons for the collapse,"" Autostrade said. Italian prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into the disaster.

nina azzarello I designboom,"during the venice architecture biennale, fondazione prada presents ‘machines à penser’, an exhibition curated by dieter roelstraete that focuses on three 20th century philosophers: theodor w. adorno, martin heidegger and ludwig wittgenstein. the exhibit explores the influence of these protagonists as they relate to the conditions of exile, escape and retreat, as well as physical or mental spaces that favor thought and intellectual production. ‘machines à penser’ takes place on the ground and first floors of the 18th century ca’ corner della regina, forming an immersive journey that deepens visitors’ understanding of the subjects and the relationship between philosophy, art and architecture overall. exhibition view of ‘machine à penser’ fondazione prada, venice all images by mattia balsamini, courtesy fondazione prada martin heidegger and ludwig wittgenstein shared a life-long need for intellectual isolation: heidegger spent long periods of his life in a secluded hut in the village of todtnauberg in the black forest in germany, while wittgenstein often retreated to a small mountain cabin in skjolden, norway. adorno, alternatively, was forced into exile from his native germany during by the nazi regime, first to oxford and then to los angeles, where he authored a collection of aphorisms reflecting on the fate of forced emigration. alongside architectural reconstructions of the actual huts of heidegger and wittgenstein, the centerpiece of the exhibition at fondazione prada is an installation conceived by the scottish artist and poet ian hamilton finlay in 1987 titled ‘adorno’s hut’. ‘these were the places where our protagonists hatched out their deepest thoughts,’ explains curator dieter roelstraete. ‘isolation, whether chosen or imposed, appears to have inspired them decisively—and over the years their huts have proven to be an inexhaustible source of inspiration in turn for generations of artists, attracted to the fantasy of withdrawal as articulated in its most elemental architectural form.’ on the first floor of ca’ corner della regina, visitors find an architecture-scale remake of heidegger’s black forest cabin. a series of personal photographs by photo-journalist digne meller-marcovicz and a set of ceramic pieces by jan bontjes van beek. contemporary work by artists such as giulio paolini, sophie nys, iñigo manglano-ovalle and paolo chiasera demonstrate the influence of heidegger’s thinking across philosophies of building, dwelling and belonging. within the reconstruction of wittgenstein’s cabin in norway, viewers encounter ‘head of a girl’, the only known artwork to have been made by the austro-british philosopher. wittgenstein’s self-imposed exile forms the subject of artworks created by a norwegian artist collective comprised of sebastian makonnen kjølaas, marianne bredesen and siri hjorth; jeremy millar; and guy moreton. a newly commissioned work by leonor antunes and a sculpture by mark manders are also featured in the exhibition. adorno’s american exile is recalled through a large-scale reproduction of a photograph by patrick lakey showcasing the interior of villa aurora in los angeles. the fate of forced retreat is explored through the work of artists such as susan philipsz; ewan telford; patrick lakey; anselm kiefer; and alexander kluge, who conceived a new video for the exhibition. goshka macuga designed three sculptures for the exhibition depicting the heads of the three philosophers, mark riley presents three dioramas and gerhard richter exhibits overpainted photographs of engadin mountainscapes and sculpture kugel III, evoking friedrich nietzsche’s thinking quarters in sils-maria where thus spoke zarathustra was conceived.","'machines à penser' takes place on the ground and first floors of the 18th century ca’ corner della regina, forming an immersive journey that deepens visitors' understanding of the subjects and the relationship between philosophy, art and architecture overall…",2018-05-23T16:47:48Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Designboom.com'}",fondazione prada explores the art and architecture of exile during the venice biennale,https://www.designboom.com/art/fondazione-prada-machines-penser-venice-architecture-biennale-05-23-2018/,https://www.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/fondazione-prada-venice-biennale-machines-a-penser-designboom-FB.jpg,,Designboom.com,Richter scale,0
Express News Service,"People walk on a road damaged by yesterday’s large earthquake at Kayangan Port in Lombok, Indonesia. On Sunday, two weeks after the August 5 earthquake that left at least 480 people dead in Indonesia, the region was hit by another earthquake of the same magnitude (6.9 on the Richter scale), and having the same epicentre (the holiday island of Lombok to the east of Bali). Four significant quakes were recorded that day — the first, measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale, struck shortly before midday; it was followed 12 hours later by another measuring 6.9, and subsequently by two more, of strength 5.9 and 5.3 on the Richter scale. Indeed, a series of temblors have hit the Indonesian archipelago since July 29. They have been of similar scale and, even though the August 5 event extracted the largest death toll, there has not been a discernible ‘main’ shock. Seismologists describe such a phenomenon as an “earthquake swarm”. According to the Swiss Seismological Service, swarms are made up of numerous earthquakes that occur locally over an extended period, without a clear sequence of high-intensity main quakes, preceded and succeeded by lower-intensity foreshocks and aftershocks. An earthquake swarm can last for weeks, and the pace of subsidence is gradual, relative to aftershocks in normal earthquakes. Swarms are observed in volcanic environments, hydrothermal systems, and other active geothermal areas, according to geophysicists. While the April 2015 Nepal earthquake demonstrated the foreshocks-main shock (7.8)- aftershocks trend, the seismic activity in Indonesia fits the typology of the swarm. — SUDHAKAR JAGDISH Telling Numbers — Education loans up 20%, but sector NPAs rising steadily Education loans disbursed by Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) crossed Rs 14,700 crore in the last financial year. This represented a growth of 20.5% over 2016-17, Parliament was told earlier this month. Disbursals in 2016-17, however, showed a negative growth of 9% over the previous year, 2015-16. Overall, in the four years since 2014-15, education loans have grown nearly 50% from Rs 10,000 crore. Significantly, bad loans in the education sector have also been rising over the past three years, with NPAs nearing 9% of the outstanding by March 2018, according to data reported this month. Banks follow the Indian Banks Association’s (IBA’s) model education loan scheme while disbursing loans, which provides for a repayment period of up to 15 years. IBA data show the percentage of NPAs to outstanding education loans rose from 7.3% in March 2016 to 7.67% the following March, and to 8.97% in March 2018. The outstanding education loan amount at the end of 2017-18 was Rs 71,724.65 crore, of which Rs 6,434.62 crore were NPAs. Public sector banks began to disburse education loans in 2000-01. The rise in bad loans has been attributed to the fact that many students are not getting jobs, or getting jobs that don’t pay enough, as well as to overcapacity created in education as engineering and management colleges mushroomed. Tip for Reading List — Something Fishy About Omega-3 The American marine conservationist Paul Greenberg knows his fish, having written two books, Four Fish: The Future of the Last Wild Food, and American Catch: The Fight for our Local Seafood, before his latest, also on fish — The Omega Principle: Seafood and the Quest for a Long Life and a Healthier Planet — that was published last month. It challenges the widely revered cult of the omega-3 fatty acids — besides telling, as Dr Siddhartha Mukherjee, author of The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer, and The Gene: An Intimate History, says, “the story of supplements, dietary fads, quackery, and the future of human health”. What is omega-3? What does it actually do in the body? Greenberg’s book questions commonly-held ideas that fish oils may help prevent coronary heart disease, increase brain volume, boost sperm competitiveness, prevent depression, and lower the risk of diabetes — bases for the existence of the multi-billion dollar omega-3 industry, which is thought to be rooted in Danish research that found low cardiac death rates among people who had more omega-3s in their blood. The “golden pills” in fact, do not have any effect on the human body, Greenberg says. Also, “If you were to take out all the fish of the world, boil them down, and produce the necessary pills to supplement the word’s anticipated 9 billion humans… the ocean would have been mercilessly raided”. The omega oil that is used in the supplements is not a byproduct of fish that are being processed for human consumption — rather, it is siphoned off from boiled-down forage fish that are pulled out of the ocean, in a quantity “equivalent to the human weight of the United States every year”, just for this purpose. — TANNU JAIN For all the latest Explained News, download Indian Express App",Quakes in Indonesia represent a kind of seismic activity that is different from the one seen in Nepal in 2015,2018-08-22T19:15:27Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Indianexpress.com'}",Explained Snippets | This Word Means — Earthquake Swarms,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-snippets-this-word-means-earthquake-swarms-5320004/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/08/earthquake-75.jpg?w=759,,Indianexpress.com,Richter scale,0
Lauren Theisen,"Murray State blew out Eastern Illinois on Thursday, 83-61, and improved to a 5-0 start to Ohio Valley Conference play in the process. And while I am 99.9 percent sure that virtually all living sports fans could not possibly care less about that result, I am equally confident that you will love watching Murray State point guard Ja Morant, a mere 6-foot-3 and 175 pounds, brutally punishing the rim after torching an Eastern Illinois defender:
This, all of this, is the Ja Morant experience. One of the coolest players in college basketball plays in a one-bid conference full of midwestern directional schools. Hes just dazzling enough to make it all worth caring about.
Morant had 27 points and nine assists in the win, which is actually a little below his season average. His 10.6 dimes per game leads division one by a laughable margin; the next most anyone has is 8.2. If Morant keeps it up, itll be an unprecedented season in college basketballthe first time anyones averaged over 20 points and 10 assists per game since they started keeping track of the latter stat. (His 5.1 turnovers per game obviously need to come down, but in fairness thats more-or-less to be expected when a guy is trying to do it all.)
Despite playing a massive 93.4 percent of his teams minutes and using 35 percent of possessions, Morant has stayed remarkably efficient on the court, with an eFG% of 59.1. Hes shooting a decent 76.8 percent from the foul line, and a great 61.7 percent from two, and while his three-pointer is still developing, hes respectably up over 35 percent on 65 attempts so far this year. As an athletic scorer and ball-handler who is capable of finishing and setting up his teammates with equal gusto, Morant is a treat on par with the best in college basketball. Hes also hidden away on a team that barely ever gets on national TV.
Here, for instance, is his play of the year so far. Morant leaps over a UT Martin defender in a way that can only be described as Vinsane. Except Vince Carter wasnt a dang mid-major point guard:
For dessert, heres another slam against an honest-to-god SEC team in Alabama, which, yeah, sure, came in the dying seconds of a loss, but still measures on the Richter Scale. Morant had 50 percent usage and scored 38 against the Crimson Tide, and more or less singlehandedly kept the game close. He was the only Racer in double-figures.
I bring this all to your attention not because I believe you really need to devote any of your life to Murray State until probably the first round of the NCAA Tournament, although there are worse ways to spend a couple hours. The better news is that Morant isnt going to plateau as The Dude With The Dunk Against UT-Martin. The smart people that evaluate basketball players for a living say that hes no Great White in a koi pond. In fact, hes projected to be the first point guard selected in next years draft, since lottery teams can look at him and dream about having their own version of DeAaron Fox. You can at least say you knew him back when he was a mere mid-major standout.","Murray State blew out Eastern Illinois on Thursday, 83-61, and improved to a 5-0 start to Ohio Valley Conference play in the process.

Karl Smallman,"MORE than 270 earthquakes have been recorded in just ten days near Spain’s Canary Islands raising fears of a volcanic eruption. The quakes have struck near Tenerife and Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands where there is a huge submarine fault between the two islands. Spain’s National Geographic Institute said the biggest recent quake reached a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale at only about 35km from Puerto La Luz in Gran Canaria. A report said the fault line has not been active in recent times, but it added, “What if it started spewing magma again? And what if it was reactivating the Teide volcano? That would be cataclysmic.” The Mount Teide volcano on Tenerife sits nearby. The National Park draws three million visitors yearly and the volcano's 3,718-metre (12,198 ft) summit is the highest point in Spain and the highest point above sea level in the islands of the Atlantic. The last eruption was on November 18, 1909. The government has been urged to step in amid calls for an urgent meeting to discuss why the quakes are happening again. But Emilio Carreño from Spain’s National Geographic Institute, said the majority of earthquakes registered in the past few days have been of tectonic origin, and ‘are not usually associated with volcanology.’ Carreño pointed out that all earthquakes are reviewed, especially those in the Canary Islands, because “the situation of the islands makes precision in locating the source more difficult.” He added: “Right now in the peninsula there are quite a few places where these series of quakes are being recorded. “It is common during any single month to register between 100 and 600 earthquakes in areas like Jodar or in Jaen, which can experience between 400 and 500.”",MORE than 270 earthquakes have been recorded in just ten days near Spain’s Canary Islands raising fears of a volcanic eruption.,2018-05-08T10:04:42Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Euroweeklynews.com'}",Over 270 quakes rock Canary Islands; Fears of volcanic eruption...,https://www.euroweeklynews.com/news/on-euro-weekly-news/canary-islands/1472569-volcano-eruption-fears-as-almost-300-earthquakes-rock-spanish-holiday-hotspot,https://www.euroweeklynews.com/media/k2/items/cache/68883faeec84f0cded04a9cc10507f2b_XL.jpg,,Euroweeklynews.com,Richter scale,1
Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - A strong earthquake rattled the Iraqi capital Baghdad and also hit the border area with Iran, local media sources reported on Sunday. The city of Kermanshah in Iran, close to the Iraqi border, was hit with a magnitude 5.9 quake in addition to two aftershocks above 3.0 on the Richter scale, according to the Tasnim news agency. The U.S. Geological Survey reported that a shallow, magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck about 55 miles (88 km) west-northwest of Kermanshah. There were no immediate reports of the number of casualties or material damage from the quake. Last November, a 7.3 magnitude quake struck villages and towns in Kermansheh province along the mountainous border with Iraq, killing at least 530 people and injuring thousands of others.

"Benjamin D Katz, Frederic Tomesco","Airbus SE plans to cap its takeover of the Bombardier Inc. C Series jetliner by scrapping the Canadian plane’s 14-year-old branding, people familiar with the plan said. Among the names under consideration for a plane in which Bombardier invested more than $6 billion is “A200,” according to the people, who asked not to be identified as no decision has been made. The designations A210 and A230 would be applied to the CS100 and CS300 variants, respectively. Rebranding the jet, which would slot in below Airbus’s A320-family narrow-bodies, would help fold it into the European company’s lineup and provide some reassurance to potential buyers about its long-term future, the people said. The change is likely to be announced soon after the purchase of a controlling stake closes, potentially in time for the Farnborough Air Show in July. The C Series branding was revealed at the Farnborough expo in 2004, where Bombardier said that it stood for “competitive, continental, connector.” The name also harked back to planemaker Canadair, which formed the core of Bombardier Aerospace following its acquisition in 1986, and hinted at the model’s aim of breaking the existing single-aisle duopoly, with “A” representing Airbus and “B” Boeing Co. Toulouse, France-based Airbus is acquiring control of the C Series after the model struggled to attract sufficient orders amid concerns about its feasibility, resulting in cash injections from government backers. That in turn sparked complaints from Boeing that the plane had benefited from illegal aid, causing the U.S. to impose duties that threatened to kill off sales in the world’s biggest air-travel market. The tariffs were later blocked by a U.S. trade panel. Supplier Talks The “A200” designation would depart from Airbus’s practice of naming passenger jets based on the original A300 model -- which has reached A380 for the company’s superjumbo -- and would provide it with options should the C Series be used as a basis to develop new aircraft platforms. C Series parts contracts will be reviewed once the deal closes with the aim of persuading suppliers to sweeten terms on the basis that Airbus’s scale and industrial clout are likely to swell orders and boost production volumes, Klaus Richter, the group’s procurement chief, said Wednesday at the Berlin Air Show. “It’s no secret that the program today is not profitable,’’ Richter said. “The plane is too expensive. We’ll have a discussion with suppliers because it makes a big difference if you have 300 or 1,500 in your order book.” The C Series had 348 firm orders as of Dec. 31, excluding a deal disclosed in November -- just weeks after the Airbus partnership was announced -- that ended an 18-month sales drought. Customer interest in the C Series has increased exponentially since the Airbus accord was announced, Bombardier Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare said April 16. “All of a sudden, with the Airbus sales and marketing organization behind that, we have access to pretty much all airline customers around the world,” he said in Montreal, where the company is based.","Airbus SE plans to cap its takeover of the Bombardier Inc.

Apartment Therapy Submissions,"Name: Peggy Wang Location: Ridgewood, Queens Size: 1100 square feet Years lived in: 3 years, owned A few years ago, I kinda just woke up one day and decided that I didn't want to live in a tiny apartment anymore. It was like a weird sudden existential outburst in my usual lazy put-everything-off-forever mindset. My boyfriend's friend happened to be looking to buy a two-family house, which is what planted the idea in my head. It took about eight months between that day I had the epiphany to the day I closed on the house. My apartment feels like the dream of the ""suburban sprawl"" compared to the tiny shoe box studio apartments in the city that I had gotten used to living in. I have yards and yards of kitchen counterspace and an actual pantry (fairly certain this is an unbeknownst word to all New Yorkers) where I can store such luxuries as a salad spinner and six different kinds of salt blends. I have a backyard with real grass and cute patio furniture and a fire pit and morning glories that climb up the fences. I have a whole room dedicated to my clothes and an entire basement dedicated to my myriad of discarded Amazon and Jet boxes (there's a washer and dryer, too). I never thought I'd be able to live with this kind of space in NYC, and it's turned me into the homebody I never wanted to become. But here I am. See this home before its remodel → A Cheap Collage of Browns &amp; Creams Gets a Bold, Blue Remodel Apartment Therapy Survey: Inspiration: In many ways color was the driving force behind this project. White Arrow brought in deep blues in the kitchen and bathroom and connected the color throughout the home with accessories. The floors are now much lighter (we bleached the old subfloor) to provide contrast to the architectural salvaged doors they found and the old staircase that we painted black. This was a total gut renovation and our goal was to take a dark row house and transform it into one that felt light, relaxed, and open. The kitchen took inspiration from British farmhouse kitchens, but we made it feel more playful with the added copper faucet and lighting, as well as the open white shelving. We added additional storage through a freestanding ""larder"" and hid the appliances to keep things cohesive. The bedroom has a more calm feel with natural wood, cacti, woven African baskets, and patterned rugs. The living room features a fun mix of vintage and contemporary pieces — with a nod to '70s Italia by incorporating some design classics. Throughout the home we played with scale and balance — often choosing pieces that had a nice geometry to them. Favorite Element: It's probably a toss up between the Hague Blue paint in the kitchen and the crown moulding that White Arrow chose. Once the crown moulding went up, that was the moment I got really, really excited for what the house could be. It gave an instant element of grandeur. Biggest Challenge: The budget. I obsessed over every dollar. This was not a renovation where I let myself have all the nice things. Every single thing I had to buy, whether it was an appliance or a light switch, was something I researched extensively for the best price. Thankfully, we had a decent amount of lead time so I could wait until things went on sale or eventually showed up on Craigslist or eBay. My boyfriend and I also lived in the house during the renovation, which saved us thousands of dollars. I'd come into work covered in drywall dust and a bit shaken up by the rat I'd seen crawl through the giant hole in the kitchen wall. But in hindsight, I can say that it was really all very worth it! Proudest DIY: We had a few months before the renovation already started, so we took it upon ourselves to remove the floral wallpaper in the entryway and start pulling up the linoleum tile on all three floors. I was praying to god that the original hardwood floors were lurking beneath (they were!) The heat gun was our best friend and I never, ever want to see one again. There was a lot of resourcefulness in this project — we used Ikea base cabinets and hand-painted the custom shaker fronts. We also sourced a lot of high end elements — like a used Subzero fridge, Bertazonni oven, fireplace mantel, dishwasher, and nearly all the furniture on sites like Craigslist and Ebay. Biggest Indulgence: I had started following the ""I Have a Thing With Floors"" Instagram and as far as I was concerned, putting patterned cement tiles in the bathroom was a non-negotiable, no matter how much they cost. They still make me so incredibly happy every time I take a shower and see them under my bare feet. Best Advice: Plan everything out and take really, really accurate measurements. Left up to my own devices, I would have bought a bunch of random stuff because I liked it and it was within budget, but those things might not have actually gone together.

PTI,"The hills of Uttarakhand are hit frequently by mild earthquakes -- as many as 51 since January 1, 2015 -- which are often dismissed as ""usual occurrences"". But are these tremors indicative of a big earthquake in future? ""Yes,"" says the head of state's Disaster Mitigation and Management Centre (DMMC). ""Frequent mild earthquakes in the hills of Uttarakhand should not be dismissed as common occurrences but treated as pointers to a major earthquake which is long overdue in the central seismic gap of the Himalayan front spanning Himachal Pradesh, Nepal and Uttarakhand,"" DMMC Executive Director Piyush Rautela told PTI. The DMMC is an autonomous body working under the Uttarakhand government for protection of people and environment against any kind of disaster. Its tasks among other include running training programme for people and communities for disaster mitigation. Rautela said the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand was hit by a catastrophic earthquake way back in 1803, and 200 years on there is a lot of ""un-released energy in the Himalayan region"". ""This pent-up energy accumulated over more than 200 years has led to an apprehension among scientists that it could find an outlet in the form of a big earthquake in the Himalayan region, of which Uttarakhand is a part, in the near future,"" he said. Another factor which has led to the apprehension is that the 700-km long seismic gap on the Himalayan front, which spans Uttarakhand, neighbouring Himachal Pradesh and Nepal, has not been ruptured in any major earthquake in the last 200-500 years, he said. ""Hence, it is only a matter of time before this pent-up, cumulative energy releases in the form of a major shake-up,"" Rautela said. Asked as to what scientists mean by major earthquake, he said the earthquakes measuring more than eight on the Richter Scale are categorised as such. According to data available on the Uttarakhand MeT department's website, there have been as many as 51 mild earthquakes in different parts of the state, especially the hill districts of Chamoli, Uttarkashi, Pithoragarh, Almora and Rudraprayag, since January 1, 2015. On an average mild intensity earthquakes occur in the hills twice a month with the latest hitting Pithoragarh on April 1 this year. The magnitude of the quake was 3.5 and it was not felt by many. The Pithoragarh earthquake was preceded by another of 2.9 magnitude in Uttarkashi on February 28, which had already been hit by another with a magnitude of 3.2 on February 12. Chamoli and Rudraprayag districts were hit by an earthquake measuring 4.7 on the Richter Scale on December 28 last year, followed by a 2.9-magnitude earthquake in Chamoli just two days later. ""The mild earthquakes which hit the hills of Uttarakhand almost every month and are often dismissed as usual occurrences should better be treated as warning bells so that we could equip ourselves better to deal with a bigger disaster,"" the DMMC ED said. ""These earthquakes often measuring about 2.5-4.5 on the Richter Scale are reminder from the nature that we live in an area vulnerable to earthquakes and cannot afford to lower our guard."". When asked what would be the extent of damage if an earthquake of 8+ magnitude hits the state, Rautela said it was difficult to quantify. ""But definitely the damage will be more in the thickly populated urban areas where there has been rapid and unplanned growth of population and infrastructure."" The devastating earthquake of April-May 2015 in Nepal, which left nearly 9,000 dead, amply highlighted the seismic threat in the region as also the vulnerability of the building stock there, he said. ""Hence, it is important to assess the vulnerability of built environment before undertaking any seismic-risk reduction exercise."" Rautela emphasised the importance of effective planning, preparedness and mitigation, underlining the ""constraints in earthquake prediction"". He said assessment of seismic vulnerability is a necessary precondition for realistic planning and effective mitigation. Citing a DMMC study conducted some time back to assess the seismic vulnerability of Nainital and Mussoorie, he said out of a total of 6,206 buildings surveyed in popular tourist cities, 14 per cent in Nainital and 18 per cent in Mussoorie show high probability of Category-5 damage (very significant damage) in the event of a seismic activity reaching intensity VII (earthquake measuring 7 on Ritcher Scale). Most of these buildings were reportedly constructed before 1951, he said. On infrastructure, the DMMC ED said, hospitals constitute the most critical facility required in the aftermath of any disaster and therefore it is important to assess the seismic performance of the buildings housing these facilities. Disruption of hospital services has the potential of magnifying the trauma and misery of the affected population manifold, he added. Safety of school buildings is also critical, he said. ""The collapse of school buildings would disrupt relief work as they are often used as shelters, makeshift dispensaries and stores for relief supplies in the aftermath of any disaster."" Tourism being the main economic activity in several cities of Uttarakhand, safety of hotel buildings must also be ensured. Seismic vulnerability assessment of such buildings is therefore highly recommended, according to the officer. In November last year, scientists had gathered for a two-day national workshop here. They were unanimous in their view about the high possibility of a devastating earthquake in Uttarakhand and asked the state government to work towards building tremor-resilient infrastructure. Professor ML Sharma from IIT-Roorkee recommended expansion of the earthquake early warning system network which has already been deployed in Uttarakhand. Scientists also spoke about the extra care that needs to be taken in designing the structures on hill slopes and the implications of wrong design or construction practices.","Is a big earthquake coming in Uttarakhand?Yes, according to a top disaster official, who adds that a major earthquake ""is long overdue in the central seismic gap of the Himalayan front spanning Himachal Pradesh, Nepal and Uttarakhand.""",2018-04-08T06:51:06Z,"{'id': 'the-times-of-india', 'name': 'The Times of India'}",Is a big earthquake coming in Uttarakhand?,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/are-frequent-tremors-in-ukhand-indicative-of-big-quake/articleshow/63665666.cms,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-63665680,width-672,resizemode-4,imgsize-40539/shimla-a-view-of-the-snow-capped-himalaya-mountains-seen-from-the-top-of-tarade-.jpg",the-times-of-india,The Times of India,Richter scale,0

Karen Hao,"Something wacky seems to be happening underneath Mount St. Helens. Early today (Jan. 3), at least 17 earthquakes hit near the active volcano in Washington state, in rapid succession between 12:30am and 6:28am US Pacific time. The first and strongest registered a magnitude of 3.9 on the Richter scale, according to the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. Last month, University of Washington seismologists logged more than 80 quakes, a huge increase over the average 17 per month. Mount St. Helens, 96 miles (154 km) south of Seattle, Washington and 50 miles (80 km) northeast of Portland, Oregon, is part of the Cascade Mountain Range that runs from northern California to British Columbia, Canada. It isn’t the only active volcano in the region—in fact, there are 12 other major volcanoes and nearly 3,000 other volcanic features in the Cascades—but scientists consider it the most active within the past 10,000 years. Swarms of quakes around the Mount St. Helens are relatively common and do not always suggest a sign of impending eruption. Still, there have been a few instances in recent memory that have led the uptick in seismic activity to cause alarm. The volcano’s most recent eruption, which occurred from 2004 to 2008, began with harbingers much like today’s: In the early hours of Sept. 23, 2004, a series of small-magnitude, shallow earthquakes rumbled through its lava dome. Over the next seven days, the frequency and size of the earthquakes increased and culminated in the first of several explosions on Oct. 1 2004. Fortunately, after initial steam and volcanic ash eruptions, the volcano only extruded semi-solid lava, which stayed relatively contained. By February 2008, the volcano quieted back down. Mount St. Helens is most infamous for a 1980 eruption, which caused a horrifying level of devastation. On May 18 that year, what had begun as tremors on March 20 culminated in a terrible explosion that blew off the volcano’s top 1,300 feet. The eruption caught the surrounding area unprepared and took the lives of 57, the deadliest volcanic event in US history. According to the US Geological Survey, most of the people who died likely did so from from asphyxiation after inhaling hot ash. Many of the victims’ bodies were also never found. Presently, there seems to be no immediate danger of an eruption, according to geologist Trevor Nace, but scientists are continuing to monitor the situation. “While we can’t be certain,” Nace wrote in Forbes, “chances are the next time Mount St. Helen erupts, we will be significantly better prepared.”","Something wacky seems to be happening underneath Mount St. Helens.

Since July 2018, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) has hosted an exhibition exploring the architecture of the former Yugoslavia. Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia, 1948-1980 became the first major US exhibition to study the subject, through over 400 drawings, models, photographs, and films.
With the exhibition soon coming to an end, Martino Stierli (Chief Curator of Architecture and Design at MoMA) and Vladimir Kulic (Guest Curator and Architecture Historian) have presented a 7-minute-long video guiding viewers through the highlights of the exhibition.
Available above, the video touches on a variety of structures, from the small, modular K67 Kiosk to the imposing Avala TV Tower in Belgrade. Tracing the genesis of the architectural movement; a post-war, utopian vision of a new society to which architecture played a central role.

The architecture that emerged during this periodfrom International Style skyscrapers to Brutalist social condensersis a manifestation of the radical pluralism, hybridity, and idealism that characterized the Yugoslav state itself. Exploring themes of large-scale urbanization, technological experimentation and its application in everyday life, consumerism, monuments and memorialization, and the global reach of Yugoslav architecture, Toward a Concrete Utopia features work by important architects, including Bogdan Bogdanovi, Juraj Neidhardt, Svetlana Kana Radevi, Edvard Ravnikar, Vjenceslav Richter, and Milica teri.

French photographer Jonk drove over 5,000 kilometers through southeast Europe. His subject matter? Yugoslavian monuments, or ""spomenik"" in Serbian. Built in the 1960s and 70s under former president Josep Broz Tito, these monuments commemorate the communist resistance during the German occupation.
Commissioned by former Yugoslavian president, Josip Broz Tito in the 1960s and 70s to commemorate sites where WWII battles took place, these now forgotten structures stand empty and without the significance it once had decades ago.
For many years, Yugoslavia's futuristic ""Spomenik"" monuments were hidden from the majority of the world, shielded from the public eye by their remote locations within the mountains and forests of Eastern Europe.

Tyler Durden,"Yesterday morning a series of 10 earthquakes struck Monterey County, California along the San Andreas fault line and has Cali residents increasingly concerned that the ""Big One"" could be next. The quakes, the biggest of which measured 4.6 on the Richter scale, hit near Salinas, California but were felt 90 miles away in San Francisco. Per SF Gate : A 4.6-magnitude earthquake rattled Monterey County on Monday and was felt more than 90 miles away in San Francisco, officials said. The quake hit at 11:31 a.m. about 13 miles northeast of Gonzales, near Salinas, and was followed by nine smaller aftershocks, with the largest measuring magnitude 2.8, said Annemarie Baltay, a seismologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park. There were no reports of injuries or damage. Baltay said the quake occurred on the San Andreas Fault, close to an area where the Calaveras Fault branches off. The quake happened at a depth of about 4 miles. While a seismologist for the US Geological Survey, Annemarie Baltay, dismissed the recent quakes as part of 'normal seismic activity', the Director of the Southern California Earthquake Center offered a slightly different opinion to the LA Times last year: “Any time there is significant seismic activity in the vicinity of the San Andreas fault, we seismologists get nervous,” said Thomas H. Jordan, director of the Southern California Earthquake Center, “because we recognize that the probability of having a large earthquake goes up.” As seismic activity drops, the probability of having a large earthquake also decreases. Experts said it’s important to understand that the chance of the swarm triggering a big one, while small, was real. “When there’s significant seismicity in this area of the fault, we kind of wonder if it is somehow going to go active,” said Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson. “So maybe one of those small earthquakes that’s happening in the neighborhood of the fault is going to trigger it, and set off the big event.” Of course, Thomas Jordan is the same California Seismologist who raised some eyebrows last year when he proclaimed that the San Andreas fault is well overdue for a major quake. “The springs on the San Andreas system have been wound very, very tight. And the southern San Andreas fault, in particular, looks like it’s locked, loaded and ready to go, ” Jordan said in the opening keynote talk. Other sections of the San Andreas fault also are far overdue for a big quake. Further southeast of the Cajon Pass, such as in San Bernardino County, the fault has not moved substantially since an earthquake in 1812, and further southeast toward the Salton Sea, it has been relatively quiet since about 1680 to 1690. Here’s the problem: Scientists have observed that based on the movement of tectonic plates, with the Pacific plate moving northwest of the North American plate, earthquakes should be relieving about 16 feet of accumulated plate movement every 100 years. Yet the San Andreas has not relieved stress that has been building up for more than a century. Jordan went on to say that when the tension that has been building along the San Andreas fault is finally relieved, it could potentially produce a magnitude 8 earthquake. Here's what a Magnitude 8 quake would look like... Back in 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey concluded that just a magnitude 7.8 earthquake along the southern San Andreas fault would cause more than 1,800 deaths, 50,000 injuries and 200 billion dollars in damage...so lets hope that Jordan is wrong.","Yesterday morning a series of 10 earthquakes struck Monterey County, California along the San Andreas fault line and has Cali residents increasingly concerned that the ""Big One"" could be next.

Pritzker has not set a limit on what he’s willing to spend to win Illinois' gubernatorial election. | Joshua Lott/Getty Images CHICAGO — Billionaire J.B. Pritzker dropped $25 million into his campaign this week and Gov. Bruce Rauner’s campaign is preparing to air at least $1 million in attack ads beginning Tuesday, keeping the Illinois governor’s election on track to be one of the most expensive in U.S. history. After a brief ceasefire, the two wealthy businessmen restarted their frenzied pace of spending this week for an election that’s still five months away. Story Continued Below Pritzker, who has already pumped $100 million of his own personal wealth into the contest, has not set a limit on what he’s willing to spend. In fact, a source close to the Pritzker campaign said, the Democratic businessman is vowing to spend double whatever multimillionaire Rauner puts into the contest. “For every dollar he spends, we’re ready to spend two,” the source told POLITICO on Monday. In response, Rauner spokesman Will Allison alluded to recorded conversations between Pritzker and imprisoned ex-Governor Rod Blagojevich that were caught on FBI wiretaps in 2008. “Based off his conversations with Blagojevich, Pritzker has already shown a willingness to try to buy political office,” Allison said. Still, Pritzker’s no holds-barred spending is a revelation sure to rattle Rauner, who has been relatively reticent this cycle to dig deep. In his first run for governor, the Republican — a wealthy private equity investor — held the upper hand in spending in his successful challenge to then-Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn. By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. Now, the tables have turned. Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, is freely spending on his own race and also vowing to dispense a regular flow of cash to smaller Democratic Party organizations across Illinois. Last week alone, Pritzker gave $5 million as part of a Blue Wave program to boost Democrats in down-ballot state races. Since last year, Rauner has spent $30 million on his 2018 election campaign, and gave another $7.5 million in that time to the Illinois Republican Party. In total, the governor’s race has so far seen more than $200 million in spending, including from primary candidates on both sides. Blair Horner, longtime executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, noted that the spending in Illinois is all the more stunning given that the state is considerably smaller than population giants like California and New York. “That’s a staggering sum,” Horner said. “That’s Richter-scale measuring spending for a governor’s race.” The eye-popping totals are rivaled only by the 2010 California governor’s race in which eBay executive Meg Whitman spent $159 million while Jerry Brown spent around $36 million. Despite being outspent five-to-one, Brown won by 13 percentage points. “It seems like it should be conventional wisdom by now that for all the hand-wringing about the distorting effects of money in politics post-Citizens United, there's no amount in the world that's going to help if you're seen as a weak candidate and voters aren't responding to your message,” said Rob Pyers, research director with California Target Book, which handicaps elections.

Geoffrey O’Brien,"When Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” emerged in 1968, after repeated delays (filming had begun in late 1965) and nearly doubling the original $6 million budget, it was greeted as something of a disaster. Kubrick had kept a tight lid on the project, and when MGM executives got a look in March, they were aghast. At the New York premiere, a sixth of the audience walked out. Critics described it as “somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring” ( Renata Adler ) and “a thoroughly uninteresting failure” ( Andrew Sarris ), with Pauline Kael concurring: “monumentally unimaginative... trash masquerading as art.” None of that meant a thing to the younger spectators who began lining up on opening day and continued to come back. By the time I belatedly caught up with “2001” some months after its opening, acquaintances had already favored me with elaborate exegeses—metaphysical, prophetic, psychedelic—of what seemed to them not so much a film as an unbroken flow of revelation. Yet although ensconced as a canonical milestone and cited as a formative influence by filmmakers who followed, “2001” remains singular even in Kubrick’s oeuvre: slow, elliptical, deliberately enigmatic, often wordless. Its most emotionally expressive character is a dysfunctional computer, its culminating episode a sustained burst of abstraction. It is doubtful whether such a film could gather a mass audience now, and even more unlikely that any filmmaker would get the chance to risk it. Kubrick’s risk-taking is the through-line of Michael Benson’s “Space Odyssey,” an omnivorously curious account of how the movie came to be, starting with Kubrick’s letter to the novelist and scientist Arthur C. Clarke about “the possibility of doing the proverbial ‘really good’ science fiction movie.” Mr. Benson, himself a filmmaker and artist whose projects have often been concerned with cosmological science, has put together an enlightening and entertaining narrative rich in both pointed anecdotes and lucid technical expositions. The book’s large cast of characters reflects the scale of a production so complex it seems a wonder it didn’t take even longer to complete—especially with the director still working out basic plot concepts and contemplating radically different endings almost until the wrap. Kubrick has been mythologized as the ultimate control freak, and the obsessiveness of his concentration is self-evident, but Mr. Benson emphasizes his capacity to improvise, to respond creatively to other people’s hints, and to make large gambles. “We never had a finished script,” production designer Tony Masters recalled. “We’d get together with Stanley in the evening and talk about what we were going to do the next day—and as a result, the whole thing would change. The production department was suicidal.” Mr. Masters was only one of a small army of recruits making crucial contributions. As Kubrick seized advantage of the ample means his earlier successes had earned him, “a big-budget Hollywood production,” in Mr. Benson’s words, “had been transformed into a giant research and development think tank.” If “2001” now seems a relic of an already unimaginable era, it is because every element of its analog simulation of a future digital age had to be imagined, invented and built by hand. Arguments over who did the imagining and inventing of any given element have simmered over the years, but Mr. Benson shows how widely diffused the creative energies were, with artisans devoting months or years to solving minute technical problems while often having scant idea of the film’s overall structure. To watch the film after reading Mr. Benson’s book is to see it as an assemblage of disparate pieces, and to marvel again at the enduring beauty of their assembling. The opening “Dawn of Man” sequence alone involved protracted trial and error to create costumes for the hominids who first encounter the inscrutable extraterrestrial monolith around which the film is centered. These outfits needed to be both flexible and believable enough not to look like B-movie apeman outfits, while the American mime Dan Richter, who would play the lead hominid, studied a gorilla at Regent’s Park Zoo and trained a troupe of dancers to imitate his movements and behavior. In the meantime, photographers flew to Namibia to gather landscape images that would be combined to remarkably seamless effect with the staged action. When they sent Kubrick pictures of a rare and protected species of Namibian trees, he went so far as to urge them to illegally uproot a few and ship them back for use by the art department. Kubrick allowed little to get in the way of anything he thought necessary for the film, and the set could be a dangerous place to work. The rotating 30-ton centrifuge set representing the living quarters of the central episode’s Jupiter-bound astronauts regularly overheated amid showers of glass from exploding lights. To provide convincing simulations of zero gravity, Kubrick encouraged high-risk wirework stunts above a concrete floor. Stuntman Bill Weston, who had a frightening near-miss realizing one such scene, remarked: “One of the great things about Stanley was he had an incredible, tremendous artistic integrity. I think morally he was a little bit weaker.” Kubrick’s drive to push collaborators beyond their usual boundaries was not so much about realizing a blueprint as about venturing into the unknown. Despite the visual power of his art, Mr. Benson writes, Kubrick was “nearly incapable of actually picturing visual concepts when they were described verbally.” He found what he wanted, where he was going, by trying things out. Before there was even a script, he spent long days in an abandoned brassiere factory in Manhattan, filming blobs of paint diffusing in a mix of ink and paint thinner: These turned out to be the preliminary ingredients of the hallucinatory “Star Gate” episode of the film’s final chapter, when the surviving astronaut played by Keir Dullea makes his final journey “beyond infinity.” In like fashion, the whole movie was built up piece by piece, the connections between the pieces known only to Kubrick. Even when completed “2001” remained opaque to many. Clarke, truly the film’s co-creator, found himself shut out from the final stages and was unhappy with the omission of the narration that had been intended to guide the spectator through all the leaps of time and space. Kubrick preferred to leave in the gaps and mysteries, perhaps realizing it was the rational explanation that would date most rapidly. As a result “2001” became a nexus for free-floating speculation. In Nathan Abrams’s “Stanley Kubrick: New York Jewish Intellectual,” a sometimes tortuous exploration of the contradictions of Kubrick’s relation to Jewish identity, the film is seen through the lens of Biblical allusion and Kabbalistic interpretation. Scribbled into Kubrick’s copy of a book by Kafka, Mr. Abrams finds his marginal note: “The tower of Babel was the start of the space age.” Like many Kubrick analysts, Mr. Abrams can go very far afield in tracking down parallels and resonances. Then again, given the director’s readiness to explore any intellectual path or aesthetic suggestion that presented itself, nothing can really be ruled out. His “Space Odyssey” continues to be gloriously open-ended. —Mr. O’Brien is the former editor-in-chief of the Library of America.",Kubrick found what he wanted by trying things out—an expensive habit.,2018-04-15T02:55:00Z,"{'id': 'the-wall-street-journal', 'name': 'The Wall Street Journal'}",‘Space Odyssey’ and ‘Stanley Kubrick’ Review: Like Nothing Else on Earth,https://www.wsj.com/articles/space-odyssey-and-stanley-kubrick-review-like-nothing-else-on-earth-1523565411,https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-YE467_bkrvku_SOC_20180410144655.jpg,the-wall-street-journal,The Wall Street Journal,Richter scale,0
Reuters Editorial,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The defense lawyer for Australian Cardinal George Pell, a former top Vatican official now in custody pending sentencing for sexually abusing 13-year-old boys, apologized on Thursday for controversial comments he made about the assault. 
The former Vatican treasurer is the most senior Catholic cleric to be convicted for child sex offences. He was found guilty in December of five offences committed in the 1990s, but the verdict was only made public this week when the court lifted a suppression order on the case. 
Robert Richter, who presented Pell’s defense in court, had tried to argue that his client’s offences were at the low-end of the scale, at one point saying it was “no more than a plain vanilla sexual penetration case” where the child did not willingly take part, an argument quickly dismissed by the judge. 
In a statement to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, he said he had made a “terrible choice of a phrase”. 
“In seeking to mitigate sentence, I used a wholly inappropriate phrase for which I apologize profusely to all who interpreted it in a way it was never intended,” Richter said. 
“It was in no way meant to belittle or minimize the suffering and hurt of victims of sex abuse, and in retrospect I can see why it caused great offence to many. 
“I hope my apology is accepted as sincerely as it is meant and I will never repeat such carelessness in my choice of words which might offend.” 
The 77-year-old Pell had been on bail throughout the court proceedings. Bail was revoked on Wednesday and he was taken into custody. He is due to be sentenced on March 13.

Jess McHugh,"An earthquake that registered at 7.6 on the Richter scale struck the Caribbean Tuesday night off the coast of Honduras. The earthquake was one of the strongest in recent history in the region, the Associated Press reported. Despite the strength of th earthquake, only minor damage has been reported so far, particularly in Honduras. Tsunami warnings were issued for parts of the coast of Central America, as well as Puerto Rico, the Cayman Islands, Cuba, Jamaica, and other Caribbean islands, but no tsunami occurred. In addition to Honduras, residents of Belize City and the Mexican state of Quintana Roo felt tremors, NBC reported. The Caribbean is an active seismic zone, and the earthquake that ravaged Haiti in 2010 registered at a 7.0 on the Richter scale. More than a dozen earthquakes with a magnitude of 7.0 or higher took place in the region in the past 500 years, according to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. One quake in 1946 that registered at a whopping 8.1 resulted in the deaths of 1,600 people, according to Woods Hole. The earthquake struck as the Caribbean region continues to rebuild following a powerful hurricane season. The situation in Puerto Rico has remained dire where many people are still lacking basic supplies and medicines they need to survive following a September 2017 hurricane. Other islands in the Caribbean saw far less damage than Puerto Rico or survived the season relatively unscathed and are urging tourists to return to the region.

Express News Service,"Last year, too, Javahar taluka in the district had reported similar earthquake shocks. (Representational/REUTERS) The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has installed seismic observation machines in Palghar district, three weeks after earthquake shocks measuring 3 on the Richter scale were reported from the district. The machines were installed during a joint visit to the site by officials from IMD, District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMA) and state government officials on December 11 and December 14. A seismo-meter was installed on the campus of Vedant Hospital in Dhundhalwadi. The site was finalised after surveying the area, which reported a series of earthquake shocks in the last few days of November. These machines will record and share real-time seismic observations, said an official from IMD, Mumbai, who visited Palghar. Last year, too, Javahar taluka in the district had reported similar earthquake shocks. With such repeated incidents, experts are planning to set up machines to undertake long-term seismic observations. Since the district is dominated by tribal people, public awareness needs to be taken up in a big way. This will help reduce anxiety and fear among the residents, the official noted.","With such repeated incidents, experts are planning to set up machines to undertake long-term seismic observations.",2018-12-15T00:31:57Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Indianexpress.com'}",IMD to monitor seismic activity in Palghar,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/imd-to-monitor-seismic-activity-in-palghar-5494723/,https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/12/earthquake.jpg?w=759,,Indianexpress.com,Richter scale,0
Joe Mellor,"Finding alien life has moved a step closer after a breakthrough by Scottish scientists. A tool has been developed that measures the level of excitement generated by any potential signal from aliens. It has been likened to the Richter Scale used for calculating the size of earthquakes – appropriate as discovering extra terresstrials will send shock waves across the planet. The tool, created by Dr Duncan Forgan’s team at the University of St Andrews’ Centre for Exoplanet Science, has been inspired by Facebook and Twitter – and the phenomenon of ‘fake news’. It is an updated version of the Rio Scale which astronomers have used since 2001 to communicate observations to the public. With the modern world of 24 hour news and social media in mind, it redefines the scale for alien detection, say the team. It takes into account the consequences for humans if the signal is from aliens, as well as the probability it really is from them and not a natural phenomenon or human-made. The scale, called Rio 2.0, gives a score between zero and ten, so that the public can quickly see how important a signal really is. Dr Forgan said: “What are the consequences for the human race if we encountered extraterrestrial intelligence? If you see a story about aliens on TV or online, how excited should you be?” Described in the International Journal of Astrobiology, the tool gives a score between zero and ten, so the public can quickly see how important a signal really is. Alien hunting pioneer Dr Jill Tarter, co-founder of the SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) Institute, Mountain View, California, said: “The whole world knows about the Richter Scale for quantifying the severity of an earthquake; that number is reported immediately following a quake and subsequently refined as more data are consolidated. “The SETI community is attempting to create a scale that can accompany reports of any claims of the detection of extraterrestrial intelligence and be refined over time as more data become available. “This scale should convey both the significance and credibility of the claimed detection. “Rio 2.0 is an attempt to update the scale to make it more useful and compatible with current modes of information dissemination, as well as providing means for the public to become familiar with the scale.” There have been many dubious signals reported as ‘aliens’ in recent years, and learning the truth about these stories is increasingly difficult. As such, an updated Rio Scale is required. Dr Forgan said, coupled with an increase in efforts to detect extra terrestrial intelligence by teams around the world, the Rio Scale is needed more than ever. It must remain relevant when communicating to the public about ‘alien signals’. His team’s revision of the Rio Scale aims to bring consensus across academic disciplines, when classifying signals potentially indicating the existence of advanced extraterrestrial life. Rio 2.0 can quickly calibrate the public expectations of a reported signal, and educate them as to how SETI scientists actually evaluate a signal. This is from its initial detection through the various verification stages needed to determine if a signal is credibly from ET. Key to the research is also the development of a single set of consistent terminology for discussing signals, both among researchers and in the media. The team has published an online Rio Scale Calculator, an interactive tool for scientists and science communicators to evaluate signals and give advice on how to use it for better reporting of ETI in the media. Dr Forgan said: “It is absolutely crucial when we talk about something so hugely significant as the discovery of intelligent life beyond the Earth, we do it clearly and carefully. “Having Rio 2.0 allows us to rank a signal quickly in a way that the general public can easily understand, and helps us keep their trust in a world filled with fake news.” The new Rio Scale has now been submitted to the International Academy of Astronautics Permanent Committee on SETI for official ratification. Since you’re here … It may worry you that much of our mainstream press is increasingly reporting with a strong right-wing bias. Most of our media is owned by a handful of offshore billionaires with personal agendas. More worrying is the staggering decline in independent, investigative journalism. It costs a lot to produce, so many publications facing an uncertain future can no longer fund it. With nobody to hold the rich and powerful to account, or report on the issues that don't fit with the mainstream 'narrative', your help is needed.

Jerri-Lynn Scofield,"By Wolf Richter, a San Francisco based executive, entrepreneur, start up specialist, and author, with extensive international work experience. Originally published at Wolf Street. Shares of Deutsche Bank fell 7.2% today in Frankfurt to €9.16, the lowest since they started trading on the Xetra exchange in 1992. They’re now lower than they’d been during its last crisis in 2016. And they’re down 71% from April 2015. This came after leaked double-whammy revelations the morning: One reported by the Financial Times, that the FDIC had put Deutsche Bank’s US operations on its infamous “Problem Bank List”; and the other one, reported by the Wall Street Journal, that the Fed, as main bank regulator, had walloped the bank last year with a “troubled condition” designation, one of the lowest rankings on its five-level scoring system. The FDIC keeps its “Problem Bank List” secret. It only discloses the number of banks on it and the amount of combined assets of these banks. A week ago, the FDIC reported that in Q1, combined assets on the “Problem Bank List” jumped by $42.5 billion to $56.4 billion (red bars, right scale), the first such surge since 2008, as I mused… Oops, It’s Starting, Says This Chart from the FDIC: That increase in assets of $42.5 billion on the “Problem Bank List” nearly matches the assets of Deutsche Bank’s principal subsidiary in the US, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (DBTCA) of $42.1 billion as of March 31. And this has now been now confirmed by the sources: it was DBTCA that ended up on the “Problem Bank List.” The Fed’s downgrade a year ago of Deutsche Bank’s US operations to “troubled condition” was what apparently nudged the FDIC in Q1 to put the bank on its Problem Bank List. The Fed’s ranking of banks is also a secret – for a good reasons: When these things come out, shares plunge and investors lose what little confidence they have left, as we’re seeing today. This loss of trust can entail larger problems that then coagulate into a self-fulfilling prophesy that perhaps should have self-fulfilled itself years ago. In addition to the shares sinking to a new low, Deutsche Bank AG’s contingent convertible bonds, one of the instruments with which the German entity has increased its woefully drained Tier 1 capital after the Financial Crisis are now plunging again. The 6% CoCos dropped 3.6% today, to 90.12 cents on the euro. They’re now down 15% from the beginning of the year: “CoCos” are designed to be “bailed in” before taxpayers get the bill. Thus, they count as Tier 1 capital, and they’re a gauge of these investors’ fears about getting bailed in. Since the Financial Crisis, Deutsche Bank has sold several waves of these CoCos. Unlike most other bonds, they have no maturity date. But the bank can redeem them, usually after five years. Annual coupon payments are contingent on the bank’s ability to keep its capital above a threshold. If capital falls below that threshold, the bank won’t make the coupon payment. But this will not count as a default, it’s just part of the deal. If regulators deem that the bank is failing, CoCos get “bailed in,” either by getting converted into increasingly worthless shares or by getting canceled. To make these risks worthwhile, CoCos offer a high annual coupon. The 6% CoCos in the chart above, when they still traded at 106 cents on the euro earlier this year, yielded 5.7%; at today’s lower price, the yield has jumped to 6.7%. In other words, investors demand to be paid more to take on the risks of getting bailed in. Deutsche Bank has been whacked serially by layoffs, strategic redirections and misdirections, CEO chaos, three years in a row of big losses, and many billions of dollars in fines – the price it is now paying for having gone from a stodgy German bank that was taking care of its industrial customers in Germany to a global powerhouse with one of the riskiest, most far-flung operations around. But once again, there’s nothing to worry about. Deutsche Bank AG, the main entity, in Germany came out with a long press release today to slough off these issues, saying firstly, “As a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific regulatory feedback”; and secondly, Deutsche Bank AG “is very well capitalized and has significant liquidity reserves,” and the US entities, which are getting tarred-and-feathered here, “have very robust balance sheet as disclosed in our quarterly regulatory filings.” Regulators, however, have been hounding the bank. Earlier this month, the Financial Times reported that the ECB and Germany’s BaFin, which both regulate the bank, were raising alarms about its US operations, their size, and their potential as trigger for instability, according to “four people with knowledge of the discussions.” The Wall Street Journal summed up why US regulators are fretting, and why the Fed, its primary US regulator, has hit the US entities with its punitive “troubled condition” status: Fed supervisors grew exasperated with its shortcomings in systems and controls and the slow pace of improvements, people familiar with internal discussions said. Deutsche Bank’s U.S. operations have drawn regulatory ire for years. They received a stinging rebuke from the New York Fed in 2014 about repeated financial-reporting failures and lack of follow-through on promised fixes, The Wall Street Journal detailed. Deutsche Bank U.S. operations failed the Fed’s stress tests in 2015 and 2016, and in 2017 was the subject of multiple Fed enforcement actions for perceived lax controls tied to currency trading, money laundering, and Volcker-rule trading restrictions. In the US, a battle for deposits has broken out, where banks fight by raising the rates on savings products to attract new money while keeping their overall funding costs low, with some twists.

Mike Arnot,"Recently, I took two flights. The first was an Air France Airbus A380 from New York JFK to Paris CDG. I barely even noticed we had taken off, let alone the relatively subtle roar that is the spooling of the engines at takeoff. Of course lucky me! I was firmly ensconced in first class, at the front of the plane. The second flight was aboard a Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft from Newark to Halifax, Nova Scotia. On the Q400, I sat behind the propeller. There was a dull roar during taxiing and that roar increased to a visceral, low, rapid thumping as the second engine was started and the plane throttled up. The “Q” of the Q400 is supposed to stand for quiet; a noise-cancelling system is built in. The truth is my ears perceive the Q400 to be about twice as loud as the A380. A 2018 study published in the Journal of Exposure Science &amp; Environmental Epidemiology points the way: how loud you perceive the cabin noise to be depends on the aircraft, and where you sit on board. On the Air France flight, had I been sitting on the lower deck in economy, behind the engines, it would not have seemed quite so quiet. So, which aircraft are the quietest aloft? And where should you aim to sit on board? First, What’s Causing the Noise? Passengers intuitively know that the engines are the main source of aircraft noise. However, in-flight noise also results from airflow around surfaces such as wings, flaps and landing gear. Surprisingly, Canadian researchers found that “high speed turbulent flow over an air­craft fuselage is responsible for a substantial component of the interior noise, and is probably the most important source of cabin noise for jet powered passenger aircraft in steady cruise.” It’s the plane itself moving through the air delivering most of the cabin noise, and not simply the engines. The good news is that the noise levels are decreasing, forced by regulation and steady improvements in engine and aircraft design. The FAA has mandated that aircraft designed after January 1, 2018 must be compliant with new, quieter decibel restrictions. Engines with high bypass ratios (the ratio of air bypassing the engine core to that flowing through the core) results in lower exhaust speed and thus less noise. The engines on most jet aircraft you will fly on these days are almost all of the high-bypass variety. In addition, the advent of geared turbofan engines has resulted in quieter engines. Thanks to a gearbox between the fan at the front of the engine and the compressor behind it, the fan can be slowed down which makes it quieter, since fan blade tips approaching the speed of sound make a special kind of whine. Geared turbofans can be found most commonly on the Airbus A220 and A320neo series, and on the Boeing 737 MAX. The Decibel: How Sound Is Measured Decibels are measured on a logarithmic scale, not a linear scale, similar to the Richter scale for seismic activity. A 7.0 magnitude earthquake differs dramatically in terms of destruction from a 5.5 on the Richter scale. Similarly, every increase of 10 decibels represents a 10X increase in the intensity of the sound but critically, a 2X factor of the perceived “loudness” (which is a subjective measure). With that in mind, absolute silence is zero decibels. A typical office setting is 60 decibels. The inside of an aircraft during flight? About 80 decibels, or about four times as loud as the typical office. Decibel levels of a typical flight. From the Journal of Exposure Science &amp; Environmental Epidemiology. The chart above gives some insight into the phases of flight, with takeoff, in green, being the loudest. Here, the cabin noise approaches 100+ decibels, before returning to around 85 decibels in flight. But those values, of course, change with airplanes. The Silence of Airplanes Earlier this year, a study was released in the Journal of Exposure Science &amp; Environmental Epidemiology, titled “ Assessment of Noise in the Airplane Cabin Environment.” The study measured the noise levels over 200 flights in almost two dozen aircraft types, with the results shown below. Aircraft Flights Observed Mean (dB) Max (dB) A319, A320, B767-300, MD-90 14 82.7 109.8 B737-300/400/500/700/800 20 83.6 &gt;110 B757 71 81.5 109.9 CRJ-100/200/700/900 15 80.8 109.6 E-135, E-145, E-170, E-175, E-190 15 78.7 107.4 B737, DC-9, MD-80, MD-88 63 83.2 &gt;110.0 The decibel levels do not differ dramatically between aircraft: the loudest aircraft, the Boeing 737, is 4.9 decibels louder than the Embraer regional jet. However, because of the logarithmic scale used in reporting decibels, this means the Boeing is about 50% “louder” than the Embraer aircraft. Similarly, the 737 is 0.9 decibels louder than the A320, or about 10% “louder”. Fascinating stuff. The Airbus A380, Boeing 787 and A350 Unfortunately, the study did not include several long-haul leaders, such as the Boeing 747, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the Airbus A350 or the Airbus A380. It didn’t include either the newest single-aisle jets, the Airbus A220 and A320neo series and the Boeing 737 MAX. All of them mount newer and much quieter engines than the previous generation. The study notes that “[a]ircraft noise has been significantly reduced by evolution of noise-reducing engine technology (e.g., Pratt and Whitney PurePower Geared TurboFan engine reduces noise footprint by 75%) combined and with the introduction of newer aircraft models and airframes with a lower noise profile (e.g., Boeing 787 and Airbus A380).” I turned to other sources to see if decibel levels were recorded or released. The A380 The Airbus A380 is considered to have the quietest long-haul cabin in the skies. So much so that pilots have complained of poor sleep because they can hear every baby cry and lavatory flush in their crew rest bunk at the rear of the aircraft. Indeed, Randy Tinseth, Boeing’s VP of Marketing, noted in a 2007 Boeing blog post that the A380’s quiet may not be a benefit for passengers; the drone of the plane cutting through the air would provide a sort of white noise. “Youd probably agree that the most disturbing background noises are the random ones talking, coughing, lavatory doors closing. How disturbed you are during a flight is a function of the degree to which the random noises rise above the background noise,” he wrote. Granted, he was talking about the competition, but I tend to agree with Tinseth; I’m far more annoyed at the pinging of passengers calling flight attendants than the drone of the engines. The Boeing 787 Boeing does not appear to have made precise claims about the decibel level in the cabin of the Dreamliner aircraft. However, the 787 features several noise reduction features, not the least of which are the chevrons on the engine which better combine hot and cold air flow to reduce engine noise. One reviewer claimed the Boeing 787 registered 90 decibels on takeoff measured with an iPhone app, which is 10 decibels lower than the aircraft in the Journal study referenced above (or about half as loud). A United Airlines Boeing 787-9 takes off from LAX, April 2016. The chevrons on the engine are evident. (Photo by Alberto Riva / TPG) However, an iPhone app measurement isn’t exactly scientifically rigorous compared to a technical study. For that matter, Airbus has its own view of how the Boeing 787 performs compared to the A350. The A350 Airbus claims the A350 is “five decibels quieter than competing aircraft [the Boeing 787], and up to nine decibels quieter towards the front of the cabin. This means four times less noise.” This, of course, is without Airbus actually releasing their data. Where to Sit? In a word? First class. Various studies cited in the studies indicate that sitting in front the wings and engines is the quietest place in flight, with behind the wing and engines being the loudest. That makes intuitive sense. In addition, the Canadian researchers discovered that window seats were four decibels higher than the middle and aisle seats or almost 50% louder. All in all, the trend for new aircraft will be quieter cabins. Ultimately, I don’t mind the white noise machine that is today’s modern aircraft. I just wish the flight attendant call button wasn’t quite so loud. Mike Arnot is the founder of Boarding Pass NYC, a New York-based travel brand, and a private pilot.

GREGORY COWLES,"Photo William Styron HAPPY OLD YEAR: Half a century ago, in the winter after the Summer of Love, American reading habits were as turbulent as the culture at large. William Styron’s novel of slave rebellion, “The Confessions of Nat Turner,” ruled the fiction best-seller list of Dec. 31, 1967, where it was joined by titles as varied as “The Exhibitionist” (Henry Sutton’s sex-soaked Hollywood romp), “The Chosen” (Chaim Potok’s coming-of-age tale about Jewish identity) and “The President’s Plane Is Missing” (Robert J. Serling’s political thriller about a constitutional crisis). And — in maybe the clearest sign that you would have needed the Richter scale to measure the zeitgeist of the late 1960s — the same list made room for both “Christy,” Catherine Marshall’s historical Christian romance, and “Rosemary’s Baby,” Ira Levin’s tale of satanic horror. Strange days, as the Doors noted that fall. Styron’s novel has probably demonstrated the longest staying power of any book on that week’s list. That’s partly because its account of America’s roots in slavery feels as fraught as ever, and partly because the artistic debate it ignited — about racial imagination and appropriation — still burns like a wildfire through today’s cultural landscape. After a planned movie adaptation was postponed in early 1970 (it was eventually canceled altogether), Styron railed against the “black pressure groups” he held responsible. “I feel that the attacks on the book are completely irrational,” he told The New York Times, “since they come mostly from blacks who resent that a white man has written about their black hero.” Twentieth Century Fox, for its part, maintained that the decision was financial; the movie, with James Earl Jones cast as Nat Turner and Sidney Lumet set to direct, had sprinted past its initial budget. Not that it hurt Styron, who was reportedly paid $600,000 for the film rights. “I don’t feel I’ve been shortchanged, because I’ll get the money,” he told The Times. Meanwhile, “The Confessions of Nat Turner” went on to spend 60 weeks on the hardcover and paperback best-seller lists, 25 of them at No. 1. I N FACT: The Dec. 31, 1967, nonfiction list was all over the place as well. Here are the top four titles: 1) “‘Our Crowd’: The Great Jewish Families of New York,” by Stephen Birmingham. 2) “Nicholas and Alexandra,” by Robert K. Massie. 3) “Rickenbacker,” by Edward V.

Sierra Crane-Murdoch,"On March 20, 2018, scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory noticed an unusual shift in a vent on the southeast flank of Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes, on the Big Island of Hawaii. Two G.P.S. monitors, installed on the north and south rims of the vent, were moving apart at a rapid rate. The vent had formed, in 1983, when an eruption of lava had hardened into a cinder cone—a hollow tower of rock, later named Puʻu ʻŌʻō. Now, magma was filling the cone and pressing against its walls. The last time that scientists had observed such a shift was in 2014, when magma had breached the cone and paved a thirteen-mile-long corridor through lush jungle, stopping just short of the town of Pahoa. The scientists foresaw a similar event and alerted county authorities. On the afternoon of April 30th, the molten center of Puʻu ʻŌʻō collapsed, as if a plug had been pulled from a drain. The magma flowed twenty miles east through underground dikes, causing earthquakes in a subdivision called Leilani Estates. The tremors were so frequent—hundreds in a matter of days—that Lee Begaye, a local resident, told me that it felt as though the ground were infested with giant snakes. Last Thursday, lava began to spurt from a crack in a street, and by the following day seven new fissures had opened in the neighborhood. Plumes of lava rose some three hundred feet into the air. By Friday morning, seventeen hundred residents had been evacuated from Leilani Estates and a nearby subdivision. Most took refuge with family or friends, but at least three hundred checked into emergency shelters, where they were given cots and bottled water. One shelter in Pahoa had been designated for people with pets, and the building soon filled with a menagerie of dogs and cats and a single, docile goose. I passed the day at the shelters interviewing evacuees. Janet Morrow, a stout, gray-haired woman in a sleeveless shirt and khaki shorts, told me that she had spent the night coaxing her animals into crates and gathering important documents. She had retired to Hawaii eighteen months ago—drawn, she said, to its “Gilligan’s Island feel.” Her house is miles from the fissures, so the lava didn’t concern her; rather, she had left home when authorities warned that a poisonous gas, sulfur dioxide, was creeping through the neighborhood. “It’d be kind of an adventure if it wasn’t for the animals,” Morrow said. Scientists said that the area would sprout new fissures, and lava could flow for weeks, if not months. Photograph from U.S. Geological Survey / NYT / Redux Among the evacuees were newcomers like Morrow, native Hawaiians, émigrés from the mainland and abroad who settled on the island decades ago, and a few tourists. A shelter volunteer, Karen Kane, told me that she had met two women who had come to attend a wedding. (“They got a free place to stay in Hawaii!” Kane said.) No one knew how long it would be before residents were allowed home—or if they would ever be able to return at all. Fire destroyed two houses that day and thirty-five others by Tuesday. Scientists said that the area would sprout new fissures, and lava could flow for weeks, if not months. If the volcano swallows Leilani Estates, it will not be the first time a neighborhood has disappeared in an eruption. In January, 1960, seismologists recorded more than a thousand earthquakes north of Kapoho, a town on the southeast tip of the island. The ground shook open; lava fountained from the cracks, subsuming the town within weeks. Then, in March, 1990, an eruption from Puʻu ʻŌʻō buried another town, called Kalapana. All the homes were destroyed except for one, belonging to a woman named Minnie Kaawaloa, whom a local paper described as an “ordained minister, master lauhala weaver and community matriarch.” Kilauea has been erupting above sea level for fifty thousand years, since before people arrived there, between the third and fifth century, and so the geology of the island is also its mythology. Native Hawaiians tend to believe in the volcano goddess, Tutu Pele, a powerful, spiteful daughter of Haumea, the earth mother. Her presence is felt everywhere on the island—in the towns and forests she consumes, in the rocky coastline she builds ever outward, and in the threads of volcanic glass called Pele’s hair, which she tosses from her cinder cones. On the day I visited the shelters, most people I met mentioned Pele. “It doesn’t surprise us,” Sergio Mamone said of the latest eruption. “We believe in Pele. She’s going to take what she wants.” Mamone was giving out plates of scrambled eggs and rice from his food truck, which he had parked near a shelter in Pahoa. He told me that, as a child, he had learned to swim in a natural pool called Queen’s Bath, where royal Hawaiians had once bathed. Locals mistreated the area, he said, “leaving rubbish all over,” and his elders warned him that Pele might punish them and “take it back.” In 1990, lava claimed the pool. As Mamone told me the story, his wife, Kalei, joined us. She said that newcomers to the island “would probably think it’s catastrophic, where for us, it’s just the way things are. We feel it’s her island, and we should let her flow over whatever she can flow over.” In 2014, when lava encroached on Pahoa, some residents suggested diverting the flow, as a town in Iceland had done, but others objected, believing the effort an insult to Pele. Many families took a deferential approach, setting out clippings of long, fibrous ti leaves, said to bring good luck. One cannot help but wonder why anyone would choose to live on the flank of an active volcano. Leilani Estates is located in a Lava Hazard Zone 1, which means that if you build there it is quite possible, if not inevitable, that your home will be destroyed. The main reason, perhaps, is economics. The Puna region, which includes Pahoa, Kapoho, Kalapana, and Leilani Estates, has among the lowest median home values in the Hawaiian island chain. When I called a realtor, Jessica Gauthier, who sells and manages properties in the subdivision, she told me that Puna has long been one of the most affordable districts in the state. “Housing on the Big Island is already a big issue,” she said. “As people are becoming more aware of beautiful places to live, local residents get pushed out, because people with more money come in.” The eruption, she believed, would make the housing situation even worse. Many families cannot afford to relocate. One man, Paul Campbell, who had lived in Leilani Estates for twenty-six years, told me that if he lost his house he believed he would end up homeless. And yet, Gauthier said, it did not surprise her that so many had chosen to live in the area. The forest is lush, the land has views of the ocean, and there is “something about the rawness of living on the side of the volcano,” she told me. “When you’re focussed on survival, you’re really attached to what’s important in life. The people. Nature. That’s why we stay.” And, though everyone who lived there knew the risk, it was easy to forget. Morrow told me, “I knew there was potential, but you get complacent.” Campbell said, “You don’t think about it until it comes. It just goes to show you nothing is permanent in this world.” I was parked in the lot of a shelter when an earthquake hit—a 5.4 on the Richter scale, a prelude to the 6.9 that would come an hour later. A van beside me rocked like a boat at sea, a baby fast asleep on a mattress in the back. The father was leaning on the hood, and when the ground settled, I stepped out to chat with him. He had a thin beard and large eyes and wore a T-shirt scrawled with the words “Fate Loves the Fearless.” His name was Cyrus Kapeli-Spencer, and he happened to be the grandson of Minnie Kaawaloa, whose home survived the 1990 eruption. He told me that, in 2006, her house had been in the path of another lava flow. That time, she had refused to evacuate. The local mayor begged her family to reason with her, and so Cyrus, who was ten at the time, went with his relatives to see his grandmother, who told them to prepare for Pele’s coming. They picked up trash, trimmed the ti leaves, built stone walls around her house. At last, his grandmother agreed to go. They watched the lava from a distance, and when it cooled, they hiked an hour across the flow. Once again, her house had been spared—a green island amid black stone. Kapeli-Spencer said that when his grandmother died, in 2014, at the age of ninety-one, her teeth were as white as milk. She brushed them with the husks of coconuts that still grew in the palms around her house.","Sierra Crane-Murdoch visits the Leilani Estates subdivision, near Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano, and talks to residents whose houses stand in the path of the lava.",2018-05-08T21:08:57Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Newyorker.com'}",Fleeing the Lava from Hawaii’s Kilauea Volcano,https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/fleeing-the-lava-from-hawaiis-kilauea-volcano,"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5af1e4c472aab327ab355b9b/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/Murdoch-Kilauea-Eruption-1.jpg",,Newyorker.com,Richter scale,0

Natalia Oelsner,"""What else can go wrong in Venezuela?"" Residents are asking themselves just this after a 7.3-magnitude earthquake shook the country’s eastern coast on Tuesday. While there were no casualties or major damage, Venezuelans are aware of just how close disaster struck. Venezuela's economic turmoil has led to severe shortages in food and medical supplies, including basic products such as milk. As a way to deal with the situation, Venezuelan Twitter users decided to poke fun at the situation with memes. ""There is no food, no medicine, currency conversion, (minimum) salary is 1800 (bolivares) — roughly €155 — Maduro still in power, civil registry office doesn't work, and now it shakes!"" Other people decided to joke about the country's worsening situation by using the hashtag #earthquake. ""Us: 'ok, nothing worse can happen to the country.' Earthquake: (image) "" ""Which is the country with the worst luck?"" ""And what does the Venezuela landscape look like right now?"" Other tweets poked fun at the new currency introduced by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that got rid of five 0s to battle hyperinflation and the deepening economic crisis. ""Colombia: earthquake with a 7.7 magnitude according to the Richter magnitude scale. Venezuela: earthquake of 0.00077 Richter Soberanos (the new currency is called Bolivar Soberano)."" ""Inflation in Venezuela is so bad that the 7.3 magnitude earthquake has turned into 78093.3. The strongest in history.""

"Marshall Shepherd, Contributor, Marshall Shepherd, Contributor https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/","One of my favorite musical artists is Prince. He had a song on the brilliant &amp;quot;Sign O' The Times&amp;quot; CD called Housequake. Prince lived in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I wonder if he ever heard of a frost quake. The Polar Vortex is dominating the headlines from so many angles. Here is another one for you. It is being reported that frost quakes are being reported in Chicago as a result of the Polar Vortex. It is not that I am psychic, but I know that many of you are asking, &amp;quot;What in the world is a frost quake?&amp;quot; Here is the answer.Current soil temperatures in the MidwestMRCC
The scientific term for a &amp;quot;frost quake&amp;quot; is cryoseism. My Forbes colleague Robin Andrews wrote about frost quakes recently but I wanted to dive more into the science.&amp;nbsp;The root words give you a clue. According to Merriam-Webster's online dictionary the word &amp;quot;seism&amp;quot; is a less common word for the &amp;quot;earthquake&amp;quot; (picture above). The word &amp;quot;cry&amp;quot; is associated with cold or extreme cold. With this foundation, you may be putting some things together, but let's do it formally. During winter or very cold outbreaks, the temperatures can cool rapidly from above 32 degrees F to below freezing. With the most recent Polar Vortex infusion of cold air, temperatures have been well into minus values in the Midwest and wind chills were in the -60 to -70 degree F range.&amp;nbsp;By the way, what does a minus temperature mean anyhow? You never see length given as -10 kilometers or mass as -50 grams. That is meaningless. The Kelvin scale is a temperature scale that has no negative values but I digress. Let's get back to frost quakes.
When the temperatures plunge rapidly below freezing, subsurface water can freeze and expand. According to a 2015 paper by Steven Battaglia and David Shannon in Weatherwise magazine,
The subsurface ice continues to expand as the temperature cools because water molecules, upon cooling, arrange themselves into a structure that takes up more volume than when the molecules were arranged in a liquid. This continuous expansion imposes a large amount of stress on the local surrounding frozen soil and rock around the ice. The surrounding frozen surface can withstand the increase in pressure from the expansion of ice for a while, but not for as long at very low temperatures and high pressures. Once the pressure is too great, it is relieved violentlya fracture on the surface forms and a loud, explosive noise echoes within the proximity of the breakage!
That's what a frost quake is. You may also see the term ice quake used to describe a cryoseism. Ironically, like the Polar Vortex, these terms are not new. You may not have heard of them until now. If you look at the graphic above, current soil temperatures in the Midwest are well below 32 degrees F in many places.
By the way, some people often report seeing flashes of light with cryoseisms. What in the world is that about? John Ebel addressed this question during an interview with the The Weather Notebook many years ago:
there are electrical changes that happen in rocks when they get squeezed. And of course earthquakes are really due to squeezing and then release of that pressure as the rock cracks and moves. And that can explain the earthquake light and lightning type effects that we see.&amp;quot;
While cryoseisms are somewhat uncommon in the popular literature (until now), people that live in very cold climates may be more familiar with them. A recent paper in the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences documented some of the larger lake-associated ice quakes (ML 2.0). Yep, cryoseisms can be measured using the same scale referenced in more common earthquakes. Most people are familiar with the &amp;quot;Richter scale,&amp;quot; but there is a bit more to the discussion. According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) website,
The magnitude is a number that characterizes the relative size of an earthquake. Magnitude is based on measurement of the maximum motion recorded by a seismograph. Several scales have been defined, but the most commonly used are (1) local magnitude (ML), commonly referred to as &amp;quot;Richter magnitude&amp;quot;, (2) surface-wave magnitude (Ms), (3) body-wave magnitude (Mb), and (4) moment magnitude (Mw).
Since we are throwing around new terms today, another term that you may not be familiar with is frost heave. This is a process in which ground moves upward in response to the seasonal freeze and thaw of the ground. The picture below is an example discussed in a report by the state of Maryland.

Sarah Sluis,"Neal Richter will present on the state of Ads.cert at AdExchanger's upcoming Programmatic IO New York conference on Oct. 15-16. Programmatic auctions are growing up and cleaning up. Improvements to programmatic technology are a critical part of that transformation. Ads.txt, rolled out last year, allows buyers to verify that theyre buying the inventory they think they are like a consumer no longer fooled by counterfeit Rolexes. Ads.cert takes verification a step further, using a cryptographic signature in the bid request, like a certificate validating a real Rolex. The move cuts out hawkers of fake inventory. While Ads.txt and Ads.cert help marketers buy impressions that will reach real users in the places where theyre consuming content, they dont help make the auctions fair. Neal Richter, chief architect of the Rakuten Marketing Platform, co-chair of the openRTB committee for the IAB Tech Lab, as well as the winner of its service excellence award, talked to AdExchanger about the role technology plays in programmatics growing up process. AdExchanger: How do programmatic auction mechanics need to change? NEAL RICHTER: OpenRTB creates a well-described protocol for bid request and response. Whats missing is a rigorous definition of how the auction works. In the beginning, that was straightforward. Then private marketplaces were added, and header bidding came in, and first-price auctions, and you have wrapper timing and bid caching. There needs to be well-defined auction rules with some guardrails for innovation. Other markets, like real estate, have guidelines on how to do a multi-participant auction how to accept a bid, the terms and conditions and I think we are missing that. Are first-price auctions here to stay? The second-price auction isnt incentive-compatible with header bidding. If you are running an SSP, you have incentive to push the clearing price of the auction up so you can win the subsequent header bidding auction. Second-price auctions will only work in prescribed environments where you know the rules and the rules are consistent. How could guidelines around auction transparency be created? One of the best ways to represent how an auction should work is in code. The reality is that each SSP and exchange has its own code [to govern] how the auction works. The exchanges tend to publish notes or documentation in their help center on how the auction works. The issue is that, while readable, theyre not always rigorous in describing the mechanics. If you look at questions that came up with [Googles] enhanced dynamic allocation, there were a lot of broad opinions on how that was working, and documentation wasnt always as clear as it could be. If marketers are going to have an extreme amount of trust, and the open market is going to have a place in media plans, [auction mechanics] do need to be more well-described. Prebid.orgs code of conduct is a start. Can a code of conduct, like the one in Prebid, ensure auction mechanics are transparent? Prebid is a piece of open-source code that defines how the header auction works, and multiple parties can inspect it. A lot of its code of conduct has to do with the fact that if you are going to use the software, you have to use it as designed and not to make alterations to give one participant an advantage over another and put the thumb on the scale. What holes remain to make programmatic completely trustworthy? A marketer values an impression the most. Ads.cert is a mechanism to sign an event. Were starting with bid requests, yet the impression event doesnt have a lot of natural security right now. If we move to signed impressions, advertisers will only be charged if the ad landed in the place they intended. Are there any other murky parts of the programmatic auction that marketers should be aware of? You have all this third-party data in an ecosystem with an unknown provenance. It becomes a data science problem to figure out how predictive it is, and you rely on the brand of the data you are using. Transparency into data sources, provenance and efficacy of data needs work. At Rakuten Marketing, we are about helping advertisers find shoppers, and thats our value proposition. One of the things we care about is having a high efficacy of the users we target. Does Ads.cert use blockchain? What role does blockchain play in bringing transparency to programmatic? Ads.cert is built on a mechanism for cryptography that is also used on blockchain, so they have some technology in common. In general, I have not seen that many solid use cases for how blockchain can be used to increase transparency in real-time bidding. The community of CTOs has looked at the technology and had questions for how it will scale for a real-time bidding approach handling a hundred billion events a day. Where do you think programmatic is on its growing up journey? Private marketplaces are continuing to grow. Two parties enter into a deal, and using the backbone of programmatic to get it done, but sidestep all these transparency questions. I think private marketplaces continue to increase. Where inventory or audience is scarce, the open auction isnt the best mechanism. The big place where programmatic will grow up is video. As humans, we are using our phones to consume video content and singing up for streaming services, and that naturally lends itself to programmatic advertising to show a more targeted ad. I think thats the next phase. We need to duplicate a lot of those [programmatic] mechanisms, and make the Wild Wild West stuff that happened in display not happen in TV.

By Smoove B,"Girl, you know I would do whatever it takes to make all your fantasies come true. I would cross a continent. I would cross an ocean. I would even tunnel to the center of the Earth just so I could find that one perfect gemstone, lobster, or ball of lava that would turn an ordinary night into an evening of ultimate perfection. However, things are tight financially right now due to some unexpected expenses after I turned my apartment’s color scheme from scarlet red to ivory white with pops of violet. I think we can both agree my penthouse is seriously bumpin’. Yet the fact remains I don’t have as much liquid cash on hand as I would like. I also made some poor investments. This in no way means I will not please that booty. Instead, it means that there will have to be some regrettable but necessary cutbacks to our evening. Do not believe for one second that you will not feel like a queen. You will simply feel like a queen of a less prosperous country. If anything, my desire is greater than ever before. If my love for you could be measured by the Richter scale, the intensity of my affection would be off the charts, leveling the tri-state area to powder. The rescue teams brought in to find the injured would be swallowed up by the Earth during the aftershocks. There would be no survivors. This is how serious my love for you is. Let me break down how this evening will go. First, my normal gleaming-white limo and backup Humvee limo will not be showing up to pick you up. I can no longer afford to keep them both on retainer, and my man at the garage says they are not available this week. We will, instead, be driven to our destination in a 2017 four-door Cadillac, which, I was told, was cleaned very recently so it will look and smell very nice. Once I return to my seat after opening your door for you in a gentlemanly fashion, I will compliment you on your face and hair. I will say something like, “Your face and hair look very fine tonight.” You will be able to tell from the tone of my voice that this is true. I will then reach into my cooler and hand you a chilled glass of cava. This is like champagne except it is from Spain and not France. We are blessed to have three Spanish food and wine importers in our city, and this vintage is the finest available. I went to all three. Since the days are now long, I thought I would use this occasion to take you on a romantic picnic. I know the most romantic spot this city has to offer. It may not be the finest and most expensive restaurant in the city, but you will be able to take a picture of us at this spot and use the hashtag #MyManTreatsMeRight or #SmooveNightOut or just simply #Bliss and mean it. This spot is so good you will want to freak me wild right there. This will be especially true as I offer you another glass of either cava or prosecco, which is from Italy but is also sparkling and quite good. You know I do not mess with wine without bubbles. I should point out that I will not have my finest crystal champagne flutes on hand as I am concerned that they may be crushed by an unexpected fit of passion or stolen by raccoons with exquisite taste. I will then take out the foods that will make up our meal. This will consist of a staggering array of cheeses, crackers, and three varieties of grapes. I will also have a variety of fresh herbs, smoked salmon, and a jar of something very closely resembling foie gras. This will also probably come from Spain or Italy. I will also bring those candles that repel bugs. Once we have had our fill of cheeses, soulful glances, and light, playful banter that will in no way be forced, we will clean up our picnic area. You may think that we are done with our outdoor adventure, but we are not. I will take you by the hand and walk you through the forest. You will cling to me, as the many sounds and movements will frighten and startle you. I will not say anything, but my confident stride will assure you that I know which path is safe to take. I will also have a very good flashlight. Soon, we will arrive at a clearing that rests on top of a hill. This hill will overlook a drive-in movie theater, which will be playing the most romantic movie France had to offer last year. Once we have placed a blanket down on the soft grass, sat down, and opened another bottle of cava or prosecco, we will hold each other tight and watch the film from atop this very romantic vantage point. I will gently stroke your hair in a way that will not mess it up. Also, I will use an app on my phone to play the movie’s audio. Again, you may want me to hit you doggy style at this time, but I will not. This will be to heighten our sexual tension, which will be brought even higher by both the movie and the romantic location. After the movie is completed, we will call another car service to pick us up. I will hold you tightly from behind and whisper things into your ear like “You are my queen” and “I could never love another woman.” If you think I will run out of things to whisper into your ears while we wait, you have sorely underestimated this Love Man. Once the car has returned us to my penthouse apartment, I will lead you to the bathroom. It is there I will draw you a hot bath and clean you with expensive soaps and the finest wash clothes Turkey has to offer. These were purchased in bulk during a more prosperous time, and I am glad to use them on my very special lady. Once your amazing body has been cleansed and dried, I will lead you to my bedroom where I will begin to pleasure you in ways that will make you forget any small inconvenience during our evening out. Our love will know no bounds. We will be like exotic animals on the run from love poachers who want to shoot us, but do not realize that every shot they fire will give us more sexual passion and energy than before. Soon, however, they will use nets, which will allow them to catch us, and then later mount our heads on their walls. Other hunters, from the most exciting lands in the world, will gaze upon our erotic visages, drink scotch, and listen to the thrilling tale of our love. Now is also when I will finally hit you doggy style. In the morning, I will prepare a breakfast for you that will be both cooked and served in cast-iron skillets. These will have the finest and most colorful potatoes available, along with cheese and chorizo from that meat market where the employees have either long beards, arm tattoos, or both. This breakfast will be the perfect way to start your day. You will need the calories. Once you are ready to leave, I will walk down with you to help you find a cab. If you give me a day or two, I would be happy to reimburse you for this via Venmo. Times may be tight, but Smoove will always pay for his lady’s cab fare home. Smoove out.","Girl, you know I would do whatever it takes to make all your fantasies come true. I would cross a continent. I would cross an ocean.

Justin Bachman,"Forty two years ago, the U.S. landed its first Mars probe on the red planet. Ever since Viking I touched down, NASA has sent a series of increasingly sophisticated rovers and orbiters to study our neighbor’s features and atmosphere. But that’s all been skin-deep. None of those craft have ever gotten too deep into the place. This weekend, NASA is launching a machine designed to study Mars at a much more foundational level, helping to fill large gaps in scientists’ understanding of the planet’s geologic structure, composition and seismic activity. Mars InSight, scheduled to land later this year, is the first NASA mission to study the red planet’s interior or, as the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory phrases it, “the vital signs of Mars.” (InSight stands for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport.) The launch is set for 4:05 a.m. PDT Saturday from Vandenberg Air Force Base in central California aboard an Atlas V rocket, with a two-hour daily launch window. It will become the first NASA deep-space mission sent from the West Coast. The 794-pound lander, built by Lockheed Martin Corp., is set to touch down Nov. 26 after a six-month cruise and a six-minute re-entry and descent—the most perilous aspect of the journey. For scientists, one principal question looms over the work InSight will perform: How did Earth and Mars become so radically different, given that each was formed of the same intergalactic “stuff” about 4.5 billion years ago? Mars presents an interesting geologic specimen to study rocky planet formation because of its “Goldilocks” size: It’s sizable enough that it experienced the same early processes as Earth and Venus during its formation, but it’s small enough to have retained a record of those processes deep within. Unlike Mars, Earth has active tectonic plates and convection that carries heat from the core outward, moving around the mantle layer. One InSight instrument will dig 5 meters (16 feet) into the subsurface to measure heat from the interior. “It’s really a science of understanding the early solar system … how planets formed,” Bruce Banerdt, InSight’s principal investigator from JPL, said Thursday during a news briefing. But even without plates, Mars on occasion rumbles—with marsquakes—another geologic phenomenon that InSight investigators want to study. NASA’s twin Viking landers from the summer of 1976 had seismometers to detect marsquakes but those were atop the craft and produced “noisy data,” according to JPL. The InSight instrument will be on the ground and is expected to yield much more insight into such phenomenon, which are thought to be smaller than 6.0 on the Richter scale, given that Mars doesn’t have the same plate structure as Earth. Seismic activity on Mars is thought to be from cracks forming in the crust, with the planet’s interior energy expected to be lower than Earth’s. The Atlas V will also launch two small CubeSats that will trail InSight to Mars to test deep-space communications technology. The launch is the first time such small sats, about the size of a briefcase, have flown in deep space. Amid the heady science and bevy of “firsts” for this mission, it’s worth noting that Mars missions have a spotty success rate of only about 40 percent, given the distance and many perils associated with entry, descent and landing.","Mars InSight will be the first time the space agency probes the crust, mantle and core of a planet that looms large in future human exploration.",2018-05-04T13:55:21Z,"{'id': 'bloomberg', 'name': 'Bloomberg'}",NASA Blasts Off to Study Marsquakes,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-04/nasa-blasts-off-to-study-marsquakes,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iLKFy9FOxqUE/v1/1200x800.jpg,bloomberg,Bloomberg,Richter scale,0

Reuters,"The Sunday night earthquake was felt in at least seven provinces of Iran, but most strongly in Kermanshah. (Source: Google Maps) A 6.3 magnitude earthquake on Iran’s western border with Iraq injured more than 600 people, most suffering minor wounds, state television said on Monday, but no fatalities had been reported. The Sunday night earthquake was felt in at least seven provinces of Iran, but most strongly in Kermanshah, where last year more than 600 people were killed and thousands injured in Iran’s deadliest earthquake in more than a decade. “The number of wounded people has reached 646 … Most of them were not hospitalised because of the slight injuries,” TV quoted officials as saying. The head of Iran’s Red Crescent Society, Mahmoud Mohammadi Nasab, told TV that there were no fatalities. TV aired footage of damaged houses in the town of Sarpol-e Zahab, where some people still remain homeless following last years 7.3 magnitude earthquake. Iran’s state news agency said two earthquakes measuring 5.2 and 4.6 on the Richter scale jolted Sarpol-e Zahab on Monday morning. Fears of aftershocks forced many people to spend the night out in the streets in cold weather. The quake triggered landslides in some areas, but Iranian authorities said rescue teams had access to all towns and villages. Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. In 2003, a 6.6 magnitude quake in Kerman province killed 31,000 people and flattened the historic city of Bam. Sunday’s tremor was also felt in Kuwait and the Iraqi capital Baghdad as well as in Erbil in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region and other Iraqi provinces, but no damage was reported.","The quake triggered landslides in some areas, but Iranian authorities said rescue teams had access to all towns and villages.

Gargi Verma,"While no loss of life or limb was reported, several structures developed cracks in the area, civic authorities said. (Archive)
AN EARTHQUAKE of 4.3 magnitude on the Richter Scale was recorded at Dahanu in Palghar Friday morning. The epicentre of the quake was around 27 km from Dhundalwadi village and was felt over a wide region, including in around 35 villages in Dahanu. This was biggest earthquake experienced in the area till date, said officials.
While no loss of life or limb was reported, several structures developed cracks in the area, civic authorities said. According to disaster management teams, tremors were also felt in Silvassa, Umbargaon and several other villages in Gujarat, all the way to the exterior areas of Vapi.
Dahanu Tehsildar Rahul Sarang said the earthquake hit at 11.14 am. The officials were having a meeting at Tawa village, Sarang added, when the earthquake hit. We could feel it and it went on for some seconds. Right after, we mobilised our teams, a civic official said.We have 14 teams patrolling the area. This was the biggest earthquake till now, Sarang said.
It was a shallow earthquake, said officials. The depth of the epicentre below the ground determines if it is a shallow, mid-focus or intermediate-level quake. This tremor originated hardly 5 km underground and travelled farther, said an officer from the disaster management team. He said, The depth can determine the amount of damage, but we dont have enough data to say how much of a factor it plays here. There have been around 700 tremors in Dahanu since January, Sarang said. Most of them are too light to be felt, but we have been feeling at least a couple of tremors every day.

Samudra Gupta Kashyap,"Bearings under two vital girders of the 56-year old Saraighat Bridge on the Brahmaputra here, which are believed to have got tilted during a major earthquake in September 2009, were finally repaired and put in place after a gap of more than eight years, with the Northeast Frontier Railway claiming it to be a record of sorts. “Engineers of NF Railway created a record of sorts when they carried out rectification of the bearing arrangements of the iconic Saraighat Bridge during a three-hour traffic block on January 12. Bearings are the arrangement by which the bridge rests on the piers (pillars). They not only link the bridge girders to the pillars but also facilitate the lateral movement of the bridge as a result of expansion etc,” NF Railway CPRO Pranav Jyoti Sharma said here on Tuesday. Though the railway authorities are not exactly sure how the bearings got tilted, the suspicion is that it was a major earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale that had occurred on September 21, 2009 that had caused the damage. “It was probably during the 6.1 Richter scale earthquake of September 21, 2009, that the bearings under two end girders got tilted. While this was not considered unsafe, the bearings in fact needed proper rectifications,” Sharma said. While the bridge was kept under round-the-clock observation for more than eight years, the railways kept it a closely-guarded secret so that there was no panic at any time. Train speed was kept at a maximum of 45 kmph since then, with the railways looking for the right opportunity to set things right. “Rectification of the bearings was indeed a herculean task as the ends of the bridge girders were to be lifted by about 10 centimetres. Such work was never taken up earlier. The team of engineers of Northeast Frontier Railway however readily accepted this challenge, and after a thorough research and design that took several years, they decided that the tilted bearings of this bridge would be rectified,” CPRO Sharma said. The 1.492-km rail-cum bridge in Guwahati that is aptly named Saraighat Bridge – after the historic Battle of Saraighat of 1671 in which the Assamese had defeated the Moghuls – is the first bridge on the Brahmaputra, and was hurriedly opened for military use during the Chinese aggression of November 1962 even before it was formally inaugurated. CPRO Sharma said that while necessary preparations were made to deal with all kinds of possible adverse situations that could occur so as to avoid disruption to this vital connectivity, the engineers not only arranged requisite bearing members but also heavy duty 500-ton capacity lifting jacks and other machinery. “While rail and road traffic on the bridge was suspended for two hours to conduct the operation smoothly, two separate teams of engineers and skilled workers were deployed on both sides for rectification of bearings. Hydraulic and mechanical jacks were installed under the railway girders. With the help of these jacks, the railway girders were lifted as required,” he said. The engineers worked on a war-footing, first removing the bearings from their place and then installing them back to the correct inclination after cleaning. “After ensuring correct position of the bearings, the bridge girders were slowly lowered back to their original position. Simultaneously, as road surface was brought back to original level, the rail track was also re-fixed, all within three hours,” the CPRO said. He also said that while two additional 500-ton hydraulic jacks and two 100-ton mechanical jacks were kept ready as a back-up measure, the engineers also kept in mind what to do in the event of an earthquake occurring during the three-hour operation. “To prepare for the worst scenario of an earthquake occurring during the work execution, that is when the bridge would be in lifted condition, the girders were tied with cables with fixed structures,” Sharma said.

The Star Online,"JAKARTA: All Malaysian students in Sulawesi are safe as many are located far away from Kota Palu and Donggala, which were devastated by a massive 7.5 Richter scale earthquake on Friday. According to Malaysian education and culture attache in Indonesia Mohd Mubarak Shamsuddin, there were 286 students studying in Universitas Hassanuddin and two others at the High School for Knowledge and Language in Makasar in south Sulawesi. “The distance from Kota Makassar is about 700km. No other Malaysians are affected because the affected areas are not tourist spots,” Bernama reported him as saying here yesterday. The Malaysian Embassy in Indonesia is currently working with the country’s authorities to get the latest information on the disaster, which has so far killed nearly 400 people on the island. The powerful quake, which hit just after 6pm local time, churned out 3m-high tsunami waves that swept into coastal villages along the Palu beach in Sulawesi, which is located east of Borneo. The island is known for its coral reefs and dive sites. The tremor is the latest to hit Indonesia which was also struck by earthquakes in Bali and Lombok, where a Malaysian was among those killed, a few months ago. Thousands of homes and buildings were reportedly damaged in the quake while the electricity supply and communications network had been cut off in parts of the island, making it difficult to establish contact and information. Indonesian agency Antara reported that thousands were still believed to be trapped under the rubble. In Kuala Terengganu, Deputy Housing and Local Government Minister Datuk Raja Kamarul Bahrin Shah Raja Ahmad Baharuddin Shah said Malaysia would send aid, including manpower, materials and food items for the victims there. He also said the ministry was still monitoring the situation and the damage due to the disaster.","JAKARTA: All Malaysian students in Sulawesi are safe as many are located far away from Kota Palu and Donggala, which were devastated by a massive 7.5 Richter scale earthquake on Friday.",2018-09-29T16:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Thestar.com.my'}",Malaysian students in quake-ravaged Sulawesi are safe For more stories:,http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/09/30/malaysian-students-in-quakeravaged-sulawesi-are-safe-for-more-stories/,https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/newTsol_logo_socmedia.png?v=2018930,,Thestar.com.my,Richter scale,0
Tyler Durden,"A crypto-Christmas miracle? Bitcoin is now unchanged from the pre-Friday bloodbath, having scrambled higher for the last 24-48 hours as much of the world enjoyed a day off. The entire crypto space is rallying once again today but the question remains, is this another dead cat bounce on the way to 'zero' or is Tom Lee, John McAfee, and Mike Novgratz right, this is a bump in the road to $40k and beyond... As The Economic Collapse's Michael Snyder notes, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and other major cryptocurrencies have been on a wild ride this year, and over the past 10 days the volatility that we have witnessed in the marketplace has been absolutely breathtaking. On December 17th, Bitcoin shot above $19,800 for a brief moment before it started plummeting dramatically. At one point the price of Bitcoin dipped below $11,000, which represented close to a 45 percent decline from the record high that it had hit just five days earlier. And Bitcoin was far from alone – virtually every other major cryptocurrency was also down between 25 and 50 percent during that five day period. But now almost all of them are bouncing back, and at this moment the price of Bitcoin is $14,219.99. So where do things go from here? There are many that believe that in the short-term the price of Bitcoin will fall back toward the actual cost of production. It has been estimated that the cost to produce a new Bitcoin is currently between three and four thousand dollars, and with the price of Bitcoin so high there is a tremendous incentive for Bitcoin miners to produce as many as possible right now. But there are others that are convinced that Bitcoin could eventually go to zero … Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette and his team sent a research note to clients a few days ago suggesting that the real value of bitcoin might be … $0. That’s zero dollars. (Bitcoin stood at around $14,400 at the time of writing.) To back up his assessment, Faucette made the following arguments… Can Bitcoin be valued like a currency? No. There is no interest rate associated with Bitcoin. Like digital gold? Maybe. Does not have any intrinsic use like gold has in electronics or jewelry. But investors appear to be ascribing some value to it. Is it a payment network? Yes but it is tough to scale and does not charge a transaction fee. Faucette also pointed out that the number of online retailers that accept Bitcoin is actually falling. Five of the top 500 e-commerce merchants accepted Bitcoin during the first quarter of 2016, but now only three still do. In order for Bitcoin to have a sustainable long-term future, it must become a real currency that is widely used, but many would argue that it is already being surpassed by better and newer options. In fact, one top cryptocurrency expert recent stated that the old Bitcoin network “is as good as unusable” … Emil Oldenburg, the co-founder of Bitcoin.com – one of the world’s largest sites devoted to the cryptocurrency – recently called the cryptocurrency the “most risky investment you can make,” after he switched to bitcoin cash, which he considers to be the future. ""The old bitcoin network is as good as unusable,” said in an interview with Swedish tech site Breakit. That certainly doesn’t sound promising, but so far that hasn’t stopped the price of Bitcoin from heading into the stratosphere. So far in 2017 the price of Bitcoin has risen more than 1,400%, and that number is extremely impressive no matter how you look at it. Of course virtually all of that “digital wealth” could disappear in just a matter of days during a major crash. The CEO of Patriarch Equity, Eric Schiffer, believers that Bitcoin investments are eventually heading for “a thermonuclear death” … “I think bitcoin is a ‘tower of death,’” Schiffer says. “It is going to result in the imminent death of your investment – a thermonuclear death. “Right now we are looking at a financial bubble that is bigger than the tulip craze and I believe that we are headed for a bitcoin crash that will supersede any financial worries of the 21st century,” he added. “People are going to be shocked when they try to liquify their bitcoins.” Schiffer might be right. After all, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies don’t have any intrinsic value. Essentially, they are nothing more than digital creations that only have value because people think they have value. But those that got in back at the beginning and have cashed out now have made enormous amounts of money, and nobody can deny that. With every form of “investing”, they are winners and there are losers. Unfortunately, those that chose to jump in at the height of the madness could end up losing very big. The following comes from Wolf Richter … Betting on cryptos is a peculiar form of online gambling on a global scale that requires a consensus among participants that they only buy, and that you cannot ever cash out, and now that some folks are trying to cash out, the bets for everyone else are souring. The same dynamics that pushed prices up have reversed and are causing them to crash. But what if the naysayers are wrong? What if this current “Bitcoin crash” is just a bump in the road on the way to $40,000? Years ago, the price of Bitcoin crashed 75 percent at one point. What would have happened if the early investors had all bailed out then instead of holding on until now? Those that sold Bitcoin at $12,000 might end up really kicking themselves if the price of Bitcoin does hit $40,000 by the end of next year, and that is exactly what some top experts are projecting … Billionaire investors and highly respected analysts including hedge fund investor Mike Novogratz, prominent financial analyst Max Keiser, and Fundstrat’s Tom Lee stated that the price of bitcoin will likely surpass the $40,000 margin by the end of 2018, and achieve a $1 trillion market cap. And let us not forget that big names such as John McAfee and James Altucher are predicting that the price of Bitcoin will eventually reach one million dollars. To me, this is absolutely fascinating. On the one side, you have financial experts that believe that Bitcoin is going to zero, and on the other side you have financial experts that are projecting that someday a single Bitcoin will be worth one million dollars. I don’t know which side will ultimately prevail, but it will be a lot of fun to watch how everything plays out. * * * Michael Snyder is a Republican candidate for Congress in Idaho’s First Congressional District, and you can learn how you can get involved in the campaign on his official website.

"Anna Shiryaevskaya, Fred Pals, Mathew Carr","The tremor that rattled windows in a densely populated part of northwest Europe this week also shook the production plans for the region’s biggest natural gas field and market prices. Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij BV, a venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp. that previously appealed Dutch government decisions to cut production from the Groningen field, on Wednesday proposed a “substantial reduction” in output. It also suggested shutting in two of the field’s four areas, which accounted for about 5 percent of last year’s total output. The proposal, which sent wholesale prices higher and will need to be finalized by the Dutch government, comes after an earthquake on Monday measuring 3.4 on the Richter scale linked to extraction in the region, the biggest tremor since August 2012. The number of earthquakes linked to gas production had been waning after previous output cuts. “Output needs to be lowered. The question is how quickly it can be done,” Eric Wiebes, the economy minister who’s also in charge of the nation’s gas production, said late Wednesday at a New Year’s event in Groningen. “We need to look at how it can be done at the quickest pace possible.” QuickTake Q&amp;A: Earth-Shaking Woes at Europe’s Biggest Gas Field Parliament will debate the earthquake and gas extraction next week. The issue of damage to housing from gas extraction won’t be resolved at short notice and “miracles” shouldn’t be expected, Wiebes said. Gas for the winter of 2018-19 in the U.K., a European benchmark, jumped 2.2 percent Wednesday on the ICE Futures Europe exchange, its biggest daily increase in a month, and was little changed on Thursday. Winter gas in the Netherlands rose 1.2 percent Thursday, extending its weekly gain to 3.2 percent, broker data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Economy Minister should shut in six of Groningen’s 20 clusters, NAM said in a statement. The areas produced a total of 1.2 billion cubic meters of gas last year, NAM data show. “Production has been reduced significantly over the past three years,” said Angela Miller, a trader at Inenco Group Ltd. in Lytham, England. “Further production cuts would bring security of supply issues into play but the Netherlands has to weigh this up against environmental concerns.” While the field is now allowed to produce 21.6 billion cubic meters (760 billion cubic feet) a year, or about half the level in 2014, the four parties in the ruling coalition government already agreed to further cuts. Groningen is important because it produces a less rich form of gas that networks from France to Germany rely on and that isn’t easily replaced without special converter facilities. Progressive Decline Annual gas output from the Groningen gas field under new rules Source: NAM data Dutch Groningen Gas Field Production Plan Ruled Insufficient The Netherlands would have to resort to other supply sources to make up for the further decline in production. “If we cut production at too short notice, we will end up watching our televisions at 6 degrees Celsius (43 Fahrenheit),” Wiebes said Wednesday. — With assistance by Joost Akkermans, and Wout Vergauwen",The tremor that rattled windows in a densely populated part of northwest Europe this week also shook the production plans for the region’s biggest natural gas field and market prices.,2018-01-11T10:46:42Z,"{'id': 'bloomberg', 'name': 'Bloomberg'}",EU Gas Feels Dutch Tremors as Biggest Field Proposes Further Cut,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-10/biggest-dutch-quake-since-2012-spurs-move-to-increase-gas-cuts,https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iuEHZ3BarLEw/v1/1200x800.jpg,bloomberg,Bloomberg,Richter scale,0

The largest in the swarm so far, which hit Tuesday afternoon, measured a 2.7 on the Richter scale — a magnitude that University of Nevada, Reno seismologist Ken Smith described as “pretty small.” ""You'd have to be right above it to really feel anything,"" he said, noting they've gotten a few dozen reports from people who've felt the jolts. While earthquakes in Northern Nevada are commonplace (The Silver State is the third-most seismically active state in the nation), Smith said he and his colleagues at UNR’s Nevada Seismological Laboratory pay special attention to earthquake swarms. Swarms of small earthquakes can sometimes act as pseudo warning systems for larger events to come. Smith said there’s no telling if this swarm will die off or yield something larger. “But if they do, we want to be on top of it,” he said. “In a way it’s kind of a heads up.” Two of Reno’s more recent seismic events, a 2013 magnitude 4.4 temblor in Spanish Springs and the 2008 magnitude 4.7 in Mogul/Somersett were both preceded by hundreds of small earthquakes. This swarm is tightly clustered underneath a patch of land situated between the I-580 and Old U.S. 395, about 1.4 miles from Galena High School. Social media commenters, reacting to stories initially reporting the swarm last week, pointed out that the swarm is located in the same area as the Ormat Steamboat Geothermal Power Plant. The activities of geothermal plants, which tap into hot water pockets beneath the Earth’s crust to create electricity, have been linked to seismic events in the past. But Smith said there’s no evidence the swarm is associated with the plant. The 200-plus earthquakes in this swarm are occurring six to seven kilometers below the ground, far deeper than the Ormat plant’s activities. It’s unclear as to what exact fault system is producing this swarm, but Smith said the South Reno region — especially near the mountain range — frequently gets a little shaky. Faults in the area produced sizable quakes as recently as 2015. That seismic event, known as the “Thomas Creek Sequence,” produced a series of magnitude 3.0’s that culminated with a magnitude 4.0. Smith said people living in Northern Nevada need to be prepared for the smaller, more commonplace, earthquakes just as much as they’d be prepared for the “big one.” “Everyone is worried about the big one, but it doesn’t take the big one to knock over your water heater and empty out your shelves,” he said. Smith said strapping down your water heater and securing bookcases to walls are simple things you can do to prepare. Though the largest temblor hit Tuesday afternoon, it appears the South Reno swarm is slowing down.

A. O. SCOTT,"Koons is by some calculations not all of them strictly monetary the most successful artist of our time, a consummate self-marketer who brazenly celebrates the commodification of art. It would be easy enough for Kahn to treat him as a villain, but instead he suggest a witty comparison between Koons and an artist whose last name happens to rhyme with his. Larry Poons lives in a peeling clapboard farmhouse far from Sothebys. A star in the 60s and 70s, he has fallen out of fashion but has continued to paint, indifferent to trends and less bitter than you might expect. As Koons unveils a partnership with Louis Vuitton, Poons plans a comeback exhibition at Yares Art, an old-fashioned gallery show of colorful, large-scale abstract canvases. At roughly the same time, Sothebys is preparing to auction a collection of paintings that includes work by Condo, Gerhard Richter, Willem de Kooning and other blue-chip names. It also includes a painting by Njideka Akunyili Crosby, a Los Angeles-based, Nigerian-born artist whose reputation is growing. Her presence, like Poonss, presents an implicit argument against the cynical view that money and celebrity have corrupted hard work and aesthetic value. Even so, the sums commanded by the de Koonings and the Richters are staggering, and their disappearance into private collections feels like a blow to the idea of a democratic culture. Jerry Saltz, the Pulitzer Prize-winning art critic for New York magazine, regrets that he is unlikely to see the auctioned-off work again in his lifetime. Im sad to be saying goodbye, he says. Equal parts gadfly and cheerleader, Saltz is the playful conscience of The Price of Everything, a role he can play partly because he has no money on the table. But if the artists are the heroes, the auctioneers, collectors and dealers arent exactly the villains. Their acquisitiveness might be an expression of love.","This documentary examines the global art market, and pauses to look at some pictures along the way.",2018-10-16T16:04:15Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Review: ‘The Price of Everything’ Asks $56 Billion Questions About Art,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/movies/the-price-of-everything-review-documentary.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/19/arts/19priceofeverything/19priceofeverything-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Richter scale,0
Tom Cary,"I n the absence of real drama, the potential leadership battle looming between Froome and Thomas took centre stage once again afterwards. Sir Bradley Wiggins had stoked the flames on Monday, saying Team Sky could have a dilemma on their hands if Thomas stayed ahead of the four-time champion for much longer, adding that Sir Dave Brailsford, Sky’s principal, was “divisive” and “self-serving” when it came to such intra-team dynamics. Brailsford was asked about those barbs. “I’ve been called a lot worse – on my Richter scale, that’s not bad,” he said. And the looming leadership battle? “It’s a totally different dynamic from what we’ve had in the past. Chris and Geraint have grown up together. They have known each other a long time.

On holiday for a few days in Kathmandu, she was trying to get used to the irregular rhythms of roadworks and city traffic. Born in the Nepalese rural region of Dolakha, and raised with Everest as her backdrop, the urban chaos felt disruptive. Behind her, a wardrobe wobbled and clothes pooled out onto the ground, but still, she sat steady. It was only when the floor shook so violently it threatened to topple her chair that the 25-year-old realised something was seriously wrong. Glancing out of the window, she saw people running, mouths shaped around silent screams. “I panicked and grabbed the wall, like I could hold it still or something,” she remembers. “I knew that should the building collapse around me, I wouldn’t be able to ask for help. If I was buried alive, I wouldn’t hear anyone call my name.” The Gorkha earthquake - 7.3 on the Richter scale - was the worst natural disaster to strike Nepal in almost a century, she explains, killing nearly 9,000 and leaving between 500,000 and 3.5 million families homeless when it struck three years ago, on April 25, 2015.","The thin glass of hot tea tipped over and shattered on the table behind her, but Bidhya Karki didn&rsquo;t look up from her book.",2018-04-25T11:09:20Z,"{'id': 'the-telegraph', 'name': 'The Telegraph'}",Nepal earthquake two years on: 'I was a deaf girl in great danger - but I stayed to set up a school',https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/nepal-earthquake-two-years-deaf-girl-great-danger-stayed-set/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2018/04/25/bidhya-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZgEkZX3M936N5BQK4Va8RWtT0gK_6EfZT336f62EI5U.jpg,the-telegraph,The Telegraph,Richter scale,0
Richard Bath,"G lasgow’s evening started badly with the news that Stuart Hogg was a last minute withdrawal. It got worse when Rhys Patchell brushed Nick Grigg aside to go over with barely three minutes on the clock. And from there it careered downhill at breakneck speed as champions Scarlets coasted to an away semi-final win for the second year in succession. But if last season’s romp in Dublin was emphatic, this win was several notches up on the Richter scale. At Scotstoun, for so long a raucous, daunting arena, and never more so than for this match when extra stands had been installed to increase the capacity to a record 10,000, the Warriors were humbled in front of the faithful. From very early coach Dave Rennie’s decision not to field Scotland centres Huw Jones and Alex Dunbar looked like an error of epic proportions. At times Glasgow’s midfield seemed totally porous as the Scarlets back division lacerated the Warriors defensive line almost at will. Scott Williams in particular needed no second invitation to run at his befuddled hosts. Glasgow’s powderpuff tackling was bad for Scarlets’ first try, it was borderline embarrassing for their second, with Williams weaving his way around four would-be tacklers before offloading to Gareth Davies to round Ruaridh Jackson and touching down under the posts.",Glasgow&rsquo;s evening started badly with the news that Stuart Hogg was a last minute withdrawal.,2018-05-18T20:50:03Z,"{'id': 'the-telegraph', 'name': 'The Telegraph'}",Glasgow 13 Scarlets 28: Reigning champions humble powderpuff Warriors,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2018/05/18/glasgow-13-scarlets-28-reigning-champions-humble-powderpuff/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-union/2018/05/18/TELEMMGLPICT000163966602-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqAbXBMw5vrTFZMTWhE2FZJYAaFlc1WXc9XwLEh12uow4.jpeg,the-telegraph,The Telegraph,Richter scale,0

ugc,"A labyrinthine underground passageway snakes for roughly half a mile beneath the Pacific Ocean. With its lack of artificial ventilation and tremor-prone nature, this former mine is no place for the faint-hearted. Accessed merely yards from the pounding Pacific surf, a chilly wind accompanies the daring descent into the Devil’s Blast ( El Chiflón del Diablo ), an abandoned coal mine near Concepción. After it opened in 1857, the mine was soon given its diabolic forename by the intrepid miners who worked this underworld in truly hellish conditions, braving toxic gases, low oxygen levels, and frequent earth tremors. The second part of the Devil’s Blast’s name recalls the unique way it was naturally ventilated via the action of strong coastal breezes. These fierce gusts still whistle and howl through the pit’s narrow, forbidding entrances and tunnels. It was one of the only operational mines in the world that didn’t rely on some form of an artificial ventilation system to protect the miners from suffocating. The Devil’s Blast employed 3,000 people by the time it was closed in 1997. The site was re-opened as a visitor attraction in an attempt to entice tourists to Lota, which, with the demise of the Chilean coal-mining industry, had lost its main employer. Today, tours of this labyrinthine netherworld are conducted by former miners and last between 30 minutes and two hours. In 2009, the Devil’s Blast was designated a “National Monument” by the Chilean government. In February 2010, a massive earthquake measuring 8.8 on the richter scale caused damage to some above-ground parts of the attraction, but the mine tours recommenced the following year.","A labyrinthine underground passageway snakes for roughly half a mile beneath the Pacific Ocean.

On behalf of the whole team here at Qumulo, I want to thank him and wish him the best on a well deserved break, time with his family and his next adventure, Richter said in the statement, after employees at its Seattle headquarters were told Tuesday that Godman was out. A Qumulo representative did not respond to follow-up questions after emailing the statement in response to an inquiry. Qumulo co-founder Peter Godman, left, and former Isilon executive Bill Richter, right. (Photo / Qumulo) Godman was the founding CEO of Qumulo in 2012, moving over to CTO when Richter joined the company in 2016. Qumulos storage systems are designed for customers that need to store huge amounts of files, and in the past companies buying this kind of storage have found it difficult to scale as their businesses grow. That led to the development of the Qumulo File Fabric, which runs on custom Qumulo hardware, hardware from HPE, and on Amazon Web Services. The company has raised $230 million over the last few years, and its not clear how the ongoing surge in cloud computing has affected its business. Qumulo introduced the cloud-based version of its product just last year, and AWS already offers its own file-storage cloud service. Godman told me last year that Qumulos service was better at scaling than AWS, and the trend toward hybrid cloud strategies works in the companys favor, but fewer and fewer companies are ordering hardware for data centers these days.

Christopher Harper,"Learning about death by dying a lot [I hold both Hotline Miami games in high regards as they are prime examples of doing a lot with so little in terms of gameplay. The games make you take an introspective look at yourself and question whether or not you may be a bad person because you enjoy a game that is about nothing but killing, all while only having five base enemy types. As stated in the comments below I've been trying to collect my thoughts on the series for a feature like this but with one fell swoop, Christopher Harper has said nearly everything I was trying to say while also relating their own personal experiences with the series and how it helped them grow. It's long and personal but one of the best community blogs I've ever seen on the site. Also, Happy Belated Birthday! -Anthony] Spoiler warning: This article discusses events taking place in both Hotline Miami titles, but especially the ending of 2. While many consider gameplay to be the primary hook for these titles, I highly recommend playing them as blind as possible for an ideal experience. Note: If you are already intimately familiar with Hotline Miami 2 and would like to skip some pretext, start at ""The End"". The Hotline Miami series may be one of my all-time favorites, right up there with pre- Phantom Pain Metal Gear, Team Fortress 2 and the first two Paper Mario games. While their nail-biting difficulty and absurd challenge (especially in the latter stages of 2) can be a turn-off for some gamers, I've always found joy in games that push me to my limits as a player. Hotline Miami's frenetic pace, excellent soundtrack and brutal, one-hit kill playstyle necessitates equal measures of cunning strategy and mechanical mastery. To get those coveted A+ and S-ranks in these titles, you need to be able to flawlessly run through these stages like a one-man army....but that's not actually what I'm here to talk about. Today, I want to touch on the story behind these games and what I learned from it. We'll brush over Hotline Miami, but the bulk of this article will be about Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number. The philosophy behind Hotline Miami The most iconic quote from the Hotline Miami series is ""Do you like hurting other people?"". This is echoed in Wrong Number by the scene depicted in the screenshot above. This question is central to the story of the first game. While there was an actual plot and lore running somewhere beneath Hotline Miami's absurdity, its main focus was on establishing pretty much everything else. The retro aesthetic, the setting rooted in old-fashioned American decadence, the surreal cracks and uneasy shakiness in the world...all of this was ultimately to service a message. That message was "" Isn't it a little messed up that you're enjoying this so much? "". While this was a somewhat unique message at the time, it had been done a few times before and many times since. I doubt many people walked away from Hotline Miami with some greatly-shifted worldview on video game violence or any real lingering thought on what little of an actual plot it had. While the plot revealed by combing through the true ending and hints strewn about the game does have some intrigue, it's nowhere close to the main focus of the first game. The atmosphere and gameplay of Hotline Miami are unforgettable, but its actual plot is dreadfully forgettable. In his videos on the Hotline Miami series, YouTuber Errant Signal claims that Hotline Miami rejects players seeking plot and context by giving them an unsatisfying answer to their questions. When Hotline Miami 2 ramps up the lore aspect significantly and has an actual...plot, he expresses a feeling that Hotline Miami 2 was akin to a magician ruining a magic trick by showing you every bit and piece that made it work. While I can't say for certain how mainstream Errant Signal's opinion here was, I have a feeling that the opinion expressed in his first video on the series had an impact on the duo of Jonatan Söderström and Dennis Wedin, the two developers making up Dennaton Games. This made Hotline Miami 2 a response, in many ways, to both its predecessor and its predecessor's reception. The actual philosophy behind the original Hotline Miami is difficult to ascertain. Is it a scathing critique of we violence-loving gamers? Is it intended as a Take That to players who wanted there to be real reasons and justifications for all the mindless violence? Was it just a fun game with an excuse plot? It's tough to answer those questions. All of those answers contradict each other but are each valid in their own ways. Wrong Number, however, is much less vague about its themes and philosophy. Many of the playable characters in Hotline Miami 2 are motivated in some way by events that transpired during the first game and the impact it had on their world. A few aren't directly motivated by the first game's events and only serve to contextualize them with storylines that take place before or during the original game. Wrong Number is a response to and an elaboration on Hotline Miami. It embraces the crazy alternate history lore established by the first game's secret ending to tell an actual story this time around, with a few messages about death. The characters and the one choice that mattered There are many, many, playable characters in Wrong Number. They generally have more distinct skills and abilities than those offered by the first game (which were generally ""Start With Weapon"" or ""Boost This Stat"") and have a more linear level design to compensate. Hotline Miami was a group of sandboxes that you could interact with as you wish, Wrong Number was a series of challenges tailored to the people you were playing as, with swift punishment for playing outside of those roles. We won't discuss all of those playable characters here. Instead, we'll focus on the three who are most relevant to the messages this game is attempting to convey. The Soldier, also known as Beard, returns from the first game. His backstory as a soldier in an alternate-history war with Russia in Hawaii is revealed. His connection to Jacket is revealed as well: the two were brothers-in-arms, best friends forged in the hottest of flames. Unfortunately, Hotline Miami 2 also reveals why Beard is less of a person and more of a presence in the first game... Because he's dead. Prior to the events of Hotline Miami, Beard lived in San Francisco, which was destroyed in a Russian nuclear strike. This recontextualizes Jacket's fever dreams in the first game, as well as his waking actions slaughtering hundreds of Russian Mafia members. The phone calls were an excuse. Jacket did like hurting other people, but especially those he felt he could blame for his grief. Richter is one of the masked killers seen in the first game. He's ordered to kill Jacket, but instead ends up killing Girlfriend and putting Jacket into a coma. When he next appears, he explains that he was only under orders, and attempts to beg Jacket for mercy. While the player can choose whether or not to kill Richter in the first game, Wrong Number reveals that Jacket spared him. Over the phone, Richter tells his side of the story. This goes from just before the events of the first game, all the way to the present day of the second. He's also one of the few characters who survives until the very end. More on that in a bit. The Writer, or Evan Wright, is the third. His goal is to learn the full truth behind the events of both games and to reveal it all in a novel that he's desperately working on. The process of writing this novel forces him into violent situations that he attempts to get through without resorting to the murder that every other playable character relishes in. Writing this novel also causes him to fall out with his wife. Evan is the person on the other end of the phone. He listens to Richter's story in its entirety and is finally given enough information to make a great breakthrough in his novel. But when we finally see Evan hang up the phone, a look around his home reveals that his child's bedroom is empty and his own is missing a lot. Letters from his wife are piled on the table, pleading him to call her and try to make things work. The player, on Evan's behalf, can then choose: the book, or his family? This is the only choice in the game that matters, the only one that changes the ending in any way. As someone writing for a living myself, who often struggles with finances and was in a very unstable situation because of it at the time I played this game...you can probably guess what choice I made. It was the wrong one. The End Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number has 26 playable stages, 27 if you count the super-short tutorial. These stages are often epic in scale, and some can take hours to overcome. It's a significantly longer, more arduous journey than the one taken in the first game. In addition to the increased scale on the gameplay side, the scale on the story's side has also been blown up. There are more, longer cutscenes than ever. Wrong Number is a long and sometimes bitter journey. For me, this journey was taken during a difficult time in my life. After escaping the abusive environment I'd been raised in to live with strangers on the Internet, I ended up in an ""Out of the frying pan..."" situation marked by living on grocery budgets of ~$20 a week and the ever-impending threat of homelessness or worse. I was 19 at the time. Hotline Miami 2 released 8 days after my 19th birthday, and 7 days after I initially arrived in Virginia. I was writing for pennies and in a desperate situation. I won't go into too much more detail here. Instead, I want to contextualize where I was in life when I experienced Wrong Number and its ending. I played the game for hours into the night, losing sleep but pushing through in an insomniac trance. I don't remember when I first saw the credits roll exactly, but I do remember those nights more clearly than anything else. And I remember Evan's plight resonating with me, sympathizing with Richter and wishing that Beard had gotten the life he'd deserved. After hours upon hours of playtime, sleepless nights upon sleepless nights, Hotline Miami 2's endgame was upon me. Many of the characters that I had gotten to know over the course of the game had died. Richter and Evan were among the last still alive. Even Jacket was still alive, albeit imprisoned. Everyone else was either dead or holed up somewhere. So, how did Wrong Number reward the efforts of myself and its characters? How did it choose to end the series? With a nuclear strike. At least two missiles, one wiping out Hawaii, the other Miami. But likely more, much more, all around the United States. This didn't happen because of anything the playable characters had done, and even if they had seen it coming chances are none of them could have done anything to stop it. At the culmination of all the time and effort people had put in, all the blood and tears...none of it mattered. You Are The Blood, by The Castanets, started playing. I watched as Richter accepted his coming death with quiet dignity. I saw Evan hunched over a keyboard in a dark room, furiously typing away at his novel. Like me, he had made the wrong choice. Between the blaring of sirens and the final song of the series playing, Hotline Miami 2 transitioned between scenes of its last few living characters and what they were doing as death came to them. Jacket even showed up one last time, sitting quietly in his cell before the light washed over him. I couldn't do anything but stare in shock and awe. Then anger. Then sadness. Then...relief? After the credits finished rolling, Wrong Number returned to its title screen. Hotline Miami 2's title screen, on initial inspection, just looks like a windy day in Miami. With the context of the ending, however, the scene being depicted on the title screen is revealed to have been a Book End all along. The first thing you see in Hotline Miami 2 (its title screen) and the last thing you see in Hotline Miami 2 (the nukes falling) are one and the same. This ending was impactful to me. While I knew Hotline Miami could be unconventional, I certainly hadn't come in expecting anything like that. Hotline Miami had culminated nihilistically, nothing had mattered. Nothing could have been done. Everyone was always going to die, no matter what they did, due to forces out of their control. At least, that's what I took from it at the time, and what I think most other people took from it. But this isn't the lesson I ended up taking away from Hotline Miami 2. To understand that, we need to talk about the dream. The End II: The Dream I'm 21 now, and I was 19 when I finished Hotline Miami 2. Abuse and trauma weren't all I was hoping to escape when I left my hometown, however. I was also escaping heartbreak. I'd been through a great deal of stupid teenage relationships in my life at this point, but there was one with a girl we'll call... Soap. Go ahead, make the jokes. I know you want to. Soap and I connected in mid-2014, shortly after I'd made my first real step toward recovery and was starting to be something like the person I wanted to be. I fell for her so fast, and until the beginning of 2015- shortly before my 18th birthday I had never been happier. Not only had I found someone who seemed perfect for me, but she was also a lifeline...a way for me to escape my environment forever. But we were young and stupid, especially me. Especially me. Look at that hair! And that PS Eye camera quality! Our actions, mostly mine, ended up destroying it so badly that even over a full year and another relationship later...I still wasn't over it. I was still miserable, constantly so. And due to the aforementioned ""out of the frying pan"" situation...things had only gotten worse. This heartbreak and despair permeated throughout me and was an important part of my Hotline Miami 2 experience. Weeks after I witnessed the ending to Hotline Miami 2, I had a dream. I dreamt I was back home, laying in the grass, staring up at a clear blue sky. I was alone but relaxed. Happy. I heard a familiar sound of sirens. My eyes were flooded with an explosion of blinding white light. Knowing what was happening, I said ""I love you"" to someone who wasn't there. Someone who wouldn't return the feeling. Just so I could hold onto that feeling as I died. Then I woke up. I realized what had happened. I now knew what I would do if faced with certain death. The first the only thing I could think of was holding onto a shadow of a feeling of a love I'd lost a long time ago. The revelation shook me. I booted up Hotline Miami 2 again, started my Hard Mode run. It took even longer than my first, but eventually, I reached that key point with Evan again...and I made the right choice this time. I made Evan choose his family. When I saw the ending again, he wouldn't be alone he'd be sharing dinner and laughing with the people he loved and cared about the most. Hotline Miami 2 had taught me a lot now. That death was inevitable, and it could come washing over you at any moment. That, if faced with it, I wouldn't react with denial or anger. I'd face it with acceptance and hold onto what little light I had left in me back then. But it hadn't taught me that none of it mattered. If anything, my dream made me realize that it mattered more. Of course everyone is going to die that's a brutal fact of life we all have to learn eventually. But that doesn't mean that our choices don't matter. Death isn't just about loss and pain. It's about love, it's about what feelings you hold onto as you leave this world. I resolved then that I couldn't be left holding onto her, or the past, anymore. When my time comes, I need to be happy. I have to be. The End III: Parting Words Some crazy things happened after that. I don't have the time to get into them here. But I will tell you that things are better now. I'm not writing for pennies. I live in my own apartment. After all those years of genuine despair, I'm finally in a place where I can start to move on from it all. It's a work in progress. Emphasis on progress. I'm not stopping until I'm more hair than human. Early in 2016, my mentor died. She walked me through my early stages of development as a writer, helped make everything possible. She's the reason I can write, and in the cases of projects like my webserial, she's the reason I still do. She taught me another lesson about death, about valuing the time you spend with people. About making sure that you never leave anything unsaid. Fortunately, I do think she knew the difference she made in my life, so that's not a weight I'm carrying. I'm coping with that loss. I turn 22 on March 2nd, 2018. That's not very long from when you're reading. Maybe it's already happened. As my life is finally completely under my control, I'm just starting to learn how much it all matters, how quickly it can all be taken away, and how important it is that I make the most of it. That's why I'm writing this. Writers write, and that is what I enjoy doing. But not in solitude. Which is why I'm sharing this with you and whoever else is reading this. Part of me hopes the world sees it. Another part of me hopes that no one ever sees how freaking sappy I am. I just wrote over 3000 words about Hotline Miami 2 and personal heartbreak and death and projected it to the whole wide world, where anyone can see it. But if you're reading this, there's no turning back now. I've bared a part of my soul to you. And I did it while talking about video games....shit. You are logged out.

https://www.facebook.com/MalaysiaKini/,"Twenty-eight people were injured in Italy's Sicily on Wednesday in an earthquake triggered by the eruption of Mount Etna, news agency Xinhua reported, quoting Italian authorities.
The volcano eruption prompted an earthquake measuring 4.8 on the Richter scale which occurred at 3.19 am local time at a depth of about one kilometre, Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said in a statement. 
The epicentre was located a few kilometres north of Catania, Sicily's second largest city which did not suffer damage. 
The major tremor had been preceded by a swarm of about 1,000 minor trembles in latest days, many of which were not even perceived by people, according to the institute.
At least 10 of the 28 people injured - mostly elders - had to be brought to the hospital, yet none were in serious health conditions, Ansa news agency reported.
Overall, about 600 people were evacuated from their homes for precautionary reasons on Wednesday. 
The worst situation was registered in Zafferana Etnea and Fleri - a small town and a hamlet in the metropolitan area around Catania, respectively - where most of the collapses occurred. 
Besides these two locations, other four municipalities - all around Catania - were among those most affected by the event, according to Ansa. 
In a message posted on Facebook and Twitter, Sicily's governor Nello Musumeci explained he met with local authorities of all six worst-hit municipalities on Wednesday in order to plan the post-event intervention.
""The Region is taking part in the crisis management table that has convened at the (Catania's) Prefecture,"" Musumeci wrote. 
""We have been monitoring the situation in hospitals, yet the first checks showed no major injuries to people, except for a few dozen bruises,"" the governor added. 
An emergency committee of the Civil Protection was called at 5am to assess the situation, and concluded its work by the end of the day, after dispatching technical teams to support local authorities in assisting the population in the six affected municipalities.
The Mount Etna, which is 3,350 metres above the sea level, is located in the eastern part of Sicily and is the largest and tallest volcano of Europe, and one of the most active volcanoes on the Earth, according to INGV. 
It is an active volcano, with a relatively recurrent activity.

Jack Giroux,"Joe Wright has been subverting expectations since he made his feature directorial debut with Pride &amp; Prejudice. With his period dramas and adaptations, unlike many others of their kind, the word “stuffy” is not applicable. Even in his newest film, Darkest Hour, the camera has a sense of freedom in a movie that consists mostly of dialogue-heavy interior scenes. After making the biggest film of his career, Pan, and his lush adaptation of Anna Karenina, Wright wanted to “go back to basics a little bit,” as he recently told us. The filmmaker, who was his typical personable self as he rolled and smoked a fine-smelling cigarette outside on a nice and breezy day, also had plenty more to say about Gary Oldman ‘s transformative work as Winston Churchill, his love of a good close-up, and more. Below, check out our Joe Wright interview. I saw the film last week and really enjoyed it. You know, I’m very gratified when I meet young people who enjoy it because I get worried that it’s an old audience’s movie, but I think young people were responding well once they get in there. The movie has an energy to it, like Atonement and Pride &amp; Prejudice, and it moves. And also, I hope that the film … You know, I wanted the film to play like a political thriller. And thrillers are accessible for all audiences, really. There is a sense of propulsion in the movie. Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. And we worked quite hard to achieve that, it’s like, this kind of urgency, even down to the speed at which Gary Oldman walks, you know, had this kind of propulsion, as you say. When you say you all worked hard to achieve that feeling, what does that entail? How’d you create that effect? I guess I was trying to…after the kind of baroque aesthetics of Anna Karenina and then, Pan, I wanted to go back to basics a little bit, and try to strip everything back and find an aesthetic that was somehow almost minimalist, really, and simple and clean, and very direct rather than trying to fill the frame with flourishes. I can see that. There’s some really effective simple touches, like cutting from a dark room to the sunny scene in the rose garden – that contrast of light and dark. Well, one of the problems we had, and often these kind of creative choices are the result of logistical problems. And one of the problems we had is that the film, as you know, is set in May 1940, which was the hottest May on record, right? But we were shooting in December and January, so we couldn’t really go outside. The scene in the Rose Garden was shot during post, in fact, it was shot much, much later. So we wanted to create a feeling, an atmosphere of the heat, of the period, without being able to see any sunshine. And also, though, we wanted a kind of darkness, a kind of sticky darkness, claustrophobia. And so, [cinematographer] Bruno [ Delbonnel ] and I together, came up with this lighting aesthetic that was basically very dark, deep shadows, a majority dark frame, and then these very hard spotlights of sun coming through windows, that kind of glared and give you a sense of the heat outside. How did that opening shot come about? What’d you want to communicate? I don’t know, I just thought of it, really. No, I think I’d already gone through later passages in the film and started thinking about this idea of leaders being like gods, looking over maps and playing with civilians, or military lives, and the idea of scale, the idea of the closeup of Winston, with an extreme wide shot of what a map is, basically. But also, maps are somehow the representation of reality, a very exact representation of reality, but they’re not in any way emotional, that’s not there. So he can be dislocated from the people that he’s playing with there. And so, that was the original conception of all those vertical aerial shots. And then once I’d figured that out later, I went back to the opening shot, and therefore, it seemed clear and obvious to me that the opening should be that direct top shot, and then it was just a matter of kind of pulling back and revealing the scale of this space and the warring factions on either side of the House. And then pushing in to the subject of our film, that being the quest for leadership. I know you liked to play all kinds of music on the set of your films, like playing The Clash on Anna Karenina. What were you playing on the set of Darkest Hour ? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Been playing a lot of Max Richter recently. Do you know Max Richter? Yeah, he scored The Leftovers. Great musician. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Especially an album called The Blue Notebooks. I have not listened to that. [Makes a nod like I should listen] [Laughs] Great. Every time we speak I like that you always recommend some album, movie, or something. There you go. And also, have you read a book called “Stoner”? I have not. By John Williams. Read it. One of the greatest American novels you’ll ever read. I’ll read it. You’ve talked before about how you have a few images in your head that you get pretty close to with the finished film. What were those shots in this case? Yeah, I guess that opening shot, ending on the hat at the end of the first scene. Winston in bed in the dark lighting a match, and then revealing him with the opening of the curtains. The shot that goes over the landscape to the closeup of the human eye, that was an early one. So yeah, it’s always still that kind of idea. After you show the leaders looking like gods, the first shot of Churchill in the bed, like you said, lighting the match. Yeah. We humanize him. Yeah, which right off the bat isn’t what I expected, just thinking of the towering figure he was portrayed as in history class. Same. I mean I, for growing up in London, you know, Churchill is this giant statue on top of a plinth, overlooking Parliament Square. And the idea for me with the movie, was to bring him down off that plinth and address him as a human, and therefore, learn from him. You know, because I don’t think it’s very useful to lionize people to that extent, they stop becoming human, and therefore relatable, and therefore teachable, or teaching us. So, I don’t think it’s useful to lionize people, and I also don’t think it’s useful to demonize people. I remember when, this is a bit of a tangent, but I remember when George Bush, when the thing in Abu Ghraib happened, the abuse in Abu Ghraib happened, and George Bush said, “These people are sick, they have sickness in their souls, they are evil.” Therefore, they are not us, therefore, they’re not our responsibility. And I don’t think that’s useful. I think it’s far more useful to look at humanity and try and understand it from a human perspective rather than from a lionizing or demonizing perspective. I was just reading about Churchill in Keith Richard’s “Life,” and he wrote that he seemed to have a huge effect on entertaininment, like embodying this Churchill idealism. Yeah, that’s really interesting. Yeah, I guess so. I mean, I’m a little bit younger than Keith Richards [Laughs]. [Laughs] Right, but looking back on movies or anything growing up, did that ever stand out to you? And I think Keith’s generation, they were born during the war, or just afterwards, and so their parents would have lived with the trauma of that experience and would have tried to turn into something positive for their children, maybe. Whereas, when I was growing up in the 70s and 80s, we were really the children of the Stones generation, who had in a way, become kind of cynical, and so, there is less of … there was a kind of kick against the Churchillian idealism, as typified by the horrendous Margaret Thatcher. But what I find interesting about Churchill, is that he’s been co-opted by so many different factions of the political spectrum, and actually he was far more bipartisan than, certainly, the conservatives would like us to think. He spent many years on the benches of the liberal party, he founded the social security system. He was certainly much more of a humanist than the conservatives are now, and yet, they try and claim him as their own. And one of the things I wanted to try and do was kind of re-appropriate him, reinstate him to his rightful position, which is somehow a bipartisan position, a position that operates purely from personal principles, rather than from party allegiance. He got a lot wrong, I mean Churchill … The thing I find interesting about Churchill, you know, there’s so many of his policies throughout his 50-year Parliamentary career, so many of his policies I think are absolutely dreadful. His opposition to women’s suffrage in the early years of the 20th century, his opposition to Indian independence, his ordering of army … the Gallipoli campaign, these terrible catastrophes. But somehow, he was someone who was able to learn from those, and I think often, politicians these days refuse to accept their responsibility in terms of mistakes, and refuse to, therefore, learn from their mistakes. You’ve discussed this before, but I like the idea of those flaws basically giving him the strength to succeed during this time. Absolutely. And I love the idea that our greatest flaws are also our greatest attributes. I identify with that. But Churchill had this extraordinary will, and it was a will that led to the catastrophe of the Gallipoli campaign, for instance. The Gallipoli campaign was a good idea that Churchill had, but then, everyone dillydallied for too long, they lost the element of surprise, but because of his will, Churchill pushed on regardless, and that meant the deaths of thousands of men. But that will that pushed that through was also the same will that resisted the wave of hatred, bigotry, and Nazism that was sweeping across Britain. And so, his greatest attribute is also his greatest flaw. Despite how big of a personality he is, Gary Oldman just finds all these nuances and has the quiet scenes speak just as loudly. What was your collaboration like early on? What was discussed? There was a lot of discussion. Yeah, there was a lot of discussion, but really it’s a matter of layering. You can have big broad discussions, and we did, but the work is what matters, and so, the very first note I gave Gary was, think about your breathing, which was during a makeup test, and he was just kind of trying the makeup and seeing what it felt like to be in character in that makeup. So we started with the idea of how Churchill breathed, and then we moved into how Churchill walked, and the walking, for instance, is vital, as I said before, because it’s about that kind of manic drive that he had that then- there’s an urgency there, you know. The closeups of him in the film are fantastic. I love closeups. I mean, I hear a lot of directors say, “Oh, I love this wide shot, or that wide shot, or that developing shot,” you know. For me, one of the most spectacular tools in cinema is a closeup of the human face because it’s the only time you see the face like that, blown up to that scale, and going right the way back to Trial of Joan of Arc, the human face and closeup is, for me, one of the most extraordinary things in cinema. But also, with Gary, the great thing is is that you can do that. You can land on a closeup and hold it for as long as you like. There’s never a point in Gary’s performance where I would have to go, “Oh, shit, that’s no good, I’ll have to cut to something else,” you know, it gives you that freedom to be that bold. *** Darkest Hour is now in theaters.

Alan Boyle,"SETI pioneer Jill Tarter pays a visit to the Allen Telescope Array in California, one of the prime sites for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. (Credit: SETI Institute) For almost 60 years, efforts to pick up signs of extraterrestrial civilizations have yielded a big fat zero, but there have been plenty of false alarms to contend with. To provide a reality check, the International Academy of Astronautics adopted a 1-to-10 rating system for claims of contact, known as the Rio scale, back in the early 2000s. Now a group of astronomers is proposing a “Rio 2.0” scale that brings the reality check up to date. They hope Rio 2.0 will serve the same purpose in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI, that the magnitude scale serves for earthquakes, the Fujita scale serves for tornadoes, and the Torino scale serves for asteroids. The Rio scale rates the importance of a SETI claim. (IAA Graphic) “The whole world knows about the Richter scale for quantifying the severity of an earthquake; that number is reported immediately following a quake and subsequently refined as more data are consolidated,” Jill Tarter, co-founder of the SETI Institute, said today in a news release. “The SETI community is attempting to create a scale that can accompany reports of any claims of the detection of extraterrestrial intelligence and be refined over time as more data become available,” said Tarter, who’s one of the researchers behind Rio 1.0 and 1.1 as well as Rio 2.0. Like the original scale, the new metric considers the credibility of a claim for contact (δ) as well as its potential significance (Q), encapsulated in a formula (R = Q * δ). The original scale had only one question aimed at judging credibility, with answers ranging from “absolutely reliable” to “obviously fake.” The new scale, described today in the International Journal of Astrobiology, gets a little more granular. Seven questions address how much credence a given report should get: How much uncertainty is there about whether the phenomenon actually occurred? How amenable to study is the phenomenon? Is the discoverer of the phenomenon the same entity that predicted such a phenomenon would indicate the presence of alien intelligence? Does the phenomenon look like a known instrumental or psychological effect? What do the builders of the detecting instrument, or the experts on the detection method, say about the phenomenon? Is there a good reason to think the phenomenon is a hoax? How does a wide community of experts assess the probability that there’s a natural or human-related cause for the phenomenon? Points are given based on the answers to those questions, and factored together to produce a zero-to-1 value on the credibility scale. That, in turn, is factored in with the answers to questions about how far away the source of the signal is, whether it’s possible to communicate with the signal’s source, and whether the signal’s sender is likely to be aware of us humans and our technology. Like Rio 1.0, the Rio 2.0 scale ends up with a number between zero and 10, from no importance to extraordinary importance. “No current signal, not even the famous ‘Wow! Signal’ … currently scores greater than 1 on either Rio 1.1 or Rio 2.0,” the newly published study’s authors report. Lead author Duncan Forgan, a founding member of the Center for Exoplanet Science at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said the new scale was drawn up in response to the changes that have taken place in the media landscape. “It’s absolutely crucial that when we talk about something so hugely significant as the discovery of intelligent life beyond the Earth, we do it clearly and carefully,” Forgan said. “Having Rio 2.0 allows us to rank a signal quickly in a way that the general public can easily understand, and helps us keep their trust in a world filled with fake news.” The revised scale has now been submitted to the International Academy of Astronautics’ Permanent Committee on SETI for official ratification. In addition to Forgan and Tarter, the authors of “Rio 2.0: Revising the Rio Scale for SETI Detections” include Jason Wright, Eric Korpela, Andrew Siemion, Iván Almár and Elisabeth Piotelat.","For almost 60 years, efforts to pick up signs of extraterrestrial civilizations have yielded a big fat zero, but there have been plenty of false alarms to contend with.
