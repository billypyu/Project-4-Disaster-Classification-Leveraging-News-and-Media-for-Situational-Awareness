Adam Rogers,"It wasnt a whodunnit. Last years unprecedented rainfall and flooding in Houston were the proximate result of Hurricane Harvey, a massive storm born northeast of Venezuela and reborn in the Gulf of Mexico, where it rapidly intensified, made landfall over Houston, and then stayedparked, as it were, for five days. Harvey was, however, something of a why dunnit. Why did the storm drop more than four feet of rain on the city? Hurricane-climate-change-planet-on-fire, yes, stipulated. But new research suggests that the fault was not only in our meteorology, but ourselves. The citythe fact of its city-ness, of its raw Houstonosity, may well have made Harveys rainfall worse. And the implications for coastal cities in a Burning World are, at minimum, very wet. Hurricane Harveys hardly ever happen over Houston, one might sayin the late 20th century it wouldve been a 2,000-year storm. In 2017, Harvey was six times more likely. Climate change theory also predicts more rapidly intensifying hurricanes that move more slowly and drop more rainjust like you-know-who. This is thanks to humans burning carbon-based fuel and coughing the leftovers into the atmosphere. Very bad! Look at what you did! Bad! No more treats. Cities around the world are getting bigger, especially along the coasts. Just a shade more than one percent of the continental United States is city, but its where a vastly greater proportion of people live, and the land dedicated to cities is only going to expand. That land use has a disproportionate effect on climate and ecosystems. Paved ground is mostly impervious to water, an impermeable surface between earth and sky, which means water that falls on it as rain or snow has to run off and away, somehowcities are, in their deep souls, machines for moving fresh water in and used water out. Something like 35 percent of precipitated water turns into runoff in a city, versus 15 percent over unpaved land. Thats why flash floods are more likely in cities. Another consequence of city building is the so-called urban heat island effect. The air over cities is hotter than over not-cities, changing atmospheric circulation patterns. It seems like urban heat islands have even caused or worsened thunderstorms over cities, including a particularly bad cluster in Beijing in 2006. Still, though, Harvey was so extreme that it warrants more running of the numbers. There was nothing looking at how the urban area interacts with a tropical cyclone or a hurricanethe role of the city, not just from a hydrologic or meteorological perspective, but both, says Gabriele Villarini, a civil engineer at the University of Iowa. We said, what if we replaced the urban area of Houston with cropland? Using a system called the Weather Research and Forecasting model to simulate climate and its changes over a region (as opposed to models with lower resolution but wider geographic scope), thats actually possible. The WRF includes a parameter for land use; in a paper in Nature today, Villarinis team tweaks that knob between cropland and Houston, and runs Harvey again and again. More specifically, they ran the model with all of Harveys observed initial conditions, to see if their simulated cyber-Harvey acted like the real deal over a Houston modeled with low- and high-density residential areas along with denser commercial spaces. The digital storm broadly did what the real one did; it rained hard. Then Villarinis team razed the digital city and replaced it with sylvan cropland, and let Harvey unfold again. Total rainfall went down by almost two feet in some parts of town, or what wouldve been town. We were able to quantify the enhancement due to the urban areas. Then the question was, OK, why? Villarini says. What we found is that there is a role due to urban roughness. As the flow from the storm approaches the city, it becomes rougher, the buildings and overall footprint. That roughness, an increase in drag, grabs the storm from the sky, like a person in socks skidding across a hardwood floor suddenly meeting a shag carpet. Coupled with the urban heat island effect, that slowdown pushes the bottom of the boundary layerthe part of the atmosphere in contact with the groundupward. Updrafts increase. Airflow converged more upstream of the city, in this case Houstons east side. These are all ingredients for heavy precipitation, Villarini says. What you might then ask is, thats fine for a simulated city and simulated crops, but what exactly is it about a city thats increasing the roughness? Tall buildings or sprawly, low strip malls and housing developments? Nobodys sure. Its true that forested landtall treeshave an overall drag coefficient somewhere between city and farm. Buildings with different shapes, at different angles versus the oncoming wind, change a citys overall drag coefficient. Was it a special combination of Houston and Harvey? Was it about Houston? Was it about Harvey? Villarini says. I dont know how these results translate to other areas. It would also depend on where a storm made landfall and its intensity. Cities, then, affect their own weather in complicated ways. Last year, researchers correlated rainfall and air pollution across China for the last seven decades, and found that urban pollution particularly made for more rain. So the Villarini group's finding came as something of a validation to Xuemei Bai, an urban sustainability researcher at Australian National University who worked on that China study. ""This is an important study that uses a physical model to establish urbanization can exacerbate heavy rainfall,"" she says. ""The fact that this [new paper] is dealing with one of the most well-known flooding episodes really strengthens its communication power."" Its also a new way to think about cities and hurricanes, specifically. This is, as far as I know, a new result and, as the authors point out, has important implications for urban planning, says Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at MIT who specializes in hurricanes. Teasing those implications out will have to come next. Climate theory takes as fairly certain, now, that denser, taller cities emit less carbon than sprawling, flat ones. But what if they also exacerbate rainfall? Urban planners are already trying to account for sea level rise and the kind of flooding that happens when storm surges meet runoff in aging city sewer systems; Villarinis finding says that the literal shape of the city itself is a factor in the weather it encounters. Climate scientists are already mounting the evidence that human behavior has exacerbated hurricanes. In another article in the same issue of Nature, researchers used the same WRF model as Villarinis team to tease out the anthropogenic influence on a few big hurricanesthe degree to which the carbon we humans emitted made the storms worse. Hurricane season last year killed at least 251 peopleprobably more, but its hard to know because of the Puerto Rico undercountand caused $265 billion in damages. The question remains: Why? Why did it get so bad? The scientists took three iconic hurricanesKatrina, Irma, and Mariaand ran simulated versions of them against two sets of conditions: a pre-industrial, non-globally warmed climate (for comparison to what actually happened) and three post-globally warmed futures of varying severity. And as theory said it would, climate change increased all three storms rainfall, and the effect increased with future warming. The same thing happened with 12 other modeled hurricanes as well. We see the majority of the 15 events becoming stronger in terms of wind speed and producing substantial increases in rainfall, says Christina Patricola, an atmospheric scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Its not great news. That bad news does help solve the mysteries remaining. Scientists are pretty sure whos responsible for making hurricanes worseits you, me, and the governments and corporations around us. Theyre learning the why and the how, even if it might feel improbable that people will be able to reimagine a society to stave off the worst impacts of climate change. Theyll have to. As a great detective once said, when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remainshowever improbablemust be the truth.

Mike Butcher,"Larry Harvey, founder of the counterculture festival Burning Man, passed away this weekend. He was 70. Harvey created a movement and contributed to the flowering both of counter-culture and, ultimately, of tech culture. Both he and John Perry Barlow, who also passed in February this year after a long period of ill health, were huge advocates of free speech. Barlow wrote lyrics for the Grateful Dead, and then became a digital rights activist in later life. In 2013 I caught up with both of them and recorded a joint 24 minute interview, just a short walk from the venue for the ‘Le Web London’ conference. Amid the street noise and the traffic, they discussed some of the intellectual underpinnings of startup entrepreneurship and its parallels with Burning Man, in what might have been their first-ever joint interview.

Lizzie Plaugic,"For the first time since advocating for the prosecution of Harvey Weinstein, the Time’s Up collective has singled out an alleged abuser: R&B star Robert Kelly. Women of Color of Time’s Up, a subcommittee of the larger group specifically organizing around issues that affect women and girls of color, released a statement this morning announcing their support of #MuteRKelly, an online campaign asking Live Nation and Sony Music to cancel R. Kelly’s tour dates and drop his recording contract. Women of Color of Time’s Up, which includes Ava DuVernay, Shonda Rimes, and Jurnee Smollett-Bell, are also asking other “corporations and venues,” including Kelly’s record label RCA Records, to cut ties with the singer. Over the course of nearly two decades, Kelly has been accused by multiple women of sexual misconduct, statutory rape, aggravated assault, and harassment. Journalist Jim DeRogatis at the Chicago Sun-Times first broke the story in 2000 that Kelly had been accused of statutory rape with girls as young as 15. Allegations against Kelly continued to surface, including a bombshell interview with DeRogatis in the Village Voice in 2013, but despite multiple lawsuits against him, the singer’s career remained relatively stable. Last summer, DeRogatis published yet another report in BuzzFeed that Kelly was holding very young women against their will in a “cult,” deciding things like what they wore and when they went to the bathroom. We join the call to #MuteRKelly and insist on the safety + dignity of all women. We demand investigations into R. Kelly’s abuse allegations made by women of color + their families for two decades. We call on those who profit from his music to cut ties. #MuteRKelly #TIMESUP #WOC pic.twitter.com/TYmDRVIH00 — Ava DuVernay (@ava) April 30, 2018 Although sexual assault convictions are difficult to come by in general — Bill Cosby was found guilty of sexual assault last week after decades of inaction and accusations from 60 people — R. Kelly’s alleged victims are overwhelmingly young black women and girls, who have seen little, if any, support from the institutions meant to protect them. In that 2013 Village Voice interview, DeRogatis said, “The saddest fact I’ve learned is nobody matters less to our society than young black women. Nobody.” The statement from the Women of Color of Time’s Up asks readers to “insist on a world in which women of all kinds can pursue their dreams free from sexual assault, abuse and predatory behavior. “As Women of Color within Time’s Up, we recognize that we have a responsibility to help right this wrong. We intend to shine a bright light on our WOC sisters in need.

ROXANE GAY,"In 1991, Anita Hill testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about the sexual harassment she said she experienced at the hands of Clarence Thomas. She took a polygraph test that indicated she was telling the truth. She was disbelieved, discredited and degraded. Mr. Thomas was appointed to the Supreme Court and continues to preside. In 2018, here we are again. Another woman, Christine Blasey Ford, testified in front of a panel of mostly men about the sexual assault she says she endured at the hands of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. She too has taken a polygraph test supporting her version of events. She is speaking her truth in front of the nation. Her entire life has exploded because she had the courage to come forward out of a sense of patriotic duty, the greater good. And still there are people who doubt her. Who do not find her credible. And if they do find her credible, they dont think what she endured merits Judge Kavanaughs losing this career opportunity. Judge Kavanaugh did not need to write down his woes in an essay. He was able to share them in front of an international audience, in real time. When he spoke on his own behalf, he was all rage and righteousness, ego and entitlement. He cried. He glared. It was a grand performance, more implausibly dramatic than any episode of Law &amp; Order. Judge Kavanaugh interrupted nearly every Democratic senator who questioned him. A year after the allegations against Harvey Weinstein were first reported, a federal judge behaved as a self-indulgent brat, unwavering in his conviction that he deserves to be on the Supreme Court. In his statements to the committee, Judge Kavanaugh said that the allegations against him had ruined his life even though he may well be confirmed to a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court. Mr. Hockenberry and Mr. Ghomeshi also lament how their lives have been ruined. The bar for a mans ruin is, apparently, quite low. May we all be so lucky as to have our lives so ruined. History is once more repeating itself and will continue to do so until we, as a culture, begin not only to believe women but also to value women enough to consider harming them unacceptable, unthinkable.

Ms. Welteroth, who is credited with reinventing Teen Vogue as a more socially conscious, politically engaged publication, noted that designers have to be conscious of the world around them. You have to be mindful of what is happening and really conscious in how you create and what stories youre telling, she said.

Nitasha Tiku,"The recent outpouring of sexual harassment and assault allegations has helped expose not only high-profile predators, but the culture of secrecy that shielded them. Now lawmakers and advocates want to empower victims, and make it harder for serial harassers to hide, by restricting the use of nondisclosure agreements, the confidentiality provisions that obscured decades of complaints against Harvey Weinstein, Bill O’Reilly, and Roger Ailes by muzzling their accusers. Since October, a handful of legislators around the country have proposed bills banning confidentiality clauses in sexual harassment settlements, where accusers are typically offered money if they agree not to pursue a claim or lawsuit. Critics of NDAs say signing away the right to report an unlawful act is inappropriate because the agreements “can effectively gag speech about a matter of genuine public concern,” says Mark Konkel, an employment lawyer with the firm Kelley Drye. Even the existence of an NDA can be secret. Without knowledge of prior allegations, serial harassers go undetected and victims can't negotiate for a fair settlement. Bills banning NDAs in sexual-harassment settlements have been proposed in the state legislatures of New York, California, and Pennsylvania. In Congress, where Rep. Blake Farenthold was revealed Friday to have paid $84,000 in taxpayer money in 2014 to confidentially settle a harassment claim from a former staffer, Rep. Jackie Speier and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand have co-sponsored a bipartisan bill that would limit the use of NDAs in such cases. State senator Brad Hoylman co-sponsored the New York bill banning confidential settlements in response to stories about Weinstein and Fox News, whose headquarters are in his district. “I’ve heard from women who want to pull the plug on NDAs and don’t want to be in the position of [being asked] to sign away their rights for a pittance, especially when the company continues to thrive at the helm [of] the predator himself,” Hoylman says. “If that’s not an illustration of unfairness, I’m not sure what is.” Even outside of a settlement, nondisclosure agreements have helped harassers evade accountability. The New York Times journalists who broke the Weinstein story said former employees felt constrained from reporting abuse because of the NDAs they signed when they were hired. Former Uber engineer Susan Fowler said nondisclosure and non-disparagement agreements had silenced complaints about sexual harassment at Uber. There’s nothing inherently nefarious about an NDA. Employers have traditionally used these confidentiality provisions to safeguard trade secrets or intellectual property. Nowadays, NDAs show up everywhere from employment contracts when workers first join a company to separation agreements when they leave. But NDAs also have become common in settlements to resolve many types of civil disputes, including allegations of sexual harassment in the workplace. Employers typically insist on such agreements as a condition for settling a complaint out of court. Employment lawyers say it’s unfair to characterize NDAs as “hush money” because no one is forced to settle, or to sign an NDA. But amid the flurry of allegations against Weinstein, a pattern emerged: Younger women raised complaints at great professional risk, were intimidated into signing NDAs by both their attorneys and Weinstein’s, then kept silent. In October, Zelda Perkins, Weinstein’s former assistant, broke her NDA, and 19 years of silence, in an interview with the Financial Times. In 2016, former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson sued Roger Ailes, then the company’s CEO and chairman, for retaliating against her after she refused his sexual demands. Carlson sued Ailes personally, rather than the network, to avoid a clause in her contract that compelled her to settle disputes with Fox through arbitration. Carlson has been meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to ban forced arbitration agreements. But she is still under the NDA that she signed in 2013 when she renegotiated her contract with Fox. NDAs and arbitration clauses, are part of a larger trend toward legal contracts that keep complaints about powerful companies and people out of the public eye. In an email to WIRED, Carlson said these contracts “both silence the victims and fool our culture into thinking we’ve come so far when we have not.” Employees who are asked to sign an NDA to get a job have little recourse. “This is a way for companies to cover all of their dirty laundry before it happens,” Carlson says. Lawyers for both employers and employees say simply banning NDAs would not be good policy. Some victims want the details to remain confidential, and forcing disclosure could lead to fewer, smaller settlements. “Why would an O’Reilly pay that kind of money when the reason he’s paying is to avoid the potential destruction of his career and ability to make money?” says Mike Delikat, head of Orrick’s employment division, who typically represents employers. “There’s really no middle ground. Either I’m not going to give you this money or you’re not going to talk about it.” Delikat, who has been defending employers for 40 years, can’t think of a time when he’s had to take someone to court for breaking a client’s NDA. “People respected those confidentiality provisions because they didn’t want to have give back the money they got,” he says. But restrictions on confidentiality are not unprecedented. For instance, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can negotiate private settlements when it sues companies for labor violations, but settlements with state and local government must be public. And last year, California passed a bill restricting confidentiality agreements in civil settlements related to felony sex offenses, such as sexual assault or sexual exploitation of a minor. Employers say “they couldn’t possibly operate” without NDAs, but “there are areas where confidentiality is not the norm and the world hasn’t collapsed,” says Minna Kotkin, director of the Employment Law Clinic at Brooklyn Law School. Advocates say there are ways to make the process of adjudicating harassment claims more equitable and transparent without banning NDAs. “This is the moment to seize, to be creative,” says Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, a nonprofit focused on expanding opportunity for women. “Silence has only made workplaces across the country worse.” Farrell suggests that employers be required to reveal prior complaints against a harasser when discussing a new settlement, even if the allegations were confidential and the details remained secret. If a victim knew that her harasser was a repeat offender, “She might go to the police. She might demand that the harasser be terminated, and certainly she would consider that she needs substantially more money,” says Farrell. Employers won’t be keen on the idea, of course. Parties already have the ability to ask about prior complaints if they file a lawsuit, explains Donald Schroeder, a labor and employment attorney with Foley &amp; Lardner. “I’m not sure that an employer would even be inclined to settle a claim if they had to share upfront and before litigation all of that information,” he says. Another idea: Include complaints of sexual harassment under whistleblower laws, which protect people who report alleged misconduct. Under the Dodd-Frank Law, for example, employees of public companies are protected from retaliation for lodging complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Jodi Short, a law professor at University of California’s Hastings School of Law who represented Jeffrey Wigand, the biochemist and whistleblower who exposed the tobacco industry practice of adding ammonia to cigarette to enhance the effect of nicotine, says the whistleblower provision in Dodd-Frank could be a good model. She says NDAs have long been used to silence the messenger. Historically, harassment has been seen as harming an individual, says Short. The challenge for advocates, she says, will be stressing that the harm is more widespread. The claim could be made with more empirical evidence, Short says. “Some of the recent cases indicate that it tends not to be an isolated problem.” The women who came forward to speak out against Weinstein and O’Reilly have already improved the NDA process by jump-starting a discussion around labor rights and the proper limits of confidentiality. Kotkin, the Brooklyn Law professor, stresses that nondisclosure agreements in job contracts cannot prohibit employees from reporting unlawful behavior. “They don’t prevent assistants who are watching Harvey Weinstein doing this from reporting it,” she says. Some companies will try to take advantage of their workforce’s ignorance in this respect, even if they know it’s not enforceable, says Konkel, the partner with Kelley Drye. Further clarification on employee rights could come from the courts, rather than legislators. Plaintiffs in at least four lawsuits are asking courts to declare pre-employment NDAs invalid. The National Labor Relations Board is making a similar argument in a case against Google. “If these cases are successful you are going to change Hollywood, you are going to change Silicon Valley, you are going to give employees a voice around the country,” says Chris Baker, a San Francisco lawyer who filed lawsuits against Google and Binary Capital, the now defunct venture-capital firm where investor Justin Caldbeck resigned after six women accused him of unwanted sexual advances. Google declined to comment.","Harvey Weinstein and Bill O'Reilly settled multiple harassment claims, but the victims weren't allowed to talk.

Josh Constine,"Larry Harvey normalized the abnormal, expanding the boundaries of what creators could attempt. That’s why there’s a special bond between Silicon Valley and Black Rock City, the desert settlement where Burning Man transpires. Both ditch “what are we supposed to do?” for “what can we do?”. Both encourage risky expression that appears insane to outsiders. And by establishing an open canvas just a few hours’ caravan from San Francisco, Harvey helped entrepreneurs come back freshly invigorated to make change. Harvey passed away this weekend at age 70. But the sub-culture he convened and the infrastructure he built to support it will stretch that canvas to the dusty horizon year after year. Google’s SkyBox Imaging satellites demonstrated the power of frequent aerial imagery by making this GIF that shows Burning Man being constructed and torn down. Burning Man began as an exhibition of disruption on SF’s Baker Beach back in 1986. Igniting that first 9-foot effigy was an artful affront to the status quo. Meanwhile, a technology-driven shift in consciousness was underway just a hour’s drive south. Burning Man and Silicon Valley evolved in parallel, straddling the concept of the open platform. Rather than dictating what should be done, each provided the tools and autonomy necessary for their participants to birth new experiences and opportunities. The relocation of Burning Man that Harvey helped orchestrate in the early 1990s would exemplify this boundary-less vision. The Black Rock Desert outside of Reno, Nevada is perception-warpingly flat in every direction, punctuated only by the art that participants install. It’s a landscape free of distraction, and that sensory deprivation seems to coax novel ideas from those it envelopes. When you stare past the edge of the world into the sunrise, your thoughts laid bare, dreams seem to crystallize more easily. The emptiness shouts back “why haven’t you built this yet?” There’s a good reason why founders from Google, Facebook, Tesla, and many more startups attend Burning Man. It dismantles your pre-conceived notions about what’s possible. This is an important characteristic for those seeking different solutions to emergent problems, and one that can wane with age as we become more accustomed to life the way it is. Great startups often come from challenging an underlying premise about how the world operates. Nowhere makes that malleability as tangible as Burning Man, where you can’t buy anything, the goal is simply to delight others, everyone responsible is welcome, and self-reliance is undergirded by a generous community. Harvey helped institute The 10 Principles that leave attendees wondering how to terraform “the default world” to closer mimic this ephemeral society. From Burning Man sprung early attempts at self-driving vehicles, as the Disco Fish art car’s pilots sought to make it avoid pedestrians in the inky night. Pioneers of LED technology bring glowing sculptures, each year brighter than the last. In 2017, Symmetry Labs invented a way to use Apple’s ARKit to map the positions of thousands of LED leaves so patterns could roll through its Tree Of Tenere. Google’s SkyBox Imaging micro-satellites demonstrated how frequent aerial imagery could reveal transportation and population trends by making the GIF above of Burning Man’s construction. I’ve seen cross-company tribes of tinkerers working the kinks out of accelerometer light-up shoes, VR theater performances, and all manners of team management software. It’s a chance to test one’s talents beyond the container of capitalism. Symmetry Labs pioneers new LED technology at Burning Man with the Tree Of Tenere Transformative moments spur word of mouth, and soon Burning Man would be faced the questions about how to scale to its newfound popularity ‘A good problem to have’ as Silicon Valley calls it, but a problem nonetheless. Harvey could have slipped away into the festival he created. There was plenty of fun to be had. The frivolity does lure leaders away from their worldly responsibilities at times when their teams need execution, not more enlightenment. Instead, Harvey stuck together with a cadre of fellow organizers to convert Burning Man into a non-profit with the appropriate longevity. Sure, there would be more tourists, more unindoctrinated rookies, more pampered rich folk, and more ‘sparkle ponies’ who just came to show off and take Instagrams rather than contribute. At its worst, Burning Man is a party for the privileged, unconcerned with suffering elsewhere. Yet the old guard worked tirelessly to sustain the core cooperative ethos of the event and push the tangential to the city’s edges. I’ve gone for 10 years and the magic remains, despite the anecdotes you hear. There might be more affluent techies in expensive RVs than before, but many from the industry earnestly embody Harvey’s ideals of radical inclusion, decomodification, and communal effort. I’ve seen billionaires sweating as they cook grilled cheese for strangers in the blazing sun, and on their hands and knees picking motes of trash off the “playa” floor. Now at 70,000 attendees per year, Burning Man offers an escape into a creation, but also an escape from digital inundation. It’s one of the few metropolises you don’t need a mobile phone to navigate. Harvey called for immediacy and participation. People find that in a week off the grid, freed from the social contracts of constant electric connectivity. Cell service is creeping in, you see a few more people trying to text, and some bring their airplane-mode devices out to snap pictures, yet face-to-face communication rules. Being offline gives a sensation of having all of your mind’s tangled wires unplugged and reorganized neatly. For those jacked into the tech world’s ever-churning news cycles and product roadmaps, this rejuvenation is ecstatic. Most obituaries encapsulate a life lost. But the elemental Larry Harvey has been decentralized and instilled into a legion of self-expressionists. While the event might only touch a tiny fraction of the world, those inspired by it build for everybody. Harvey’s legacy is restored, celebrated, and returned to dust each Labor Day. He succeeded, because no one ever doubts the Man will burn again. [Image via Burners.me ]","Larry Harvey normalized the abnormal, expanding the boundaries of what creators could attempt.

Megan Molteni,"Last Wednesday, Hurricane Michael slammed into the Florida Panhandle at 155 miles per hour, flattening neighborhoods, turning subdivisions into rubble, and plunging the coast into darkness. On Friday, Trevor Lewis packed up two trucks with crowbars, chainsaws, sledgehammers, ropes, walkie talkies, and five other guys from Cocoa Beach, where he lives on the east side of the state. As night fell they began the drive up into the worst of the wreckage. By 4 am on Saturday they were responding to their first call for help. Lewis leads a self-funded search-and-rescue unit made up of off-duty police officers, firefighters, and EMTs. They call themselves Salty Water Rescue Services, and most of them have special emergency training on the high-speed powerboat racing circuit off Cocoa Beach. Theyre one of hundreds of volunteer crews that showed up post-Michael to help first responders overwhelmed by 911 calls. They used as their guide a service called Crowdsource Rescue, or CSR, which showed on a map individuals who might need help. On one of Salty Waters visits, the crew met a woman whose house had a gas leak, so Lewis called local authorities. Its an eerie feeling to dial that number thinking someones going to come and it goes straight to a busy signal, he says. The womans family had used CSR to request a wellness check on their relative. The idea behind CSR started out simple: collect calls for help posted on social media, geolocate them, and route volunteers to the distressed parties. Basically, Uber for emergencies. It was a simple enough concept that a pair of developers named Matthew Marchetti and Nate Larson hacked it together in about six soggy hours in Houston last August while Hurricane Harvey howled outside. They expected it to help out a few families in their rapidly flooding neighborhood. By the time the storm was over, Marchetti says at least 25,000 people had been reached using the web service. Turns out, armies of spontaneous samaritans can get a lot more done if technology tells them where to go. The volunteers are going to show up no matter what, says Marchetti. Were just trying to empower them to find more people safely and more effectively. What began as a one-off charitable coding sprint has since evolved into a five-person emergency volunteer mission control center. In their day jobs at a real estate company, Marchetti and Larson built maps. And thats basically what the first version of CSR was. But as more hurricanes rocked the US in quick succession in late 2017first Irma, then Mariathe pair piled on new features as problems arose in real-time. We would change something on the site while there were 60,000 people using it, and if they didnt like it, theyd let us know, says Marchetti. We had no master plan. It was all just reactionary. In January, when the hurricane season had ended, they found time for a more thoughtful redesign. The latest version, released two weeks before Florence hit, includes a mobile app and new safeguards. It allows users to tag hazards such as downed power lines, washed-out roads, and fast-moving water. It also gives CSR the flexibility to block off any areas that emergency management officials have declared dangerous for civilians, so that volunteers without proper training cant see aid requests in those areas. Those precautions are to prevent volunteers from winding up needing rescuing themselves. Thats less of a concern for volunteers like Lewiss Salty Water crew, who used CSR for the first time during Florence, but who are no strangers to treacherous waters. After that September storm swept through, seven of their guys drove to North Carolina with a flat-bottom boat and two tuned-up jet skis with rescue sleds on the back. Over the course of a few sleepless days they checked in on nearly 100 people, delivering supplies, relaying messages to loved ones, and helping the unluckiest few to safety, including about a dozen shivering pets. On the long drive back to Cocoa Beach they decided to formally partner up with the crowdsource platform. But when Michael arrived two months later with its powerful Category 4 winds, Lewis and his teammates had used up most of their vacation time responding to Florence, so they could only stay four days. They had AT&amp;T, which Lewis says was the only carrier with coverage, and switched to walkie-talkies when they hit areas with service outages. If they couldn't relay their findings back to worried families directly, they'd take pictures or video to share using their phones later. He says that in the time they were in Panhandle, his team reached more than 300 people using the app. Yet the rescue that sticks in his mind most vividly wasnt coordinated by CSR. It came about just by chance. She was the neighbor of someone whose family had filed a wellness request; Lewis spotted her as they were preparing to move on to the next ticket, and he asked if she was alright. It soon became clear she wasnt. A widow in her 80s and frail, she lived alone. There was almost no food or water in her house. A section of her roof had been ripped clear of its frame. An immigrant from Thailand, she had no family in the US. No one was looking for her. She had one friend in the city, but with no phone service she couldnt call her. It was heart wrenching, says Lewis. His team reached the friend and waited until she came to pick the old woman up. Then they patched her roof and ripped out her wet carpet, collected her valuables and put them in a safe place to dry. They filed a new CSR ticket so that there was a record. And so that someone follows up. But the incident showed one of the apps biggest limitationson its own it cant locate missing people. Being homeless, phoneless, family-less, or Facebook-less can make dangerous storms even more deadly in the days and weeks after the worst weather has passed. Thats one of the reasons Marchettis team has started to layer social vulnerability indices and flood zones onto its maps of areas where hurricanes are expected to hit. As landfall predictions firm up, CSR places Facebook ads for its app targeted at people living in the path of the storm. They start making calls to churches and local community organizations, trying to raise awareness of the resource. We want to play this role of equalizer, to come in serve as a stopgap, he says. Not having the ability or the funds to evacuate doesnt mean you dont deserve to be helped. Early Wednesday morning, CSR had more than 1,200 open tickets for people not yet verified as safe. But as more people got cell service and volunteers cleared a backlog of requests, that number dropped to 548 by the end of the day. Marchetti says that doesnt necessarily mean that all of those people really are missing and presumed dead. They could be staying with other friends or relatives and unable to communicate. But we are starting to hit that point in every disaster where that number becomes more and more representative of the real thing, he says. A more official number could emerge as soon as Thursday evening, when the Federal Emergency Management Agency expects to complete its search and rescue operations. The agency has 10 crews and a dozen cadaver-sniffing dogs scouring the destruction scattered across Bay, Gulf, and Jackson counties, according to FEMA spokesperson Ruben Brown, reached Wednesday at the agencys interim operating facility in Tallahassee. State officials have not provided a count of the people currently considered to be missing. The states division of emergency management has an online system where people can report missing individuals as well as the locations of people who are trapped or running out of medications and other supplies. But Florida officials did not respond to questions about how those lists are used to coordinate searches. The states website also links to a searchable American Red Cross registry where people can list themselves as safe and well for their loved ones to find.

MANNY FERNANDEZ and ILANA PANICH-LINSMAN,"Local, state and federal officials expressed concern for low-income Harvey victims, but they were unable to explain why so many of them continue to struggle. City officials say there has been no shortage of resources and services for poor residents affected by the storm, including the 14 neighborhood restoration centers the city opened, mostly in low-income areas. FEMA said it has put $4.3 billion into the hands of affected Houstonians. “There are thousands of families who live in low-income communities, who already were operating at the margins before Harvey, and the storm pushed them down even further,” the mayor of Houston, Sylvester Turner, said in an interview. “We want to reassure them that they have not been forgotten.” Mr. Turner, who visited Kashmere Gardens and other neighborhoods to mark the anniversary of Harvey, described the problem as a federal and state issue, citing the $5 billion in federal Community Development Block Grant disaster-recovery funds that were approved for Texas, but that Houston has yet to receive. “We know that the city is going to receive $1.14 billion dollars in C.D.B.G. funding for housing,” Mr. Turner said. “But you can’t disperse what you don’t have.” Kurt H. Pickering, a spokesman for FEMA in Texas, said the agency had seen no evidence that low-income areas were receiving less support from the agency. He said that federal assistance was designed not to make a person whole after a disaster, but to help start the recovery process. “FEMA does everything possible to assist every family in every way,” within the bounds of its regulations, Mr. Pickering said. In Kashmere Gardens, Ms. Houston ended the tour of her house on Lufkin Street after a few minutes. “I can’t stay in here too long because I start coughing,” she said. She spoke of the past 12 months as a series of disputes and broken promises. She said she felt abandoned by FEMA, contractors, reporters and celebrities who visited the neighborhood and failed to follow up on repairs. “We’re no more than 15 minutes from River Oaks,” she said, referring to one of the wealthiest areas of Houston. “It’s not just the government.

But the court allowed Ms. Judd to amend the sexual harassment part of her complaint and resubmit it. Her lawyers did so, citing end-of-year revisions to California sexual harassment laws and arguing that the changes should be applied retroactively.

Lawyers routinely use private investigators to collect information to help them argue civil and criminal cases.

 Ashley Judd can still proceed with her claim that Harvey Weinstein tried to sabotage her career
Actress Ashley Judd's sexual harassment lawsuit against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has been dismissed by a Los Angeles federal court. 
Judge Philip Gutierrez ruled on Wednesday that Ms Judd's allegations did not fall within the scope of the statute under which she had sued.
But Ms Judd's defamation claim, that Mr Weinstein had sabotaged her career, may still proceed, the judge said.
Mr Weinstein denies all allegations of sexual harassment and intimidation.
Ms Judd's sexual harassment lawsuit was re-filed following a change in California state law after her initial claim was rejected by Judge Gutierrez last September.
She alleges she rejected unwanted advances from him and he then tried to wreck her career.
But in a statement late on Wednesday, Judge Gutierrez said the law that deals with sexual misconduct claims in professional relationships, which was revised to include directors and producers, could not be applied retrospectively to Ms Judd's case.
Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Phyllis Kupferstein, welcomed the judge's decision. 
""We have said from the beginning that this claim was unjustified, and we are pleased that the court saw it as we did"" she said in a statement, adding: ""We believe that we will ultimately prevail on her remaining claims.""
However, Ms Judd's claim that the Oscar-winning producer ""blackballed"" her after she refused his advances would still be heard, Judge Gutierrez said. 
That part of her lawsuit states that ""Weinstein used his power in the entertainment industry to damage Ms Judd's reputation and limit her ability to find work"".

He said that Mr Weinstein had warned him that the actress was a ""nightmare"" to work with.
Mr Weinstein, however, said he had no role in Mr Jackson's casting and denied trying to derail Ms Judd's career.

JAN RANSOM,"The detectives grave mistake meant a grand jury was not aware of the friends statements three months later when it decided to indict Mr. Weinstein, 66, on charges he sexually assaulted Ms. Evans and raped a second woman at a hotel in 2013. The indictment was updated in July, adding the accusation that Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted a third woman at his townhouse in 2006. Nearly two weeks ago, it came to light that Detective DiGaudio had also urged one of Mr. Weinsteins accusers to delete embarrassing material from her cellphones before giving them to prosecutors, further eroding his credibility. (After consulting with a lawyer, the woman turned her phones over to prosecutors without deletions.) In theory, the dismissed charge should not hurt the prosecutions chances at trial, some experienced trial lawyers said. Five counts remain. The other cases and witnesses exist unto themselves, said Evan Krutoy, a former Manhattan prosecutor who now focuses on internal sexual harassment investigations for companies. At trial, a reasonable, fair juror will independently assess those complainants. But Barbara S. Barron, a former prosecutor who teaches law at Hofstra University, said that the defense can use the judges decision regarding Ms. Evans to cast doubt on the entire case, not just at trial, but also in the battle for public opinion.

"Chloe Melas, CNN","(CNN)Ashley Judd's multi-pronged legal battle against Harvey Weinstein came to a bit of a crossroads on Wednesday.
US District Judge Philip S. Gutierrez dismissed Judd's sexual harassment case against the movie mogul, stating in the ruling obtained by CNN that Judd's legal team had ""not adequately alleged that her relationship with Defendant was covered by the statute.""
But Gutierrez ruled that Judd could move forward with her defamation case against Weinstein, in which she claims he derailed her career after she denied his alleged sexual advances in the 1990s. 
Gutierrez's ruling said Judd's claims for defamation, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and violation of California's unfair competition law could proceed. But he said she did not make the case for sexual harassment under the civil code that was in effect when her suit was filed, noting, ""The Court makes clear that it is not determining whether Plaintiff was sexually harassed in the colloquial sense of the term. The only question presented by the current motion is whether the harassment that Plaintiff allegedly suffered falls within the scope of the California statute that she has sued under.""
That code was amended in September 2018 to include relationships between directors and producers, but Gutierrez's ruling concluded that the change could not be applied retroactively. 
Weinstein's attorney in this case, Phyllis Kupferstein said in a statement to CNN, ""We have said from the beginning that this claim was unjustified, and we are pleased that the court saw it as we did. We believe that we will ultimately prevail on her remaining claims.""
Judd's attorney Theodore Boutrous appeared to be optimistic about the judge's decision. ""Nothing about today's ruling changes that Ms. Judd's case is moving forward on multiple claims,"" he said, adding, ""While we respectfully disagree with the Court's decision as to the one claim it ruled on today, we look forward to pursuing the three claims for relief that the Court has already ruled can move forward.""
Judd's suit was filed in April. In it she claimed that she lost out on multiple film roles because of Weinstein, including one in ""The Lord of the Rings"" franchise. She says Weinstein told director Peter Jackson and his producing partner, Fran Walsh, not to work with Judd on the films, a move that not only ""torpedoed"" her opportunity to star in the Academy Award-winning franchise, but also cost her additional work. Weinstein has denied those allegations.
Judd filed her lawsuit after Jackson said in a December 2017 article to New Zealand news website Stuff that Weinstein had made those claims to him about Judd. 
Judd appeared in ""Frida,"" which was distributed by Weinstein's company Miramax in 2002, and starred in ""Crossing Over,"" which was distributed by The Weinstein Company in 2009.
Judd was among the first women in Hollywood to accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct in a series of reports published by The New York Times and The New Yorker last October. Since then, more than 80 women have accused Weinstein of varying degrees of misconduct, including harassment and rape. He has denied all allegations of ""nonconsensual sexual activity.""
Weinstein is awaiting a pretrial hearing in March in a New York criminal case.

JAN RANSOM,"Some defense lawyers questioned why Mr. Weinstein would severe ties with Mr. Brafman just a few months before his trial begins in May, and after his lawyer had gotten one of the charges against him dismissed in October.
That charge was related to Lucia Evans, a marketing executive, who alleged that the producer had forced her to perform oral sex on him in 2004. The charge was dropped after prosecutors acknowledged that the lead detective on the case, Nicholas DiGaudio, had not shared with them a conflicting account from a witness.
At that point, the case appeared to be fraying, and Mr. Brafman continued to pile on, releasing emails between Mr. Weinstein and his two remaining accusers in a relentless attempt to undermine their credibility.
There are a lot of great lawyers in Manhattan, said Mr. Alonso, an executive with Exiger, a compliance and investigations firm. I cant think of anyone better than Benjamin Brafman as a criminal defense lawyer in New York County.
Another lawyer, Mark A. Bederow, said Mr. Weinstein had one of the best attorneys imaginable.
But finding a new lawyer likely will not be difficult for Mr. Weinstein, Mr. Bederow said, because of the high-profile and challenging nature of the case.
This is what you do, he said. Someone is accused of a crime, there are due-process rights and credible defenses. It appears to be a very triable case.
Other people Mr. Weinstein has reached out to include Duncan Levin, a former state and federal prosecutor, and Jeffrey Lichtman, who represents Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the infamous drug lord known as El Chapo.","Harvey Weinstein arriving for court in Manhattan.

Jess Joho,"Ah, leave it to The Men to give themselves a pat on the back for ""predicting"" accused Hollywood predators like Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein — who, let the record show, were actually outed by talented journalists (many of them women) and the survivors who found the courage to speak up against them (again, many of them women). Only a show like Family Guy would feel justified in congratulating itself for a few passing jokes that acknowledged the widely known abuses of now-disgraced Hollywood men like Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein. The show packaged its Emmy consideration mailers this year with a smug-looking Peter Griffin insisting, ""We predicted Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weisntein. Open DVD to see who’s next."" With all the subtlety and nuance of a typical Family Guy joke, the viewer opens the DVD only to find a mirror. Get it?! Because the one ""who's next"" is YOU ! Hah! (Presumably assuming, of course, that the Emmy judge in question would be male, and I guess experiencing some level of anxiety over being ""next"" on the #MeToo ""hit list"" — or something?) Now, before you send you Twitter @s — we get it. The joke is supposed to be in line with Peter Griffin's characteristic arrogant pig-headedness. But that still doesn't make it any less gross to see Family Guy taking this historical moment for women's rights and sexual abuse survivors as an opportunity to promote their own contributions... in the context of a goddamn Emmy bid. SEE ALSO: Please stop applauding Louis C.K. for doing the bare minimum The ""predictions"" they're referring to were a) An off-handed joke back in 2005 where a naked Stewie says he escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement, and b) Another brief joke from when Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane hosted the 2013 Oscars and joked about actresses not having to pretend to be attracted to ex-executive producer mogul Harvey Weinstein. Listen, we do commend MacFarlane for speaking out when others weren't able to. His reasons for the Oscars joke seemed nothing but sincere. We also commend Difficult People for doing similar Kevin Spacey jabs, too, and about fifty more than Family Guy ever did. And we also don't see Billy Eichner self-promoting by calling attention to the bravery of these jokes. It's also especially gross when you consider how, before the Weinstein callout at the 2013 Oscars, Seth MacFarlane opened the show with the lovely song titled, ""We Saw Your Boobs."" During this song, to the clear horror of most actresses in the room, MacFarlane expressed his allyship to women subjected to sexual assault and harassment in Hollywood by personally calling out each one of them who acted in a nude scene. Yikes. And, hey, no one's perfect. We've all had years of learning since 2013.

MAYA SALAM,"After a monthslong downward spiral, Harvey Weinstein, the once powerful movie producer, is expected to be arrested in New York on Friday on sexual assault charges. According to law enforcement officials, Mr. Weinstein will face criminal charges in connection with the accusations of two women, including Lucia Evans, who claimed that he forced her to perform oral sex on him during a 2004 business meeting. While it is unclear which other person’s accusations have resulted in charges, the Manhattan district attorney’s office had been investigating allegations that Mr. Weinstein raped the actress Paz de la Huerta in her New York City home in 2010, as well as allegations by three to five other women. The unraveling of Mr. Weinstein, 66, began with reports by The New York Times and The New Yorker, both published in October, which prompted movements against sexual misconduct that have spread far beyond Hollywood.","Mr. Weinstein is expected to be arrested in New York on Friday.

"JON PARELES, JON CARAMANICA and GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO","The tracks that caught our critics’ attention this week, from Cardi B, Stephen Malkmus &amp; the Jicks, John Parish with PJ Harvey and more. The Weeknd released a new EP, “My Dear Melancholy,” with little notice this week. Credit Nina Westervelt for The New York Times Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos — and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. This week, Cardi B blasts a cheater, Stephen Malkmus &amp; the Jicks get riled up and John Parish and PJ Harvey sing a tribute to Mark Linkous. Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. The Weeknd, ‘Hurt You’ Anxiety and resentment drip off “My Dear Melancholy,” a great new EP by the Weeknd announced and released on short notice this week that’s filled with scarred, tart songwriting and dismal moods. Which is to say: vintage Weeknd ! Here, he is both savior and judge, sweet singer of cruel sentiments. The beat — produced by Gesaffelstein and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo (of Daft Punk) with Cirkut — is stormy and dreamy in equal measure, and the Weeknd is coolly vicious atop it. Throughout this EP, he applies the polished songwriting he’s picked up on his path to pop saturation, but the most gratifying parts are the moments of unvarnished bitterness that can’t be smoothed over. JON CARAMANICA Cardi B, ‘Be Careful’ Cheat on Cardi B ? Not a good idea. The track combines a tinny, off-the-shelf vamp that could have been marked “Latin” on a 1950s chord organ with a few trap accents, but there’s no mistaking the fury in the song. “My heart is like a package with a fragile label on it,” Cardi B sings, and that makes her bitterness mount in verses that detail how he kept sneaking around while she was faithful, even thinking about marriage. There’s suspicion, disgust, self-doubt, anger and thoughts of karmic retribution — but it’s still not over: “This is not a threat, it’s a warning.” JON PARELES Stephen Malkmus &amp; the Jicks, ‘Shiggy’ The old indie-rock indifference doesn’t play so well in 2018, and Stephen Malkmus — who perfected the noisy offhand shrug as the leader of Pavement — is unmistakably riled up in “Shiggy,” from an album with the Jicks that’s due in May. The bass is more bruising and the drums are heftier; guitars unite to blare out hooks. And when he sings, “Don’t speak your dumb wisdom/I’m not so easily confused,” it’s not hard to guess his target. J.P. Mary Halvorson, ‘In the Second Before’ The guitarist Mary Halvorson is basically opposed to things that could spark any easy association or soft comfort. She doesn’t do campfire strums or snaky jazz guitar lines or steadily arcing song structures. And apparently her M.O. as a lyricist is roughly the same: fragmented and semi-opaque, unrhymed, sometimes verging toward language poetry. We know this thanks to “Code Girl,” Ms. Halvorson’s new album, named for the quintet she recently assembled with Amirtha Kidambi on vocals, Ambrose Akinmusire on trumpet, Michael Formanek on bass and Tomas Fujiwara on drums. Case in point: Is “In the Second Before” a love song? A loneliness song? A defiant dance? After a low, rustling intro, the group finds itself in a lovely flow, and Ms. Kidambi intones: “His voice comes/out of the sound/of the million people/we are known/to discard.” But that gentle sway is fleeting: The track ends in a cloud of Ms. Halvorson’s electric scuzz. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO Seinabo Sey featuring Jacob Banks, ‘Remember’ The sound and imagery of gospel infuse this enigmatic song, an anticipatory elegy that’s the B-side to a more combative new single, “I Owe You Nothing,” by the Swedish songwriter Seinabo Sey. “You say you want to be remembered,” Ms. Sey begins, singing completely alone; a choir, slow organ chords and eventually the deep rasp of Jacob Banks are all that join her through the first half of the song, which vows, “When the trumpets call/you can send me to the Lord.” Finally, drums and orchestral strings arrive for a rousing march that’s also a plea: “Remember me.” J.P. Tyler, the Creator, ‘OKRA’ All the attention given to the wink tossed at Timothée Chalamet on “OKRA” obscures something far more important: This is one of Tyler, the Creator’s sharpest songs in years, full of urgently mumbled and funny lyrics — “$30,000 just for luggage, financial adviser buggin’” — over a beat that’s a low, slimy, persistent groan. J.C. John Parish, ‘Sorry for Your Loss’ “The sun never felt colder,” PJ Harvey sings in “Sorry for Your Loss,” which is dedicated to the songwriter Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse, who committed suicide in 2010. He had worked with both the songwriter-producer John Parish and Ms. Harvey. The music echoes Sparklehorse, setting a Celtic-modal banjo against a looming, distorted electric guitar; the song captures the eerie persistence of grief. “The window rattled and I wondered if you’d just passed over.” J.P. Phum Viphurit, ‘Lover Boy’ Phum Viphurit is a young Thai singer raised largely in New Zealand with an unpretentious style: a mild Bublé croon over Mraz-esque guitar breeze. “Lover Boy” is his best song to date — he leans hard into the syllables, making them sound sticky, but keeps his flirtation light. J.C. DJ Esco featuring Future and Ty Dolla Sign, ‘Psychedelik Smoke’ “Kolorblind,” the new album by DJ Esco — Future’s D.J. — is, from some angles, a backdoor Future album, and a welcome one, more breathable than his own recent full-length releases. Out of several strong songs here, this one has sinuous charm and a chipper 1980s back-and-forth lightness. J.C. Sonar featuring David Torn, ‘Red Shift’ Vortex is a Swiss quartet whose music tends toward a percussive, guitar-driven minimalism, not ambience. But on “Vortex,” the group’s fourth full-length, the guitarist David Torn joins as special guest and spirit guide, and he changes things. A frequent composer of film scores, he’s a fan of atmosphere and accrual. The single, sustained note is his friend; so is the loop pedal. At the beginning of “Red Shift,” a stubborn, puddly bass opens up a wide bed, and a throng of guitars begins to bite and snipe over top. But here comes Mr. Torn, crafting a big, luminescent haze above it all. Five and a half minutes in, the track strips down nearly to silence: The troops are in retreat, provisioning for another salvo. Then the build starts again, more urgent than before. By the end we’re beyond gravity.

Rachel Becker,"Climate change is already making devastating hurricanes wetter — and similar storms are likely to unleash more rain and faster winds by the end of the century, new research says. When Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria struck the US in rapid succession in the fall of 2017, the storms and their aftermaths killed thousands of people and caused an estimated $265 billion in damage. Harvey became the second costliest storm after Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005. Now, new research published today in the journal Nature suggests that climate change made Irma, Maria, and Katrina drop more rain than they would have in a pre-industrial world. The study also predicts that in a warmer future, these storms would be even wetter and windier. A second paper (also published today in Nature) took a closer look at Hurricane Harvey. It shows another way people may have made the storm’s rain and flooding more severe: by building cities. Hurricanes should, theoretically, be more intense and wetter on a hotter planet. After all, warm ocean water fuels hurricanes, and warmer air holds more moisture — which means more rain. Recent studies back that up; analyses of Hurricane Harvey, for instance, reported that 15 percent or more of the rainfall could be attributed to global warming. “It’s a very important confirmation.” Today’s paper provides yet more evidence about the ways in which climate change shapes extreme weather events, says Dim Coumou, an atmospheric scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research who was not involved in the study. “It’s a very important confirmation of our understanding of how hurricanes change with global warming.” Climate scientist Michael Mann says that some of the results make perfect sense. “We expect greater rainfall and flooding from hurricanes as ocean surface temperatures and atmospheric moisture content increases in a warming world.” But he cautions that the papers use a single climate model, so “it is difficult to draw other general conclusions from these studies.” The study started because Christina Patricola, a climate scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, wanted to find out how exactly climate change fit into the recent spate of devastating storms. So she simulated more than a dozen hurricanes, including Hurricane Katrina. She and her co-author Michael Wehner plugged in ocean temperature, atmospheric conditions, and watched the simulated storms spin toward land. The models weren’t perfect, the study acknowledges: the simulations didn’t quite capture Hurricane Maria’s track, or the rapid intensifications of Katrina, Maria, and Irma. But the models were close — and that’s where the experiments could start. Patricola tweaked the conditions to watch what would happen if Katrina, Irma, and Maria had unfolded in a pre-industrial world, and found that global warming boosted the deluge by between 4 and 9 percent. The team also analyzed wind speeds, but didn’t see much of a contribution of global warming for the recent storms. That could change in the future. Patricola found that if we continue to burn fossil fuels unchecked through the year 2100, some of those same storms would drop 25 to 30 percent more rain, and the winds would blow up to 33 miles per hour faster. It’s a thorough, convincing study, Coumou says — but there are still some big questions left to answer. The study doesn’t examine how climate change might alter the speed at which hurricanes travel along their paths, for example, or how future hurricane rainfall and storm surge might combine to drive heavy flooding. The question of flooding is where today’s second study comes in. Hydrologist Gabriele Villarini at the University of Iowa and his colleagues at Princeton University took a close look at Hurricane Harvey, which dumped five feet of rain on Houston and killed at least 93 people. Previous studies analyzed at how much of that rainfall could be attributed to global warming, and found it was around 15 precent or more. And we’d expect that when developers slap down impermeable surfaces like concrete and asphalt, the amount of water slicking off those surfaces increases. “The skyline, the tall buildings, the city footprint — we don’t know which one is more important.” But Villarini’s team took a slightly different tack and looked at how the city’s footprint and skyline might have changed both runoff and the rain. They modeled how much rain the hurricane would have dropped on the city had the buildings been replaced with farm fields. And they found that the rough texture of the city with its buildings and complicated skyline snagged and slowed down the humid air flowing over it, boosting conditions for precipitation. To be clear, Hurricane Harvey would have dropped rain over Houston no matter what was there. But the presence of the city exacerbated the flooding across Houston by about 21 times, on average, the study says. The team doesn’t know precisely why. “The skyline, the tall buildings, the city footprint — we don’t know which one is more important,” Villarini says. They also don’t know if these findings are specific to Harvey, or whether they’d hold up when another storm hits a different city. “I don’t think there’s one single way of dealing with this problem.” Still, the findings suggest that urbanization could make the flooding impacts of hurricanes worse, and in multiple different ways. “This is, as far as I know, a new result and, as the authors point out, has important implications for urban planning,” Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at MIT who was not involved in the study, says in a statement emailed to The Verge. Together, the two studies show that we need to be ready for the complex ways a warmer world could change extreme weather events. And preparing for these events won’t be easy, according to Villarini. Politicians, urban developers, and engineers will all have to be involved, and will have to work together to figure out ways for their communities to survive future storms. “I don’t think there’s one single way of dealing with this problem,” he says.","New research published in the journal Nature suggests that climate change made Hurricanes Irma, Maria, and Katrina drop more rain than they would have in a pre-industrial world.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex One of Harvey Weinstein's accusers was told by police to delete any files from her phone that she wanted to keep private, prosecutors have admitted. Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said the complainant was told by a detective to ""delete anything she did not want anyone to see"". Mr Weinstein's lawyer said the development ""undermines"" the case. The Hollywood producer faces charges involving alleged sex assaults on two women. Mr Weinstein denies the charges. ""My office had asked Complainant 2 to produce any and all cell phones that she might have used during the time she interacted with the defendant,"" Ms Illuzzi-Orbon wrote in a letter to Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Ben Brafman. She adds, however, that the woman said she was then advised to remove files ""before providing the phones to our office"". Despite this advice, the woman still provided the phones used to communicate with Mr Weinstein ""without any deletions"", Ms Illuzzi-Orbon said. Mr Brafman later released a statement in response to the letter, saying the news ""further undermines the integrity of an already deeply flawed indictment of Mr Weinstein"". He earlier requested that the entire case be dismissed. Earlier this month a charge against Mr Weinstein by actress Lucia Evans was dismissed by a judge in New York after she was said to have given a differing account of events. Mr Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 70 women. The accusations against him helped awaken the #MeToo movement, which has seen hundreds of women accusing high-profile men in business, government and entertainment of sexual abuse and harassment. Mr Weinstein has agreed to wear a GPS tracker and to surrender his passport. He also faces additional investigations in Los Angeles and London, and by the US federal government.

JACK HEALY,"Now, mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates are edging higher around Houston, according to real estate and legal aid groups. Many families who suffered damage in the Aug. 25 storm say they are borrowing money from relatives, living off credit cards and falling behind on bills. A survey last month of Harvey survivors found that nearly 25 percent of people who suffered damage or lost income in the storm said they were in worse financial shape today than a year ago. “They were just pouring all the money they had into living,” said Jon-Ross Trevino, a staff attorney with the Foreclosure Prevention Project of Lone Star Legal Aid. “It goes fast.” This time a year ago, Ms. Ford-Amofa, who was 43, was sitting in her sister’s kitchen, dialing and redialing two phones to get through to a rental-car company and FEMA. Her husband, Yaw Amofa, 47, was back at their house, tearing out soaked wallboard with a dull bread knife. The family had fled when floodwaters reached as high as their three children’s chests, ruining the first floor of their home. [ Revisit our coverage of the Amofa family immediately after the storm. ] They had been desperate to start rebuilding. Their two-story house in the new subdivision of Evergreen Villas was the first home the Amofas had ever owned. When they bought it, Ms. Ford-Amofa said, they were told not to bother with flood insurance. Even the federal government said the area was a “minimal hazard” for flooding. But then Harvey upended expectations, delivering $125 billion in damages and more than 40 inches of rain in some areas.","The Amofa family outside of their Houston home, where the first floor was flooded during Hurricane Harvey.

"Eric Levenson, CNN","(CNN) Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood producer, arrived in a Manhattan court on Monday to be arraigned on three additional sex crime charges. Weinstein, 66, was indicted last week by a grand jury on one count of committing a criminal sexual act in the first degree and two counts of felony predatory sexual assault. He has already pleaded not guilty to two counts of rape and one first-degree criminal sex act charge, and he is out on $1 million cash bail. Weinstein's attorney Benjamin Brafman said he will enter a plea of not guilty to the three new charges. ""Mr. Weinstein maintains that all of these allegations are false and he expects to be fully vindicated,"" Brafman said in a statement. ""Furthermore, to charge Mr. Weinstein as a predator when the interactions were each consensual is simply not justified."" In all, Weinstein now faces six felony charges relating to three women: two counts of predatory sexual assault, two counts of criminal sexual act in the first degree, and one count each of first-degree rape and third-degree rape. The charges are related to separate incidents in 2004, 2006 and 2013. ""A Manhattan Grand Jury has now indicted Harvey Weinstein on some of the most serious sexual offenses that exist under New York's Penal Law,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said in a statement. ""This indictment is the result of the extraordinary courage exhibited by the survivors who have come forward."" Weinstein was one of the most powerful figures in the film industry until last year, when The New Yorker and The New York Times published accounts from several women accusing him of various forms of sexual assault and misconduct. Since then, more than 40 women, including actresses Ashley Judd, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. Weinstein was fired from the Weinstein Company, which has since filed for bankruptcy and been sold off. The women's accounts -- and the public's willingness to believe them -- emboldened others around the world to stand up to powerful, abusive men in what has come to be known as the #MeToo movement. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph and Chloe Melas contributed to this report.","Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood producer, arrived in a Manhattan court on Monday to be arraigned on three additional sex crime charges.",2018-07-09T13:14:34Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Harvey Weinstein arrives in court to face additional sex crime charges,https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/09/us/harvey-weinstein-arraignment/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180709084920-02-weinstein-arraignment-0709-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,Harvey,0
JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.,"The movie producer Harvey Weinstein, already charged with sexually assaulting two women, has been indicted on additional sexual assault charges in connection with a third victim. Prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney’s office said on Monday that a grand jury had voted to approve a superseding indictment against Mr. Weinstein, adding to the charges he already faces in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Once a powerful figure in Hollywood who could make or break careers, Mr. Weinstein, 66, was arrested in Manhattan in May on charges that he sexually assaulted two women, one in 2013 and one in 2006. He has denied the charges, saying the encounters were consensual, and has pleaded not guilty. A judge released him on $1 million bail to await trial. Issued on Monday, the updated indictment accuses Mr. Weinstein of forcing a third woman to have sex with him. The additional charges include two counts of predatory sexual assault, which carries a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum of life.","The disgraced movie producer has been indicted on additional charges stemming from a sexual encounter with a third woman, prosecutors said.",2018-07-02T15:48:21Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Harvey Weinstein Faces New Sex Assault Charges in Manhattan,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-sex.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/03/nyregion/03weinstein/03weinstein-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Harvey,0
RICHARD GOLDSTEIN,"He umpired his first major league game on April 10, 1962, and during his rookie year he learned a lesson he would never forget. Photo Dodgers pitcher Don Sutton argued with Harvey and other umpires after being ejected from a 1978 game. Sutton had been accused of throwing defaced baseballs. Credit Associated Press As he told it, he was in St. Louis, only his third game behind the plate, with Stan Musial at bat. It was the ninth inning, bases loaded, two outs and a full count. As the next pitch approached the plate, Harvey raised his right hand, signaling strike three. But the pitch broke outside by three inches. “There I am standing with egg on my face,” Harvey remembered in a 1992 interview with Jerome Holtzman for Baseball Digest shortly after he retired. “Musial never looked at me. He asked the bat boy to bring him his glove. Then, without turning, he said, ‘Young fellow, I don’t know what league you came from, but we use the same plate. It’s 17 inches wide.’” “That’s when I realized why they called him Stan the Man, and I learned not to anticipate the call. I introduced timing to umpiring. That’s my gift to baseball. My heritage. My legacy. Before, the umpires were always told: ‘Be quick! Be decisive!’” When Harvey was chosen for Cooperstown, Tommy Lasorda, the former Los Angeles Dodgers manager, recalled how “you could see every time he was on the field, he gave every ounce of energy he had, and I can’t say that about a lot of guys.” But Lasorda was not always thrilled with Harvey. One time, when Keith Hernandez, the Mets’ first baseman, was batting, Harvey’s calls of two balls and no strikes brought howls from Lasorda in the dugout. “Don’t let those guys intimidate you,” Hernandez told Harvey. His response: “Nobody’s ever intimidated me, son.” Doug Harvey was born on March 13, 1930, in South Gate, Calif. He was a teenager when he decided he would become a sports official, figuring he could do better than those he saw. He got his start in professional baseball as a ticket taker and a bat boy for a minor league team in El Centro, Calif. After attending San Diego State University, where he played basketball, football and baseball, Harvey began his umpiring career in 1958 in the California League, earning $350 a month. Photo In 2010, Harvey became the ninth umpire inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Credit Adam Fenster/Reuters Joy Harvey, in an interview with Lee Gutkind for his book on umpiring, “The Best Seat in Baseball: But You Have to Stand!,” remembered how, while her husband was umpiring in the low minors, “we scrimped and saved so he had enough money to drive up to San Francisco for a night and a day.” “The first place we went was Candlestick Park. In all his years in baseball, Doug had never, up to that time, been in a major league stadium, so we went that morning and asked if we could go in and walk around.” They sat in the top row of the stands in a silent and windy park, and then, said Joy Harvey: “It came right out of a Grade B movie, but I knew for all he was worth, Doug meant for it to come true. ‘Some day,’ he said, ‘I’m going to umpire in this stadium.’” Harvey, who chewed tobacco during his umpiring years, was found to have oral cancer in 1997 and spoke out about the dangers of smokeless tobacco following his treatment. He is survived by his wife; his brother Nolan; his sons Scott and Todd; six grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren. For all of his authoritative presence, Harvey once became embroiled in a controversy in which he came out second best. On July 14, 1978, he ejected Don Sutton, the Dodgers’ star pitcher, after accusing him of throwing defaced baseballs in a game at St. Louis. The infraction carried a 10-day suspension, but Sutton, proclaiming his innocence, said he would sue the National League and Harvey for depriving him of a livelihood. The league president, Chub Feeney, never imposed the suspension. Harvey’s reputation was evidently well earned, but there was at least one person besides the sometimes aggrieved ballplayer or manager who made sure he did not get carried away by his lofty aura. One Christmas, Joy Harvey gave her husband a T-shirt that read: “We’ll Get Along Just Fine as Soon as You Realize I’m God.” Jason Bailey contributed reporting.

Leigh Anderson,"Since the New York Times broke the story of Harvey Weinstein’s many, many years of predatory sexual behavior, the floodgates have opened. Men in fields from entertainment to journalism to politics have been accused of sexual harassment and assault, taking down the unlikeable and repugnant (Weinstein) to the honored and even beloved (George H.W. Bush; Elie Wiesel). This is not especially shocking, at least to half of us—I don’t know a single woman who hasn’t been sexually assaulted or harassed at some point in her life. What is surprising is how these men are apparently now being held accountable—TV shows not renewed, new magazines shut down, movie premieres canceled. (I mean, we’ll see how long it lasts—I expect at least a few of these guys will rehabilitate themselves in the next few years, or least take a turn on Dancing with the Stars.) In all these accounts of women fielding vile male behavior, what’s resonated the most with me are the stories of women who didn’t triumph—who didn’t go on to become major Hollywood actresses, or journalism stars, successful despite the bad behavior of their bosses and colleagues. In the face of workplaces in which they were harassed and the perpetrators not punished, some women hung on and gritted their teeth; others found other jobs; still others, demoralized, left their fields entirely. One woman, harassed by Michael Oreskes, the former editorial director of NPR, told Vox that the worst result of the whole ordeal was “the fact that he utterly destroyed my ambition.” Sexual Harassment or Boys’ Club? In my late 20s, I decided to be an eternal freelancer. I’ve always claimed this is due to a somewhat misanthropic nature and a dislike of office life, but if I’m honest, it’s also because I just didn’t want to be subjected to the power dynamics of corporate culture—power dynamics that often involved young women and older men in positions of power over them. Media, when I was starting out, was male-dominated, and the men didn’t hide their sotto voce snickering with one another about their female colleagues’ looks and sexual availability. Even in a workplace in which no one is whipping out their dick, it’s sometimes hard to tease out what is sexual harassment (the kind that’s actionable or prosecutable, at least in theory) and what is “merely” that subtle, gendered exclusion known as the boys’ club. I’ve made a decent career for myself since then—it’s no accident that most of my contacts now are women—but I do sometimes wonder what my life would look like if I had been better able to navigate the men in my field. A lot of us women just...leaned out, or left entirely. Rebecca Traister recounts the story of a women so demoralized by the men in book publishing that she switched fields entirely—to renovating homes in rural Pennsylvania. In every organization, at some point, a worker comes along with an intolerable smell, personal… Read more Read I laughed off all of the gendered incidents that occurred in my earlier working life: the butt grabs, the dirty jokes, the not-quite-inaudible comments about women and their capabilities. But “laughing it off” is itself a form of gaslighting—you pretend to others that it’s not a big deal, you tell yourself it’s not a big deal, and 20 years later you’re renovating houses in rural Pennsylvania and have nearly forgotten you had other dreams. This is the kind of morass ( Is it sexual harassment? Is it gendered discrimination? Or am I simply not getting along with my colleagues? ) that could cause a person experiencing harassment to doubt themselves and their capabilities. And so I’m asking: How can we absolutely know sexual harassment when we see it? In every inappropriate-to-menacing interaction I’ve had with men, there’s been a moment when I asked myself, “Did that really happen?” How can we know what’s merely a bad joke, or a sincerely misdirected text, and what’s targeted, gendered discrimination? The Law Eric Bachman, an employment lawyer at Zuckerman Law who handles sexual harassment and glass ceiling discrimination cases, wrote in an email, “Much of the recent reporting on sexual harassment has focused on the blatant behaviors (such as sexual assault and groping) of high-profile figures. A far more common type of harassment, however, involves less obvious conduct in workplaces around the country that lack the headline-grabbing attention of Hollywood. And this more subtle form of discrimination can also be unlawful under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and other laws.” However, he emphasizes that the law doesn’t guarantee an office civility code, and that when hearing cases, courts are going to apply a “reasonable person” standard: “Would a reasonable person in the employee’s shoes have felt that the conduct was offensive? If so, then the employee will probably be able to prove the harassment was unlawful. The reality is that different courts assess hostile work environment claims in different ways and no precise mathematical test exists to gauge when harassment crosses the line from simply obnoxious to illegal.” At one of my first “real” jobs, I was on a project with a group of workers who were notoriously… Read more Read So what is this “less obvious” but still actionable conduct? Well, for one, it doesn’t have to be specifically about sex—it can be general comments about a person’s gender, like “women can’t do this kind of work.” It also doesn’t have to be directed at the person complaining—if a co-worker is making vulgar jokes about women, even if they’re not directed at you, that’s a problem. Kathleen Peratis, an employment lawyer and partner at Outten and Golden in New York City, says: “As a legal matter, the hostility has to be either severe or pervasive.” Severe is a Weinstein/Louis C.K. kind of situation, or the classic boss-chasing-you-around-the desk, or an explicit quid pro quo. But the more subtle markers of a hostile environment are “a drip drip drip,” she says — the sexist jokes, the snickers, a colleague “accidentally” letting you see porn on his computer. “That’s pervasive,” she says. “Sometimes it’s things that aren’t sexual at all, except when you put them in context,” says Peratis. “Even though a particular comment isn’t about sex,” like a colleague exhibiting too much lurid interest in your dating life,” you can see that it’s creating conditions that are interfering with your ability to do your job: a hostile work environment. This doesn’t necessarily mean it’s easy to prove. Says Bachman, “The basic framework that an employee must prove to show that they work in a “hostile work environment” is: She was subjected to unwelcome harassment; The harassment was based on sex; The harassment unreasonably interfered with her work performance; and The employer knew or should have known about the harassing conduct but failed to take corrective action.” Ellen Pao, who had been a junior partner at the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, launched a discrimination suit that went to trial in 2015. Pao alleged that Kleiner Perkins “ [created] an atmosphere of both insidious and overt sexism that stymied her career. ” Her suit claimed that a male partner harassed female employees and in one instance made a pass at a woman while he was dressed only in a bathrobe (what is it with these guys and bathrobes?). Pao had had a brief relationship with him; she claimed he retaliated against her when it ended. Pao lost her case. But there are also success stories: in 1996, 23 women filed suit against Smith Barney in the infamous “boom boom room” case (male employees’ birthdays were celebrated with strippers in what could only be a totally icky basement room); the brokerage firm eventually paid out $150 million. Trust Yourself, and Lobby for Changes It’s difficult to know if a catalog of subtle incidents—of sexist jokes, of encountering a guy in his bathrobe—is enough to bring a case, but Bachman encourages women to trust their instincts: “As we’ve seen from the cascade of women finally speaking up about the sexual harassment they’ve had to endure, if you are consistently feeling uncomfortable about how your boss or your coworkers are treating you, then you are probably in a toxic work environment. And even if it does not rise to the level of an unlawful hostile work environment, an employee shouldn’t have to just grin and bear this kind of behavior. Perhaps there is a trusted supervisor that the employee can discuss their concerns with and see if that leads to any constructive changes.” And if not, obviously a lawyer can help you determine your next steps. Both Bachman and Peratis note that there’s strength in numbers: The more women you can convince to come forward at once, the better your case. No matter what, though, the emotional, financial and professional toll of filing suit, or even of going to HR to file a complaint, can be grueling. How to See the Big Picture Peratis notes that if one tries to analyze this hostile environment incident by incident, claims are easy to pick apart—which is exactly what the defense will do: They’ll say “this particular thing wasn’t so terrible; that particular thing can be explained, this particular thing didn’t really happen that way. If you take it one little bit at a time, nothing is going to seem illegal. But if you look at the whole picture, the environment, then you see it was really pervaded by a feeling of denigration or being demeaning. It was making the condition of work much harder for the woman who bore it than it is for everybody else.” That’s what you have to ask yourself, if you’re unsure—are my working conditions harder than everyone else’s due to this hostility? Were Rose McGowan’s working conditions worse than Brad Pitt’s? Certainly. But when it’s more subtle, it’s hard to know—are you having a harder time presenting your ideas at meetings, or socializing with your colleagues at conferences, than the guy at the next desk who’s not enduring lengthy shoulder squeezes or jokes about blondes? That can be tough to parse, even to yourself, and it can be tempting to simply say “not a good fit,” move on, and hope to forget about it. But if the current moment has taught us anything, it’s that we don’t actually forget—not in a few months or a year or a lifetime. And we should let that knowledge guide us in the present from now on. As Bachman says, “The more voices that are heard, the more likely things will actually improve.”","Since the New York Times broke the story of Harvey Weinstein’s many, many years of predatory sexual behavior, the floodgates have opened.

JOSE A. DEL REAL and INYOUNG KANG,"Young writers and artists in the area have long venerated Mr. Lamar, whose rise from poverty to becoming one of the acclaimed musical writers of his generation is a source of hope and inspiration. Kyland Turner, a young writer and poet from Watts, said Mr. Lamar’s music helped him make sense of his own life and choices at critical moments. “There was a long time that I didn’t know how to express myself, and Kendrick was that expression for me personally. I was young and trying to make it through the city,” said Mr. Turner, 22. “His first album, that album got me through some of the toughest parts of my life, from being evicted to having friends dying.” Mr. Turner’s dream is to make it as a songwriter and screenwriter. He’s well on his way. He has built a following through raw performances in spoken-word events around the city, drawing from his life in South L.A.’s neighborhoods. He recently did story-consulting work on a Netflix series about South L.A., “On My Block,” and once performed at the White House. Mr. Lamar’s Pulitzer win, said Mr. Turner, has provided a rush of inspiration for Mr. Turner and others like him. “We knew about Kendrick before the world knew about him. To see his growth over time and for him to stay true to his community, just on a personal level growing up in the city, in L.A., Watts, Compton — it made me feel like, man, I can make it,” Mr. Turner said.

SHERI FINK,"What seems like a small detail might resonate in unanticipated ways. For example, well into production on the Magazine story, the editor, Luke Mitchell, allowed me to add a sentence about innovations that included the fact that in Charleston County, S.C., people could provide information to 911 online.
I learned later that several 911 directors reached out to Charlestons 911 director for more information. One was John Dejung from Dane County, Wis. Hurricane Harvey had awakened him to the possibility that his 911 system, one of the largest in a state prone to ice storms, blizzards and tornadoes, might get so bogged down or debilitated that we might want to rely on alternatives to phones. Dane County set aside $10,000 in next years budget for the purchase of a system that will allow people to reach 911 online if necessary in a major disaster.
That alone would likely not have saved Caseys life, but it may save someones. There are myriad ways in which we and the infrastructure and systems we rely on remain unprepared to contend with the natural disasters that seem to arrive ever more frequently and catastrophically. 
All of us have a stake and arguably a role in fixing the most critical problems. But to justify making personal, professional or governmental investments, we need to understand what it looks like when we dont.

Jess Joho,"Justice continues to close in on Harvey Weinstein, ever since he surrendered himself to the New York police on May 25 (before being released on bail). Now, one more survivor accusing him of rape is adding her story to the legal battle. CNN reports that Melissa Thompson joined the three other women who filed a class-action lawsuit against the infamous, disgraced Hollywood producer. Before the new charges, he already stood accused of first and third degree rape, as well as first degree criminal sexual act. SEE ALSO: Asia Argento: 'I was raped by Harvey Weinstein here at Cannes' Though Thompson's story sounds very similar to the litany of other allegations brought to light by women over the past seven months, it adds a fresh layer of (alleged) insidiousness from Weinstein's lawyer. Thompson says that back in 2011, she pitched Weinstein on a tech marketing idea. Then, he allegedly raped her in his New York hotel room. Years later, Thompson says she suspects lawyers Ben Brafman — who currently represents Weinstein — and Alex Spiro manipulated her into giving them audio and video evidence of Weinstein's behavior. Back in 2017, when the first wave of accusations against Weinstein were reported by The New York Times and The New Yorker, Thompson says a mutual friend put her in contact with Spiro. She was lead to believe he was part of the team defending Weinstein's victims. The law finally caught up with Harvey Weinstein on Friday and charged him with multiple counts of rape and sexual assault. But nothing about that felt celebratory to me. — Annabella Sciorra (@AnnabellSciorra) May 27, 2018 Only after sharing the evidence with Spiro did she realize that he worked at Brafman's firm, which was representing Weinstein. Both lawyers deny the story as Thompson describes it. In statements given to CNN, Braufman claimed the firm ""never represented Melissa Thompson,"" and that he ""personally never met with her or any of the other women named in the lawsuit."" Spiro alleges that he ""never met with Mr. Weinstein nor did he have any responsibility whatsoever in connection with our representation of Mr. Weinstein in any matter."" Spiro's statement also notes: ""I never have and I never would represent Harvey Weinstein, I left the Brafman firm well before Brafman ever represented Weinstein, and, in fact, I represent one of the key victims, but Ms. Thompson has never been a client."" As for Brafman, he left room to walk back his own claims, saying that if Spiro ever had spoken with or met these women, he'd done so on his own time after leaving Brafman's firm for another. Actress and alleged Weinstein rape survivor Rose McGowan in the 'Non Una Di Meno' (Me Too) march in Rome Image: ALBERTO PIZZOLI/AFP/Getty Images The lawsuit not only accuses Harvey Weinstein of criminal activity, but also his enablers: brother Robert Weinstein, The Walt Disney Company, Miramax, and Weinstein Company board members (among others). Again, the complaints echo what several other survivors have already been saying, which is that the parties listed above participated in a ""decades-long campaign to squelch complaints or illegally procure the silence of victims, witnesses and others."" According to The New York Times, Weinstein is scheduled to appear in a Manhattan Criminal Court on July 30.

WESLEY MORRIS,"Last month, Ms. Sciorra told the journalist Ronan Farrow, writing in The New Yorker, that she, too, was among the women Harvey Weinstein had assaulted. (He denies all accounts of nonconsensual sex.) Her account was harrowing; she accuses him of rape, and of terrorizing her during that early professional run, damaging her and perhaps her career. Each of these sexual assault stories is tough to expunge; they don’t blend together so much as affix themselves to a timeline in your heart. But as they accumulate, you do wonder whether, after their experiences with Mr. Weinstein, women like Asia Argento, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino and other less famous actresses, thought differently about acting, or whether people who make casting decisions thought differently about them, because of rumors or deals with Mr. Weinstein. In the middle of Mr. Farrow’s story, the actress Rosie Perez says this about her friend Ms. Sciorra: “She was riding high, and then she started acting weird and getting reclusive. It made no sense. Why did this woman, who was so talented, and riding so high, doing hit after hit, then all of a sudden fall off the map? It hurts me as a fellow actress to see her career not flourish the way it should have.” It’s strange. The country is in the grip of a sexual counterrevolution. Suddenly, stories of abuse and harassment are being believed, abusers and harassers are being toppled. Yet at the same time, one of the top movies in the country right now is “Daddy’s Home 2,” which has a biggish, comedic part for Mel Gibson. He’s the man whose anti-Semitism and racist rants became part of the cultural lore. He’s the man who pleaded no contest to a domestic abuse charge. This past winter, that same guy won a best director Oscar nomination for “Hacksaw Ridge.” “Daddy’s Home” is more than a title. It names a taunting moral perversion. At 57, Ms. Sciorra is four years younger than Mr. Gibson and nowhere near the top of the box office. Whatever kind of counterrevolution this turns out to be, much of it, so far, has necessarily been about the actions and art of men. How do the claims against them alter the perception of what they’ve made? Should they? With their victims, it’s the opposite. How does what’s been done to them bear out in art they never got to make? Photo Annabella Sciorra in “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.” Credit Buena Vista, via Photofest That Rosie Perez quote reminded me how Ms. Sciorra excelled at her job. Her coming forward left me at a loss. What good was all that illusory familiarity? I couldn’t make a condolence call. There was nowhere to send a letter. So I did something else. I watched her work. That helplessness got me reacquainted with how good she was in “Jungle Fever.” It’s among the most ideologically ambitious of the Spike Lee joints, it really was the “Get Out” of its day, and it’s mysteriously absent from every legal streaming service. Ms. Sciorra plays Angie Tucci, an Italian-American, Brooklyn-bred secretary at a Manhattan architecture firm, who has an affair with her married black boss (Wesley Snipes). She endures her family’s racism and her lover’s skepticism about the feasibility of their love. At the time — it was 1991 — Mr. Lee told journalists that the movie was interested in the sexual stereotypes that facilitate interracial relationships. But that kind of fetishizing doesn’t appear to be what’s animating Ms. Sciorra’s performance. The way she looks at Mr. Snipes is so pure, and when things between them go south, her grief tips the emotional balance in her favor and places all the neurosis at her co-star’s feet. That makes sense. The movie is ultimately — or also — about the assortment of crosses affluent black men have to bear. But it’s Angie you feel most sorry for. This is one of the few times I’ve ever seen an actor almost upstage a master director just by turning the temperature down on her performance. Mr. Lee was making a social tragedy. Ms. Sciorra’s starring in a more private one. Her passion — which in one devastating sequence is nearly beaten out of her — departs from all the bigger, louder acting around her. Almost everybody in this movie is angry — the Italians, the crackheads, the Bible-thumping preacher. She acts heartbreak that doesn’t appear to be in Mr. Lee’s script, simply by turning for a last look at Mr. Snipes on her way out of an apartment. Maybe Mr. Lee once believed that a white woman couldn’t love a black man without also having something more sinister up her sleeve. Ms. Sciorra begs to differ. She probably knew this woman better than the man who invented her. She’s not acting the politics. She’s acting the character’s heart. Mr. Lee has wrung lots of wonderful acting from lots of different kinds of actors. But you watch Ms. Sciorra in “Jungle Fever” and wonder whether she’s wrung something new out of him. Photo James Gandolfini and Annabella Sciorra in “The Sopranos.” Credit HBO She was even better, 10 years later, in Season 3 of “The Sopranos,” a show that, like “Jungle Fever,” swooped in and out of the operatic. She plays Gloria, the New Jersey Mercedes-Benz saleswoman who meets Tony Soprano because Dr. Melfi accidentally double-booked them. Tony is drawn in and eventually overmatched. Their affair is one of those all-consuming lust connections that brings out the volcanic in both of them. Ms. Sciorra is quick, alluringly vulgar, and determined to locate the humanity in a basket case. Tony shows up very late to dinner one night, and Gloria blows up. Ms. Sciorra can do wounded. But she wounds, too. Here, she plays the sort of woman who’ll grab the slab of beef she’s just reheated and chuck it at the head of a mobster who’s three times her size. That’s followed by Tony’s chasing Gloria around her dining room and kitchen. He picks her up and throws her into a wall, slams her to the floor and chokes her. She uses what breath she has to beg him to finish the job, to kill her. That scene has an awful intimacy that was also one of the draws of the show. Almost no one matched James Gandolfini’s intensity on that show. Edie Falco and Lorraine Bracco obviously could. Ms. Sciorra did, too. Watching her suffer with Tony Soprano, I didn’t think much about Mr. Weinstein. I was more focused on the tang of Ms. Sciorra’s realness (in 2001, she lost an Emmy for her “Sopranos” work to Sally Field) and how this reckoning with bad men has the tendency of upstaging the great work of women. Ms. Sciorra’s realness is part of her skill as an actor. It seems to reside in the marrow of her being. She makes me hope for her happiness, for her safety, and in something good and trashy — like that nanny movie or “Whispers in the Dark” (another light-bulb-on-the-fritz part, this time a bedeviled shrink) — for her revenge. With her, the project of moviemaking always seemed complete: I felt what she felt. Her pleasure was pleasing. Her hurt hurt me. It still does.

Heather Dockray,"Everyone remembers their first GIF. Forbes staff writer Alex Konrad was in a group chat with his grandmother, nicknamed Grammy, when one of his family members sent a Steve Harvey GIF. Grammy, who hadn't been exposed to a GIF before, understandably freaked out. SEE ALSO: Why we could be watching 'The Simpsons' for another 30 seasons Before you pass judgement, try empathy.

Though Grammy's family members attempted to explain to her how a GIF functions, she wasn't convinced. So, she headed straight to the Verizon store, and later recapped her experience for the group chat: ""Verizon guy was totally casual about it. Said it's 'Running in a loop'... &amp; said it would run out eventually. To which I replied but it will use up all its charge &amp; he said ""no — not at all"" hmmmm leaving me speechless &amp; perplexed!!!!!!!!!"" As Konrad is a reporter, he conducted a follow-up interview: ""I called Grammy last night to tell her about all this, and her first comment was, 'Are you calling about the clapping man?'"" Konrad told Mashable. ""We then both started laughing for about 30 seconds. She's a great sport like that, always seeing the good in things and rolling with them."" ""I explained what a GIF was to her, and she said the Verizon employee had told her they ""went around and around,"" which got me laughing again.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright PA Image caption Harvey Weinstein is facing dozens of accusations of abuse The New York studio co-founded by disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein is to file for bankruptcy after talks to sell its assets to an investor group collapsed. Talks ended two weeks ago when the New York attorney general's office filed a lawsuit against the Weinstein Company. The board of directors said bankruptcy was the only viable option. Mr Weinstein faces dozens of allegations of sexual abuse, including rape, but denies non-consensual sex. The civil rights lawsuit against the company alleges that Mr Weinstein sexually harassed and abused women employed by the studio for years, as well as making verbal threats to kill staff members. It accuses senior executives at the company, including Mr Weinstein's brother Robert, of failing to prevent the mistreatment of staff despite being presented with evidence. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is seeking an unspecified sum to cover damages, plus penalties, for victims of alleged abuse. A lawyer for Mr Weinstein has said a ""fair investigation"" will show that many of the allegations are without merit, while the company's board of directors has said many of the allegations relating to the board are ""inaccurate"". The allegations against Mr Weinstein first surfaced in October last year, when the New York Times published a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Mr Weinstein. Since then, more than 50 women, among them some of the biggest names in Hollywood, have accused the film producer of sexual assault, harassment, abuse and rape. In the wake of the allegations, Mr Weinstein was sacked by the board of his company. He is under investigation by UK and US police, but no criminal charges have been brought. Mr Weinstein, who was once among the most powerful men in Hollywood, has admitted that his behaviour has ""caused a lot of pain"" but has described many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"".",The film studio co-founded by disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein has been unable to sell its assets.,2018-02-26T07:04:28Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Weinstein Company filing for bankruptcy,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43195327,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4022/production/_99981461_hi044493880.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Harvey,0
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Roads turned to rivers across Houston as Harvey hit Scientists have weighed the water that fell on Texas during the record-breaking Hurricane Harvey in August. They calculate, by measuring how much the Earth was compressed, that the Category 4 storm dropped 127 billion tonnes, or 34 trillion gallons. ""One person asked me how many stadia is that. It's 26,000 New Orleans Superdomes,"" said Adrian Borsa from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. His numbers were released as other scientists stated that the summer's big hurricanes had a clear human influence. Harvey, Irma and Maria ripped through the US Gulf states and the Caribbean, leading to widespread flooding and wind damage. Researchers told the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union here in New Orleans that the heavy rainfall seen in Harvey was very likely exacerbated by the extra warming associated with increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Sea surface temperatures were particularly high in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico this hurricane season. Warm ocean water acts as a fuel for the storms. Media caption The BBC's James Cook found a scene of devastation in Rockport Harvey devastated parts of the Texas coastline because it stalled, concentrating its deluge in a very narrow region. It was one of the heaviest precipitation events in recorded hurricane history. Standard rain gauges recorded upwards of 1,270mm (50 inches) of precipitation in places. But these were point measurements and Dr Borsa attempted to get a much broader view by measuring how much the Earth moved in response to the weight of overlying water. This was detected by a network of high-precision GPS stations. ""It's like you sitting down on a mattress - it depresses; you stand up and it rebounds. The Earth behaves very similarly, like a rubber block. So the Earth is recording the effects of the loads acting on its surface."" The GPS network is dense enough that a broad picture of activity can be discerned. ""It gives us a holistic view, not just point measurements,” Dr Borsa told BBC News. What is smart is that the system can see the immediate change as water runs off the land through rivers, but also captures the much slower effect of water removal through evaporation, driven by the warmth of the Sun. This takes several weeks. ""One of the big deficiencies in our models is that evapotranspiration - that's the Sun and plants doing their things - is not currently directly observed, and it's half of the total water budget. I think this GPS is going to be able to provide very useful information about this."" At the same annual scientific gathering, the American Meteorological Association revealed that its annual report on extreme weather events had identified three that would “not have been not possible” without the influence of human-induced climate change. These were: the record-breaking global temperatures in 2016; the 2016 heat wave across Asia and the high ocean temperatures measured off the coast of Alaska. These were events that happened because “we have created a new climate,” said National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) climate scientist Stephanie Herring. The report also concluded that other heat waves around the world were made more intense by climate change and that Arctic warming was “most likely” not possible without it. The coral bleaching event in the Great Barrier Reef and other marine ecosystems in the Pacific Ocean were also amplified by “human-caused warming of the ocean”. The research is primarily based on comparing models, or simulations, of our climate. “We run a model that shows what the world looks like today and we can validate those models against what is actually happening,” explained Dr Herring. “Then we compare it to a model of an ‘alternative world’ in which - theoretically - climate change never happened. As if humans didn’t emit greenhouse gases since the industrial revolution. “So we can look at a world with climate change and a world without it.”",Scientists established how much rain fell by measuring how much the Earth compressed during the storm.,2017-12-14T00:57:26Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Hurricane Harvey rainfall 'weighed 127bn tonnes',http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-42347510,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p05dh54p.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Harvey,0
AL BAKER and JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.,"Why wasn’t Harvey Weinstein jailed ahead of trial ? His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, negotiated a bail package with the district attorney’s office in advance of the arrest and Judge Kevin McGrath agreed to it. In New York, the only question a judge may consider in weighing bail is risk of flight, not whether the defendant poses a threat to the community. In this case, prosecutors agreed to let him remain free if he posted $1 million in bail, wore a tracking device, surrendered his passport and agreed not to travel outside of New York and Connecticut. He has no previous record of arrests, and the measures are considered enough to ensure he will show up to his court dates. Defendants who do not have the money or assets to post bail usually end up held on Rikers Island to await trial. How soon will he go on trial? It is hard to predict, but it could be more than a year. For starters, a grand jury has yet to indict Mr. Weinstein. That must happen within six months. By law, there are deadlines intended to speed things along. But both sides often waive those deadlines in high-profile cases. What happens now ? Mr. Weinstein is set to appear next in Criminal Court in Manhattan on July 30, when he’ll learn whether a grand jury has indicted him. If it has, then he will be arraigned in State Supreme Court in Manhattan and the long run-up to a trial begins. [ Everything you need to know about the case against Harvey Weinstein explained ] Who will the judge be ? At his July appearance, one of several criminal court judges covering that day will preside. Afterward, the case will likely be referred to Justice James Burke, who handles most of the cases brought by the sex crimes bureau of the Manhattan district attorney’s office. But a final decision about which Supreme Court justice gets the case belongs to the administrative judge, Justice Ellen Biben.","Harvey Weinstein in Manhattan Criminal Court, where he was arraigned on charges of rape and criminal sex act.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira It's a year since movie mogul Harvey Weinstein checked himself into a sex addiction clinic after the flood of rape and sexual harassment allegations that gave rise to the Me Too movement. The BBC's Sangita Myska has been meeting people who say they've suffered from sex addiction, in order to understand whether it really exists, and if so, what it is. Neila's first job in the UK, after she arrived from Central Asia 15 years ago, was on the trading floor of a finance company dominated by what she describes as ""alpha-males, earning million-pound bonuses"". She was one of only two women on the team, and her male colleagues would sometimes try to provoke them by playing pornography on the big screens that should have been showing market data. ""I didn't like it but I was at the start of my career, making my way in the city. It was good money and a glamorous job and I didn't want to lose that,"" she says. ""I knew the men in the office were looking for a reaction - they wanted to shock me. So I started going home and watching porn videos and DVDs on my own, so I could brush it off in the office."" Image copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira But quickly Neila got hooked. Her upbringing in a socially conservative family where sex was never discussed left her ""defenceless"" she says. Every day she was thinking about how quickly she could get home to choose a film and a sex toy and start to masturbate. She describes the process for me. ""It starts slowly. You get aroused. And then you just watch and simultaneously you switch on your equipment. All your senses are stimulated, watching something so exciting. Your mind goes elsewhere. You know it's not going to stop until you press the button. You know you're in control of it, of every aspect of your pleasure, and it gives you orgasms you just can't have with another human being - and certainly not a man. ""The whole process of masturbating and coming will take you a maximum of five to 10 minutes but you pull back because you don't want to exit this state you are in, which is basically like being intoxicated."" Using this technique, called ""edging"", she was watching porn for two to three hours, seven days a week. Find out more Listen to Addicted to Sex by Sangita Myska on Radio 4 on 5 November at 20:00, repeated on 7 November at 11:00 Download the Addicted to Sex podcast - six full and very frank conversations Sangita recorded for the programme Her behaviour was compulsive, she says. If she couldn't watch porn, she craved it. She would also spend hours justifying it to herself, however detrimental it had become: ""Everything is safe, you're not going to catch an STD from watching porn, you don't have to wear make-up. Everything on your terms and with guaranteed results."" Image copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira But to continue getting those guaranteed results, the type of pornography she was watching took a darker turn. ""Usually you start watching vanilla porn - that means male-on-female or female-on-female, normal stuff - and after a while it doesn't work any more. Your body gets used to this release. It's similar to drug addiction, you need to increase the dose, so in order to increase it you watch more hardcore stuff. ""So you start watching anal, and then after a while that becomes a new normal for you so you need to watch something more hardcore and then you start searching for extreme stuff like gang bangs."" This was very uncomfortable for Neila, who began to worry that she was ""a perv"", as she puts it. This issue of shame is a big one for every person who believes they are a sex addict. Shame simultaneously makes them want to hide away and drives them further into their compulsion. ""It's a cocktail of arousal and shame,"" Neila says. Porn also changed her attitude towards men. It meant that when she looked for a potential partner, their personalities and character became almost irrelevant. ""I would look through their shirts to see if they had a six-pack,"" she says. ""The average UK penis size wasn't enough for me... but it's not a good way to choose a life partner."" Image copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira She had a series of failed relationships, but it was the fact she felt compelled to watch films featuring violence against women to get a ""high"" that really began to terrify her. ""I had to ask myself, what's next? Will I end up watching a snuff movie just to satisfy my addiction?"" she says. Neila left the City and re-trained as a counsellor. Now in her 40s, she specialises in treating other patients who believe they are sex addicts. She trained at the Laurel Centre in central London, one of only a handful of clinics in the UK providing specialist support of this kind. To get it you have to pay, sometimes hundreds of pounds per hour, because the NHS doesn't recognise sex addiction as a genuine condition. But it's estimated that hundreds, if not thousands, of people seek treatment in the UK each year, the vast majority of them men. Does sex addiction exist? The World Health Organization recently added Compulsive Sexual Behaviour Disorder to its list of recognised disorders The UK's National Health Service doesn't recognise sex addiction as an illness - and doesn't keep official statistics The NHS web page on addiction notes that addiction is most commonly associated with gambling, drugs, alcohol and nicotine - and adds: ""being addicted to something means not having it causes withdrawal symptoms"" Private clinics in the UK claim that hundreds of people, if not thousands, approach them every year for help Where to get help Part of the reason for this may be that women are more ashamed and find it harder to confess to the problem. But whatever the explanation, Paul is more typical of those seeking help for this condition - both because he's a man, and also because he got his thrills from having sex rather than watching porn. In his 50s, tall and well-dressed in a crisp white shirt and jacket, Paul tells me his addiction began 30 years ago at university. He had a loving relationship with his girlfriend but one day, it seems, that wasn't enough for him. ""I loved her, I really did but for whatever reason I went to see a prostitute,"" he says. ""I was desperate for a thrilling sexual encounter and I knew that this was something I shouldn't be doing. I'd never be unfaithful to her with another girl but this felt like something different."" Within weeks, his behaviour had changed completely. ""I had about six girlfriends on the go at the same time and I was seeing two or three sex workers a week. It's almost like ordering a pizza in because I was hungry. I want something, I order it in, I forget about it."" Image copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira He says he knew something was very wrong. But just as he began considering whether or not to confide in someone, or even get help, he landed his first job in London - and found himself in an environment where this kind of behaviour was actually encouraged. ""Life was unbelievable. Flying around the world on Concorde, earning a lot of money, frequenting the lap-dancing bars of London - you find yourself going out for a sexual thrill with the people you work with,"" Paul remembers. ""So at this point [I'm thinking] 'Maybe I haven't got a problem, maybe I'm just a normal sort of guy?'"" Even then, a nagging doubt remained at the back of Paul's mind. He would go with colleagues on a ""grand night out"" to the lap-dancing bars - so-called because each spent £1,000 per night - on a Tuesday, perhaps, and maybe again on a Thursday. But Paul would be the only one going back on a Saturday. Like Neila, Paul says he began to ""chase the high"". So much so, that despite being heterosexual, for 10 years he also had sex with men. ""I switched completely from women to men. So all my physical acting out was with men. I can honestly say that I haven't got one ounce of homosexuality in me. It's really just seeking a higher thrill, that's what it came down to. And throughout this whole period I had some very very nice girlfriends."" Again, as with Neila, Paul says his behaviour was compulsive. If he wasn't having sex, he craved it. And again it wasn't reaching orgasm that was the goal - it was the set of behaviours around it that he was hooked on. Like Neila, he would stretch out the experience for hours at a time. ""The thrill is the build-up, the anticipation of what you're going to be doing the very last thing that you want to do is to ejaculate because at that point the whole process is over."" It took Paul a long time to get hooked on porn, after first discovering it at the age of 12. ""I did come across some magazines in my parents' house. I found them hidden when my parents were out. So it was a reasonably early exposure to porn. But, if I'm honest I can't remember feeling sexual excitement."" That changed when high-speed internet arrived. At that point his focus shifted from sex workers to online porn, which he would watch for hours on end. Image copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira Paul has received long-term support from the Laurel Centre, and now believes he is well on the way to recovery. He has not used sex workers for several years or watched porn for months, he says. His goal is to settle down with one woman. ""It's a lonely disease You get to the point where you realise that you've got a limited amount time on the planet. I've never had an enjoyable sexual relationship with someone I care for and love. That's the one thing that's been missing for 30 years."" In June, the World Health Organization officially recognised what it calls Compulsive Sexual Behaviour Disorder in its international classification of diseases. Therapists I've spoken to say that even though this falls short of classifying the condition as an addiction, it may encourage the UK government to provide counselling services on the NHS. In the last few weeks I have spoken to many other people who believe they are sex addicts, and I no longer believe it's important whether the condition is called an addiction or not - because all of them clearly need help to solve a problem that is wrecking their lives. When it comes to Weinstein, and the suspicion that checking into a sex addiction clinic could signal an attempt to dodge responsibility for his behaviour, the people I've spoken to understood the difference between consensual sex and rape even at the height of their compulsive behaviour. None, as far as I know, has committed a crime. In my view, sex addicts primarily hurt themselves and their partners - sex predators abuse victims and attempt to disguise it.

Morgan Sung,"Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate were so destructive, no other hurricanes will be given the same names. The World Meteorological Organization announced Thursday that it's retiring the names Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate from its rotation because of 2017's devastating season. It's replacing the names with Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel instead. SEE ALSO: Shell knew truth of global warming in 1980s; foresaw a Hurricane Sandy scenario WMO names each hurricane based on an alphabetical rotation of names, alternating between male and female names. The selection of names for each rotation is usually used every six years, so we won't see Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel come into use until 2023. If a hurricane is especially fatal and causes significant damage, its name is taken off the rotation and replaced with a different one. According to the WMO's FAQ, this naming system makes it easier for news outlets to report on the storms and increases community preparedness. ""Experience shows that the use of short, distinctive given names in written as well as spoken communications is quicker and less subject to error than the older more cumbersome latitude-longitude identification methods,"" WMO's FAQ says. WMO says that the 2017 hurricane season was ""one of the most destructive on record,"" with damages in the United States alone costing $250 billion. The 2017 hurricane season was one of the most destructive on record. Image: world METEOROLOGICAL organization The hurricanes taken off the WMO's rotation of names caused 224 deaths during their tropical cyclone phases. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria were the first Category 4 storms to make landfall in the United States on record. Irma and Maria both reached Category 5 storms when they made landfall on the Caribbean islands. The damage caused in the Caribbean is likely to take years to recover, according to WMO. Seventeen tropical storms were named in 2017, and 10 of those storms became hurricanes. Six reached ""major hurricane strength"" and clocked in at Category 3 or higher. This is above the average for annual storms; from 1981-2010, the average was 12 tropical storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. Harvey made landfall over or near Texas last August as a Category 4 hurricane. It lasted for four days, devastating Houston and causing the deaths of 68 people. It was the costliest hurricane after Katrina, causing an estimated $125 billion in damages. Irma caused significant destruction in the Caribbean as a Category 5 hurricane, nearly wiping out Barbuda. It was the first hurricane to make landfall in Cuba since 1932, and it prompted the evacuation of about 6 million people in southern Florida. Maria ripped through Dominica and Puerto Rico in September. Dominica's damages are estimated at $1.3 billion, or about 224 percent of its GDP according to WMO. The entire island of Puerto Rico lost power, which one report concluded was the second largest blackout in history. Nate crossed from Nicaragua to Honduras as a tropical storm, but made landfall as a category 1 hurricane. The rainfall from Nate caused 44 deaths in Central America. 2017 retired almost as many names as 2005, when the severe hurricane season resulted in WMO removing Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan, and Wilma from the rotation.","Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate were so destructive, no other hurricanes will be given the same names.

THOMAS FULLER,"“We have an ace card called China” in the dispute, he said. China imposed in September a complex formula that compels automakers to sell more electric cars starting in 2019 or be banned from selling gasoline-powered cars. In response, global automakers are moving to expand sharply their electric car production and sales. California is the largest market for electric cars in the United States, and the world’s second-largest after China. The Trump administration has begun moving to weaken overall fuel-economy standards in the United States. Still, Governor Brown said, California and China together are such an important part of global car sales that they represent “two formidable domains that even Mr. Trump can’t overcome.” The Chinese government said in September that it would phase out the sale of cars with internal combustion engines, a goal that Britain, France, India and Norway have already announced. Li Junfeng, a key architect of China’s energy policies and senior adviser, said on the conference sidelines that China had not yet picked a year for the phaseout to be completed. Still, he added, “I think China will be earlier than other countries.” California Online (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • An American citizen was mistakenly targeted for deportation.

BONNIE GREER,"I started as a professional actor when I was 16. After, I decided I wanted to train. I wanted to get a degree and intellectually develop myself. So I went off, and obviously I got a lot of debt from university, which was probably a bad move. But never mind, you live and learn. Shakespeare’s Globe was started by Sam Wanamaker, an actor. Mark Rylance was artistic director; an actor. Michelle Terry is now the artistic director; an actor. It really felt like I was in an actor’s space. Shakespeare’s Globe is built near the Bard’s original playhouse, and you’ve put him onstage. And yet, the play feels very contemporary. Shakespeare was hugely experimental. When he built the Globe and when he wrote a play, it was like an experiment to see how the audience would take it. For me to work here as an actor and director, how do I make a production in which the audience experience is as close to Emilia’s emotional journey as possible? It was important to reflect Emilia’s story with a contemporary mirror, so that she feels important to us as a figure today, as a woman of the world. She reflects back to us our own strength and potential, and our own fire and our fight. This is part of me. And I feel very fortunate to have joined the ranks of the women of color who are directing on London’s main stages.

Chris Taylor,"Larry Harvey, the co-founder of the Burning Man festival who grew it from an event on a San Francisco beach to a desert arts festival of global significance, died Saturday. He was 70. Harvey had been hospitalized after a stroke on April 4, and had remained in critical condition. ""Though we all hoped he would recover, he passed peacefully this morning at 8:24am in San Francisco, with members of his family at his side,"" wrote Burning Man CEO Marian Goodall in the organization's official announcement. SEE ALSO: Burning Man Isn't What You Think, and Never Has Been Harvey's story has already passed into countercultural legend. A former landscape gardener and carpenter, he and his friend Jerry James decided to burn a large wooden figure of a man on San Francisco's Baker Beach in 1986. The Burning Man event, repeated annually, began to draw exponentially increasing numbers of attendees — so many that Harvey and friends needed a new location where it could grow relatively unchecked by authorities. In 1990 they found one in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, and the week-long extravaganza of Burning Man began. Much of the event's energy in those early years was provided by the Cacophony Society, a culture-jamming collective of California artists. But it was Harvey who became the face and the driving force behind Burning Man's expansion. After a particularly anarchic version of the festival in 1996, in which one participant ran his car over a number of people in tents, Harvey oversaw Burning Man's transformation into Black Rock City — a temporary urban environment with roads, gas lamps and an army of volunteers. Harvey was a self-educated deep thinker who would never use one word where a paragraph would do. He was often to be found delivering lectures and giving interviews, his signature cowboy hat never far from his head. But that ceaseless brain provided the philosophy and principles that made Burning Man what it is today — a year-round global network with 85 official regional events on six continents. He insisted that the event resist commercialization, so that even now, with around 70,000 regular annual attendees, the only things you can buy with actual money at Burning Man are ice and coffee. He balanced the ""radical self reliance"" needed to survive in the harsh desert environment with a ""gift economy"" culture — encouraging participants to offer goods and services freely to others in the name of community. Harvey insisted that everyone think of themselves as a participant and a provider; at Burning Man, there were to be ""no spectators."" Indeed, the volunteerism rate at Black Rock City — roughly 70% of attendees get involved with one of the events' many sub-organizations such as the Lamplighters or the Department of Public Works — has amazed the urban planners and city managers who made the pilgrimage. Burning Man's fame soon far outgrew the numbers who made the actual trek to Black Rock. In particular, Silicon Valley took to the event with a vengeance. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos were regular attendees. Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page were not only enthusiastic Burners themselves, but chose their CEO, Eric Schmidt, because he was the only candidate who had been to Burning Man. SEE ALSO: Make Burning Man suck again! Harvey allowed and accommodated the increasing number of celebrities (such as Kanye West and Katy Perry) to attend. He weathered storms of grumbles from old-time Burners over the ""turnkey"" camps that accommodated the rich, pointing out that only 2 percent of attendees were members of society's wealthiest 1 percent. He soothed the event's constant conflicts with its landlords at the Bureau of Land Management, and encouraged the artists whose work has spread out from the festival, now installed in locations such as Las Vegas and the San Francisco Bay Bridge. But his mind was forever on the philosophy behind the event and the good it could do in the world at large. Burning Man was never just a party or an arts festival to Harvey; it was what anarchists call a Temporary Autonomous Zone, a space to try different ways of living, that would inspire change back in the ""default world."" Harvey called Burning Man a ""hundred year movement,"" and felt that regional events known as ""burns"" would soon overtake the need for one central Burning Man. And still it grew. Every year Harvey designated a theme for the event — from the simple (""Floating World,"" a nod to the prehistoric lake bed of Black Rock) to the historical (""Da Vinci's Workshop"") to the obscure (""Caravansary""). Some themes were more successful than others, but they all inspired jaw-dropping art and playfully improvised theme camps. Harvey had initially set up Burning Man as a private corporation — one that began to take in more than $10 million in annual ticket revenue. (Its expenditure often matched that, not least because the BLM kept raising its land use fees). Facing down criticism on this front, Harvey turned the organization into a nonprofit. He ceded day-to-day management to Goodall, his dear friend and colleague for 22 years, and designated himself Chief Philosophical Officer. A sign above his office door read ""Larry Harvey does not exist."" But he did. He most definitely did, and he changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people who have attended the event and found it to be transformational. ""Larry Harvey had an idea and because of that idea my life changed forever,"" wrote one attendee on Facebook who first got together with her husband at the event. ""That idea brought me dozens of amazing friends from across the globe, obscene amounts of fun, broken bones, an empty wallet, dreadful over-confidence, desert survival skills (sometimes), the ability to cook dinner for 50 people in tent in a sandstorm, some beautiful corsets, a half-share in a lock-up garage in Reno, camping kit that's eternally full of gypsum, and the love of my life."" Harvey is survived by a son, a brother, a nephew, and a hundred-year movement.","Larry Harvey, the co-founder of the Burning Man festival who grew it from an event on a San Francisco beach to a desert arts festival of global significance, died Saturday.

MICHAEL GOLD,"When the woman refused, the complaint said, Mr. Weinstein threatened her career, suggesting that she would never work as an actress unless she acquiesced.

Soon after the alleged incident, Mr. Weinstein began calling and texting the woman about every two weeks, the court documents said. Each time, he told her that he was the only person who could help her become an actress. According to the complaint: A few years later, Mr. Weinstein called the woman, who told him she was dating a wealthy man so that he would leave her alone. He then became possessive and repeatedly chastised her for being sexually unavailable for him. He later showed up at her residence, but security refused to let him in. The woman had other dealings with Mr. Weinstein over the next several years as she continued to pursue acting, the court filing said. He offered her a role as an extra in The Nanny Diaries in 2004, the court filing said, but he told her she would have to be very good to him in return. She eventually took the role. In 2006, the woman said she asked Mr. Weinstein for a recommendation to acting school. After he provided the letter, the complaint said, he invited her to have a drink, but she declined.

Jack Morse,"The internet is a confusing place. It's not always clear if that weird Twitter account spamming your mentions is a well-intentioned idiot or a malicious actor  unless you work for the social media giant itself, that is. 
Speaking to a group of security researchers and journalists at the annual RSA conference in San Francisco, Twitter vice president of trust and safety Del Harvey explained that the company is remarkably good at distinguishing between accounts intentionally spreading misinformation and those just plain ignorant of basic facts. Essentially, Harvey explained, Twitter has a pretty good idea whether or not you believe the bullshit you're spreading. 
SEE ALSO: Cryptography experts are already laughing at 'Facebook Coin'
Harvey was speaking in response to a question from moderator Ted Schlein. Schlein, a general partner at Kleiner Perkins, had asked the assembled panel which included Facebook head of cybersecurity Nathaniel Gleicher about the difficulties of moderating content on the guests' respective platforms.  
""Is there a difference between someone who intentionally uses false information for manipulative purposes versus someone who truly believes [what] they're propagating, but what they're propagating is just false?"" asked Schlein. ""Do you look at that as two different scenarios? Those are behaviors that actually kind of look the same.""
Harvey jumped in to let Schlein know that he'd be surprised to learn what things actually look like from Twitter's perspective. 
""I would actually say that if you really go into the behavior they don't actually look that similar,"" she explained. 
Essentially, she continued, there are various tells that Twitter's security team knows to look for to determine at least in its mind the motivations behind certain posts.
""Because, if you're talking about disinformation, you are deliberately and knowingly spreading information that is untrue,"" Harvey continued. ""Then, in order to do that, there are certain things that you're likely going to be doing. You're going to be targeting certain networks you may not actually have a natural home within that network so you're going to have to try to either work your way into it through some sort of social engineering, or you're going to try to amplify your content through the use of other accounts.""
This, according to Harvey, is a far cry from some random chumps posting anti-vaccination content in their spare time. She described our theoretical guileless disseminator of harmful garbage as ""somebody who is perhaps more a native of that network, who comes across and believes that information and then circulates it out to their network.""
Other warning signs include how other people on the platform initially engage with the tweeted falsehood. ""One of them looks very different in terms of even how others initially respond to it, and how it sort of enters into the conversation,"" Harvey concluded. 
Twitter execs, of course, have long spoken about identifying and removing ""coordinated inauthentic behavior,"" and this panel discussion did not make clear how much of an exact science the process really is (or isn't). But, at least according to Harvey, the company is pretty good at distinguishing between accounts intentionally screwing with us and the ones that just don't know any better.

JAN RANSOM,"The case against Mr. Weinstein, while unusual, was not implausible. Mr. Weinstein, a powerful movie producer “had recruited and enticed a young aspiring actress — with the promise of a film role and to use his considerable influence in the entertainment industry on her behalf, knowing that he would use means of force, fraud or coercion to cause her to engage in a sex act,” Judge Sweet wrote. He rejected Mr. Weinstein’s argument that nothing of value was exchanged with Ms. Noble. “For an aspiring actress, meeting a world-renowned film producer carries value, in and of itself,” the judge wrote. “The opportunity, moreover, for the actress to sit down with that producer in a private meeting to review her film reel and discuss a promised film role carries value that is career-making and life-changing. The contention, therefore, that Noble was given nothing of value — that the expectation of a film role, of a modeling meeting, of ‘his people’ being ‘in touch with her’ had no value — does not reflect modern reality.” Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer, Phyllis Kupferstein, said her client would appeal the decision. Even if the suit goes forward, she said, the case has no merit.","A judge has cleared the way for a lawsuit that claims Harvey Weinstein, shown in June after he was charged with sex assault, violated a federal sex-trafficking statute.",2018-08-15T11:08:56Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Is Harvey Weinstein a Sex Trafficker?

JAN RANSOM,"Lawyers for the defendants said the women have not demonstrated that their business or property was injured by any RICO violation, or provided evidence of witness tampering. They said the plaintiffs have failed to back allegations of sex trafficking because nothing of value was offered in exchange for sex. But the womens lawyer could argue that the explicit exchange was a job and a good movie for sex, Judge Hellerstein said. Defense lawyers in the criminal case say the allegations are too old and lack forensic evidence, like DNA. The prosecutor, Ms. Illuzzi-Orbon, wrote that the statute of limitations for rape in the third degree is five years from the date of the alleged crime. Defense lawyers in the civil case also said the claims do not fall within the statute of limitations, which range from one to four years. These plaintiffs allege their assaults occurred before 2012, Ms. Fegan said. However, Alafair S. Burke, a professor at Hofstra University School of Law, said the issue is complicated. The statute of limitations is four years, but the Supreme Court has not announced a final rule for determining when the clock starts to tick, she said. The conventional wisdom is that the measurement commences when the plaintiff has notice of injuries. But plaintiffs can argue that the period is tolled the clock stopped, in other words based on further misconduct by the defendants or a conspiracy.","The cases — one criminal, the other civil — will be decided in two Manhattan courtrooms, and include allegations ranging from sexual assault to a cover-up by his former company.",2018-09-22T01:26:18Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",5 Ways Harvey Weinstein’s Lawyers Plan to Fight the Accusations Against Him,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/nyregion/weinstein-sexual-assault-defense.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/22/nyregion/22weinstein/00weinstein-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Harvey,0
NEIL GENZLINGER,"But the big prize, the boxes of silver the ship had been carrying, remained elusive, because the Chameau had not simply sunk; it had been smashed to pieces in a particularly violent death, its wreckage strewn over a wide area. Some pieces had washed ashore by the morning after the wreck; an expedition the next year was the first to search for the missing treasure but did not find much. After that initial encounter with the Chameau’s cannons, Mr. Storm began studying up on the ship and its demise. In an account written for the 1990 book “The Island: New Perspectives on Cape Breton History, 1713-1990,” he recalled that two stories about the wreck were going around locally at the time. “One was that two men trawling for herring in the area of Chameau Rock had hauled up a pouch so heavy that it required the strength of both men to lift it out of the water,” he wrote. “As they were lifting it aboard, the stitches gave way, the pouch split and hundreds of silver coins spilled back into the sea. The second tale noted that some lobster fishermen once hurried home and rigged up long poles with tar-covered mops at the end, then returned to the location. They dipped the sticky mops into the water and recovered many coins.” Mr. Storm and two partners, Harvey MacLeod and David MacEachern, on a boat called the Marilyn B. II, set out to look for the treasure in June 1965. They took a scholarly approach, mapping known pieces of the wreck on a grid to try to figure out where the 1725 storm might have scattered the debris. Wind, strong tides and fog made it difficult work, as did the cold water, despite their wet suits. “We spent hours shivering in front of a tiny stove in the shelter of the wheelhouse,” Mr. Storm wrote, “but we persevered.” After Mr. Storm’s encouraging find on Sept. 19, bad weather kept the men from resuming the search for three days. Finally, he and Mr. MacEachern were able to dive the site again. While Mr. MacEachern searched nearby, Mr. Storm explored a crevice in a rock. “It was filled to the brim with slate-gray coins, just like the silver ones recovered a few days earlier,” he wrote. “The scene gave me a strange feeling, a mixture of disbelief and joy. I picked up a few and turned to let Dave know. It was not necessary. He loomed behind holding both hands outstretched in front of him, both full of coins.”","From left, Alex Storm, Harvey MacLeod and David MacEachern with some of the coins they salvaged from the sunken wreck of the Chameau, an 18th-century French ship, in 1965.",2018-08-24T04:26:02Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Alex Storm, Who Found a Long-Lost Treasure at Sea, Dies at 80",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/obituaries/alex-storm-dead.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/24/obituaries/24STORM1/24STORM1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Harvey,0
MELENA RYZIK,"“What I saw today when I looked at him on the news, he’s now experiencing all the things he’s put everybody else through,” Ms. Burr said. “Humiliation, worthlessness, fear, weakness, aloneness, loss, suffering and embarrassment. And it’s only the beginning for him.” Mr. Weinstein once reigned as an awards season deity, but Hollywood has long since processed his absence, and the arrest was met quietly there at the start of the Memorial Day weekend. On social media, some of Mr. Weinstein’s high-profile accusers reveled in his transformation from mogul to perp. “We got you, Harvey Weinstein, we got you,” Rose McGowan, who was among the first to come forward with allegations against him, wrote on Twitter. Speaking on “Good Morning America,” Ms. McGowan said that seeing Mr. Weinstein in handcuffs — a “visceral” desire she had — might help overcome the anxiety she otherwise felt when she saw images of him, a feeling others echoed. “It’s definitely been hard reliving it because I had buried it a long time ago,” said Ms. Dunning, who said she sat at her kitchen table, watching the video clip of Mr. Weinstein in cuffs over and over. When Ms. Dunning was a young actress and design student, she said, Mr. Weinstein invited her to a hotel to discuss career prospects, and then propositioned her; she fled. She soon left acting, and is now a costume designer. When Ms. d’Amore, who said Mr. Weinstein raped her in a New York hotel room in the 1970s, burst into tears in a department store on Friday, she was surprised at her own reaction, she said. “This has had such a huge impact on my life, more than I realized for so many years,” she said. “I’m not even close to sorting it all out.” Judith Godrèche, a French actress who lives in Los Angeles, said she worried about Mr. Weinstein’s sway for years after she rebuffed his advances at the Cannes film festival in 1996. “There are some things you can’t repair: women’s souls and bodies and memories and traumas that are going to be there forever, careers that have been damaged,” she said. “You can’t get that back.”","Women who had accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment, assault and abuse swung between hope and disbelief, watching a day they thought would never come.",2018-05-26T00:56:07Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Weinstein in Handcuffs Is a ‘Start to Justice’ for His Accusers,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/nyregion/metoo-accusers-harvey-weinstein.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/26/nyregion/26metoo/26metoo-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Harvey,0
JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.,"Former members of the sex crimes unit said it is standard procedure to rigorously vet a victim’s credibility to avoid surprises at trial. “You better know everything that might come out,” one said. “It’s not personal.” Manhattan prosecutors were also known for nixing arrests they felt would not stand up in court. As a result, the police closed proportionately fewer rape cases in Manhattan than other boroughs, but prosecutors had a high conviction rate. “They spend an exorbitant amount of time doing those kinds of investigations, working with victims, going through the facts and screening out cases that don’t fall within the penal law,” said one former Manhattan prosecutor, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he still has professional dealings with the office. The advocates’ complaints about the sex crimes unit remained muted until last October, when exposes in The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed that numerous women had made sexual harassment complaints about Mr. Weinstein. The reports led to a cascade of sexual misconduct accusations against other powerful men. Mr. Vance came under fire for his decision not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein in 2015 after an Italian model, Ambra Battilana, accused him of groping her breasts and trying to put his hand up her skirt during a business interview at his office. Ms. Battilana had recorded Mr. Weinstein admitting touching her breasts, but Martha Bashford, chief of the sex crimes unit, determined the case could not be proven, in part because Ms. Battilana had given shifting accounts of sworn testimony in another sexual assault case in Italy. Mr. Vance agreed. Mr. Weinstein had hired Elkan Abramowitz, a friend and campaign donor to Mr. Vance, to represent him and had paid for private investigators to dig up information about her statements in the Italian case. Michael Bock, a former sergeant in the special victims division, said Ms. Bashford had questioned Ms. Battilana for hours about her statements in Italy, reducing her to tears. “The whole thing smells,” he said.","Cyrus R.

JAN RANSOM,"For the next two weeks, Mr. Weinstein harassed her, calling her often and idling his car outside her residence, she said in the complaint. On Dec. 23, Ms. de la Huerta said Mr. Weinstein called her and said he was waiting in the lobby of her apartment building. He refused to leave until she met him. Ms. de la Huerta said she had been drinking heavily that night because she was fearful and depressed, rendering herself unable to consent to any disputed sexual encounter. Mr. Weinstein promised Ms. de la Huerta that they would resolve the matter, but once inside her apartment, the complaint said, he overpowered her and raped her a second time. Ms. de la Huerta said she again encountered Mr. Weinstein at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills following a British Academy of Television Arts event on Jan. 15, 2011. He had promised to speak to her regarding their dispute, she said, but then appeared at the entrance of his hotel room in a robe and exposed himself. Ms. de la Huerta fled and Mr. Weinstein appeared angered by her rejection and denunciation, the complaint said. Ms. de la Huerta said she experienced severe emotional distress after the incident and began drinking heavily. The next day, an intoxicated Ms. de la Huerta was turned away from an after-party at the Chateau Marmont hotel. And a video, which aired on the news on Jan. 17, captured her stumbling and falling. The lawsuit said Ms. de la Huerta was warned by Weinstein that any effort to take legal action against him would fail and would prompt him to interfere with her future success and career as an actress. Indeed, Ms. de la Huerta suggested that Mr. Weinstein had destroyed her career. Her complaint included photographs of Mr. Weinstein conversing with Martin Scorsese, the producer of Boardwalk Empire. Three weeks later, Ms. de la Huerta was terminated from the show, causing her to believe that Mr. Weinstein was making good on threats to harm her career if she defied him. Pointing to a loss of income and work, she is seeking $60 million in damages.","Unable to persuade the Manhattan district attorney to take her case, the “Boardwalk Empire” actress said in a lawsuit the producer raped her twice.",2018-11-14T01:51:44Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Actress Paz de la Huerta, Alleging Rape, Sues Harvey Weinstein for $60 Million",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/nyregion/actress-sues-weinstein-paz-de-la-huerta.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/14/nyregion/14weinstein/14weinstein-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Harvey,0

JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.,"Prosecutors are also investigating at least one other allegation, first reported in The New Yorker, that Mr. Weinstein forced a student actress, Lucia Evans, to perform oral sex on him during a business meeting at his office in 2004, two people familiar with the investigation said. Prosecutors have also expanded the inquiry to include possible financial crimes involving Mr. Weinstein’s former production company, subpoenaing a wide range of records. The team looking at Mr. Weinstein also includes prosecutors from the Major Economic Crimes Bureau, according to two people familiar with the subpoenas. Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said the sexual encounters the district attorney’s office has been scrutinizing were consensual. “The substantial delay in this investigation has been the result of serious flaws that are apparent with respect to any claim of non-consensual sex,” he said. He also denied Mr. Weinstein had committed any financial wrongdoing, asserting that he had reimbursed his former company for all personal expenditures. Now the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., has turned to Ms. Illuzzi, one of the most successful prosecutors in his office. A veteran homicide prosecutor, she was on the team that won a conviction against Pedro Hernandez for the killing of 6-year-old Etan Patz. In 2016, she ran as the Republican candidate for district attorney on Staten Island, where she lives; she lost to the Democratic candidate, Michael McMahon. By turning to Ms. Illuzzi, Mr. Vance has tapped someone with expertise in cold cases in which there is little or no physical evidence and the credibility of witnesses is paramount. But he is also tapping a lawyer who has had to make difficult and politically fraught decisions in high-profile cases. In 2011, she led the investigation to determine if Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, had sexually assaulted Nafissatou Diallo, who worked as a housekeeper in the hotel where Mr. Strauss-Kahn was staying. In that case, Ms Illuzzi ultimately recommended the indictment be thrown out after evidence emerged undermining Ms. Diallo’s reliability as a witness. The decision was a political setback for Mr. Vance, though he won re-election in 2013 and 2017. Photo Harvey Weinstein Credit Andrew Kelly/Reuters Mr. Vance declined to say why he had assigned Ms. Illuzzi to the Weinstein investigation. “This investigation is active and ongoing,” said Mr. Vance’s spokesman, Danny Frost. “It would be inappropriate to comment on investigative personnel except to say that we are staffing the matter appropriately as it moves forward.” Carrie A. Goldberg, a Brooklyn lawyer representing Ms. de la Huerta and Ms. Evans, had criticized Mr. Vance for not moving more quickly to seek an indictment against Mr. Weinstein. In December she accused his office of “being complicit in Mr. Weinstein’s evading punishment.” She said on Wednesday, however, that Ms. Illuzzi had given the investigation new energy. “The victims see her involvement as a sign from Cyrus Vance that he is treating this case more seriously,” she said. “We have reason to expect the district attorney of New York to act soon.” Ms. Illuzzi took over the case from Maxine B. Rosenthal, an experienced sex-crimes prosecutor known for a hard-nosed style. “They are both heavy hitters, both widely respected,” Evan Krutoy, a former Manhattan prosecutor, said. In 2009, Ms. Rosenthal oversaw the prosecution of Joseph Brooks, an Oscar-winning song writer turned movie producer, who was charged with drugging and raping aspiring actresses he lured to his apartment with promises of auditions. ( Mr. Brooks died in an apparent suicide before his trial.) Ms. Illuzzi declined to comment on her new role. Ms. Rosenthal did not respond to a message from a reporter. The investigation is being overseen by Martha Bashford, the chief of the office’s sex crimes bureau, who also declined to comment. Last year, Mr. Vance drew criticism for the handling of a March 2015 investigation into Mr. Weinstein’s behavior with Ambra Battilana, an Italian model. Ms. Battilana told the police Mr. Weinstein groped her breasts and tried to slide a hand up her skirt during an interview at his TriBeCa office. In a sting operation the next day, she captured audio of him admitting he had touched her breasts. Although the police believed they had a case, Mr. Vance’s office declined to prosecute. Ms. Bashford’s team found Ms. Battilana to be a problematic witness, who had given shifting accounts of a previous sexual assault complaint she made in Italy. The decision not to bring charges led to finger-pointing between members of the Police Department’s Special Victims Division, who believed they had evidence of “forcible touching,” and the district attorney’s office, whose prosecutors doubted the case could be won. Ms. Battilana later accepted a settlement payment and signed an agreement not to talk about what happened. But the political atmosphere surrounding sexual harassment has changed since Ms. Battilana made her complaint. More than 80 women, including several big-name actresses, have come forward with accusations against Mr. Weinstein, from unwanted touching to sexual assault. Scores of other women have come forward with stories of harassment in the workplace by other powerful men, leading to a cascade of resignations and firings. Last fall, as the storm over sexual harassment grew, Mr. Vance found himself on the defensive. Critics suggested he was gun-shy of taking on powerful men accused of sexual crimes after he was forced to drop the charges against Mr. Strauss-Kahn. In March, the governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, responding to calls from a Hollywood advocacy group fighting sexual harassment, directed the attorney general to review Mr. Vance’s handling of Ms. Battilana’s complaint. Mr. Vance has defended the decision, saying his office has a duty to bring charges only when it is convinced the crimes can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. “Any other course of action only serves to hurt the victims of sex crimes,” he said.

He remembers escaping years ago to the prairie to bird watch. One recent morning he drove me out there along the Grand Parkway and pulled into an unfinished subdivision. A saleswoman in a model home boasted about $1 billion worth of box stores and malls being built nearby. The development, she said, adheres to county standards requiring that houses be raised above the 100-year floodplain. The woman handed Mr. Blackburn a glossy brochure and a disclaimer, which he scanned before climbing back into the car, shaking his head. The disclaimer explained that roads outside the development, linking it to the parkway, occupy the 10-year floodplain, meaning they would have about a 10 percent chance of flooding every year. “These days that means they’ll flood anytime you look at them funny,” Mr. Blackburn said. “It’s the new normal.” That’s not far-off. The number of “heavy precipitation” events in the United States has skyrocketed since the 1960s. Since 1980, instances of extreme weather — hurricanes, floods, heat waves — linked to climate change have cost the United States $1.1 trillion. Studies show that for every dollar spent upfront in preparedness, American taxpayers could save $4 in emergency relief and reconstruction — not counting health costs, the impact of lost jobs and business revenues and incalculable grief. But that requires politicians to agree. “We suffered nothing short of a catastrophic disaster,” a veteran Texas lobbyist, Bill Miller, said. “It happens at a time when the people in the governing class in this state don’t believe in taxes and government. But they also don’t want anybody discouraged from coming here, because that’s bad for business.” An upbeat narrative casts business-friendly Texas in the loner role of swashbuckling cowboy, disdainful of coastal elites. “Don’t California my Texas” has become a rallying cry for Republican state lawmakers and a theme repeated by the governor, Greg Abbott, who has complained about “a patchwork quilt of bans and rules and regulations that is eroding the Texas model.” He believes cities are the culprit. For years, Texas Republicans promoted local controls to push against federal court orders on issues like desegregation and same-sex marriage. Now state leaders have made a U-turn. Mr. Abbott has complained about “political demagogues using climate change as an excuse to remake the American economy.” At a Republican gathering in June, he talked about the experience of driving out of the state’s capital, Austin. “It starts smelling different,” he told the audience. “And you know what that fragrance is? Freedom.” Little wonder, post-Harvey, that state and local officials have anointed different flood and recovery czars. Texas is sounding these days like Russia under the Romanovs. The system ensures nobody is clearly in charge. Least of all in Houston. A bill that would have allowed Harris County merely to issue the equivalent of parking tickets to developers violating floodplain regulations — the sort of regulations that control flooding — was vetoed by the governor. Two other bills to study flooding in the Houston region, introduced in the last legislative session, died in committee. And not long ago, when Houston’s Democratic mayor, Sylvester Turner, petitioned the governor to tap into the state’s multibillion-dollar Rainy Day Fund for post-Harvey debris removal, Mr. Abbott said he would not authorize money before 2019, when the Legislature is next scheduled to meet. I met with the mayor in City Hall at the time. He noted that the Legislature had convened a special session to ban gender-neutral bathrooms. “If they can meet about toilets, why can’t they meet when the toilets overflow?” one frustrated city official said, before Mr. Abbott came up with $50 million from a separate fund to stem growing criticism. Another official, this one with the county, made the point that the area around Houston is a patchwork of counties and municipalities with different rules and no coordination because Texans believed the upside of what became, in essence, institutionalized entropy was that it allowed residents to avoid the encumbrances of city governments, regulations and taxes. The problem is that hurricanes and floods, worsened by climate change, do not recognize political borders or county lines. Their toll is shared by everyone. The latest estimate from Moody’s puts recovery from Harvey at $81 billion, much of which will end up paid by taxpayers across the United States. “The whole trans-Mississippi pioneer enterprise was in fact brought to you by the federal government,” says Steven Conn, a historian and author of “Americans Against the City.” The hypocrisy of Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, resisting federal aid to the New York region after Hurricane Sandy but then requesting it for Texas after Harvey, is in fact part of this same history. Houston’s unregulated sprawl, Mr. Conn added, gives physical form to this politics of “decentralization and anti-statism.” Photo Bruce Hooper, outside his home in Kashmere Gardens in Houston, would like to move but has no place to go.

Credit Josh Haner/The New York Times A Houston Selling Point: It’s Not New York At the same time, Houston is in many ways a forward-looking, progressive city. Before it elected Mr. Turner, it elected a mayor who was a lesbian. The city is in thrall to cars and highways and has precious little mass transit, but the municipality of Houston relies more on renewable energy than any other big city in America. Houston has more green space, relative to paved, than New York. And what many Houston residents like about it, its supporters say, is precisely that it isn’t New York or San Francisco or Boston. They insist that its business-friendly, light-on-regulations approach helps account for a big rise in employment since 2000. A report by the city’s Center for Opportunity Urbanism, a pro-development organization, which cautions against overreacting to Harvey, said: “The city emanates a conviction that people should have the freedom to determine their destiny.” Photo Houston’s sprawl, and its dependence on the automobile, contributed to the misery that Hurricane Harvey unleashed. Credit Josh Haner/The New York Times Thomas Cole, director of the McGovern Center for Humanities and Ethics at the Texas Medical School of Houston, recalled how, during the 1960s, business leaders and politicians conspired with media executives to desegregate Houston quietly, seeing the turmoil that desegregation was causing elsewhere in the South. Decades later, Houston boasts of becoming the most diverse big city in the country, with comparatively low housing costs that translate to higher levels of minority homeownership. But what does “affordable” really mean if residents have to pay hefty transportation costs and rebuild, time and again, after floods? Houston’s affordability leans on loosely regulated, low-cost immigrant labor providing an abundance of cheaply made, slab-on-grade, single-family houses that sprawl on all that open land, in areas like the Katy Prairie. And it relies heavily on American taxpayers providing government tax credits, mortgage interest deductions, gas subsidies, artificially low flood insurance rates, highway construction money — and emergency relief, including buying out homeowners to remove their properties from harm’s way. Harris County officials say they have received as many requests for buyouts since the hurricane (3,000) as there have been buyouts since the mid-1990s. Harvey turned out to be an equal opportunity disaster. In Meyerland, an affluent district where Brays Bayou burst its banks, Steve and Julie Sacks’s house flooded for the third time in three years. They are among the homeowners hoping for a buyout. “But I’m not counting on one,” Mr. Sacks told me. Buying out rich homes to repurpose vulnerable areas like Meyerland for flood detention, as Mr. Sacks notes, would require loads of money and remove valuable properties from tax rolls in a county that relies on property taxes. Bruce Hooper would move, too. During Harvey, he woke up to crackling sounds, when floodwaters started to seep into his appliances and electrical outlets. Mr. Hooper lives in a poor area called Kashmere Gardens. I found him sitting on a tattered lawn chair outside the shell of his tumbledown rental. An unemployed former parks employee, Mr. Hooper told me that he and his family of five had to be airlifted out by the Coast Guard after a detention pond overflowed and water inside the house rose from ankle to chest high in an hour. He would live elsewhere, he said, but like many others without flood insurance or savings, “we got nowhere else to go.” Photo Andy and Christine Kahan inside their damaged home in Bear Creek Village. “Welcome to the war zone,” Mr. Kahan said. Credit Josh Haner/The New York Times As for Andy and Christine Kahan, they were among thousands who had no inkling they were especially vulnerable before Harvey. The Kahans own a single-story home in a middle-class neighborhood, Bear Creek Village. “The damn dam did us in,” Mr. Kahan said. The Kahans’s home was among those houses flooded by the reservoirs, which Harvey for the first time filled and threatened to overflow. Christine Kahan and her husband had lived for 28 years in their house without a flood. Now Ms. Kahan said she would entertain a buyout. A part-time real-estate agent, she advises clients to think twice about buying any home that flooded. Hers is now one of them. But Mr. Kahan says they will stay, for the time being. “I’m not a skeptic about climate change,” he told me. “It defies logic not to believe something is going on.” I asked how that lined up with his desire not to leave Bear Creek. “Harvey was an exception, an act of God,” he said, then added, “I know it doesn’t make sense. But I’m an optimist. “At least, I am until the next flood.” Continue reading the main story","Houston is drained by several meandering rivers, or bayous, that move water from west to east.

Michael R. Sisak,"NEW YORK -- A New York judge declined to dismiss sexual assault charges against Harvey Weinstein Thursday, rejecting the latest push from the disgraced film producer's lawyers to have his indictment thrown out.
Judge James Burke's ruling buoyed a prosecution that has appeared on rocky ground in recent months amid a prolonged defence effort to raise doubts about the case and the police investigation.
Weinstein's lawyers argued the case had been ""irreparably tainted"" by a detective's alleged coaching of a potential witness and one of the accusers. They also said the grand jury should have been shown evidence that Weinstein had exchanged friendly emails with his two accusers after the alleged attacks.
But Burke ruled that Weinstein's claims of prosecutorial misconduct had ""no basis."" He also denied Weinstein's request for an evidentiary hearing.
Weinstein's next court date is scheduled for March 7.
Weinstein's defence attorney, Benjamin Brafman, said he was disappointed with Burke's ruling, but said he remains confident Weinstein will be ""completely exonerated"" at trial.
""We intend to vigorously defend this case to the best of our ability,"" Brafman told reporters after the hearing. ""It does not in any way suggest that the case against Mr. Weinstein is going to end badly.""
Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex. He pleaded not guilty and is free on $1 million bail. He left court without commenting.
He is charged with raping an unidentified female acquaintance in his hotel room in 2013 and performing a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006. The Associated Press does not identify alleged victims of sexual assaults unless they come forward publicly.
Images of Weinstein, the notoriously bombastic producer of Oscar winners ""Shakespeare in Love"" and ""The English Patient,"" in handcuffs last spring were seen by many women as a cathartic moment in the .MeToo reckoning. About half a dozen women supporting Time's Up, including actresses Amber Tamblyn and Marisa Tomei, were at the hearing Thursday.
""Today, here in New York, we saw the first steps towards justice,"" Time's Up President Lisa Borders said after the judge's ruling.
Burke could have dismissed some or all of the charges, which would have been a major setback for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who was criticized for declining to pursue criminal charges against Weinstein when he was accused of groping an Italian model in 2015. Vance cited a lack of supporting evidence at the time, despite the existence of a clandestinely made recording of Weinstein discussing the episode with the woman.
But in recent months, Weinstein worked side-by-side with Brafman to throw doubt on the case and his accusers. They plucked emails from his movie studio's servers they say showed Weinstein had friendly, consensual relationships with the women.
Weinstein's defence was boosted in October by back-to-back allegations of misconduct in the police investigation.
Manhattan prosecutors dropped one of the charges against him -- allegations that he raped an aspiring actress who was still in college -- after evidence surfaced that Det. Nicholas DiGaudio instructed a potential witness to keep some of her doubts about the veracity of the allegations to herself.
DiGaudio allegedly told the witness in February that when she spoke to prosecutors, ""less is more."" That witness never testified before the grand jury that indicted Weinstein.
Burke, in his ruling, noted that count was dismissed not because prosecutors disbelieved the alleged victim but because they determined they may not have been able to prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.
Prosecutors also disclosed an allegation that DiGaudio urged the 2013 rape accuser to delete private material from her cellphones before handing them over to the DA's office.
Prosecutors said the material didn't pertain to Weinstein and the woman wound up not deleting anything. DiGaudio's union has said he ""was simply trying to get to the truth"" and wasn't trying to influence the investigation.
Late last month, Weinstein's lawyers said they spoke to a woman who said the rape accuser asked her to corroborate her allegations, but the friend wouldn't ""make up a story.""
The friend told investigators that Weinstein and the accuser had been ""hooking up"" consensually for a while and that she never heard her say anything bad about him until last year, Brafman said in a court filing.
In the months after The New York Times and The New Yorker began publishing stories about Weinstein's interactions with women, activists pressured Vance to bring charges as dozens of people came forward with claims of sexual misconduct against him.
New York Police officials poured on the pressure, too, saying publicly they believed they had gathered ample evidence to make an arrest.
Burke's ruling revealed that Weinstein had agreed in May to testify before the grand jury considering his case. He was arrested days later and then withdrew his notice to testify before the grand jury that charged him.",Weinstein judge: No merit in misconduct claims CTV News Jennifer Lawrence to face up to Harvey Weinstein in criminal hearing: report Winnipeg Sun Judge lets Harvey Weinstein case move forward CBC.ca Judge declines to throw out Harvey Weinstein criminal case P…,2018-12-20T06:34:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Ctvnews.ca'}",Weinstein judge: No merit in misconduct claims - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/weinstein-judge-no-merit-in-misconduct-claims-1.4225531,https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4225814.1545318776!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,,Ctvnews.ca,Harvey,0

VIVIAN WANG and JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.,"“It is of great concern that sexual assault cases have not been pursued with full vigor by our criminal justice system,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. “It is critical not only that these cases are given the utmost attention but also that there is public confidence in the handling of these cases.” The announcement also came the same day that Cynthia Nixon, an actress and education activist, announced her candidacy for governor ; Ms. Nixon, a Democrat, is widely expected to challenge Mr. Cuomo from the left. Mr. Vance’s office is currently investigating other claims against Mr. Weinstein, including that he twice raped the actress Paz de la Huerta. Mr. Cuomo’s statement said the review of Ms. Battilana’s case would not interfere with those open investigations, which he said would conclude within about 45 days. Afterward, the statement said, Mr. Schneiderman would review the entire matter and decide if further action was warranted. “We are deeply familiar with Harvey Weinstein’s years of egregious sexual abuse, and recently filed a civil rights lawsuit against him alleging severe and persistent abuse of employees at The Weinstein Company,” Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement. “We are committed to pursuing a full, fair and independent review of this matter.” Reports of possible conflicts of interest between Mr. Vance and Mr. Weinstein have circulated since last October, when a deluge of accusations against Mr. Weinstein, once one of Hollywood’s most powerful producers, sparked an international reckoning around sexual abuse. Two of the lawyers Mr. Weinstein retained after being brought in for questioning about his encounters with Ms. Battilana had personal and financial ties to Mr. Vance: Elkan Abramowitz was a former law partner of Mr. Vance and a donor to his campaign, and Daniel S. Connolly was a former prosecutor turned white-collar defense lawyer. Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers also brought on Linda Fairstein, a former Manhattan sex crimes prosecutor and close friend of the head of the district attorney’s sex crimes bureau, as a consultant; she facilitated an introduction between Mr. Abramowitz and the bureau head, Martha Bashford. And David Boies, a lawyer for Mr. Weinstein who hired a private investigative firm to dig up information in an attempt to stop The New York Times’s expose on his client, has given $55,000 to Mr. Vance over the years. Mr. Boies has said he never spoke to Mr. Vance about any criminal investigation of Mr. Weinstein. In Ms. Battilana’s case, Ms. Bashford determined after two weeks of investigation that she could not prove the crime of forcible touching or third-degree sexual abuse had been committed, even though she had the audio tape, Mr. Vance has said. Prosecutors judged it would be hard to prove Mr. Weinstein touched Ms. Battilana for sexual reasons because the advance came as the two were talking about Ms. Battilana becoming a lingerie model and whether her bosom had been surgically enhanced. Prosecutors have wide discretion in deciding whether to pursue charges, and it is not uncommon for assistant district attorneys not to see eye-to-eye with detectives on the strength of a case. But the tensions over Mr. Vance’s decision in the case have exploded in recent months into an open feud between some detectives in the Police Department’s special victims unit and the district attorney. For detectives, assembling enough evidence to establish that it is probable someone committed a crime — known in law as “probable cause” — is enough to make an arrest. Prosecutors, however, must take things further and prove every element of the crime in court, and that can often be a much higher bar. “The police have a job to do, and we have a job to do, and they are very different jobs,” Mr. Vance said in an interview Monday night. “Our job is to ensure that any case that we bring has proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard we have to meet in court. Any other course of action only serves to hurt the victims of sex crimes. If you are trying cases where you don’t have the proof, that’s not going to be a satisfactory outcome for the survivor.” Mr. Vance also issued a joint statement with the police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, in which he called his office and the Police Department “fully committed partners in the investigation and prosecution of sexual assault.” “From time to time we’ll have our disagreements, but we will never allow them to undermine this shared endeavor,” the statement said.

Back Story Many Americans awoke last week to news that most Britons, several time zones ahead, had heard first: Prince Harry and his American girlfriend, Meghan Markle, were engaged. But when King Edward VIII gave up the throne in December 1936 to marry an American, England was seemingly the last to know. Photo The former King Edward VIII, then the Duke of Windsor, and Wallis Simpson on their wedding day in France in June 1937. Credit Associated Press The British news media largely blacked out coverage of Edward’s yearslong affair with the American socialite Wallis Simpson, who by that time was divorcing her second husband. Pages were reportedly even torn from foreign magazines, which were writing freely about the couple. The average Briton was unprepared for the looming constitutional crisis when the affair was publicly revealed and Parliament refused to allow the marriage. As The Times wrote, “Public in London Is Bewildered.” In a changed world, the royal family has struggled against the intrusive media attention, particularly in the marriage and divorce of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and in Diana’s death. But Harry and his brother, William, have tried to establish a respectful relationship with the news media ( despite the occasional warning ). Ultimately, the news of Harry and Ms. Markle’s engagement received a far warmer reception than that of Edward, the brother of Harry’s great-grandfather.

"JOHN SCHWARTZ, JAMES GLANZ and ANDREW W. LEHREN","Shifting Terrain As early as 2006, The Woodlands filed a plan for a new subdivision on thousands of acres containing “wooded areas and a few rural home sites,” according to documents obtained from Harris County. But it was not until the years leading up to 2011, when the Hughes Corporation put together the final pieces of its purchase of The Woodlands, that the housing market caught up with the plan. Houston shook off the wreckage of the subprime mortgage crisis and encountered a very different problem: a shortage of housing on the high end of the market. Touching off the surge in demand was an announcement by Exxon that it was opening a new corporate campus in nearby Spring. Exxon was far from alone, as a growing list of companies relocated to the area. So did tens of thousands of workers, drawn by the boom in fracking technologies that none other than Mr. Mitchell and colleagues had coaxed, tweaked and perfected over nearly 20 years. That influx would have all but saturated the existing home market, said Bill Gilmer, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. It drove a spike in land prices, allowing developers to consider new construction on relatively low-cost lots that previously would have been too costly to improve. “This would just give you the opportunity to make those extensive improvements and still come out ahead,” Mr. Gilmer said. FEMA maps of The Woodlands showed a tantalizing stretch of undeveloped land hard by a waterway called Spring Creek — including acreage in the 2006 plan. Building right along the creek would have been out of the question, but farther south, portions of the land were slightly above the 100-year flood plain, according to the maps. Those who knew the land and its history saw warning signs. Nick Rife, whose family owned land in the area, said he used to hunt there “when it wasn’t flooded.” By bringing in thousands of dump truck loads of dirt, it would be possible to expand the acreage above the flood plain, making the whole area suitable for construction. That is exactly what The Woodlands decided to do, documents show. The former edges of the flood plain run through what are now the lots of Ms. Martinez and Mr. Hickey, the longtime Woodlands resident who once worked for Mr. Mitchell and had built a new home in the neighborhood. On the strip of land containing Wood Drake Place — Ms. Martinez’s street — 60,907 cubic yards of dirt were laid down. FEMA approved a map change for that area on Feb. 8, 2011, documents show. The large extrusion of development around Lake Reverie Place — Mr. Hickey’s street — and the nearby Sundown Ridge Place got 19,890 cubic yards of dirt. On June 13, 2013, FEMA approved a map change for what would become lots for the 81 homes in those areas. The result: neighborhoods that seemed safe from flooding. When Esteban and Paola Seañez moved into their home next to Spring Creek in 2015, their mortgage company assured them that the plot was high and dry. When the couple asked about flood insurance, “They said, ‘You don’t even have to purchase it,’” Ms. Seañez recalled. Photo The view outside Ms. Martinez’s second-floor window this week. Credit Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times Last year, after water came within several feet of their door, Mr. Hickey’s neighbors James and Gayle Soeder inquired about flood insurance. Initially, the agent warned that the policy would be very expensive; the house was in a flood plain, she said. Mr. Soeder, who knew he had bought a home at the 500-year elevation, asked her to check again. “We see that the flood plain was revised recently,” the agent said. So, for a bargain rate of $450 per year, the Soeders became one of the families in the neighborhood to be covered by insurance when Harvey struck. A number of residents asked whether managers of The Woodlands since Mr. Mitchell had been as careful as its predecessors in designing the newer developments, and pointed to what they called more aggressive policies since the Howard Hughes Corporation — a brand revived in 2010 by the activist investor Bill Ackman — took over. Mr. Hickey dug into damage statistics and found that his recently constructed neighborhood flooded at far higher rates than others in The Woodlands. In older parts of the community, his research revealed, about 215 out of 33,000 homes flooded during Harvey, or less than 1 percent — a far smaller percentage than many other communities in the greater Houston area. Yet among homes built in more recent years in Harris County, 331 out of 4,993 flooded, or more than 6 percent. In the newest areas of that Harris County expansion, including those where the Soeder, the Hickey and the Seañez families live, 331 out of 1,450 homes were affected — a whopping 23 percent. Mr. Hickey questioned whether adequate measures had been taken in the fill project to provide water storage and drainage in big storms. Marc Crudgington, who bought his home the year after Ms. Martinez and her husband did, voiced similar concerns. “They’ve filled in lakes that have been around forever just so they can build on them, and clear-cut trees like nobody’s business,” he said. “Our name for it is not The Woodlands, it’s Concrete Land.” The company stated that “the senior development team is ‘essentially the same team’ that has worked on The Woodlands for 25 years.” Tim Welbes, co-president of The Woodlands Development Company, said the company had complied with FEMA standards for its homes, but that the neighborhood had been overwhelmed by the storm’s waters. “We met the standard,” he said. “This event exceeded the standard.” Still, at a recent meeting of The Woodlands Storm Drainage Task Force, residents expressed anger at local officials over the damage to homes from Hurricane Harvey — and, for many of them, from earlier floods. This task force was actually formed last year in response to previous flooding, and little had been done to improve the situation before Harvey.

Kara Alaimo,"Kara Alaimo, an assistant professor of public relations at Hofstra University, is the author of "" Pitch, Tweet, or Engage on the Street: How to Practice Global Public Relations and Strategic Communication."" She was spokeswoman for international affairs in the Treasury Department during the Obama administration. Follow her on Twitter @karaalaimo. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) On Sunday, The New York Times reported that Italian actress Asia Argento, whose allegations that she was sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein helped launch the #MeToo movement, has been accused of sexual assault herself. According to documents that the Times obtained through encrypted email from an unidentified source, after Argento made her public accusations against Weinstein, she was accused of assaulting the actor and musician Jimmy Bennett and later paid Bennett $380,000. The Times reported that, at the time of the alleged assault, Bennett had just turned 17 -- and was therefore under California's age of consent, which is 18 -- while Argento was 37. Neither the Times nor CNN has been able to reach Argento for comment, and we don't know whether the allegations are true. On Monday, Jimmy Bennett's attorney, Gordon K. Sattro, issued a statement in which the actor declined to comment on the Times report. There is no question that such ugly accusations against such a significant leader of #MeToo don't help the movement, giving ammunition to misogynists who question women's stories of sexual harassment and abuse. But do they present it with a setback? They do not. They are, actually, evidence of its success. Whatever the truth of his allegations, Bennett's apparent willingness to challenge Argento shows that he is aware that the barriers to men reporting allegations of sexual abuse may finally be breaking down. Consider that one reason perpetrators are able to get away with sexual crimes -- against women or men -- is that they are often never accused. According to the US Department of Justice's 2016 National Crime Victimization Survey, the most recent available, just 23% of rapes and sexual assaults are reported to the police. A major reason for this is because victims are embarrassed to speak out. A 2006 survey of college students found that ""shame, guilt, or embarrassment"" were significant barriers to reporting rape. But the flood of victims who have disclosed sexual abuse as part of the #MeToo movement is beginning to erode the fears many victims associate with reporting assault. The women -- including Argento -- who have spoken out against prominent men thought to be untouchable have set a powerful example. This could explain why Bennett was reportedly willing to challenge Argento, initially, with a lawsuit seeking $3.5 million in damages. The allegations could also encourage more men to report sexual abuse. Although the #MeToo movement has focused largely on female victims, men are often the victims of sexual assault. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, 24.8% of American men experience sexual violence at some point in their lives. But social stigmas to reporting such abuse are especially strong for men. For example, the survey of college students found that men were significantly more likely than women to report that ""shame, guilt, or embarrassment"" were reasons not to report rape. Now, recent claims by men that they have been victims of sexual abuse -- such as the actor Brendan Fraser's allegation that in 2003 he was groped by the former president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (the accused, Philip Berk, told GQ he ""pinched"" Fraser in jest), and the actor Terry Crews' assertion that he was groped by a ""high level Hollywood executive"" -- show that some men are emboldened to report such incidents. Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Junot Diaz, who was accused of sexual abuse but vindicated in an investigation by MIT, where he teaches, has also written publicly about being raped as a child. In testimony before the Senate last June, Crews called on other men to talk openly about sexual assault. This national conversation is long overdue. Hopefully, the latest disturbing allegations will teach other men that there's no shame in speaking up if they are victims of abuse -- and that it's possible to challenge the mighty. As Tarana Burke, who founded the #MeToo movement, tweeted on Monday, ""I've said repeatedly that the #metooMVMT is for all of us, including these brave young men who are now coming forward."" Burke also tweeted, ""Sexual violence is about power and privilege. That doesn't change if the perpetrator is your favorite actress, activist or professor of any gender."" That may be the most powerful lesson of all.","On Sunday, The New York Times reported that Italian actress Asia Argento, whose allegations that she was sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein helped launch the #MeToo movement, has been accused of sexual assault herself.",2018-08-20T22:14:32Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Opinion: What the Asia Argento sexual assault allegations tell us,https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/20/opinions/asia-argento-sexual-assault-allegations-alaimo/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180820120539-asia-argento-jimmy-bennett-split-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,Harvey,0

I have lost a dear friend who I've known, loved, and worked beside for nearly 22 years."" Harvey had a stroke April 4, she said. ""As he told one of us recently, Larry liked to create 'scenes' that made people consider the world in a new way. He was extraordinarily successful at doing just that.""

Here’s an antacid: a literate, perpetually curious, good-humored and prolific chronicler of scientific wonders, astonishing optical illusions, space-exploration tidbits and just about anything else that tickles one’s intellectual fancy.” A pair of photographs widely circulated on Chinese social media this week invoked the Boxer Rebellion, a painful chapter of China’s history, as a commentary on how the country’s position in the world had changed. The Boxer Rebellion began in northern China in the late 19th century, when foreign powers had established concessions in major cities.

Credit Hulton Archive, via Getty Images A conservative and superstitious militia called the Yihetuan — known as “Boxers” in English because its members practiced martial arts — was killing Christian missionaries and Chinese Christians. With the eventual support of the ruling Qing dynasty, the Boxers forced diplomats and other foreigners to take refuge in the Beijing Legation Quarter for 55 days in 1900. An alliance of eight states (Austria-Hungary, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the U.S.) sent thousands of troops to rescue the diplomats, with atrocities committed all around as they defeated Chinese forces. The foreign troops began a yearlong occupation of Beijing and other cities, resulting in rape and the rampant looting of Chinese property.","President Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on the news in Seoul, South Korea, today.

Mark Kaufman,"Most polar bear populations are in okay shape today, and this comes with a problem: Climate change deniers, often in the form of bloggers, employ this fleeting reality to promote skepticism about the idea that the planet is warming. The broad argument is that if polar bears — who largely depend on Arctic sea ice to find food — are doing okay, then there must be doubt about the effect that fossil fuel emissions have on the global climate. Yet, observable evidence of human-caused global warming's impact is abounding, especially when it comes to Arctic sea ice. The last four winters have seen the four lowest maximum sea ice extents on record. SEE ALSO: Thawing chunks of Arctic sea ice trapped and sunk boats in the Atlantic Ocean So, climate deniers use polar bears as a tool. ""The magnitude of evidence would overwhelm these bloggers, so they focus on polar bears,"" Jeffrey Harvey, a population ecologist and senior scientist at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology, said in an interview. ""You pick one or two topics when the evidence is not in your favor."" Harvey, along with 13 other researchers, including polar scientists and climatologists, published a report in the journal BioScience on Tuesday, illustrating how internet bloggers have denied the impacts of human-induced global warming on polar bears to cast doubt on climate change science. This, the researchers argue, presents freely-available and easy-to-access distorted science to millions of readers. A polar bear on Arctic sea ice. Image: Kathy Crane/NOAA Arctic Research Program The researchers looked at 90 blogs that covered polar bears and Arctic sea ice. Exactly half of these blogs were categorized as ""science-based,"" and the other 45 were broadly defined as ""climate-denier"" blogs. The differences were stark. An analysis of the ""science-based"" blogs showed that 44 statements about Arctic sea ice extent were made, and every one of these blogs concluded that Arctic sea ice is declining. In contrast, ""science-denier"" blogs included 85 references to Arctic sea ice, and less than 3 percent said the ice was in decline. Instead, these blogs concluded that the ice is either not in decline, or might be in decline today but this might simply be due to natural climatic swings. The researchers also analyzed how both categories of blogs assessed the threat to polar bears from human-induced climate change. The numbers were similar. The notion that sea ice isn't in decline, however, is wildly erroneous. ""Arctic sea ice is melting faster today than at any point in the last 1,500 years,"" Jeremy Mathis, the director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Arctic Research Program, who had no role in the study, said in an interview. As expected, the greatest melting happens during the summer. Arctic scientists expect this sea ice to be completely gone during the summer sometime this century, though Mathis said predictions range from around 10 to 40 or 50 years. Even so, the trend is undeniable. ""If everything stays the same, I imagine that we’re going to be much closer to those early estimates for seeing an ice-free Arctic during those summer months,"" said Mathis. Polar bears, then, may not be hit hard by starvation now, but it's almost certain many populations will plummet when their historic habitat disappears. ""The climate change skeptics play the 'so far so good game',"" said Harvey. ""At some point something has got to give. It's a simple habitat issue. As ice continues to melt, polar bears will be in big trouble."" The future vulnerability of polar bears is a ""complicated story,"" said Mathis, because different populations will be affected by sea ice loss in different ways. And that's being studied now. But polar bears that are farther from land, exposed on the open sea, will almost certainly see declines, said Mathis. The research team's critique of the ""science-denier"" blogs quickly generated angry responses. Of note, the zoologist Susan Crawford, who writes the blog ""Polar Bear Science"" found the critique in BioScience tantamount to ""academic rape,"" as she wrote in a tweet. On her blog, she called the study ""a smack-talk response"" to a previous blog pointing out that polar bear populations didn't plummet in 2007 as some biologists predicted. (Harvey noted Crawford misunderstood and then mischaracterized this prediction). A curious polar bear standing up to get a better look at NOAA scientists on a research cruise in 2003. Image: Kathy Crane, NOAA Arctic Research Program Harvey called these retorts ""brutal"" and ""desperate,"" noting that scientists regularly scrutinize the work of other scientists. ""She thinks she has impunity of criticism by writing blogs,"" said Harvey. ""The paper wasn’t about her. She’s a symptom."" Scientists traditionally challenge other theories or research in a formal, somewhat private manner, through publication in peer-reviewed journals, noted Harvey. This allows other experts not involved in the research to scrutinize and provide possible edits for a study before it is published in a scientific journal. More public forms of debate — like a Twitter argument — serve to fuel public notions that the science of climate change, for example, is in doubt. Still, Harvey said that some science denial must be countered in public. ""We are viciously attacked,"" said Harvey. ""If more scientists in critical mass stood out against these people distorting science, we would overwhelm them in sheer mass."" Harvey appears to be doing his part, but maintained he's committed to being a scientist, not an aggressive spokesperson. ""I’m not an activist — I’m a scientist,"" he said. ""I don’t chain myself to trees.""","Most polar bear populations are in okay shape today, and this comes with a problem: Climate change deniers, often in the form of bloggers, employ this fleeting reality to promote skepticism about the idea that the planet is warming.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Hudson Hongo to Gizmodo","Hurricane Harvey appears to be just the beginning of what’s to come for Houston, and Texas as a whole. That’s according to a study published online Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a tricky one. We know that, generally, storms are more intense when the air is warmer, and their impacts on coastlines are more severe when the sea level is higher. But determining whether the odds of a single storm were affected by the warming climate is a science all unto itself. It’s called weather attribution. “We believe the odds of a flood like Harvey are changing.” Many researchers weren’t sure what to initially think about Harvey when it struck the Gulf in August. Nearly three months later, at least one scientist is offering some answers as to how much climate change impacted the odds of the hurricane that left at least 82 dead and damaged more than 119,000 homes in Harris County, Texas—and how much it’ll continue to boost those odds in the future. Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric science professor at MIT who authored the paper, found that record rainfall—like the 27 trillion gallons of water we saw with Harvey—will become 18 percent more likely to hit the state by the end of the century under a business-as-usual, worst-case-scenario emissions model, which Emanuel uses in the study. Between 1981 and 2000, those chances were slim: 1 percent for a given year. When looking at Houston, specifically, he found that storms like Harvey have historically happened once every 2,000 years, describing it as “biblical,” in a press release. Climate change is changing all that. It already is: Emanuel estimates that, in 2017, those 1 percent odds have increased to 6 percent. “You’re rolling the dice every year,” said Emanuel, in the press release. “And we believe the odds of a flood like Harvey are changing.” Most climate models available to scientists like Emanuel are too coarse in resolution to simulate the formation of hurricanes. But Emanuel and his team developed one that can model hurricanes at high spatial resolutions within a changing climate. At least one other scientist, atmospheric scientist Phil Klotzbach, at Colorado State University, knows and trusts this approach. He’s seen this model used in previous research by Emanuel, and “it seems to work fairly well at replicating overall Atlantic hurricane activity,” Klotzbach wrote in an email to Earther. “How will steering current patterns change in the future?” But we also know that Texas saw some unique conditions with Harvey that made the storm’s impacts so much worse. For one, Houston didn’t build with storms in mind. Its sprawling development and vast impervious surfaces allowed water to just pool in the city and create flooding like no one ( well, except these journalists ) expected. Then, there were the meteorological conditions surrounding the storm itself. Atmospheric steering currents, which would usually bring a storm like Harvey inland to die, were unusually weak, so the hurricane stayed close to shore picking up more and more water from the Gulf with which to pound Texas. That’s where Klotzbach has some questions: “How will steering current patterns change in the future?” he asked, in the email to Earther. Emanuel ponders this, too, in his study. Still, in an email to Earther, he emphasized his confidence in his methods, which account for both storm movement and changing atmospheric moisture. And this study isn’t the last one coming. He and his team are analyzing how much of the state’s projected rainfall increases will result from either changing atmospheric moisture levels or longer-lasting events. “Preliminary results show roughly equal contributions from both factors,” he wrote to Earther. Emanuel does know some things for certain, though. And he makes note in his study: [A]nthropogenic climate change is expected to lead to a greater incidence of high-intensity hurricanes, which together with rising sea level, will produce increased risk of storm surge flooding, while hurricanes are projected to produce substantially more precipitation as the atmosphere and oceans warm. While it’s difficult to say climate change caused any one storm, we can safely assume climate change will bring about more storms like Harvey, or Irma, or Maria. Research like Emanuel’s gives us a sense of how much more likely these storms will be in the future. And that information will help us prepare.","Hurricane Harvey appears to be just the beginning of what’s to come for Houston, and Texas as a whole.

"Elizabeth Joseph, CNN","(CNN) Harvey Weinstein's defense team filed a motion Monday to have the five remaining sex crimes charges against him in New York's Supreme Court dismissed, saying in court documents that the entire case was based on a ""defective Grand Jury proceeding"" that was ""irreparably tainted by police misconduct."" Weinstein's defense attorney Ben Brafman outlined a series of missteps he says the New York Police Department and the Manhattan District Attorney's office made in their attempts to convict the disgraced media mogul. He also revealed a February 2007 text message from Mimi Haleyi, one of three original complainants in the superseding indictment. The text message was, according to the court documents submitted by Brafman, received by Weinstein seven months after he allegedly forced oral sex on her. ""Hi! Just wondering if u have any news on whether harvey will have time to see me before he leaves? x Miriam,"" says the text, which the defense documents say ""make clear"" that Haleyi wanted to continue seeing Weinstein after the alleged July 2006 assault. ""The defense's speculation is not a substitute for evidence,"" Haleyi's lawyer, famed women's rights attorney Gloria Allred said in a statement. ""If they are engaging in speculation as to my client, I believe that they are lacking in facts which would exculpate their client Mr. Weinstein,"" she said, adding that their defense of Weinstein as to her client ""appears to be built on quicksand rather than on a strong factual foundation."" One of six felony charges dismissed Judge James Burke granted a motion last month to dismiss one of six felony charges levied against Weinstein. That charge -- a criminal sexual act in the first degree -- involved aspiring actress Lucia Evans, who alleged Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him in his Tribeca, New York office in 2004. Her account was first made public by Ronan Farrow in the New Yorker last fall. The charge was dropped, in part, because prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon cited alleged inconsistencies in Evans' story in a letter sent to Brafman. According to the letter, a friend of Evans allegedly told NYPD Detective Nicholas DiGaudio, the former lead investigator on the Weinstein case, that Evans told her she had engaged in consensual contact with Weinstein: oral sex in exchange for a job. Detective DiGaudio, now the subject of an internal NYPD investigation and removed from the Weinstein case, responded to the friend's claims by saying that, going forward, ""less is more,"" and that the witness had no obligation to cooperate, according to the letter from the prosecutor's office. He never went back to the DA's office with this information, according to Monday's motion. Approximately a week later, it was revealed that Detective DiGaudio told an accuser to delete cell phone messages prior to turning her phones over to authorities, the Manhattan DA's office said, again in a letter to Brafman. DiGaudio advised the woman that she should delete ""anything she did not want anyone to see before providing the phones"" according to the DA's office. Detective is a ""serial obstructer,"" defense says The court documents filed Monday describe DiGaudio as a ""serial obstructer"" and that his ""effort to foster concealment of this vital information from the district attorney,"" coupled with his ""less is more"" comment ""dramatically illustrates how DiGaudio was singularly hell-bent on concealing the truth as to all charges."" The documents depict DiGaudio as an overzealous detective fixed on a conviction against Weinstein, whose alleged sexual assaults sparked the international #MeToo movement. Weinstein's defense team has a request for the DA's office to disclose all materials relating to DiGuadio's discussions with all ""would be complainants or witnesses to be disclosed by the DA's office"" at the time he was working on the case. ""I'm not surprised by Mr. Brafman's motion for an all-inclusive dismissal, but my response to him is 'not so fast.' Detective DiGaudio did nothing wrong and Mr. Brafman is simply trying to avoid a full blown examination of the facts at trial,"" Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association, which represents DiGaudio told CNN in a statement late Monday. Danny Frost, Director of Communications for the Manhattan District Attorney's office, declined to comment when asked for reaction to the motion to dismiss the criminal case against Weinstein and if the DA's office still felt they have a strong case against him.

KAREN ZRAICK and VIRGINIA LOZANO,"1. “We got you, Harvey Weinstein, we got you.” Those were the first words Rose McGowan tweeted after the disgraced Hollywood producer was arrested in New York, on charges that he raped one woman and forced another to perform oral sex. Ms. McGowan, an actress, was one of the first women to come forward last fall about Mr. Weinstein’s history of sexual misconduct, setting off a tidal wave of awareness and activism, and prompting the #MeToo movement. Mr. Weinstein surrendered his passport and posted $1 million bail. Outside the courthouse, his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, told a scrum of reporters that he would “move quickly” to dismiss the charges, calling them “constitutionally flawed and factually unsubstantiated.”",Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day.,2018-05-25T21:57:54Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Harvey Weinstein, Ireland, Hawaii: Your Friday Evening Briefing",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/briefing/harvey-weinstein-ireland-hawaii.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/25/briefing/052518-evening-promo/052518-evening-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Harvey,0
MATTHEW GOLDSTEIN and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM,"The contract under which Black Cube worked for Mr. Weinstein — signed in July by his lawyer David Boies — provided for deceptive techniques that included the hiring of “an investigative journalist” who was to conduct 40 interviews over four months as part of a scheme intended, in part, to block the publication of a New York Times article about Mr. Weinstein’s decades of sexual misconduct. The agent who approached Ms. McGowan, pretending to represent a woman’s advocacy group, was Stella Penn Pechanac, the same woman who helped arranged the phony interviews in London. She was working for Black Cube, according to a person familiar with the company’s operations. She is also believed to have approached investors, analysts and financial journalists critical of the accounting practices of AmTrust, a big New York insurance company, last summer. For that operation, she used a different identity and said she worked for a fictitious London company. In a court filing in Toronto on Wednesday as part of a legal dispute between two Canadian financial firms, an employee for West Face Capital, a hedge fund, described how she was recruited by a woman who identified herself as Maja Lazarov and said she working for a London recruitment firm called Casear &amp; Company. The employee, Bei Huang, said she took an overnight flight from Toronto to London on an all-expenses-paid trip to meet with other representatives of Casear. Photo Rose McGowan has identified Stella Penn Pechanac as a woman who approached her and pretended to represent a woman’s advocacy group. Credit Rena Laverty/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The meeting was planned at a restaurant with a man named Alexander Korovin on Nov. 9, Ms. Huang said in the filing. But before it could occur, officials at West Face were alerted that it was a fake interview and a friend at the company told Ms. Huang it was a ruse. She went ahead with the meeting, but agents working for another private investigation firm, this one retained by West Face, were waiting to take photographs of the men she was meeting. In effect, it became a case of spy vs. spy. It is not clear who Black Cube was working for in that instance. In court filings, lawyers for West Face Capital suggest the client is Catalyst Capital, a large Canadian private equity firm, with which West Face has been embroiled in bitter litigation for several years over investment decisions. But the person familiar with the operations said Black Cube was not working for Catalyst. A representative for Catalyst did not return repeated phone calls and email seeking comment. Ms. Pechanac’s identity became more widely known after The Daily Mail published a photograph of her last week. After they appeared, Ms. McGowan, West Face Capital and critics of AmTrust all identified her as the person who had approached them, according to court filings and interviews with some of those people. “I talked to employees and those employees have looked at the picture of the woman in The Daily Mail and confirmed that is the same person they met with,” said Philip Panet, general counsel for West Face Capital. Ms. Pechanac has appeared in music videos in Israel and, despite her multiple undercover personas, has had her wedding photos published online by bridal shop. She could not be reached for comment. When asked about the approaches to West Face employees, Black Cube said in a statement that its policy was “to never discuss its clients with any third party, and to never confirm or deny any speculation made regarding the company’s work.” Despite its work for Mr. Weinstein, the company said it “does not accept any work concerning family disputes or sexual harassment cases.” The firm, which has offices in London, Paris and Tel Aviv, said it would donate any profits from its work for Mr. Weinstein to groups that support victims of sexual harassment. The New York Times and The New Yorker last month reported on a number of women, including Hollywood celebrities, who said they were either sexually harassed or assaulted by Mr. Weinstein. Through a spokeswoman, he has denied engaging in nonconsensual sex. The firm said it “operates in full compliance with the law of any jurisdiction in which it operates” and “strictly following the guidance and legal opinions” of major law firms. Black Cube said it worked with many law firms in the United States and helped lawyers gather evidence for complex legal cases. The firm said it mainly focused on commercial disputes, market manipulation and “uncovering of negative campaigns” against individuals and companies. The company also does do some work for governments. In New York and many other states, private investigators are required to be licensed and can be charged with a misdemeanor if they are not. In New York, there is no record of a license being issued to a firm under the name Black Cube or the firm’s corporate name, B.C. Strategy. Photo Stella Penn Pechanac in a music video in 2010 with Rudi Saada. Credit via Youtube But state prosecutors in Manhattan said the law was rarely enforced and they could not remember filing charges against any unlicensed investigators. Under the ethical guidelines of the New York State bar association, law firms hiring investigative firms are generally responsible for monitoring their actions. Black Cube’s work for Mr. Weinstein is now raising fresh questions about the role played by Mr. Boies, a prominent litigator who is well-known for arguing on behalf same-sex marriage before the Supreme Court in 2013. Mr. Boies’s firm, Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner, executed the original contract with Black Cube in October 2016, and Mr. Boies personally signed a renegotiated contract in July that explained more specifically what Black Cube was supposed to investigate. That work became a point of contention between Mr. Boies and The New York Times last week because his firm had handled cases for The Times, and Black Cube’s work was aimed at undermining its article on Mr. Weinstein. The Times fired Mr. Boies’s firm and called its actions “reprehensible.’’ Mr. Boies acknowledged he had not closely monitored Black Cube’s conduct and said it did not constitute a conflict with the legal work he did for The Times. He said he had not previously heard of Black Cube, but his firm confirmed it had worked with a client that had hired Black Cube on at least one other occasion. In general, law firms are not supposed to work with unlicensed private investigators if they intend to use any information gleaned from the investigation in court filings and to pursue litigation. Lawyers are also required to closely monitor private investigators to make sure they do not break the law or engage in inappropriate deceptive behavior. He said that was being done by other lawyers working for Mr. Weinstein, including Lisa Bloom, a familiar legal commentator on TV and a lawyer specializing in sexual harassment cases. But Ms. Bloom, who recently stopped representing Mr. Weinstein, said in an email that she was surprised by Mr. Boies’s claims. “They are false,” she said. This is not the first time that Black Cube actions have pushed the boundaries. Two Black Cube employees were arrested last year on charges related to a campaign to intimidate Romania’s anti-corruption chief, in part by using email phishing attacks aimed at capturing passwords and login credentials. The employees were convicted and given suspended sentences. Black Cube’s many deceptions have at times caused some confusion for its operatives. Brandon Moyse, a former West Face employee, said in an affidavit that he was suspicious of the woman he now knows was Ms. Pechanac but at the time had called herself Olivia Anderson. At a dinner, the woman had referred to the man who was with her as her husband, Victor. But in an email, she called him another name — Alexander. “It seemed very unusual that Olivia would use an incorrect name for her husband,” Mr. Moyse said in the affidavit. But he did come away with something: a $200 bottle of scotch she had given him for his birthday. Barry Meier contributed reporting from Berlin, and Irit Panzer from Jerusalem.

Leslie Felperin,"We’re living in a time when the news eco-system is as densely crammed with tales of the perfidy of rich, powerful men as a square kilometer of Amazonian rainforest is packed with endangered life forms. Consequently, the shocking (albeit not entirely surprising within the industry) revelations about the predatory habits of Harvey Weinstein, recounted in director Ursula Macfarlane’s scrupulous documentary Untouchable, almost feel like the fading echoes of an ancient supernova, one that exploded way back in the distant mists of October, 2017.
But the reverberations from Weinstein’s alleged misdeeds can still be felt today through the evolving collective story of the #MeToo movement, as ever more public figures are pulled into the undertow, while older accusations are made new again with fresh revelations. See, for example, the recent allegations published this month about Bryan Singer, while in Sundance, where Untouchable debuted, TV series Leaving Neverland also screened for the first time, offering four hours’ worth of detail about Michael Jackson’s alleged sexual abuse of the young boys he groomed as “friends.” Moreover, the Weinstein story is about to heat up again given that his trial, for charges of rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault, is scheduled to start in May.
Told with clarity, respect and empathy, and not just for the women on whom Weinstein preyed, Macfarlane’s film offers a timely and fascinating overview of his story, one that’s almost emblematic of the pathology of serial sexual abusers. Former employees and colleagues from his earliest days in Buffalo as a music promoter and on through the early years of Miramax, the film company he founded with his brother Bob, recollect with justifiable admiration his passion for film, his good taste in material and his gift for marketing and making hits. Some are even willing to go so far as to admit that he could be undeniably charming and charismatic, but as one former executive notes, the flipside of that “genius” was a gluttonous appetite for power and pleasure.
Sensation seekers should be warned that there aren’t really any fresh allegations aired here, and Untouchable allocates just as much screen time to interviews with “non-famous” women Weinstein allegedly importuned or assaulted as it does to the likes of actors Rosanna Arquette and Paz de la Huerta, both interviewed here. But there is something extraordinary and immediate about these women’s narratives of what happened to them, told with honesty but evident and intense pain. Arguably the most devastating moment is when the camera holds patiently on one-time Weinstein employee Hope D’Amore for many seconds of screen time as she struggles to find the words to describe a sexual assault by Weinstein that happened in 1978. (“I didn’t scratch his eyes out, but I did say no and tried to push him away,” she says with painful frankness.) It’s in scenes like this that the film vibrates with an emotional richness and cathartic charge that the written journalistic word would struggle to match.
Macfarlane spends just about the right amount of time prodding at Harvey’s psychology in order to propel the story, but the real meat of the movie is its engagement with those who came into his orbit and became as damaged as they were enriched by the exposure. Those include not just the women he allegedly attacked or pressured or threatened, but to an extent also the people he worked with who sort of knew but sort of didn’t want to know, or even outright knew and chose to keep on working with him. Jack Lechner, at one time head of development at Miramax, John Schmidt, formerly a Miramax CFO, and Mark Gill, president of Miramax Los Angeles, all speak eloquently about their feelings of shame and survivor’s guilt. Kathy Declesis, at one time Bob Weinstein’s assistant, can at least hold her head high when recounting how she quit after reading a letter from a lawyer detailing the rape of another employee, but how many knew of similar assaults and chose to do nothing? The diffuse contagion of guilt is in some ways the real subject of this film.
After detailing how she was allegedly raped by Weinstein, Paz de La Huerta talks haltingly about how she felt a need to assert her sexuality even more on screen and in photo sessions as a kind of self-therapy, attempting to take back control of her own body and sensuality after the violation. As a kind of aesthetic correlative of this, each of the interviewees here are beautifully made up and flatteringly lit by cinematographers Patrick Smith and Neil Harvey. The glossy production values given them a sort of visual armor, and serve to remind us how Weinstein pathologically coveted beauty, perhaps because he was so uncomfortable in his own skin.
In the interests of full disclosure, The Hollywood Reporter’s editor-at-large Kim Masters is one of several journalists interviewed here about her dealings with Weinstein over the years. Her contributions are insightful, as is the one from prominent writer Rebecca Traister and her one-time boyfriend Andrew Goldman, who recount, with some tension-dissipating and welcome hilarity, a bizarre evening where they were verbally and physically assaulted by Weinstein, but still managed to record him boasting profanely about how he was the virtual sheriff of New York — and, as the title notes, untouchable.

"Samira Said, CNN","Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (CNN) As floodwaters forced some South Carolinians to evacuate in Hurricane Florence's aftermath, the man known as the ""Hurricane Cowboy"" rode into dangerous areas to save abandoned animals. In the past week, Patrick Mckann, a 42-year-old Virginia horse trainer, said he and his friends have rescued six horses, two donkeys, around 14 guinea fowl and lots of chickens threatened by the disaster's encroaching waters. Mckann -- who got his nickname helping folks in Texas after Hurricane Harvey last year -- and longtime friend Travis Holstein traveled a week ago to Burgaw, North Carolina, to join the rescue efforts. Arriving in the town north of Wilmington, they met up with other volunteers from Harvey, Sean Irion and Malachai Huffman. Together, the men were intent on going to hard-hit areas to save animals that otherwise would have drowned or starved. ""We just do what we can do,"" Mckann told CNN. Rather than waste their time in meetings with other volunteers, the men took a traditional cowboy approach to their rescue work, he said. ""As cowboys we just said let's get in a huddle and say, 'You get a rope, I'll do this and get a handle this way,' "" he said. In Burgaw, a veterinarian whose truck had been engulfed in the flooding reached out for help, so the men took Mckann's horse trailer and answered the call. ""The vet had sank her truck in high water,"" he said. ""(While) they checked on her, we roped two donkeys. ""We pulled them back to safety,"" he said. ""They actually pulled us for a while."" 'That's him! That's the Hurricane Cowboy!' Mckann has been around animals all his life and ""cowboying"" since he was a kid, he told CNN. At 5, he started riding auction horses and then at 14, race horses. By the time he was 17, he had moved on to broncos and bulls. But it wasn't until Hurricane Harvey that he earned his moniker. ""I bought a new truck and was listening to CNN on Sirius radio,"" the former bull rider said. ""They were talking about flooding and people down there (in the Houston area). I had this new truck and a trailer... so that's when I said, 'Well, I guess I'm going down there.' "" With the trailer full of supplies donated by friends and other community members, Mckann packed up and drove 1,200 miles to southeast Texas, where he said he helped rescue cows, horses and chickens. He even drove home to Virginia, picked up more supplies and brought them back. ""We put about 25,000 miles on (the new truck),"" he said, between the two trips and driving around the Lone Star State. Mckann was loading up his trailer on a return trip to Virginia when he overheard a woman telling a volunteer she wanted to give her donations to the ""Hurricane Cowboy."" ""You know, the cowboy that loads up his truck and takes it down himself,"" Mckann recalls the woman saying. That's when she turned around and saw Mckann standing there. ""That's him!"" she said, according to Mckann. ""That's the Hurricane Cowboy!"" After helping the vet in Burgaw, Mckann and his fellow cowboys wanted to head to the next town in need. They quickly realized animals in Conway, South Carolina, were in trouble. With rivers converging in the inland town near Myrtle Beach -- and news reports indicating conditions could get worse -- the Hurricane Cowboy and his team wanted to focus their efforts there. ""We took a few minutes, looked at a map, figured out where the water would be high,"" he said. Once in Conway, they went straight to work after a man told them that three of his horses were trapped. He was afraid they would drown, Mckann said. It was the perfect chance for the rescuers to put their skills to the test. They had to walk 4 miles, Mckann said, mostly in floodwater. But they managed to ride the three horses out to safety. A local news outlet did a story on them, and residents began reaching out. One call came from an older couple who said they had to leave their animals behind, Mckann said. He and his friends made the miles-long journey to the couple's house by boat, tractor and then by foot -- at one point walking in water up to Mckann's chest, he said. The men found three horses, one of which was unbroken, Mckann said. But he managed to get things under control, and they saved all three, he said. On Friday night, Mckann headed back to Virginia to pick up more donations with Holstein. He pledges to return to the flood-ravaged region -- either to Conway or Lumberton, North Carolina -- to drop off supplies as soon as they can get back. He said he's only too glad to lend a hand to ""these little towns no one helps."" ""People forget about them,"" he said. ""We're just cowboys out here doing our job.""","As floodwaters forced some South Carolinians to evacuate in Hurricane Florence's aftermath, the man known as the ""Hurricane Cowboy"" rode into dangerous areas to save abandoned animals.",2018-09-29T19:17:47Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",First it was Harvey.

Angie Han,"Even before his downfall, Harvey Weinstein had a habit of pissing people off. Case in point: James Cameron recently recounted the time he nearly hit Weinstein with an Oscar statue – 19 years ago. SEE ALSO: Uma Thurman posts fierce message to Harvey Weinstein Cameron revealed to Vanity Fair that he and Weinstein almost came to blows at the 1998 Academy Awards (i.e., the one where Titanic won all the Oscars). The two began arguing on the main floor of the Oscars theater, just as music started playing to let attendees know they needed to return to their seats before the live televised feed began. At one point, according to Cameron, he was about to hit Weinstein with the award he'd just won. While Cameron didn't quite get there, Weinstein surely would've been hurt if he had – those things weigh 8.5 pounds. So, what was it that had Cameron so heated? He was standing up for his friend and fellow director Guillermo del Toro, who was coming off of a terrible experience with the Weinsteins on his first American movie, Mimic. Cameron explained: Harvey came up glad-handing me, talking about how great [The Weinstein Co.] were for the artist, and I just read him chapter and verse about how great I thought he was for the artist based on my friend’s experience, and that led to an altercation. Del Toro has made no secret of his dislike of Weinstein. Speaking last month at the BFI London Film Festival, del Toro stated that he ""really hated"" working with Weinstein on Mimic. ""Two horrible things happened in the late nineties: my father was kidnapped and I worked with the Weinsteins,"" said del Toro. ""I know which one was worse. The kidnapping made more sense. I knew what they wanted.”","Even before his downfall, Harvey Weinstein had a habit of pissing people off.

JOHN KOBLIN,"But there was a big story to be gotten, and the reporting continued into the spring and summer, albeit “discreetly,” Mr. McHugh said. Mr. Farrow gained access to a recording of a New York Police Department sting operation in which Mr. Weinstein admitted to groping the model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez. Even with the addition of that tape, Mr. McHugh said, executives at NBC News seemed unpersuaded. “I think it’s fair to say that there was a point in our reporting where I felt there were obstacles to us reporting this externally, and there were obstacles to us reporting this internally,” the producer said. “Externally, I had Weinstein associates calling me repeatedly. I knew that Weinstein was calling NBC executives directly. One time it even happened when we were in the room.” On Oct. 5, The Times published the first of its articles detailing allegations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Weinstein. That evening, CBS and ABC gave airtime to the explosive story on their newscasts. NBC did not. The next morning, “Today” gave it scant attention. Mr. Farrow published his first New Yorker article on Mr. Weinstein on Oct. 10. Since then, Mr. McHugh has questioned how NBC handled things. “I don’t believe they’ve told the truth about it,” he said. “That’s my opinion. I’ve asked that question, and to this day I still have not been given a good answer.” Asked why it had taken him so long to leave the network, Mr. McHugh said he had stayed on so he could continue providing for his family and out of a fear that NBC could retaliate against him. He has retained the Washington-based lawyer Ari Wilkenfeld. Mr. Wilkenfeld also represents women who have made allegations against Mr. Lauer and another NBC luminary, Tom Brokaw, who has been accused of making unwanted advances toward women he worked with. In addition to his continuing work for The New Yorker, Mr. Farrow is writing a book, “Catch and Kill,” which is expected to include his account of NBC’s role in the reporting of the Weinstein story.","The Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein entering a court in Manhattan in June.

ANITA GATES,"Larry Harvey, the guru-like driving force behind Burning Man, the globally celebrated anti-establishment, anti-consumerist festival that he and a friend began 32 years ago on a San Francisco beach, died on Saturday at a hospital in San Francisco. He was 70. His death was announced on the Burning Man website. Mr. Harvey had a stroke on April 4. Burning Man is now a revered weeklong annual event that takes place in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada, north of Reno, but there is no firm consensus on whether it is a spiritual retreat, performance art, a music festival, a construction project or just an excuse to party in the middle of scorching heat and dust storms. New York Times writers have described it as, or compared it to, a “weeklong cyberhippie carnival,” a “fringe culturefest,” “a hallucinogenic state fair,” “a full-scale countercultural declaration of independence,” “the internet made flesh” and “the Whitney Biennial reimagined as a rave party.” Last year’s celebration drew roughly 70,000 participants, who were free to bring or build their own arts projects, perform their own music, dress any way they liked (participants in “drag races” run on foot, dressed in drag) or go nude — and dance and chant “Burn the man” during the big finale.

Gianluca Mezzofiore,"That Morrissey, the English singer and ex-frontman of The Smiths, loves causing controversy is a well-known fact that surprises nobody in Britain. SEE ALSO: People are appalled that Morrissey blames Kevin Spacey's and Harvey Weinstein's victims Well, hardly anything surprises British people, but this time's an exception. This time Morrissey has stepped over a red line. And the Brits are fuming. After defending Kevin Spacey and blaming the victims of Harvey Weinstein, Morrissey went after the country's most beloved national treasure. We are naturally talking about David Attenborough, the wildlife authority whose dulcet tones make watching Planet Earth and Blue Planet a life-changing experience. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Morrissey, a longtime vegan activist who orders food stalls at his concerts to sell only vegetarian food, dared to question Attenborough's real love for animals. “It was beautiful but I don’t know about Attenborough’s regard for animals,” he said in reference to BBC 2's The Culture Show poll in 2006 that voted Morrissey Britain's second most important cultural icon after Attenborough. “He often uses terms like ‘seafood’ and there’s no such thing as seafood. It’s sea life, and he talks about ‘wildlife’ and it’s free life. Animals are not wild simply because we pathetic humans haven’t shoved them in a cage, so his terminology is often up the pole.” Maybe Morrissey was just venting his frustration, but it definitely didn't go well with Attenborough fans on Twitter: Think wikipedia has the answer why: ""In a 2006 BBC poll, Morrissey was voted the second greatest living British cultural icon, behind only David Attenborough"" Bet he's miffed not being first! 😂 — Lophophanes (@Lophophanes) November 27, 2017 The new Morrissey album is weak IMHO, and his recent comments on Brexit and Kevin Spacey... now he's is on at Sir David Attenborough.

JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.,"The indictment charges Mr. Weinstein with first-degree and third-degree rape and first-degree criminal sexual act. The top charges carry a penalty of between five and 25 years in prison, if convicted. Mr. Weinstein, the once-powerful movie producer disgraced after more than 80 women accused him of sexual misconduct, was released on Friday after turning in his passport and posting $1 million bail. When he was brought before a judge on Friday, Mr. Weinstein notified prosecutors that he might want to give his version of events to the grand jury. The lead prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi, said Mr. Weinstein had agreed to decide by Wednesday whether to testify before the grand jury. In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said the movie producer did not have sufficient time to prepare testimony, having learned the details of the accusations and identities of his accusers late Friday afternoon, just before Memorial Day weekend. Mr. Brafman also said “regardless of how compelling Mr. Weinstein’s personal testimony might be, an indictment was inevitable due to the unfair political pressure being placed on Cy Vance to secure a conviction of Mr. Weinstein.”","A Manhattan grand jury voted on Wednesday to indict Harvey Weinstein on charges that he forced one woman to perform oral sex and raped a second woman, the Manhattan district attorney said.",2018-05-30T22:37:51Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Weinstein Indicted on Rape and Criminal Sexual Act Charges,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/nyregion/weinstein-indicted-rape.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/31/nyregion/31weinstein-copy/31weinstein-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Harvey,0
Tom McKay,"Twitter is never, ever going to ban or otherwise take direct action against the president, who besides being the sites number one power user has in the past skirted uncomfortably close to using it as ground zero for nuclear war. The logic goes that as the president, Trumps tweets are inherently newsworthya sensible argument in principle, though the outcome of that has been that Trumps account enjoys de facto immunity from the rules governing every other Twitter user. Social media platforms, however, have been rushing to show how much they care about election integrity since the debacle in 2016 (have you heard about Facebooks War Room ?). Twitter in particular promised before the midterms that it would take steps to ensure that Twitter provides a healthy space for public conversation that voters can rely on for accurate election news and information. This is entirely dissonant with the impunity with which Trump has used his account to spread bogus of electoral fraud in Florida, portraying the ongoing recount in a Senate race there as involving forged ballots and found votes. (Spoilers: Hes lying.) According to a Tuesday report from BuzzFeed News, Twitter is dodging the subject of what to do about this like a cowboy having revolvers fired at his feet: Asked by BuzzFeed News if Twitter was considering updating its rules to address Trumps voter fraud claims, the companys vice president of trust and safety, Del Harvey, suggested that the company would wait until 2019 to address the issue, if at all. One of our goals for 2019 is to significantly increase transparency around those conversations as well as the principles we draw from when evaluating the impact of potential changes, Harvey tweeted at BuzzFeed News. Pressed for specifics, Harvey declined to provide any examples of what increased transparency might look like, noting vaguely that we have ongoing conversations about these themes broadly. So, to recap, Twitter will be more transparent about the ongoing conversation around either the presidents tweets, or maybe just the ongoing discussion about tweets in general, and the principles involved in that discussion, sometime in 2019. Maybe. The recount will be over by then, so you know, water under the bridge and all that. BuzzFeed pointed out that one potential solution is introducing fact-checking features that would appear under the presidents tweetsthough its hard to imagine how that would put any noticeable dent in his ability to continue spreading misinformation. Besides, Trump would just get angry about that too. In any case, if Twitter would like to have a conversation about the ongoing conversations about the public conversation, maybe they could call up the president. I hear he really likes talking.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Asia Argento was one of the first women to accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault One of the leading figures in the #MeToo movement has reportedly been accused of sexual assault herself. Italian actress Asia Argento was one of the first to speak out against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. The New York Times reports that legal documents, which the BBC has not seen, show she paid a former co-star $380,000 after he alleged she had assaulted him in a California hotel room in 2013. A lawyer for Ms Argento declined to comment on the allegations. Her accuser, Jimmy Bennett was just 17 at the time. The age of consent in California is 18. Ms Argento would have been 37 at the time of the encounter. Mr Bennett says in the documents that the encounter traumatised him and threatened his mental health and career, the New York Times reported. He had played Ms Argento's young son in a 2004 film. In the documents seen by the paper, the actress's lawyer said that the money was given to Mr Bennett to help him, and that it was Ms Argento who had been preyed upon. In a statement published by Vanity Fair, a lawyer for Mr Bennett said his client would not comment but would take the ""next 24 hours, or longer, to prepare his response"". A lawyer for Mr Weinstein said the development revealed ""a stunning level of hypocrisy by Asia Argento"".

Sarah Buhr,"“Five second” baby swaddle Sleepea (pronounced “sleepy”) is a sleep sack for your little one promising to be more efficient and effective than the other swaddles on the market. This is the second product to debut from Happiest Baby founder Dr. Harvey Karp, the creator of the Snoo, a $1200 robot bassinet that rocks and vibrates your baby to sleep. The swaddle is more of a low-tech item included on the list of things Dr. Karp mentions in his book and program ‘The Happiest Baby on the Block’ to can keep your baby soothed and sleeping through the night. Dr. Karp’s program suggests five “S’s”: Swaddle, Side or Stomach position, Shush, Swing and Suck. Swaddling as a measure to keep babies calm and comforted was nearly unheard of a few years ago and you couldn’t even buy a swaddle in the U.S. in 2002. Dr. Karp is credited with kicking off the swaddle movement among parents and says he wanted to expand on his product offerings after not finding the kind of swaddle he wished were on the market for parents. “Swaddling is the cornerstone for comforting babies,” he says. “But the current blankets all have problems. They unravel, they overheat, the don’t restrict the arms properly.” He does include a sleep sack with the Snoo, but that sack is made specifically to hook into the bassinet. Sleepea is a standalone product anyone can use, whether or not they have the Snoo. Sleepeas come in three sizes: small (5-12 lb), medium (12-18lb) and large (18-25lb) and four star-sprinkled colors — teal, pink, grey and blue. Features of the Sleepea include: Design that won’t unravel and stays on snug (other swaddles tend to be loose clothes that babies can escape from or cover their faces. Hip Safe – provides ample room in the hip area for healthy, growing joints. Breathable mesh to prevent risky overheating. Quiet velcro so baby won’t be startled awake when changing their diaper. Zips two ways to make diaper changes and getting out of it easier. Comes with “smart” bands, which keep the baby’s arms in place and keeps them in position through the night – no Houdini escape artists here. Made with organic cotton The Sleepea promises parents can get babies in and out of it in five seconds or less. And, unlike the pricier Snoo, the swaddle can be purchased for a mere $24 at retail stores like Walmart, Jet.com and Amazon. Compare that to other swaddles with similar features like SwaddleMe ($27 at Target ) or the Halo SleepSack ($22 at Amazon ). There are also some more high-tech products Dr. Karp plans to release in the future, including a sleep logger for the Snoo so parents can see how much sleep and the quality of sleep babies are getting.

David Turner,"Twitter in 2018 remains a cesspool of narcissists, scammers, and trolls—I’m not just talking about Kanye West’s mentions—and on Tuesday the service announced its latest attempt to solve that problem. In the coming weeks, Twitter will begin hiding tweets that are “detracting from the conversation.” Twitter isn’t going to start flat-out deleting tweets from your Twitter feed. Instead, its algorithm will mute certain users so their tweets fall behind a “see more replies” link and their content will no longer be searchable. Del Harvey, vice president of trust and safety at Twitter, said to Slate that the primary factors will be how many complaints, blocks, and mutes an account receives compared to the number of favorites and comments a tweet receives. On Twitter’s company blog, Harvey said this change should hit less than one percent of Twitter’s users. Assuming the service has around 330 million active users (it did at the end of 2017), this new change could hit over three million users and bots. According to Harvey, “The challenge for us has been: how can we proactively address these disruptive behaviors that do not violate our policies but negatively impact the health of the conversation?” Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey told the Verge, “We want to take the burden of the work off the people receiving the abuse or harassment.” The proliferation of vile content on Twitter is certainly not a new topic. Two months ago Jack went on Twitter to talk about...what else, the health of Twitter. Here’s one of his many lofty statements: We’ve focused most of our efforts on removing content against our terms, instead of building a systemic framework to help encourage more healthy debate, conversations, and critical thinking. This is the approach we now need. Twitter’s newly announced fix engages with the content people view, but it doesn’t fundamentally change the incentives for people to be trolls and make hateful comments. Well, if this doesn’t work, Dorsey will certainly tweet some more about it.

Rachel Kraus,"A pattern has emerged with every new allegation of sexual misconduct. After the bombshell comes an ""apology"" letter — now the accused's ubiquitous and perfunctory mechanism for responding. Many have found the letters hollow, insincere, and insufficient. But one woman has altered the apology letters to give them new meaning. SEE ALSO: Louis C.K. responds to sexual misconduct allegations: 'These stories are true' Poet Isobel O'Hare is creating striking ""erasure poems"" out of the apologies, and posting them on her Instagram. She has created poems out of the apologies of Louis C.K., Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, and more. ""As new abuse allegations come out day after day, and each man releases his statement, I started to notice patterns in the language they use,"" said O'Hare in an email to Mashable. ""Either because they are following a boilerplate PR format or because they are unwittingly revealing universal truths about male dominance and power."" An erasure poem is a form in which an artist redacts a pre-existing text — in this case, the apology letter — leaving a few words visible, that together, form a new message. As Rachel Stone writes in The New Republic, the erasure poem can ""expose the human cost of suppression, and symbolically restore a voice to the silenced."" The interpretation of this form as giving a ""voice to the silenced"" works particularly well for O'Hare's work. With the exception of Louis C.K. who goes out of his way to say ""these stories are true,"" the letters are mostly defensive, and work to shirk responsibility while rebutting the statements of victims — who in many cases have stayed silent for decades. ""I want people to see what these statements are really conveying,"" O'Hare said, ""which I think is a very male narcissism that demands constant attention, praise, and forgiveness. I hope that the form of erasure itself draws attention to the fact that these men have in fact erased the voices of their victims, for many years, some very deliberately and litigiously."" The New Republic reports that erasure poems have gained new popularity in the wake of the Trump regime. Artist jayy dodd created an erasure poem out of President Trump's inauguration speech, which went viral. Currently, there are over 11,000 posts tagged #erasurepoetry or #erasurepoem on Instagram. Poet Raye Hendrix followed Isabel O'Hare's lead, and created an erasure poem out of the statements of support for Roy Moore, the Alabama senatorial candidate accused of sexual misconduct with teenagers. Rose McGowan also shared O'Hare's work with her followers. It's hard to say whether the new messages themselves, or the act of blacking out and reclaiming the text of these alleged sexual abusers, is what gives these pieces their power. But jarring artistic takes on the cultural conversation like O'Hare's can help us cut beyond vitriol, and think hard about the politics of language and power. ""I hope survivors start erasing the hell out of the words of abusive, powerful people,"" O'Hare said. ""I hope space can open up for vulnerable, silenced, marginalized individuals to make the kind of art that deserves to be seen. And I want powerful abusive people to feel scared for once."" You can see all of O'Hare's erasure poetry on her Instagram.","A pattern has emerged with every new allegation of sexual misconduct.

BROOKS BARNES and WILLIAM NEUMAN,"Photo Eric T. Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general, speaking to reporters in August. Mr. Schneiderman filed a lawsuit against the Weinstein Company on Sunday and demanded that any victims of Harvey Weinstein be justly compensated. The lawsuit was a last-minute snag during negotiations to sell the company. Credit Drew Angerer/Getty Images The fire sale of the Weinstein Company hit a last-minute snag on Sunday, when Eric T. Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general, filed a lawsuit against the studio and its fraternal founders alleging that they repeatedly violated state and city laws barring gender discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual abuse and coercion. The lawsuit, filed electronically in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, appeared timed to at least temporarily stop a sale, which had been expected to be finalized on Sunday. “Any sale of the Weinstein Company must ensure that victims will be compensated, employees will be protected going forward, and that neither perpetrators nor enablers will be unjustly enriched,” Mr. Schneiderman said in a news release. The Weinstein Company, which has been trying to avoid bankruptcy since October, when reports by the The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed decades of sexual harassment allegations against one of its founders, Harvey Weinstein, was nearing a deal to sell itself to an investor group for roughly $275 million, plus the assumption of $225 million in debt, according to two people briefed on the deal who spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations are private. The impending deal also called for the creation of a multimillion-dollar settlement fund for women who have accused Mr. Weinstein of abuse. Under the deal, the two people said, Mr. Weinstein’s younger brother, Bob Weinstein, who has run the studio’s commercially oriented Dimension Films label, would leave the studio. Bob Weinstein had frantically tried to keep control of the company following his brother’s firing in October. Photo Harvey Weinstein speaking at an event in New York in 2012.

Louise Matsakis,"Twitter on Tuesday announced a new policy addressing dehumanizing speech, which will take effect later this year, and for the first time the public will be able to formally provide the company with feedback on the proposed rule. The policy will prohibit content that dehumanizes others based on their membership in an identifiable group, even when the material does not include a direct target. It expands upon Twitters existing hateful conduct policy prohibiting users from threatening violence or directly attacking a specific individual on the basis of characteristics such as race, sexual orientation, or gender. Twitters users, especially women and minority groups, long have complained that the companys rules have been ineffective and inconsistent in addressing harassment and abuse. We obviously get reports from people about content that they believe violates our rules that does not. The dehumanizing content and the dehumanizing behavior is one of the areas that really makes up a significant chunk of those reports, says Del Harvey, Twitters vice president of trust and safety. She adds that many Twitter users, as well as researchers who study dehumanizing speechs real-world effects, told the company allowing that content to stay was deeply problematic. Susan Benesch, whose research Twitter cites in its announcement, defines dehumanizing speech as describing other people in ways that deny or diminish their humanity, like comparing them to insects, demons, or bacteria. The Dangerous Speech Project she founded and directs argues that it's one hallmark of a wider category called dangerous speech, which covers any form of expression that can increase the risk that an audience will participate in or accept violence against another person or group. Dehumanization is important since it leads to real harm; it's just challenging to define precisely, and it's critical to protect freedom of speech as well, says Benesch. This initiative shows that Twitter staff are thinking hard about the variety of offline harms to which online content can lead, and trying to reduce them. It's easiest for platforms to respond to more obvious forms of harm, such as a credible threat of violence directed at a named, specific person. Previously on Twitter, a comment like all women are scum and should die would need to be targeted at an individual to break Twitters rules. The new policy would remove the requirement that a user who is potentially a member of the protected class be referenced or discussed in the tweet itself. 'Our hope is that actually having this feedback period will serve to bring people sort of along with us on the process.' Del Harvey, Twitter News that Twitter was considering a policy on dehumanizing speech first broke in August, as major tech companies like YouTube and Facebook moved to ban conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from their platforms. Twitter initially declined to follow suit, and CEO Jack Dorsey defended his companys decision by arguing that Jones had not broken the rules. (Media outlets like CNN went on to point out multiple instances where Jones did appear to violate Twitter policies.) After the judgment caused an uproar at Twitter, Harvey sent an email to staff that she was shifting our timeline forward for reviewing the dehumanization policy. Twitter is giving users two weeks to comment on the new rule via a survey form; questions include whether the policy is clear and how it could be improved. It will be available in English, Spanish, Arabic, and Japanese. Historically we have been less transparent than, quite frankly, I think is ideal about our policies and how we develop them, says Harvey, who has worked at the company for more than a decade. Our hope is that actually having this feedback period will serve to bring people sort of along with us on the process. Twitter also has a so-called Trust and Safety Council, made up of third-party nonprofits and other organizations that are consulted on new policies. The company will process the feedback and then continue its normal internal procedure for new policies. After the dehumanizing speech statute becomes a permanent part of Twitters rules, the hardest work of actually enforcement will begin. Unlike, say, a cryptocurrency scam, dehumanizing speech might be difficult to spotin part because its dependent on context and hard to exactly define. Not all dangerous speech has dehumanizing language, and not all comparisons of human beings with animals are dehumanizing, says Benesch. Twitter and other platforms should be careful not to define dehumanization too broadly. For example, its tempting to say that any demeaning remark about a group of people, such as the X people are all thieves or all corrupt is dehumanizing. That one is not dehumanizing, since corruption is a specialty of humans. Recent real-world incidents have proved challenging for other social media companies to police effectively. Facebook, for instance, has been accused of helping to facilitate the Muslim Rohingya crisis in Myanmar, which the UN is now calling to prosecute as genocide. Buddhist leaders in the country used the platform to spread misinformation and hate speech, including comparing Rohingya to dogs and pests. (Facebook already prohibits users from publishing violent or dehumanizing speech.) Twitters new policy is part of a greater soul-searching initiative the company announced in March, after it was widely criticized for allowing misinformation and automated bots to flourish on its platform during the lead-up to the 2016 US presidential election. Since then, Twitter has limited the influence of suspicious accounts, deleted more than 140,000 third-party apps that violated its policies, and begun hiding tweets from potentially harmful users, among other efforts. The fight against dehumanizing speech is only the latest part of that effort. Hate groups that use the platform to spread their messages would likely be impacted, for example, even if theyre not harassing a specific individual. But a rule against dehumanization wont help in circumstances where harassment is facilitated through lying or misinformation. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones claims that school shootings never happened wouldnt necessarily be addressed by the policy, but theyre still extremely harmful nonetheless. What's more, Twitter may need to decide what to do about high-profile users like President Donald Trump, who once tweeted that Democrats want illegal immigrants to pour into and infest our Country. The company historically has allowed for world leaders whose statements may violate policies but also are newsworthy. Its not something where its set in stone, says Harvey. Its something were going to be continuing to explore.

Jonathan Stempel,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York state judge on Friday approved Harvey Weinstein’s overhaul of his legal team to defend him against criminal sexual assault charges, though two of his new lawyers represented one of the disgraced Hollywood mogul’s most vocal accusers, actress Rose McGowan. 
At a Manhattan court hearing, Weinstein told Judge James Burke he accepted the potential conflicts of interest that Jose Baez and Ronald Sullivan might have from recently representing McGowan in a Virginia drug possession case, where she pleaded no contest. 
The judge said McGowan had accused Weinstein of having cocaine planted in her wallet, and his new lawyers might have email evidence where he supposedly wrote about it. 
“He was commenting on the absurdity of the allegations,” Weinstein’s former lawyer Benjamin Brafman told Burke, referring to Weinstein and the alleged email evidence. 
But the judge cautioned Weinstein his new lawyers “might not cross-examine Ms. McGowan as vigorously as they might otherwise” if she testified at his trial, which is not expected. Weinstein said he understood. 
Prosecutors accuse Weinstein, 66, of forcibly performing oral sex on a woman in 2006 and raping another woman in 2013. 
Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to five criminal charges, and could face life in prison if convicted. 
“He is innocent,” Baez told reporters after the hearing. “He should be entitled to the same presumption as anyone else.” 
More than 70 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. He has denied all accusations and said any contact was consensual. 
Weinstein’s case helped launch the #MeToo movement, in which dozens of powerful men in entertainment, politics and other fields were accused of sexual misconduct. 
On Jan. 7, a not guilty plea was entered in a Massachusetts court on behalf of Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey to sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man in 2016. 
Baez previously represented Casey Anthony, the Florida mother found not guilty in 2011 of murdering her 2-year-old daughter Caylee. 
He worked with Sullivan, a Harvard Law School professor, when they won a 2017 acquittal for former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez at his double murder trial. Hernandez later committed suicide. 
Another new Weinstein lawyer is Pamela Mackey, who represented former basketball star Kobe Bryant when he was accused of raping a woman in 2003. Bryant called the encounter consensual. The case was eventually dropped. 
His other new lawyer is Duncan Levin, a former top deputy to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance. 
Weinstein’s trial is scheduled for early May. The next hearing is on March 8. Baez, Sullivan and Levin attended Friday’s hearing. 
“Welcome aboard,” Burke told them.

Rachel Thompson,"Your finger flits through face after face as you amass matches like collectors' items left to gather dust on a forgotten shelf. You swipe, you match, you...never speak to them. So goes the interminable revolving door of online dating. SEE ALSO: Vanity was once the preserve of the privileged but Instagram has changed all of that Why so cynical, you may well be wondering? I, like many online daters, have been swiping for years. Whenever I find myself in need of a thumb-twiddling activity, I fire up Tinder and Bumble and aimlessly trawl through a bottomless pit of faces. I fling messages at a few of the matches I fancy, but things usually fizzle out after an initial flirtation. I stockpile matches like they're going out of fashion, but when it comes to actual meaningful engagement, there's very little going on. This swiping ennui is shared by other daters. Freelance journalist Kanika Banwait says she treats dating apps ""as more of a game right now"" than a tool for looking for a relationship. ""When I get a match, I tend to message the guy but often they don't reply or if they do, the conversation is usually boring or very one sided, so I stop messaging,"" says Banwait. She uses Bumble and Tinder at the moment, but says she isn't really ""committed to them"" and mostly uses them when she's ""bored or trying to fall asleep"" as the ""monotonous swiping makes [her] feel sleepy."" Aside from swiping's soporific benefits, dating apps are frustrating for Banwait. ""You match with someone that you think you could really like and the conversation never takes off because it's easier to not reply to a message or not open an app than it would be to ignore someone if you met in real life or traditional way."" Image: vicky leta / mashable So, if swiping's not working, why not just delete the apps? ""I've had this conversation with a lot of my friends and we all have expressed a dislike for dating apps, but continue to use them because it seems to be the way it works now,"" says Banwait. For those looking for meaningful connections, the gamification of dating apps can be demoralising. Musician Kev Leam finds swiping ""utterly soul-destroying"" due to the lack of interaction. ""On the rare moments I've had a match they've actually come out and said it's just a game to them,"" he says. Despite being disheartened, Leam says he keeps coming back time again on the off-chance that something might come from it. ""I keep going back in the hope that maybe something might come of it which I know is the wrong thing to do but the apps are strangely addictive,"" says Leam. ""I've deleted them numerous times but after a while I download them again but it's the same thing over and over again."" ""That’s a user browsing 7,500 profiles before connecting with someone 'meaningfully. So, are dating app users getting tired of endlessly swiping? This conversation isn't just being had by tired daters who've reached the end of their swiping tether — the dating industry is also asking itself this very question. Scott Harvey, editor of Global Dating Insights — the online dating industry's trade publication — says this question is a ""real talking point within the industry"" right now. ""Swiping is definitely good for matching — plenty of users will rack up dozens or hundreds of matches — but a lot of low quality interaction can follow on from that,"" he says. Harvey broke down the figures of just how much swiping it actually takes to get a meaningful level of engagement. By his estimate, users will need to peruse thousands of profiles before getting any meaningful engagement. ""Say it takes 10 swipes for a match, 2 matches for an opening line, 3 opening lines for a response, 5 responses for a flowing conversation, 5 flowing conversations for a date, and 5 dates for a second date,"" says Harvey. ""That’s a user browsing 7,500 profiles before connecting with someone 'meaningfully.'"" Harvey says that there's a ""feeling out there"" that online daters are ""jaded."" ""The automaticity of swiping and the paradox of choice tend to be the two main criticisms — users look for a quick dopamine hit, and this becomes a higher priority than engaging with their matches,"" says Harvey. The term 'paradox of choice' refers to the notion that having excessive choice — something generally considered to be a good thing — can actually make us unhappy and dissatisfied. So, are swipers using matches for a fleeting moment of validation? Could too much choice be holding us back? One app has already decided to break away from the swiping model. Hinge decided to ditch its swipe-based user experience back in 2016. Back then, the app's CEO and co-founder Justin McLeod had some harsh words about swipe culture. ""Dating websites aren’t being used and dating apps have become like a game that’s dehumanising its players,"" McLeod told TNW. Since making radical changes to its user experience — enabling users to like and reply to specific aspects of a user's profile — the app has reported a significant rise in user engagement. A spokesperson for Hinge told Mashable that prior to getting rid of the swipe only 15 percent of matches were leading to conversations. Now, with Hinge's new non-swipe user experience, three times as many matches turn into conversations compared to the old swiping version of the app. Image: hinge ""They can get you to a real life 'hello,' but can’t accurately predict the value of any subsequent experience."" Dating blogger Lucy Goes Dating says she feels like swipe apps are ""basically killing dating and romance."" As she rightly points out, there's enough evidence to support the fact that swiping does work. ""There are enough stories of people who met their other halves on dating apps to prove that,"" she says. That said, she notes that, for many daters, ""you can get dozens of matches but no one ever messages."" She's tried messaging every single Bumble match, but keeps finding that ""hardly any of them reply."" ""Recently I got 19 matches, only four replied within the required 24 hours, and all four of those fizzled out because the conversation was dull and went nowhere,"" says Lucy. ""The apps need to get better,"" she adds. On the other hand, are we putting too much onus on the apps? Do we need to manage our own expectations about what these apps are capable of achieving? Helen Fisher, Chief Scientific Advisor at Match.com, told IntelligenceSquared: ""these are not dating sites, they are introducing sites."" Harvey says he thinks Fisher's approach is a sensible one. ""They can get you to a real life 'hello,' but can’t accurately predict the value of any subsequent experience just yet,"" says Harvey. As to whether or not a better model exists for ""meaningful online connections,"" Harvey's not sure. ""Some services have compatibility algorithms, such as eHarmony and OkCupid, but there’s not a huge amount of independent science suggesting they work,"" he says. ""I would say watch this space — the apps experimenting with video streaming might be on to something, or the next radical innovation may come with the application of artificial intelligence."" Hinge's shift away from the swipe shows that some daters — those seeking meaningful connections — might need to look to non-swipe-based dating apps. To swipe or not to swipe? That's the ultimate question. For now, I'll be retiring my swiping thumb. It was fun while it lasted.

BENJAMIN MUELLER,"A bartender said in a lawsuit that after a co-worker in 2012 forced his hand onto her genitals and buttocks, the hotel’s director of security chided her for going to the police. The hotel settled the lawsuit in February for an undisclosed sum, a court document indicates. Two female cooks at the hotel said in a 2008 lawsuit that supervisors blocked them from leaving the kitchen, pushed them against counters and rubbed their genitals against the women’s buttocks. The parties reached a confidential settlement agreement, said Bradley C. Gage, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. Mr. Nissenbaum said the hotel was legally prohibited from commenting on employees and related legal matters. Susan Minato, a co-president of Unite Here Local 11 in Los Angeles, said nonunion housekeepers told her they avoid reporting harassment for fear of being fired. Housekeepers at the Peninsula are not unionized. In a bid to secure protections for all workers, with or without a union, Unite Here pressed for legislation in Long Beach, south of Los Angeles, that would have required hotels to provide workers with panic buttons, but the City Council rejected the measure. A union survey of hotel workers in Chicago found that 58 percent of them had been sexually harassed by a guest. Union organizers said immigrant workers were especially vulnerable. And the same power imbalance that gives guests too much control over female workers can also leave workers vulnerable to their managers, said Karen Kent, the president of Unite Here Local 1 in Chicago. Mr. Weinstein frequently turned a fourth-floor Peninsula suite into his headquarters-away-from-home. He put up a team of his staff there, too, a former associate of his said. His stays would likely have brought in thousands of dollars; rooms at the Peninsula cost several hundred dollars a night, while suites can go for more than $2,000 a night. That money bought personalized service. Employees met to discuss the next day’s arrivals. Regular guests could store things for their next stay. For Mr. Weinstein, hotel workers furnished the room of one of his assistants with stationery embossed with the assistant’s name, the former associate said. “Every time you stay there, what you order, what you eat — there’s a record of it,” said a former staff member at the Peninsula who took part in pre-arrival meetings. The hotel is a picture of opulence. On a recent visit, the horseshoe driveway was lined with luxury cars. Hanging from the trees were orbs covered in tiny lights. Inside, attendants scurried around offering drinks. Studio bosses, agents and actors often traveled to Mr. Weinstein’s suite. Photo Two decades ago, the actress Lola Glaudini was introduced to Mr. Weinstein by the actor Edward Norton at a premiere for the film “Rounders.” She was asked to meet Mr. Weinstein at the Peninsula Beverly Hills a few days later. Credit WireImage Video, via Getty Images On a late-summer day in 1998, Lola Glaudini, then 26, arrived at the Peninsula for what she expected to be a meeting about her acting career with Mr. Weinstein. After she asked for him at the front desk, an assistant whisked her upstairs and left her in a suite transformed from a business venue to a bacchanal. A room service cart was heaped with champagne, lobster and shrimp. From the bedroom he told her to pour herself a drink — she did not — and he walked out in hardly any clothing, Ms. Glaudini said. They had met a few days earlier, at a premiere party for the movie “Rounders.” Ms. Glaudini, anxious to fill gaps in her memory, found a red carpet video on YouTube recently that recorded the introductio n. She approached The Times with her story in October shortly after it published an investigation of sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Weinstein. In his suite, Mr. Weinstein asked her to play along in a fantasy, tried coaxing her into bed and, when she declined his advances, told her on the balcony about actresses he claimed to have slept with, including Ms. Paltrow, and suggested she do the same for a role. “All I just kept wanting to do was get the meeting on track,” Ms. Glaudini said. “I wanted the meeting.” Afterward, she said she steadied herself with a glass of wine at the hotel bar, scanning women who walked in for someone she feared might become his next victim. She said she told her father and her then-boyfriend, now-husband. In separate interviews, they both confirmed her account and recalled Ms. Glaudini being shaken and disappointed. A few days later, Mr. Weinstein sent her a card urging her to contact his development team if she came up with a project, Ms. Glaudini said. He told her he would be happy to join the meeting.

Chris Welch,"Australian shoppers will find themselves limited to a much smaller Amazon item selection beginning on July 1st. Instead of being able to visit and make purchases from international versions of Amazon’s web store — as most of us can do — they’ll be redirected to the local Australian site. Geoblocking isn’t the only strategy Amazon is taking; Amazon.com and the company’s other sites will no longer ship to Australian addresses as of the same date. When I say “much smaller,” Amazon’s local Australia site still sells tens of millions of products, but it’s definitely a significantly lesser total than you’d find from Amazon’s US site. Reuters estimates that it offers one-tenth of Amazon.com’s selection. All the basics should be readily available, but this will be a real problem for certain item categories. The move is the result of Amazon’s unwillingness to cooperate with Australia’s updated GST (goods and services tax), which would require the online retail giant to collect a 10 percent tax on all purchases that are shipped to Australia from overseas; previously the GST only applied to imported items over A$1,000. “While we regret any inconvenience this may cause customers, we have had to assess the workability of the legislation as a global business with multiple international sites,” an Amazon spokesperson told The Sydney Morning Herald. The legislation was lobbied for by local, smaller online and brick-and-mortar retailers like Harvey Norman. “They think they have the right to pay no tax in Australia,” the company’s executive chairman Gerry Harvey told the Herald. “They’ve done the dirty on the government. They’ve done the dirty on the public.” Accusations that Amazon attempts to skirt around or mold tax laws to its liking are nothing new, but this is one instance where consumers are going to feel the brunt of the standoff. The Herald notes that some savvy shoppers are already looking into utilizing package redirection services so that they can continue getting their very particular items from Amazon — even if shipping will take a little longer. Amazon reportedly “baulked at the massive administrative burden of tracking Australian GST from all overseas transactions,” according to Australia’s ABC News. eBay had also once warned that the revised GST legislation would similarly force it to block Australian shoppers from importing items, but it has since changed its tune. “We won’t block Aussie buyers, redirect them, or require them to pretend they are located overseas. Australians will continue to be able to buy from any eBay site,” a spokesperson said. “This requires major changes to eBay’s global systems and we are working to have these ready by July 1st.”","Instead of being able to visit and make purchases on international versions of Amazon’s web store, Australian shoppers will be redirected to the local Australian site.

Bonnie Burton,"Nothing says ""Happy Life Day"" quite like Chewbacca wearing a Snuggie. Lucasfilm Say the words The Star Wars Holiday Special around a group of geeks, and you'll most likely be met with guttural groans and a lot of glares. The 97-minute TV special debuted on Nov. 17, 1978 (making this its 40th-anniversary year), and never aired again. Many fans, as well as director George Lucas, would prefer to pretend the Wookiee- and disco-saturated show never existed, but I watch it every year as a holiday tradition to amuse myself and horrify my friends. The infamous TV special aired on CBS, parent company of CNET. It featured not only the iconic Star Wars characters Chewbacca, Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Darth Vader, C-3PO and R2-D2, but also new characters like Chewie's wife Malla, his son Lumpy and his father Itchy. If that's not intriguing enough, we get Golden Girls actress Bea Arthur playing Ackmena the cantina bartender; The Carol Burnett Show veteran Harvey Korman playing a myriad of bizarre characters; and actor Art Carney as electronics salesman Saun Dann and friend to the Wookiees. The gist of the plot is that Han Solo and Chewbacca are on their way home to the Wookiee planet of Kashyyyk to celebrate the holiday Life Day, which is sort of like Christmas without Jesus and involves just a lot of awkward caroling in space with Wookiees wearing red robes and led by a very out-of-it Princess Leia played by the late Carrie Fisher. However, on the way home in the Millennium Falcon, Han and Chewie encounter enemy attack from the Empire and are delayed. That's as close to the real movie action as we're gonna get. The rest feels like Keeping Up With the Kardashians with Wookiees. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) may or may not be comfortably numb in The Star Wars Holiday Special. Lucasfilm George Lucas was busy working on The Empire Strikes Back in 1978, so he left creating, directing and producing The Star Wars Holiday Special to Smith-Hemion Productions, which also produced the Tony Awards. Because of Lucas' lack of usual attention to a Star Wars project, the show went from being a possible extension of A New Hope to a bizarre variety-show style farce that could only be appreciated while intoxicated or heavily sedated. It's been reported that Lucas wishes he could destroy every copy. According to various urban legends, Lucas said, ""If I had the time and a hammer, I would smash every copy of the Holiday Special."" In reality, he told Maxim magazine in a May 2002 interview, ""That's one of those things that happened, and I just have to live with it."" Related stories In addition to calling the show cheesy and even unwatchable, fans often grumble that it promises appearances from the original Star Wars cast only to deliver the occasional cameo from Skype-like calls from Luke, R2-D2, Leia and C-3PO to check in on Malla with concern that Han and Chewie haven't arrived home for Life Day yet. Boba Fett even shows up -- in a Star Wars cartoon created by the production company Nelvana midway through the show. Lumpy watches an animated short featuring Luke, Han, Vader, C-3PO, R2-D2 and his own dad Chewbacca. Since the Holiday Special airs before The Empire Strikes Back premieres, this is where fans remember being introduced to the beloved bounty hunter. Personally, I love the random, non-canon characters -- most notably Bea Arthur who tends bar at a cantina full of aliens and the Bith band ""Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes."" She fends off affection from yet another character played by Korman. But best of all she sings a you-don't-have-to-go-home-but-you-can't-stay-here song called ""Goodnight But Not Goodbye"" to kick out all the bar patrons. It's like an episode of Cheers in space! Bea Arthur as Ackmena, the cantina bartender who serves drinks to every thirsty alien in the galaxy in Star Wars Holiday Special. Lucasfilm The bulk of the show takes place at Casa de Chewie. Malla is cooking Bantha Surprise for dinner with help from ""The Julia Child of the Milky Way"" Gormaanda, played by Harvey Korman in drag who endlessly chants ""Whip! Whip! Stir! Stir! Whip!"" Meanwhile, Lumpy watches holographic dancers that act like Cirque du Soleil on acid. This goes on for what seems like hours and is usually when most Star Wars fans cry ""Uncle Owen!"" Amateurs. For me, however, the show is a practically a master class in Wookiee speak. You don't really pay attention to what Wookiees sound like until you're forced to listen to their roars, moans, chuckles and whines in endless bouts of conversation that never get subtitled. When I watch the special, I like to shout out my own Wookiee translations, which are probably way off-base from the real plot and a lot more R-rated then they need to be. ""If your family has a hearty appetite, I would suggest that old holiday favorite, the Bantha rump,"" advised ""The Julia Child of the Milky Way"" Gormaanda (played by Harvey Korman). Lucasfilm The show takes a rather smarmy turn when Art Carney shows up at the Wookiee household wearing his unbuttoned, large-lapeled disco shirt with gray chest hair spilling out. He flirts with Malla then gives Grandpa Itchy what I can only describe as ""awkward hologram porn"" featuring actress Diahann Carroll wearing a form-fitting Bob Mackie gown perfect for Studio 54. As Mermeia, she sings suggestively to a lustful elderly Wookiee. Before you can heave in your mouth at the thought of what Grandpa Itchy may or may not be doing while watching Mermeia, Stormtroopers show up at the Wookiee household to stir things up looking for Han and Chewie. Don't worry! Carney comes to the rescue with a Jefferson Starship hologram music video to distract the Empire. Before you argue that this kind of absurdist Star Wars action is what makes the show unwatchable, let me remind you that with this camp comes a wide selection of vintage commercials that alone make it worth your while to find a bootlegged copy. My favorites include a sing-along PSA for the Ladies Garment Workers Union complete with more pantsuits and beehives than a Grease reunion. There's a CBS News break about the Soviet neutron bomb, a caught double agent and a blizzard in Minnesota. Creepy Contac cold medicine capsules being spilled out like a slow-mo version of Valley of the Dolls. Control-top pantyhose for the working woman. A guy wearing a shimmering gold-spandex body suit delivering flowers at a hospital for FTD. A Lincoln Mercury Bobcat Wagon for sale at only $4,142. And finally, a retro commercial for the new line of Star Wars toys, which include the ultimate kid fantasy -- a Death Star Space Station complete with a working trash compactor! It's that classic Star Wars toy commercial that reminds us what this whole saga really means to fans -- a celebration of oddballs trying to find their destinies in a galaxy full of powerful villains, malfunctioning droids and a Jedi who just wants to be a hero. While The Star Wars Holiday Special feels more like a Wookiee reality show, it still holds some magic for those of us who want to believe that somewhere out there, Malla is cooking Bantha Surprise and Bea Arthur has a pint waiting for us.

LIVIA ALBECK-RIPKA,"Theresa Byrne, who lives in Salem, Ore., said the city took too long to inform residents that most plastics and egg and milk cartons were now considered garbage. “I was angry,” she said. “I believe in recycling.” Other communities, like Grants Pass, Ore., home to about 37,000 people, are continuing to encourage their residents to recycle as usual, but the materials are winding up in landfills anyway. Local waste managers said they were concerned that if they told residents to stop recycling, it could be hard to get them to start again. It is “difficult with the public to turn the spigot on and off,” said Brian Fuller, a waste manager with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. The fallout has spread beyond the West Coast. Ben Harvey, the president of E.L. Harvey &amp; Sons, a recycling company based in Westborough, Mass., said that he had around 6,000 tonsof paper and cardboard piling up, when he would normally have a couple hundred tons stockpiled. The bales are filling almost half of his 80,000-square-foot facility. “It’s really impacted our day-to-day operations,” Mr. Harvey said. “It’s stifling me.” Recyclers in Canada, Australia, Britain, Germany and other parts of Europe have also scrambled to find alternatives. Still, across much of the United States, including most major cities, recycling is continuing as usual. Countries like India, Vietnam and Indonesia are importing more of the materials that are not processed domestically. And some waste companies have responded to China’s ban by stockpiling material while looking for new processors, or hoping that China reconsiders its policy.",Plastics and papers from dozens of American cities and towns are being dumped in landfills after China stopped recycling most “foreign garbage.”,2018-05-29T10:20:02Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Your Recycling Gets Recycled, Right?

Cat Schuknecht,"In May, Harvey Weinstein turned himself in to police following allegations by several women of sexual misconduct. Weinstein's lawyer will try to persuade a judge on Thursday to throw out the charges against the movie mogul.
Andres Kudacki/AP
At a hearing in New York on Thursday morning, Harvey Weinstein's legal team will try to convince a judge that the sexual assault charges against the movie mogul should be dropped and the case thrown out.
Weinstein turned himself in to police in May, some seven months after The New York Times and The New Yorker reported for the first time that multiple women were accusing him of sexual misconduct. In June, Weinstein pleaded not guilty to charges that he sexually assaulted three women.
""Mr. Weinstein has denied these crimes,"" Weinstein's attorney Benjamin Brafman told a gaggle of reporters after the movie producer's plea hearing. ""He has maintained that he has never engaged in non-consensual sex with anyone."" 
Additional charges were filed against Weinstein in July.
At the time, it seemed like a big win for the #MeToo movement; dozens of women had come forward to accuse Weinstein of rape and sexual misconduct that took place over nearly four decades. The movement, named for the social media hashtag #MeToo, has also led to the downfall of other powerful men in media including NPRentertainment, politics and other industries.
But six months later, the case against Weinstein may be in trouble.
One of the six charges against him has already been dropped due to an error by the lead detective on the case, according to The New York Times. And on Thursday, Brafman will move to have the rest of the charges thrown out.
""Mr. Weinstein is, you know, embarrassed by the fact that he had these extramarital relationships at a time when he was married,"" Brafman told NPR's Joel Rose and Rose Friendman. ""You know I'm not defending his behavior. I'm defending specific acts of criminal conduct.""
Brafman's reasoning for dismissing the case rests on two arguments: that a detective involved in Weinstein's arrest made several key mistakes in his investigation and that the women who accused his client are lying.
As NPR has previously reported, the prosecution says New York Police Department detective Nicholas DiGaudio erred in his communications with Weinstein's accusers more than once, including encouraging one accuser to delete personal data from her phone before she handed it over to police.
An expert on police investigations told NPR that DiGaudio's behavior made it look like he was trying to influence the investigation.
NPR previously reported that prosecutors also say DiGaudio fumbled when he interviewed a second accuser.
""The detective had interviewed one of Weinstein's accusers, Lucia Evans, who says the film producer assaulted her in 2004. (Evans told her story to The New Yorker last year.) DiGaudio also interviewed one of Evans' friends, who says she remembers Evans describing her encounters with Weinstein differently.
But then, according to prosecutors, the detective failed to inform them about key differences in their stories and told the friend that ""going forward, 'less is more' "" and that she had no obligation to cooperate with law enforcement.""
The NYPD wouldn't let NPR talk to DiGaudio, but the police union told NPR that the detective did his job and that the information was handed over but was ""forgotten or ignored"" by prosecutors.
In October, prosecutors disclosed these and other mistakes to Weinstein's lawyers, who moved to have the assault charge based on Evans' allegations thrown out. The prosecutors agreed and the charge was dismissed.
""I'm baffled by the D.A.'s decision,"" Evans' attorney, Carrie Goldberg, told NPR.
Goldberg and others say they think the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., is afraid to take someone as powerful as Weinstein to court. In an earlier run-in with Weinstein in 2015, Vance declined to bring charges against the producer when he was recorded admitting to groping an Italian model.

Scott K. Johnson,"Enlarge / Warm sea surface temperatures on August 23, 2017, just before Hurricane Harvey. reader comments 4 We’ve covered several studies seeking to clarify the role of human-caused climate change in the unbelievable amounts of water Hurricane Harvey dumped on Houston last year. The general approach of these studies was to simulate today’s climate and a pre-global-warming climate, and to then compare the behavior of hurricanes around Houston. Since most people understand that hurricanes are fueled by warm ocean water, however, perhaps it would be conceptually simpler to focus on the seawater beneath Harvey. That has now been done by a new study led by Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. By analyzing the heat energy present in the Gulf of Mexico—and how much was lost as Harvey spun through—researchers get a fairly direct measure of Harvey’s fuel. As long as wind speeds at higher altitude aren’t fast enough to tear a baby cyclone apart, sea surface temperatures over 26°C can grow that baby into a tyrant. Warm, moist air over the water gets pulled into the storm’s low pressure center, where it buoyantly rises. As it begins to cool, some of the water vapor condenses—which releases a considerable amount of heat, which keeps the air rising. Just as evaporating sweat carries heat energy away from your skin, evaporating seawater carries heat energy away from the ocean and up into the engine of the hurricane. By measuring the change in ocean heat energy as a hurricane passes, you can work out how much energy went into its engine. The difficulty is that we only have so many floats and ships out there making measurements, so you rarely have enough data to reliably calculate that fairly rapid change. In this case, the researchers compared average heat energy in the upper ocean in the Gulf of Mexico for August 1-20 (just before Harvey) with September 1-20. Satellites now measure sea surface temperatures every day, although they can’t reach below the surface to really measure total heat energy. When Harvey entered the Gulf of Mexico, it encountered record ocean heat energy (top graph in the image below). That wasn’t just random chance—average sea surface temperatures have increased about 0.6°C since 1960 (lower graph below). Global warming obviously includes warming seawater, which means greater ocean heat energy. Enlarge / Ocean heat content (OHC, top) and sea surface temperatures (SST, bottom) in the Gulf of Mexico since 1960. As Hurricane Harvey grew strong feeding on that energy, it left water about 1° to 2°C cooler in its wake (but still above the 26°C hurricane threshold). Doing the math, the researchers estimate this represents about 590 billion gigajoules of heat energy lost by the upper ocean. Want another big number you can’t really fathom for comparison? That’s like the ocean powered two 100 watt incandescent lightbulbs for every square meter of the Gulf of Mexico … for a month. Enlarge / Measurements of ocean temperature at various depths before and after Hurricane Harvey's passage. As that energy was released when rain condensed to fall back down, you can balance the energy ledger by adding up the total rainfall. At about a quarter of a quadrillion liters of water, this represents around 600 billion gigajoules of released heat energy—which compares pretty well to the 590 billion gigajoules of estimated heat energy lost by the ocean. The point here is that you can tie Harvey’s extreme rainfall directly to the ocean heat it consumed. And with ocean heat energy at a record level after decades of global warming, it’s pretty difficult to argue that humans didn’t juice the storm. The researchers also add a brief discussion of how well we are preparing for disasters like 2017’s many deadly Atlantic hurricanes. Efforts to respond to climate change are usually grouped into two categories: mitigation (slowing warming) or adaptation (protections to limit harm). The authors remind us that there’s a third option illustrated by these disasters: do little and “suffer the consequences.” “Houston has been beset with three 500-year floods in 3 years prior to Harvey, and Miami regularly experiences ‘sunny day’ flooding with high tides,” they write. “Why was there reportedly only one in six with flood insurance in the Houston area and Florida? Why have various flood mitigation measures not been enacted?” If we know the fuel for storms like Harvey is increasing, it becomes even more urgent to stop dragging our feet and protect the communities that could be next in harm’s way.

In a New York Times article, she says Weinstein pushed her down and ""tried to expose himself"" at the producer's hotel room in London during the 1990s, before she managed to ""wriggle away"". Harvey Weinstein's spokeswoman said the claims about an assault ""are untrue"". The 47-year-old star also said she was raped as a teenager by an unnamed actor who was 20 years her senior. Thurman had expressed anger at Weinstein last November, saying: ""I'm glad it's going slowly - you don't deserve a bullet.""

But she details her claims in a 3,000-word feature published in the New York Times on Saturday, entitled: ""This is why Uma Thurman is angry"". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey Weinstein has been at the centre of a string of abuse allegations What does Uma Thurman say? Among the revelations in the article are that Thurman was sexually assaulted at age 16, at the beginning of her career. She met an actor - who is not named - at a Manhattan nightclub, and was ""coerced"" when she returned to his home for a late-night drink. ""I was ultimately compliant,"" she told the newspaper. ""I tried to say no, I cried, I did everything I could do. He told me the door was locked but I never ran over and tried the knob."" ""When I got home, I remember I stood in front of the mirror and I looked at my hands and I was so mad at them for not being bloody or bruised."" Her allegations regarding Weinstein took place in the time period after the success of the 1994 Quentin Tarantino film Pulp Fiction, which was produced by Weinstein. The alleged incident took place at his suite in London's Savoy Hotel. ""He pushed me down. He tried to shove himself on me... He did all kinds of unpleasant things,"" Thurman told the Times. ""But he didn't actually put his back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard."" She said a bunch of flowers arrived the next day with a note reading: ""You have great instincts."" And that in the aftermath, Weinstein's assistants kept calling about new film projects. What was Harvey Weinstein's response? A spokeswoman for Harvey Weinstein - who is in rehab - issued a statement in the wake of the story's publication. It said his team had contacted the New York Times and sent photographs ""that demonstrate the strong relationship Mr Weinstein and Ms Thurman had"". The newspaper acknowledged receiving ""chummy photos"" of the pair at premieres and parties. ""Mr Weinstein acknowledges making an awkward pass 25 years ago at Ms Thurman in England after misreading her signals, after a flirtatious exchange in Paris, for which he immediately apologised and deeply regrets,"" the statement said. ""However, her claims about being physically assaulted are untrue."" ""There was no physical contact during Mr Weinstein's awkward pass and [he] is saddened and puzzled as to why Ms Thurman... waited 25 years to make these allegations public"". What about Quentin Tarantino? Thurman also detailed the rift between herself and director Quentin Tarantino, who - alongside Weinstein - made Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, two of Thurman's most successful films. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Quentin Tarantino, Uma Thurman, and Harvey Weinstein, pictured at the Kill Bill Vol 2 after party in 2004 But she revealed that she fell out with Tarantino over a car crash scene in Kill Bill. She alleges that there were known issues with the convertible car, that Tarantino was ""furious"" at her insistence that they use a stunt driver during filming, and persuaded her to drive the car - which crashed, injuring her. The incident would mar the pair's relationship. Thurman threatened to sue Weinstein's studio but says she was denied access to the crash footage for 15 years.

BENJAMIN MUELLER,"Prosecutors in the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., conducted dozens of interviews in New York and elsewhere and issued hundreds of subpoenas, and their inquiry is not over. An investigative grand jury, still convened, will look into other sexual assault allegations against Mr. Weinstein as well as possible financial crimes relating to how he paid women to stay silent, people familiar with the proceedings said. Among other things, the grand jury is delving into whether Mr. Weinstein used employees of his former production company to identify women for him to assault, to set up meetings with the women or to discredit them if they complained. Three years ago, the Manhattan district attorney’s office decided not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein after an Italian model, Ambra Battilana, accused him of groping her breasts during a meeting in his office. In the recent inquiry, detectives traveled to the United Kingdom and Canada to interview witnesses and investigators were in Los Angeles as recently as late April and early May, several people briefed on the matter have said. Prosecutors have also combed through Mr. Weinstein’s financial records in an effort to uncover any possible improprieties, several people have said.","Mr. Weinstein will be arraigned on charges of first-degree rape and third-degree rape in one case, and first-degree criminal sex act in another, officials said.",2018-05-25T12:04:54Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Harvey Weinstein Turns Himself in for Arrest on Rape Charges in New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-arrested.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/26/nyregion/26weinstein-sub/26weinstein-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Harvey,0
Reuters Editorial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said on Sunday he had filed suit against The Weinstein Company, Harvey Weinstein, and Robert Weinstein, alleging the company’s executives and board failed to protect employees from movie producer and former CEO Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein, co-founder of the Miramax studio, was one of Hollywood’s most influential men before more than 70 women accused him of sexual misconduct, including rape. He denies having non-consensual sex with anyone. Schneiderman said in a statement that any sale of The Weinstein Company must ensure that victims will be compensated. The studio has been in talks to sell itself to a group of investors led by former Obama administration official Maria Contreras-Sweet, but Scheiderman’s lawsuit has put deal negotiations on hold, according to people familiar with the matter.

Proma Khosla,"A new New Yorker article provides a more detailed look at the legal gymnastics employed by Harvey Weinstein and Miramax to silence victims of Weinstein's alleged sexual assault and harassment. A former employee described her exhausting experience trying to accuse and persecute Weinstein for allegedly assaulting her assistant, a twisted ordeal that ended in a payoff from Bob Weinstein 's personal bank account. SEE ALSO: Harvey Weinstein reportedly hired private investigators to discredit accusers One of the most damning parts of the piece is that Bob Weinstein, who previously claimed to be unaware of his brother's history of sexual misconduct, paid off two women from his personal bank account as if to absolve Miramax of any involvement. And as many people have said since this first started, Bob Weinstein was complicit and any interview he gave stating otherwise was the same garbage lies his brother spewed. https://t.co/TE8PkRha7P — Carrie 🎃 🍁 (@VampVixyn) November 21, 2017 Bob Weinstein confirmed to the New Yorker that he made the payments, but that he wasn't fully aware of the circumstances; he thought his brother was having affairs, consensual ones, but a Miramax executive said that isn't believable; the harassment allegations were reported to the company. Where the recent deluge of public accusations have finally shattered Weinstein's professional persona, the years of accusations behind closed doors seemingly did nothing to curtail his behavior. On the contrary, paying off his victims made it possible for Weinstein to continue his awful behavior. Weinstein's lawyers repeated his current statement: He never engaged in any non-consensual sexual behavior and that any such accusations are untrue ( over 100 women have accused Weinstein of unwanted sexual advances). “Repeat offenders are able to operate under a cloak of silence with the help of nondisclosure agreements,” NYU law professor Samuel Estreicher told the New Yorker. Weinstein's former assistant Zelda Perkins, one of the women paid by Bob Weinstein, said she spent years trying to curtail his advances and attempt to rectify his behavior. ""Ultimately, the reason Harvey Weinstein followed the route he did is because he was allowed to, and that’s our fault. As a culture, that’s our fault."" ""What I want to talk about at this point is not what Harvey did,” she said in the article. “It’s more about the system that protected him and that enabled him, because that’s the only thing that we can change. Money and power enabled, and the legal system has enabled. Ultimately, the reason Harvey Weinstein followed the route he did is because he was allowed to, and that’s our fault. As a culture, that’s our fault.” Many of Weinstein's employees and victims were subject to lifetime nondisclosure agreements that prohibited them from literally ever speaking about what they had witnessed and worked with. “People should not be made to live with that,"" said former employee Irwin Reiter. ""He’s created so many victims that have been burdened for so many years, and it’s just not right.” The New Yorker has previous reported on the complex and convoluted network Weinstein had in place to protect his sexual misconduct while racking up accolades and reputability for Miramax in the film industry. Many who were part of this have issued statements or resigned since Weinstein's public exposure.

Proma Khosla,"Hollywood is in the middle of the movement, and while it continues to topple powerful men, at least one has thus far proved immune: Woody Allen. In an opinion column for the Los Angeles Times, Dylan Farrow, whom Allen and Mia Farrow adopted, questioned how the industry that finally toppled Harvey Weinstein and quickly turned on Louis C.K. continues to support Allen – and to silence his accuser. SEE ALSO: Jennifer Lawrence to Oprah: Harvey Weinstein could be 'a brute' Farrow was seven when, according to her accounts, Allen got her alone in the attic and sexually assaulted her. Ultimately, a custody judge ruled that Allen's behavior was ""grossly inappropriate"" but the case did not go to criminal trial. Allen stands accused – just like Harvey Weinstein, Brett Ratner, James Toback, and more. And they're on their way the hell out of town while Allen soaks in another movie release. ""It is a testament to Allen’s public relations team and his lawyers that few know these simple facts,"" Farrow wrote in the Times. ""It also speaks to the forces that have historically protected men like Allen: the money and power deployed to make the simple complicated, to massage the story."" Farrow points to the conflicting messages of prominent celebrities like Kate Winslet, Blake Lively, and Greta Gerwig, all of whom adamantly support the women coming forward to oust sexual misconduct in Hollywood but who shy away from Allen's personal history while working with him. Farrow's op-ed contains glowing quotes from all three actresses about working with Allen that are juxtaposed with criticism of Weinstein and others. In October, Allen expressed sympathy for Weinstein and warned against Hollywood embarking upon a ""witch hunt."" It's worth noting that one of the early Weinstein investigations after news broke was written by Dylan's brother Ronan.

JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.,"“I never allowed the media circus, if you will, to impact my focus,” Mr. Brafman said in an interview on Thursday. “My determination is to extricate my client from this mess.” Not all of Mr. Brafman’s clients end up in the clear. Despite Mr. Brafman’s efforts to humanize Martin Shkreli, the boorish pharmaceutical executive notorious for price gouging, jurors convicted Mr. Shkreli in August on three counts of fraud relating to two hedge funds and a drug company he previously ran. Photo Blair Berk, who represented the artist CeeLo Green in 2014, was first hired by Harvey Weinstein in October 2016. Credit Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Mr. Brafman declined to comment on the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, except to say he would “vigorously defend” his client. Paz de la Huerta, an actress known for her work on “Boardwalk Empire,” has accused the movie mogul of raping her on two occasions in 2010 in her TriBeCa apartment. The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., has said his office is investigating those accusations. The accusation presents challenges for investigators. Seven years have passed and the crime was not reported to the police at the time. Ms. de la Huerta did speak to a therapist about the encounters, saying she felt coerced to have sex with Mr. Weinstein because of his power and rank in the industry, according to her lawyer, Aaron Filler. In Los Angeles, the authorities are delving into similar accusations by an 38-year-old Italian actress who maintains Mr. Weinstein forced his way into her room at a Beverly Hills hotel in February 2013 and raped her in a bathroom. Ms. Berk declined to comment on that investigation. She was first hired by Mr. Weinstein in October 2016 and brought in Mr. Brafman as her co-counsel in Manhattan earlier this year. Ms. Berk, who graduated from Harvard Law School, grew up in Chapel Hill, N.C., where her father and mother also practiced law. She has a reputation for avoiding publicity and working behind the scenes to negotiate favorable plea bargains or to stave off criminal charges. Mr. Brafman has a more modest educational pedigree but a touch of showmanship. The son of Holocaust survivors, he grew up in Brooklyn and Queens, earning his bachelor’s degree at night at Brooklyn College. He earned a law degree from Ohio Northern University’s College of Law before landing a job in Manhattan district attorney’s office in the late 1970s. As a defense lawyer, he has represented mobsters and drug dealers, as well as celebrities like the artists Jay-Z and Michael Jackson. In court, has a knack for getting inside the heads of witnesses on cross-examination, and he often uses self-deprecating humor to win over jurors, making quips, for example, about his own short stature. “Ben grew up as a borscht belt comedian, and he has got the quickest wit,” said Paul Shechtman, another criminal defense lawyer. “Jury trials, even in high profile cases, can be dull and humor keeps a jury awake and can keep them on your side.” Correction: November 9, 2017 An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a criminal defense lawyer.

Heather Dockray,"After The New York Times published Uma Thurman's #MeToo account on Saturday, one person dominated the coverage — Harvey Weinstein. But the actress recounted two stories of abuse in the Times piece, one featuring Harvey Weinstein and the other, Quentin Tarantino. Only the Weinstein story featured sexual assault and misconduct, which is why only one would be classified as a traditional #MeToo story. The allegations against Tarantino are harder to classify. They don't involve sexual assault or harassment or anything that could be neatly categorized as sexual misconduct. But both stories, however distant from one another they may seem, involve an abuse of power that feels both gendered and familiar, adding a whole other layer of complexity to the increasingly intricate #MeToo conversation. SEE ALSO: Uma Thurman opens up about her anger at Harvey Weinstein and Quentin Tarantino In the piece (which is worth a full, make-it-to-the-end read ), Thurman alleges that Tarantino compromised her physical safety while on the set of Kill Bill. For one particular stunt, Tarantino asked Thurman, who is not an stunt actor, to drive a blue convertible that had recently been refitted with an automatic transmission. According to the actress, a teamster had told her the car might not be operating that well. Thurman expressed her concerns to Tarantino and asked that a stunt person drive the car instead. She shared what she remembers of Tarantino's response with the Times : ""He was furious because I’d cost them a lot of time. But I was scared. He said: ‘I promise you the car is fine. It’s a straight piece of road.’"" In the end, he persuaded her to do it. Thurman crashed the car while shooting the scene, leaving crew members to pull her from the wreckage. She said the incident left her with permanent damage to both her neck and her knees. Thurman pressed Tarantino for 15 years before he agreed to show her footage of the incident. But her description of his behavior on the day of the crash was just one example of a recurring pattern: She said the director also personally performed some of the film's more sadistic stunts, including spitting in her face and choking her. Everything about this is difficult to read, and the video is horrible to watch. I can't stop thinking about how we were sold this narrative about Uma Thurman being Tarantino's ""muse,"" and how often ""muse"" seems to serve as cover for all manner of abuse. https://t.co/DgSaOohLdk — Melissa McEwan (@Shakestweetz) February 3, 2018 It's hard to know to how to characterize Tarantino's alleged behavior without minimizing it or making it something it's not. This isn't sexual abuse. It's not physical assault. What happened to Thurman on the set of Kill Bill is nonetheless a dangerous, seemingly gendered abuse of power. Her story hits home in an industry where male auteurs like Tarantino have so much power over the actresses they call their muses (as Tarantino has called Thurman throughout his career, ugh). Notably, Thurman says it was Tarantino's actions — not Weinstein's — that finally ""killed"" her. ""Harvey assaulted me but that didn’t kill me,"" Thurman told the Times. ""What really got me about the crash was that it was a cheap shot. I had been through so many rings of fire by that point. I had really always felt a connection to the greater good in my work with Quentin and most of what I allowed to happen to me and what I participated in was kind of like a horrible mud wrestle with a very angry brother. But at least I had some say, you know?” The incident transformed Thurman ""from a creative collaborator and performer"" to a ""broken tool."" Her experience has echoes. It's also a challenge to pin down. Outside of vocabulary like exploitation and abuse, Tarantino's alleged actions can't be neatly classified. In fact, Tarantino's alleged response may require a more specific vocabulary, one that the #MeToo movement has yet to develop. Quentin Tarantino choked Uma Thurman, spat in her face, and forced her into a car crash. After the Weinstein revelations Tarantino said, “I knew enough to do more than I did.” He was *part* of the abuse, just as so many other men pretending to be “shocked” or “sorry” are. — Kaivan Shroff (@KaivanShroff) February 3, 2018 There's an argument to be made that Thurman's Tarantino story belongs in a different conversation, one that's parallel to #MeToo. The behavior she describes fits neatly into debates we have about gender, toxic masculinity and the abuse of power. Since Tarantino's alleged abuse of Thurman wasn't specifically sexual, the logic goes, it doesn't belong in the #MeToo conversation even if it still fits in alongside it. It's a well-intended line of reasoning — but one that might eclipse the movement's fundamental message. Tarantino didn't harass Thurman, at least not in the traditional sense. He did, however, abuse his position in a way that feels both gendered and, to the thousands of women who will read Thurman's story, systematic. There aren't many women who've worked with Quentin Tarantino and can easily identify with Uma's exact experience. Yet there are millions who've been asked to do something they don't want to do by a man who has more power than they do — and then complied because he demanded it. You don't have to be a female star in Hollywood for a story about men who abuse their position to resonate. We might not know where exactly to position Thurman's story under the #MeToo umbrella. But it can still belong there, even if we don't know how to label it — yet.","After The New York Times published Uma Thurman's #MeToo account on Saturday, one person dominated the coverage — Harvey Weinstein.

Chris Jones,"On August 24 at 8:20 pm, a 44-year-old moonlighting meteorologist named Eric Berger was nearly finished writing a post for his Houston-centric blog, Space City Weather, titled “ Harvey Late Night: Some Final Thursday Thoughts.” He was in his home office. He had just poured himself a glass of cabernet. He had been looking at the online forecasts from the National Hurricane Center and agreed with their essential conclusions: Harvey was a well-­organized storm that would land with hurricane force on the Texas Gulf Coast somewhere between Corpus Christi and Port O’Connor. Berger also backed the center’s belief that the winds would be strong in Houston that weekend, perhaps more than 40 miles per hour. But he was far more worried about the rain. The unanswered question is what happens to Harvey once it reaches the coast, Berger wrote. Where will it go, and will it go fast enough? Houston’s rainfall totals over the next five days depend on this, and we just don’t know. The considerable majority of modern weather forecasting is aided by computer algorithm. Most hurricane tracking relies on data crunched by various public and private computer models, and the models, which take different variables (temperature, moisture, mass) and consider them in different ways, are not always in agreement. The National Hurricane Center takes input from several models to make its predictions, averaging out their differences, in part because it faces the tallest order in hurricane forecasting: It must say that the hurricane will go here. So must television meteorologists, one of the center’s principal conduits to a concerned public. TV, too, demands a singular answer. Berger doesn’t have to draw a line. He is a certified meteorologist, but the weather is just a particularly absorbing hobby of his; his primary paying gig is writing about aerospace for Ars Technica (a site owned by WIRED Media Group), and he blogs about the weather in his free time. That gives him two luxuries that most front-line meteorologists don’t have: He can value certain models and their ensembles much more heavily than others, untangling as many as 50 different versions of each forecast, and he can also admit doubt. He can explore the subtlety of the weather, marveling at its mysteries, the way he has for his small but loyal community of readers for years, but especially since he established his site in October 2015. Berger does not generate his forecasts from scratch, pointing his licked finger into the wind and taking readings from the Galileo thermometer on his windowsill. He really does have a Galileo thermometer on his windowsill, but he works out of a home office that he hasn’t otherwise bothered to decorate, with a basic PC and a single monitor on which he toggles between tabs, from forecast to conflicting forecast. In Houston that evening, the US government forecast called for about 15 inches of rain. By then Berger had already begun to wonder. There is one model he has come to trust and rely on more than any other: the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’ Integrated Forecasting System, more popularly known in the US as the European model. Funded by 22 EU members and 12 cooperating states, the European model is sometimes shockingly accurate, in part because it’s so well financed and its computing power is stronger than most. With Harvey, it suggested that the storm would stall over Houston, dumping 25 inches of rain or more before eventually moving on. That synced with Berger’s own analysis of the weather patterns in the atmosphere. He detected a troublesome absence of steering currents, the forces that push hurricanes to wherever they’re headed next, and without those currents, the European model’s forecast of a stall made a lot of sense. Given the sum of the evidence before him, Berger felt confident in one fearsome prediction, and he wrote as much: Big-time floods are coming to Texas. It was, at its essence, an informed gut call, and Berger thought carefully about what he would write next. He had made his reputation, such as it was for a leisure-­time meteorologist with a city-specific weather blog, by refusing to submit to the hysterical frenzies that competent weather observers dismiss as “storm porn.” He is by nature a fairly skeptical person. His twin passions, space and the weather, share long histories of broken promises and unmet expectations. His site’s motto is “Hype-free forecasts for greater Houston,” mindful of the chaotic and ultimately unnecessary evacuations prompted by Hurricane Rita in 2005. I am not going to sugar-coat this, my friends, he had written in advance of that storm. As a Houston resident and property owner, I am truly mortified right now. Rita and Berger had both missed. But underplaying weather of dire consequences could lead to a different kind of calamity for his readers. James Spann, Alabama’s longtime weather forecaster of choice, had infamously botched that state’s ice storms of January 2014. Spann had predicted a “dusting” of snow, and unworried commuters headed out on the roads; when that dusting turned out to be a thick layer of ice, Spann shouldered much of the blame for the thousands of people who ended up stranded in their cars, schools, and workplaces overnight. Berger despises alarmism in all its forms. He also didn’t want to bear responsibility for children drowning in their attics. Berger’s wife, Amanda, was getting their own two daughters ready for bed in their League City apartment, temporary accommodations while the family builds their dream home in nearby Clear Creek. His dog, Bonnie, a Maltese-­poodle cross who dislikes all men but him, kept her usual vigilant watch. Berger can be painfully shy. Now he felt possessed by an unusual authority, exercised remotely through the digitally transmitted written word. He took another sip of his wine and returned to his keyboard. Certainly the Corpus Christi area and points immediately north and west of there will get too much rain, he wrote. Flooding will spread to other parts of Texas too, quite possibly Houston. But right now we can’t say that for certain. As I’ve said, it’s either going to be pretty bad, or really really bad here. He posted his piece. His site normally averaged somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 views a day. That particular entry received 207,334 over the next 24 hours. A shocked Berger surmised that his core readers were recommending him to their suddenly weather-concerned friends. He had become the center of a kind of storm within the storm. In the comments, one reader asked what Berger thought the rainfall totals might be in San Antonio, 200 miles to the west. Someone else asked about Colorado County, and another about the neighborhoods near Ellington Field. Another reader wondered whether her husband’s flight out of Hobby Airport on Saturday morning might be delayed. A man named Petey James pointed out that Saturday night was the night of the big fight between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor, and he wanted to know whether he should risk going to the local bar or pay to watch it at home. A woman named Deb Walters asked whether she should still have the party she had planned to host near Dacus on Saturday afternoon. I’d press ahead at this point, Berger wrote to her. Obviously if things turn ugly Saturday morning, you’ll have to cancel. The following morning, Friday, August 25, it started to rain, a few drops at first, and then a fairly steady shower. Harvey’s leading edge had come to town, and the models, constantly updated, began to align: Harvey was nearly laser-precise in its construction and massive, and it was also a slow mover. The rain was going to be measured in feet, not inches. Berger sat down at his desk, no wine this time, and wrote another post. “ A very serious flooding situation is coming, ” he wrote. He wrote it two more times for emphasis. “ A very serious flooding situation is coming. A very serious flooding situation is coming. ” It was 3:15 pm. He hoped Deb Walters had canceled her party. Millions turned to Berger’s Space City Weather blog during the storm. Since 1980, there have been more than 200 weather and climate events in the United States that have each caused more than $1 billion in damage. Three principal national bodies are charged with predicting their arrivals and effects. The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, keeps watch for tornadoes. The Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, monitors heavy rains. And the National Hurricane Center in Miami minds hurricanes. They have been busy. In the case of Harvey, all three were involved, funneling their best information to the Houston branch of the National Weather Service, one of its 122 field offices across the country. Each helps turn national forecasts into finely tuned local ones. The Houston office is the only one that shares space with its home county’s Office of Emergency Management—Galveston County in its case—better to coordinate their shared response. It is no accident that their building sits atop a mound and that their offices are on the upper floor. Over the past few decades, greater Houston has grown exponentially from a mosquito-­plagued oil port into the fifth-largest metro area in the United States, home to nearly 7 million people. That population explosion, combined with a certain regional antipathy toward civic oversight, has seen former swamps turned into sprawling, unregulated developments. Houston has been built to flood. Dan Reilly, 52, is the local Warning Coordination Meteorologist, part of the National Weather Service’s round-the-clock professional staff. In a catastrophe-prone city like his, the job is twofold. The first is the forecast. “When something bad is coming, that’s really when we need to be at the top of our game,” he says. Of the three most damaging effects of hurricanes—wind, storm surge, and rain—rain is one of the most difficult to quantify in advance. The heaviest rain typically falls in small pockets, and that level of precision is difficult to attain more than six to 12 hours ahead of its arrival. Houston’s physical size also makes rain forecasts challenging: Each side of the I-10, for instance—one of several highways that serve as boundaries in an otherwise endless city—might receive a substantially different amount. A good meteorologist is almost always, by definition, skilled at pattern recognition. Weather, like the law, is built on a foundation of similar cases. Veteran meteorologists—Reilly has been in the job for 24 years—mine their memories for analogues. In the early hours of Harvey, Reilly’s team began upping the National Weather Service’s rain forecast to amounts that no one had ever seen: 25 inches, 30, and eventually 50, over a widespread swath of Houston. Reilly set aside everything he knew about the weather and decided to obey the combination of awe and dread he felt in his chest: A killing flood was on its way. Somehow the warnings sounded different coming from him. The next part of the job, and perhaps the more important one, is getting the word out. At a time when the weather can be more extreme than ever, and trust in government is low, convincing people to heed your warnings, especially the most severe of them, might now be the weather forecaster’s harder task. The most serious warning when it comes to rain is called a Flash Flood Emergency, and before Harvey, the Houston office had issued that warning on only three occasions. It would soon be used for a fourth. Berger, sitting behind his Spartan desk that afternoon, anxiety beginning to weigh on him like heat, was first among those who might listen—and to whom others might listen about the coming storm. He wasn’t the government; he was a human being, and somehow the warnings sounded different to their ears coming from him, the kind of measured voice that shines through in a crisis. After he had written his ominous flood forecast three times, he looked out his office window at one of the two garages he keeps. One of them was bursting with new things for his new house, and he began ferrying boxes upstairs to his office, filling the space in front of his desk with new light fixtures, a microwave, and a tub. In between trips, he heard Amanda making arrangements to take shelter, with their daughters, at her sister’s house, built on pilings and tucked away from the wind. Berger would stay. He would hunker down behind his wall of boxes with his PC and his readers, now numbering in the hundreds of thousands, for the duration of the storm. He knew that his city was in serious trouble, and he felt an almost spiritual need to convince his neighbors that it was time for them to share his fears. The weather started making an impression on Berger in 2001, when Tropical Storm Allison came to town. Berger is from Michigan but had gone to the University of Texas to earn his astronomy degree. He moved to Houston for a girl, first working weekends at the Houston Chronicle before becoming the paper’s designated “SciGuy,” writing mostly about physics, chemistry, and astronomy. He also wrote a little about the weather. He had just bought his first house near White Oak Bayou. On June 8, a Friday night—what was it about storms and Friday nights?—he went out with some friends to see a Bob Schneider concert. Allison had passed through Houston once already, but now it returned to take a second run at the city. Berger remembers that the sound of the rain on the roof drowned out Schneider, as though there was too much percussion in the mix. After the concert, he and his friends left to wander around midtown, gawking at the water rising on the empty streets. Berger wrote about the storm. One of his stories, about the drowning deaths of tens of thousands of research animals in the basement of the Texas Medical Center, drew massive national readership. He began having visions—he saw a place for thoughtful written analysis of the weather online. His discussions could be more timely and interactive than the forecasts printed in the paper itself. And unlike TV meteorologists, he needn’t worry about ratings or being available to viewers only at certain designated times. In June 2005, he started his own blog on the Chronicle ’s site. He didn’t yet have any meteorological training; he was just someone who liked talking about the weather. (His colleagues called him “Weather Boy.” It was not a compliment.) Three months later came Katrina. Then came Rita. And three years later, Hurricane Ike. Berger’s life could seem governed by storms; even his first meeting with Amanda, whom he married in 2002, came only a few weeks after Allison’s transformative rains. He convinced the newspaper to put him through a distance learning program at Mississippi State to earn his certification as a professional meteorologist. Modern technology and information dissemination have led to a democratization of weather forecasting, and that could mean compounding disaster in the wrong hands. Berger wanted to make sure his hands were the right ones. When he left the Chronicle to join Ars Technica in October of 2015, he started Space City Weather. The day after he opened up shop, the remnants of Hurricane Patricia began clouding the skies of Houston. He was supposed to go out for dinner with Amanda. He worried his readers would feel he’d abandoned them in a time of need, and he couldn’t help writing a post. His first forecast on Space City Weather was for a flood. Now in August 2017, the rains on Harvey’s opening night shocked even him. They were biblical. Rain falling at a rate of 2 inches an hour would force most drivers to pull over. Harvey would sometimes drop 5. It didn’t look like water; it looked like milk. Worse, Berger studied the models and the satellite imagery, and if he knew anything in that moment, listening to the rain against his window, he knew that there was so much more to come. On Saturday, August 26, an hour after sunset, the evening’s first band of precipitation, which on radar resembled the longest tentacles of an angry squid, opened up over Houston, slowly crossing the city from west to east. As predicted by the European model, it stalled. Additional bands trailing behind it intensified and merged with the first. This created what meteorologists properly call a seething nexus of hate, Berger later wrote. The now-combined band extended more than 400 miles over Galveston and deep into the too-warm waters of the Gulf, creating a superhighway for rain to be delivered directly to Houston. By very early Sunday morning, Harvey’s enormous size began to tell, and another band prepared to make its assault on the already flooded southern suburbs. The Houston branch of the NWS had issued its special emergency bulletin, and in the adjacent Office of Emergency Management, the walls were being papered with calls for water rescues. People were drowning in the rain. A sleepless Berger sat down at his desk and began writing a new post. Amanda and their daughters had been at her sister’s house for several hours, and she texted him to ask if he thought the latest band would be the end of it. He inserted the scene into his piece, which went up at 2:10 am on Sunday morning. I wanted nothing more than to fall in her arms and tell her yes, this was it. By God, yes. Let’s go to bed and forget this ever happened. It had to be it, surely. It would not be it. Harvey would make true Berger’s most pessimistic projections and refuse to leave. He would tell his readers that the rain would continue, especially at night. He would later hear that administrators at the Houston Methodist Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine were among those looking to him for guidance. He would harbor a guilt for delivering bad news for so many. At 12:03 pm on Sunday, Berger finished writing a post that he titled: “Houston, We Will Get Through This.” With the prospect of more rain, you may feel hopeless or helpless, or both. From a mental health standpoint, the uncertainty this brings adds a considerable amount of stress to an already stressful situation. I wish we could tell you when the rains will end, but we can’t. Here’s one thing we are sure of, however. The rains will end. After that the sun will come out. More than a million people would visit Space City Weather on Sunday alone. Hurricane Harvey already had a name. Now it had its face. Harvey’s unrelenting rain left so much underwater—like these orchards in Pecan Grove. On Tuesday evening, more than four days after the rain first started to fall, Berger would finally write: It’s over. He had been nearly perfect in his forecast. It hadn’t been all that windy, so there weren’t many roofs blown off or trees toppled, except in those few cursed places that were also visited by tornadoes. And there wasn’t much local storm surge. The water didn’t come rushing through Houston. It didn’t arrive in walls the way it did in New Orleans with Katrina, one of the reasons Harvey directly killed 68 people, many in their cars, instead of an estimated 1,833 people, many in their beds. Harvey was a cataclysmic rain event, just as Berger had feared. He could have been wrong and his readers would have moved their furniture back downstairs and grumbled about the wasted effort. But he had been right, and thousands of his readers didn’t have a downstairs anymore. A month after the storm, Berger dropped into his Hyundai hybrid and went for a drive. He wanted to see the terrible reality that had accompanied his forecasts, as though he could use the reminder that Harvey really did do what it did, to Houston and to him. By then the last part of weather analysis, the accounting of the aftermath, was nearly complete. It had rained so hard for so long that Houston’s swamps and reservoirs and drainage canals filled up, which meant that the city’s kitchens and living rooms and dens filled up next. Then the water drained away. In the time in between it made an estimated $75 billion in property irreparably wet. He headed south toward Dickinson, one of the worst-hit areas. On some streets, every house had an enormous pile of debris out front—everything that had been inside the house was now outside of it, rotting in the sun. Other streets had been picked clean, and they looked almost normal, except that through their windows, Berger could see that the otherwise pristine-­seeming houses had been stripped down to the studs. There was a photograph that had made the rounds during the storm. It was of the flood-soaked residents of a nursing home, sitting on their loungers and walkers, water up to their chests. It seemed like a macabre piece of surrealist art. On his tour, Berger decided to visit that nursing home, La Vita Bella. Nearly everything that wasn’t human in that photograph was now sitting out in the yard. The lamps, the chairs, and the popcorn machine from that haunting image melted in the piles of sodden sheetrock and carpet, relics of a viral infamy. They were joined by smaller but perhaps more significant losses: a stuffed animal, a deck of playing cards, a broken mirror, a lipstick and a rouge, a large-print copy of Marley &amp; Me. At 12:03 pm on Sunday, Berger finished writing a post titled: ""Houston, We Will Get Through This."" Berger had also lost a book in the flood. Before dawn on Sunday, lightning had lit up the sky, and he could see that water had reached his garages. He had mostly emptied one but not the other—not the one that contained his old things, his diplomas and his Appetite for Destruction poster and his boxes of books. He raced down and lifted up a box from the floor and its bottom fell out. A book titled From Dawn to Decadence by Jacques Barzun dropped into the water and disappeared. Berger had treasured that book, a massive 500-year history of Western civilization. Its French-born author had died in Texas in 2012. Barzun was 104 years old, and the book had been his life’s work. Something about losing that particular book hit Berger harder than it might have. It was a metaphor for how easily even our monuments can be erased. He had written about the loss of that book and other things in a post that went up on Ars Technica early in the morning on August 30, the Wednesday after the storm. The post was titled “This Is Probably the Worst US Flood Storm Ever, and I’ll Never Be the Same.” The cardboard box had failed, he wrote, and the book had dropped into the murk. Almost immediately, a current from the rushing water beyond the garage door pulled the tome away, forever. Damn, I loved that book. An indescribably bad night had just gotten that little bit worse. Berger started receiving emails and notes from his grateful readers. They had saved some of their own treasures because of his warnings, and they felt they had a debt to settle. A copy of From Dawn to Decadence was eventually put into his hands by a stranger, a woman who had attended a talk he had overcome his nerves to give after the storm. That book now sits high and dry on a shelf in his office, a tiny reminder of the things that Harvey had taken, but also a reminder of the things it had delivered. The National Weather Service is part of a necessary and effective meteorological bureaucracy. It is staffed by thousands of people—by good and competent forecasters who care deeply about the weather and its effects on their communities. The NWS can offer its best daily guess, informed by their forecasters’ computer models and professional experiences. It can give warnings and sound alarms. But the NWS can’t talk about the weather the way human beings talk about the weather. It can’t explore each of its uncertainties, almost reveling in the sweeping possibilities of hurricanes and their animal behaviors. It can’t riff. More important, when the weather is at its worst: The National Weather Service can’t comfort. Even though Dan Reilly and his colleagues live and work in greater Houston, even though they were plenty concerned during Harvey for their own families and homes, they can’t issue a bulletin that says, We’re sick and tired of the rain, just like everyone else. They can’t write: The rains will end. After that the sun will come out. Only someone like Eric Berger can do that, providing a weather forecast that includes words like hope or sorry or maybe. Only someone like Eric Berger can employ our best technology in a way that still feels intimate and human-scale, applying the wisdom of satellites to Deb Walters and her doomed party. Only someone like Eric Berger, looking out his window at the rain and willing for it to stop even though he knows that it won’t be stopping anytime soon, can speak to a family watching the water on its torturous rise to their door, the winds threatening the entirety of their lives, and make them feel a little less alone in the storm. Update: After this article went to press, we heard from Deb Walters, one of the many people who sought Berger’s advice just before Hurricane Harvey. Thanks to Berger’s forecasts, Walters decided to cancel a house party she hosts every year for some members of Alcoholics Anonymous and ex-cons. It turned out to be a good call. Although Walters’ house was spared, the surrounding streets flooded, which would have stranded the guests there for three days. “These folks are hysterical,” she said (as in funny and lovable), “but the type of people you invite to a party aren’t necessarily the type of people you want to spend three days with.” She finally hosted the shindig three weeks later, for a smaller crowd. —The Editors Chris Jones is a longtime magazine writer.

MAYA SALAM,"The statement requests that Mr. Weinstein and his legal team submit a “full mea culpa and admission of the wrongs perpetrated by both him and his enablers.” The plaintiffs were identified as Louisette Geiss, Katherine Kendall, Zoe Brock, Sarah Ann Masse, Melissa Sagemiller and Nannette Klatt. [Read their statement and the court filing here.] Two of the defendants named in the suit are James Dolan, owner of the New York Knicks, and Marc Lasry, a co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks. Both men are former members of the Weinstein Company’s board of directors — Mr. Dolan from mid-2015 to June 2016, and Mr. Lasry from mid-2016 to October 2017, according to the suit. A spokeswoman for Harvey Weinstein did not immediately respond to a request for comment in Wednesday. His company fired him in October. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by Hagens Berman and The Armenta Law Firm. It states that actresses and other women in the film industry were lured to industry events, hotel rooms, Mr. Weinstein’s home, office meetings or auditions to discuss projects, only to be victimized by Mr. Weinstein. “The Weinstein Sexual Enterprise had many participants, grew over time as the obfuscation of Weinstein’s conduct became more difficult to conceal,” the suit says. “The producer Harvey Weinstein relied on powerful relationships across industries to provide him with cover as accusations of sexual misconduct piled up for decades,” the law firm said in a statement.

MICHAEL TACKETT,"Mr. Long said Peter Gaynor, the deputy administrator, would serve as acting administrator.
Mr. Long earned plaudits for FEMAs response to Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas and Louisiana in 2017. Assessing the damage in Texas, President Trump praised Mr. Long as a man who really has become very famous on television in the last couple of days.
But he came under withering criticism for FEMAs handling of relief efforts after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico later that year, including a call last month from Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts and a candidate for president, for Mr. Long to resign.
Hurricane Maria eventually caused almost 3,000 deaths and left thousands without electricity for months, and Hurricane Harvey killed nearly 70 people. Those storms combined with others in 2017 caused an estimated $300 billion in damage.
Mr. Long came to Washington with a strong reputation for skilled handling of disaster management, and White House officials often praised his professionalism. But that standing was undercut by the inspector generals report, which noted that Mr. Long had also used a government vehicle for personal purposes while on a family vacation in Hawaii.
The FEMA administrator is supposed to be focused on preparing for disasters like the devastating hurricanes that killed thousands of Americans in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands not using government vehicles to shuttle his family around Hawaii at taxpayer expense, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who was the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee and is now its chairman, said when the report was released.","Brock Long, right, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, in South Carolina after Hurricane Florence last year with President Trump and Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary.",2019-02-14T00:02:29Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Brock Long, FEMA Administrator, Resigns After Two Turbulent Years",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/us/politics/brock-long-fema.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/arts/14DC-FEMA/14DC-FEMA-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Harvey,0
Rayne Ellis,"Disaster relief is most commonly thought of as providing food, water, and shelter to those affected by calamitous events beyond their control. But as communities in places like Texas and Puerto Rico are learning, disaster relief that only alleviates physical wants is not enough to put their communities back on their feet. After first responders have done their jobs to secure personal safety, an emotional recovery has to begin as well. Organizations like UNICEF are acknowledging that the damage to communities can last long after the repairs to homes are completed. Canned goods and other basic need items are given out in a disaster relief station in southeast Texas. Image: Getty Images “When the reality of the disaster sets in, the emotional and psychological responses that are seen community-wide are tremendous and overwhelming,” Center for School Behavioral Health director Janet Pozmantier said. “People simply don’t have the wherewithal to cope effectively.” That's where organizations like UNICEF are stepping in. Called psychosocial disaster relief, this kind of help comes in the weeks and months after a disaster in order to help people recover emotionally. If UNICEF can help it, these recovery efforts will be implemented after every storm. Psychosocial relief in the wake of Hurricanes Maria and Harvey are currently ongoing, and UNICEF knows that the aftermath of Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas will also require this kind of help in the near future. Other organizations like the Red Cross have also been championing psychological first aid measures for years, and with good reason. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Maria is the deadliest storm of the 21st century Research suggests that those who have survived catastrophe tend to start showing signs of trauma roughly three months after the event took place. Those signs can look like anything from anxiety and depression to constant irritability and anger or even complete dissociation and inattention in both children and adults. In order to combat these symptoms, Pozmantier and other staff at the center working under Mental Health America in Greater Houston developed free workshops to teach others how to effectively help people struggling in the aftermath of traumatic disaster-related events. Damaged furniture and personal belongings sit on a flooded curb in Southeast Texas. Image: Getty Images The workshop focuses on helping educators identify signs and symptoms of trauma in children while also including other useful tools like mindfulness training and how to self-regulate emotions. After Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas, UNICEF reached out to the center and offered to fund a Harvey-specific trauma training workshop, which the center named Hope for Harvey. In the months after Harvey made landfall in Texas, Pozmantier would drive through neighborhoods and see the entire contents of homes in a pile on the curb — family photos and clothing laying on top of piles of water damaged furniture — all ready to be collected by waste management. She said it was easy to understand why people would be traumatized. So when the center developed Hope for Harvey, aside from training people to deal with trauma in children, they also added some training on how to deal with adults. “Going through something like this, I realized more than ever that if we can take care of the adults, the kids are going to be okay for the most part too,” Pozmantier said. Nine months later, when UNICEF approached the center again to help Puerto Rico recover, the message was the same. The center developed a workshop, completely in Spanish, to help curb the emotional impact Hurricane Maria had on the people of Puerto Rico, focusing again on children — but also providing help to adults. First, UNICEF sent hygiene kits, water, and helped with shelter. But what UNICEF President Caryl Stern said she’s most proud of is the collaborative work that UNICEF and the Center for School Behavioral Health were able to put into action. A man and a child stand in front of a destoryed house in Puerto Rico a few days after Hurricane Maria hit the island. Image: unicef usa “Now classrooms are catastrophe stations the every time it rains in Puerto Rico. The children are worried that their home is destroyed. Or they’re wondering 'Is my mother okay?'” Stern said. Even seeing adults in distress can trigger the children, Stern said. Once Stern experienced this, she said she know that the training workshops would be incredibly important. In addition to the workshops, UNICEF sent a few hundred college students from State University of New York and City University of New York to pair up with member of various Puerto Rican communities to help rebuild the Boys and Girls Clubs of Puerto Rico. Through this, people were able to come together and repair their communities themselves — something that can have a strong positive effect on the psyche. Stern says everyone who has ever dealt with disaster relief knows that the psychosocial recovery is the most import aspect of relief that is widely ignored by the public. Pozmantier agreed, adding that if she could, she would mandate that all educators go through training in mental health, trauma, mindfulness, and self-help strategies. “They are the first line of defense. It’s like any other kind of illness. You wouldn’t wait until you’re on your deathbed to try and strengthen your immune system,” Pozmantier said.","Disaster relief is most commonly thought of as providing food, water, and shelter to those affected by calamitous events beyond their control.

Evan Real,"Early Friday morning, Asia Argento — the Italian actress who accused Harvey Weinstein of rape and spoke out against him in a searing speech at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival — took to Twitter to comment on the fallen mogul surrendering to police in New York. ""Today Harvey Weinstein will take his first step on his inevitable descent to hell,"" she wrote. ""We, the women, finally have real hope for justice."" Thursday evening, Rose McGowan, who has also accused Weinstein of rape, posted about his arrest on Instagram. ""I, and so many of Harvey Weinstein’s survivors, had given up hope that our rapist would be held accountable by law. Twenty years ago, I swore that I would right this wrong. Today we are one step closer to justice. We were young women who were assaulted by Weinstein and later terrorized by his vast network of complicity,"" she wrote. ""I stand with my fellow survivors. May his arrest give hope to all victims and survivors everywhere that are telling their truths."" In a video interview with the Associated Press posted on Friday morning, McGowan revealed that she is looking forward to attending any of Weinstein's upcoming trials. ""If I'm allowed to, I will attend,"" she said. ""And hopefully that will actually heal a lot of the kind of trauma I get whenever I see his face or whenever I hear his name or whenever I have to read or hear that he says it was consensual."" McGowan continued: ""And I'll get to sit there and I'll get to look at him. And I'll get to be an eye and so many other victims will get to look him square in the eye and just by being there, represent the fact that we did not want this. We did not ask for this. We were just people."" LOOK HIM SQUARELY IN THE EYE: #RoseMcGowan says she hopes to attend any upcoming trial for #HarveyWeinstein, as he turns himself in to police. pic.twitter.com/wdvtndpVWR — AP Entertainment (@APEntertainment) May 25, 2018 McGowan also made a Friday morning appearance on Good Morning America, where she spoke about her ""visceral need"" to see Weinstein in handcuffs. ""I feel shocked. I would say it's just so big,"" she said. ""I have to admit I didn't think I would see the day that he would have handcuffs on him. I have a visceral need for him to have handcuffs on."" Later in the morning, McGowan tweeted, ""We got you, Harvey Weinstein, we got you."" Argento and McGowan are two of the more than 80 women who came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Weinstein. Ashley Judd, Mira Sorvino, Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow are also among the high-profile actresses who have come forward with stories about Weinstein's pattern of alleged abuse. At around 7:30 a.m. ET on Friday, Weinstein turned himself into the New York Police Department at the first precinct in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood, just blocks away from the office of his longtime Weinstein Co. offices. Weinstein was arrested shortly thereafter, the NYPD confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter and is expected to be charged and arraigned later today. He is expected to be charged with the rape of an unidentified woman and a criminal sex act, an official told the Associated Press. The latter involves Lucia Evans, who previously told investigators that Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him in 2004. The alleged incident took place at the former Miramax offices in Tribeca. In a New Yorker report with Ronan Farrow on Friday, Evans confirmed she was pressing charges against the disgraced mogul. Not long after his surrender, Argento tweeted a video of Weinstein's perp walk and asked, ""What took you so long Harvey?"" Hours later, TV chef Anthony Bourdain tweeted his support for Argento, writing, ""When you went on record, @AsiaArgento you were sure this day would never come, that you would be crushed, that you were alone. And yet you did it anyway. #perpwalk"" Kathy Griffin, a vocal supporter of the #MeToo and Time's Up movements — both inspired by the myriad allegations made against Weinstein, which first made headlines last October in twin exposés published by The New York Times and The New Yorker — tweeted her support for several Weinstein victims and applauded them for their bravery. ""Tonight, on the eve of the monster turning himself in, I just want to say that I love @RoArquette @AnnabellSciorra @AsiaArgento @rosemcgowan and all of the women who bravely shared their stories,"" she wrote. ""They had no safety net..but they spoke out any way. Heroes and Revolutionaries."" Women's rights attorney Gloria Allred, who has represented a number of Weinstein's accusers, reacted to his arrest in a statement to THR on Friday morning. ""I represent many accusers of Harvey Weinstein, both in lawsuits and in claims in bankruptcy court. It is long overdue for him to be required to face the bar of justice, but that day has finally come,"" said Allred. ""I commend the courage of all those who have come forward and who have had the courage to speak their truth to a rich, powerful famous man. We look forward to a just result."" Weinstein, who has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex, has been facing multiple criminal charges in New York, Los Angeles and London. Earlier this week, federal prosecutors in Manhattan launched a criminal probe into sex-abuse allegations against Weinstein, focusing on whether he lured women to cross state lines under false pretenses for the purpose of committing sex crimes. Weinstein also faces numerous civil suits filed by women claiming abuse and harassment. Weinstein previously evaded arrest in 2015. Last fall, the NYPD faced backlash after it was revealed they failed to prosecute Weinstein after Italian model Ambra Battilana accused him of groping her during a business meeting in 2015. Even though the police worked with Battilana to get Weinstein to acknowledge the incident in a recording, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., declined to press charges.

In a text message, a screenshot of which was provided by her publicist, Ms. McGowan said: “Rain confirms that everything is true.” Gordon K. Sattro, a lawyer for Mr. Bennett, did not immediately respond Monday to an email seeking comment about Ms. McGowan’s remarks and the allegations they contained. Last fall, Ms. Argento was among the first women to publicly accuse the producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault. Around the same time, a New York Times article detailing Mr. Weinstein’s behavior reported the existence of a previously undisclosed settlement between Mr. Weinstein and Ms. McGowan related to an episode in a hotel room. Soon after the publication of the Times article, Ms. McGowan became one of Mr. Weinstein’s most vocal accusers. On Monday, Ms. McGowan acknowledged that over the course of the last year, she had “bonded” with Ms. Argento over their shared trauma, and said the two had even gotten matching tattoos. But she added that while she appreciates Ms. Argento’s bravery in coming forward with her allegations against Mr. Weinstein, she implored Ms. Argento to “be the person you wish Harvey could have been.” “I’ve frankly been extremely humbled by this event,” Ms. McGowan said. “There absolutely should be no leeway or tolerance for sexual assault. Hard stop. NONE. Victims also shouldn’t be told how they should react or what they should say about their abusers. However as allies to the victim and voyeurs of an event we should find a better way to balance support of the victim with due process for the accused.” “We cannot let this moment break the momentum of a movement that has freed so many people,” she wrote. “We must use it to allow us to become stronger.

MATT STEVENS,"Ms. Contreras-Sweet’s group had pulled ahead of other bidders like Lions Gate Entertainment by promising to keep the studio intact and retaining its employees, including senior managers like Mr. Glasser. Under the deal, Mr. Weinstein’s younger brother, Bob Weinstein, would leave the studio, two people said. Mr. Schneiderman’s lawsuit does not name Mr. Glasser, but it refers to him by his title and says that the sale of the company could result in employees reporting to some of the same managers “who failed to investigate” Mr. Weinstein’s conduct or protect female employees from him. Mr. Glasser, 46, was a longtime top lieutenant at the company, and the Weinsteins have called him their “ third brother.” Efforts to contact Mr. Glasser early Saturday morning were unsuccessful. In October, after the public complaints of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein led to his firing, Mr. Glasser tried to rally his shaken staff members at a meeting. “We are going to be O.K.,” two people who attended the meeting recalled Mr. Glasser saying. He said his door was open to anyone who wanted to talk. Mr. Glasser, who had said he would depart as president of the Weinstein Company in August 2015, announced a month later that he would instead remain under a new three-year contract. At the time, Bob Weinstein — who led the effort to retain Mr. Glasser — attributed Mr. Glasser’s change of heart in part to a personal friendship between Mr. Glasser and the brothers. “Harvey and I sometimes don’t even want to be brothers,” Bob Weinstein said at the time. “I don’t know why anyone would want to be another brother.” But Mr. Glasser, ”should he want it,” Bob Weinstein said, “has become the third brother.” Continue reading the main story",The move to get rid of the man the Weinsteins called their “third brother” comes at an urgent moment for the troubled company.,2018-02-17T05:45:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Weinstein Company Fires David Glasser, Its President",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/arts/weinstein-company-fires-david-glasser.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/18/arts/18xp-Glasser/18xp-Glasser-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Harvey,0

We need to reimagine the pro-choice movement and build a stronger, louder movement for women’s freedom and equality than we’ve ever seen. Movement politics is not the politics of accommodation, it is the politics of perseverance.” Health care cuts ‘oppress and disempower women’ Mr. Schneiderman was a vocal supporter of the Affordable Care Act, and he saw his defense of President Obama’s policy to expand health care coverage as a protection of women’s rights. He told GQ magazine last year : “It’s important to keep in mind that in one respect the health care fight is part of a wider effort by radical conservatives to oppress and disempower women. Denying women access to contraception and abortion services is a critical part of the larger machinery of oppression, discrimination, and violence against women and it’s incumbent on all of us to fight.” Pursuit of Harvey Weinstein After the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual misconduct by dozens of women, Mr. Schneiderman f i led a lawsuit against Mr. Weinstein, his brother, Bob, and their studio. “We have never seen anything as despicable as what we’ve seen right here,” Mr. Schneiderman said in announcing the civil rights suit. He said at a news conference : “Our investigation uncovered a pervasive pattern of sexual harassment, intimidation, discrimination and abuse at the Weinstein Company. Women were coerced into facilitating Harvey Weinstein’s misconduct. Sometimes they were targets themselves. If they refused they were threatened with insults. Their careers were threatened. They were threatened with physical intimidation and violence.” He added: “The board and management knew all of this. They knew how pervasive it was, and not only did they fail to stop it, they enabled it and covered it up.” Praise for reporting that inspired #MeToo Last month, after Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey of the The New York Times and Ronan Farrow of The New Yorker were awarded the Pulitzer Prize in public service for their reporting on Harvey Weinstein, Mr. Schneiderman praised their work in a tweet.

The Year in Review also highlights women's issues with both the Women's March on DC and International Women's Day, which was the top moment discussed in 2017. Finally, the social network highlights the Super Bowl and the total solar eclipse (which I maintain is a big deal ) as big events of the year.

Brian Heater,"There are few metrics in the world that offer as much insight into our society as Google’s annual “Year in Search.” More than any of the other year-end download and streaming roundups, Google’s offers a clear snapshot of the things that captured our imaginations and baffled us during what felt like a particularly turbulent year. Here in the U.S., the top overall searches cover a pretty wide range of the human experience, running the gamut from natural phenomenon, to sports, to human tragedy, to the sexual misconduct allegations that have been echoing across a wide range of industries in recent months. Hurricanes Irma and Harvey took the first and eighth spots in the Top 10, and August’s much-hyped solar eclipse came in at No. 7. The October shooting in Las Vegas that ended in 59 deaths was the No. 5 search. Musician Tom Petty was both the top search in celebrity deaths and No. 3 overall, while former Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, who took his own life in a prison cell in April, was No. 9. The Super Bowl and the Mayweather/McGregor fight landed at four and five, respectively, and the fidget spinners that briefly caught our short attention spans this year hit No. 10. Former NBC anchor Matt Lauer hit No. 2 overall and was the top person search in general. A number of other subjects of sexual misconduct allegations also made the Top 10 people list, including Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Bill O’Reilly. Apple had the strongest showing in Consumer Tech, with the iPhone 8, iPhone X, iPhone 8 Plus and Apple Watch 3 scoring spots one, two, six and nine. Nintendo and Samsung also had strong showings with the Nintendo Switch, Samsung Galaxy S8, Super NES Classic and Samsung Galaxy Note 8 making the Top 10 in that category. People were also looking for ways to make their own eclipse glasses, fidget spinners and slime. More people wanted to know what DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) was than anything else. Bitcoin also had a strong showing at No. 2.","There are few metrics in the world that offer as much insight into our society as Google’s annual “Year in Search.” More than any of the other year-end download and streaming roundups, Google’s offers a clear snapshot of the things that captured our imaginati…",2017-12-13T08:01:59Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Here’s what people were Googling in 2017,https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/13/heres-what-people-were-googling-in-2017/,https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/google-search-app-ios.jpg,techcrunch,TechCrunch,Harvey,0
David Sewell,"September 21, 2018 4 min read Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. As the Carolinas evaluate the damage caused by Hurricane Florence and begin the recovery process, I can't help but think back to where I was a year ago. Last August, Hurricane Harvey roared into my hometown Houston community. The wall of rain blanketing our city eliminated visibility, and triple-digit winds ripped off rooftops and snapped trees like they were twigs. Related: How Our Growing Tech Company Stayed Open During Hurricane María Even in the midst of a natural disaster, entrepreneurs need to find ways to keep their businesses running and their customers well served. As devastating as the storm was, I knew, as a Farmers Insurance agent and owner of a small business, that I had a responsibility to my customers. I knew this historic storm would usher in some of the greatest moments of need in my customers' lives. While my team and I dealt with Harvey's effects, we learned lessons that any entrepreneur could find helpful during any type of natural disaster. The three strategies below helped keep us going, and my team hopes leaders impacted by Florence, or any other catastrophe, can consider them during their time of need and recovery. 1. Schedule daily check-ins. It's critical to plan full-fledged check-ins with your team every day, at least once a day. As we fought through Harvey's challenges, my team connected in the morning, midday and in the late afternoon on calls. We viewed these check-ins as opportunities to help team members get the resources they needed to keep the business running, share news and developments, and listen to our colleagues and customers. Every disaster presents different obstacles, so sharing learnings specific to our team's objectives in real-time helped everyone digest, recover and support our customers more quickly. It's also important for leaders to remember that your team members are dealing with the natural disaster as individuals, not just employees; we knew it was vital to make time to let them be heard. Regular check-in participation helped my team be smarter during Harvey and made us better prepared for the next one, whenever it comes our way. Related: How This Entrepreneur Turned Hurricane Harvey into an Incredible Breakthrough 2. Adopt a micro solutions mantra. When everything is falling apart during and just after a natural disaster, the road to recovery can look like it's running straight up Mount Everest. It can be difficult to know where, how or when to start making things better. Though challenges on the scale of a natural disaster can't be underestimated, teams can avoid feeling overwhelmed by breaking down problems to their smallest steps. In those check-ins I described, taking the time to explicitly discuss all components -- no matter how small -- of a large, pressing project encouraged clarity, accountability and confidence among the team. It minimized the risk of responsibilities getting lost to miscommunications or assumptions. And as team members shared firsthand experiences and customer feedback in relation to our efforts, we even discovered ways to optimize our work in real time. Committing to creating micro solutions instead of mega ones can make it easier to focus on what your team can accomplish now. In turn, that behavior can help teams buy in and believe their goals are achievable -- even when their to-do lists seem never-ending. Related: 3 Steps Effective Leaders Take When Dealing With Crisis 3. Tap technology to its fullest. Technology made a big difference in our response to Hurricane Harvey's destruction. In previous storm response efforts, we weren't as reliant on technology. For instance, when Hurricane Ike hit in 2008, I had to walk or drive (and personally hand-deliver) submitted claims to a mobile operations center. In a time of crisis, plan to communicate with customers and team members through multiple channels, as some of your most reliable communication networks and methods may be temporarily down. After Harvey, my team received customers' claims via every form of technological communication, including phone calls, texts and emails. And my team stayed in constant contact through phone, video conferencing, emails and social media communications. Most entrepreneurs rarely consider natural disasters until they're literally on their doorstep and by then, it's too late to devise contingency plans. But, these three strategies helped enable me and my team to assist our clients during and after Hurricane Harvey. We hope they'll be equally helpful to those affected by Florence -- or any other disaster -- so they can meet their current challenges and find practical solutions that will strengthen them as entrepreneurs.",Here are a few tips from a Houston-based business owner who survived Hurricane Harvey for entrepreneurs impacted by Florence.,2018-09-21T18:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Entrepreneur.com'}","What I Learned From Harvey, Can Help You With Florence",https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/320430,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20180920185856-GettyImages-1034524074.jpeg,,Entrepreneur.com,Harvey,0

Brian Stelter,"An investment group led by Maria Contreras-Sweet, former head of the U.S. Small Business Administration, has moved into exclusive negotiations about a bid for the company's assets, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. A deal could now be days away, the person said. The Weinstein Co. has been seeking a buyer for several months. The movie and TV studio was severely hurt by the sexual harassment and assault scandal surrounding Harvey Weinstein. In fact, the stain was so damaging that the company likely won't carry the name Weinstein at all in the future. Representatives for Contreras-Sweet and The Weinstein Co. declined to comment on Tuesday. Deadline, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported that exclusive negotiations are underway. The person with knowledge of the talks said the plan calls for Contreras-Sweet's group to acquire the studio's employees, projects and assets. The plan will avert a bankruptcy auction, which was thought to be a likely outcome. Related: Six women sue Harvey Weinstein and his company in class action lawsuit But the investor group will not be buying The Weinstein Co. per se -- because they'll be forming a new company with a new name. Erasing the stain, so to speak. Last fall Contreras-Sweet was reportedly interested in having a ""women-led board"" take control of The Weinstein Co. Her proposal letter to the company sparked both internal and external interest. Before running the SBA during the Obama administration, Contreras-Sweet was the founder of ProAmerica Bank. The Weinstein Co. has operated in a state of limbo ever since the scandal involving Harvey Weinstein erupted last October. Projects have been frozen and partners have backed away from the studio.

JON ROBIN BAITZ,"There is a thesis to be written about New York theater of that moment in that dyad of shows, linked by a single actor: Nixon, unwilling to hide the gears turning in her brain with the limbs of her body. By the 1980s, the conventional acting ideology had been absorbed, filed away, and all that mattered was being smart. These actors knew the Meisner-influenced naturalism of New York’s Neighborhood Playhouse and the elegant crispness of the British school, but they grew up in the 1970s when — after President Nixon and Vietnam — nobody believed in any kind of hegemony: American, theatrical or otherwise. So acting transformed in the 1980s into something post-Freudian and hypnotic, like Eric Fischl’s paintings of that moment. Because in that era, being any kind of artist in New York meant you were living through the plague and you were one of its diarists. All shows, from the furthest reaches of the East Village (John Kelly at the Pyramid Club, playing a ravaged Mona Lisa) to the glitzy musicals (“ La Cage aux Folles,” starring Gene Barry) had the slight whiff of death. Death was this generation’s teacher. Disco was dead, Studio 54 had gone cold and Paul Schrader’s “American Gigolo” was the first great film of the decade, starring a young actor, Richard Gere, who had come of age doing Martin Sherman’s “ Bent,” a 1979 play about gays killed by Nazis. After “American Gigolo,” the New York theater continued to lend-lease its loosely organized repertory company to the movies: Kathy Bates, LaTanya Richardson Jackson and her husband Samuel L. Jackson, Amanda Plummer, Sarah Jessica Parker and the rest knew how not to be mere tools of the technology — they made the camera adjust to them, to their temperatures, their pickpocket eyes. Nobody more so than Willem Dafoe, who labored quietly and deliberately downtown at the Wooster Group, like Houdini practicing escape acts over and over. Perhaps that’s why, in a 2012 interview, he said, “you do your best things when... you’re a little scared.” In these years, there was a lot to be scared about. Cut to 2014, and I am sitting in a restaurant having lunch with an emaciated Nichols, now close to his own end. It was a melancholy meal, and we cheered ourselves up by talking about actors and their tricks. We landed on Nathan Lane, whom we had both worked with often and worshiped unconditionally. I sighed, then asked, “Don’t you love them all, more than anything?” He looked at me, his limpid, quicksilver eyes pooling, and said, “You don’t understand. It’s almost all I have left.”","Standing, from left: Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Stephen Bogardus, Michael Cerveris, Harvey Fierstein, Matthew Broderick, Elizabeth McGovern, Mia Katigba, Kathy Bates, Mercedes Ruehl, Nathan Lane, John Kelly, Victor Garber, Ed Harris, Amanda Plummer and Cynt…",2018-04-16T09:50:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Stars Who Got Their Start on the ’80s New York Stage,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/t-magazine/broadway-1980s-actors-sarah-jessica-parker-willem-dafoe.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/05/t-magazine/05tmag-group-slide-QT9P/05tmag-group-slide-QT9P-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Harvey,0
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Researchers in Australia say they have traced the country's indigenous languages back to a single, common tongue. The languages are all derived from a mother tongue, known as Proto-Australian, that was spoken about 10,000 years ago, according to a new study. Linguists have long debated the subject in Australia. More than 200 languages were spoken at the time of British settlement in 1788. The research, published in the Diachronica linguistics journal, is the first to prove that all of those languages came from the same family, said linguists at the University of Newcastle, Australia and Western Sydney University. ""Until now, it was speculated that Australia was significantly more linguistically diverse than somewhere like Europe, because it had not been proven that all Australian languages actually stemmed from the same lineage,"" said Associate Prof Mark Harvey from the University of Newcastle, Australia. Although an estimated 120 indigenous languages still exist, only about 20 are actively spoken today, he said. Geographical distance Researchers said they found ""recurrent"" and ""systematic"" traits in the sounds of words among the languages. ""[We were] essentially looking for consistent similarities, like how there's a link between 'good' and 'gut' in English and German,"" Associate Prof Harvey told the BBC. He said such similarities were found in the basic vocabulary of languages ""that might be 100km (60 miles) apart"" in terms of where they were being spoken. ""[It] makes it very unlikely that they are the result of chance or [subsequent] language contact,"" said Associate Prof Robert Mailhammer from Western Sydney University. Diversity in the north Researchers said the language family had spread and diversified from a small area in northern Australia. ""Where you have the greatest diversity is where the original forms [of language] were, so your standard starting point would be the Kimberleys [in Western Australia] and the Top End [upper Northern Territory],"" he said. However, he said the findings did not fit well with existing understandings of how populations had moved across the continent. People movements are usually regarded as key factors in spreading languages, Associate Prof Harvey said. ""So there are still lots of questions about how we understand the pre-history of Australia,"" he said. Last year, scientists found evidence to suggest that indigenous Australians have lived on the continent for at least 65,000 years. Aboriginal Australians are believed to be the world's oldest continuous civilisation.","All indigenous languages can be traced to a mother tongue dubbed Proto-Australian, researchers say.",2018-03-28T02:01:54Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}","Australia's indigenous languages have one source, study says",http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-43564134,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6FDF/production/_100593682_gettyimages-183298080.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Harvey,0

Reuters Editorial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is expected in a Manhattan courtroom on Monday to face charges of sexually assaulting a woman in 2006, the third criminal sex assault case brought against him. More than 70 women, mostly young actresses and women employed in other areas of the movie business, have accused the 66-year-old cofounder of the Miramax film studio of sexual misconduct, including rape, in a series of incidents dating back decades. The accusations gave rise to the #MeToo movement in which hundreds of women publicly accused powerful men in business, government and entertainment of sexual harassment and abuse, lifting a shroud that had long shielded such behavior. Weinstein has been free on $1 million bail following his May arrest and not guilty plea on charges he sexually assaulted two other women, one in 2004 and one in 2013. He has repeatedly denied having any non-consensual sexual encounters. Prosecutors contend that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on the woman who was his 2006 victim. The latest charges include two counts of predatory sexual assault, which carry a maximum life sentence, and one count criminal sexual act, also a felony. He is expected to be arraigned on the latest charges in New York state Supreme Court. Earlier charges included two counts of rape and one count of criminal sexual act. Weinstein was charged after a months-long investigation by the New York Police Department. Prosecutors have not named the women accusing Weinstein of sexual assault. Details from the 2004 case align with an account by Lucia Evans, a former aspiring actress who told the New Yorker magazine in October 2017 that Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex. After Weinstein was publicly implicated in sexual misconduct, his eponymous company Weinstein Co fired him and filed for bankruptcy, and he was expelled by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Through his company and Miramax, Weinstein won plaudits and many awards for movies such as “Shakespeare in Love,” “Pulp Fiction,” “Sex, Lies and Videotape,” “The Crying Game” and “The King’s Speech.” London police and Los Angeles prosecutors have also been reviewing sexual assault accusations against Weinstein.

Andrew Freedman,"The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, which officially ends on Thursday, will go down as one of the most expensive in American history. The notorious storms of 2017 — hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria — may have had innocuous names. However, they flooded America's fourth-largest metropolis, cut a swath of destruction across the Caribbean before hitting Florida, and cut off power to the entire island of Puerto Rico, respectively. The costs of the storms that hit the U.S. are still being tallied, with some analysts claiming that it was the most expensive hurricane season on record. Steve Bowen, a meteorologist with the insurance company AonBenfield, said that his company's calculations show that direct damage and business interruption losses from 2017's many storms will put 2017 in second place, behind 2005, once adjusted for inflation. SEE ALSO: San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz talks Puerto Rico's recovery with Stephen Colbert It's possible that ranking will change, however. ""There remains so much uncertainty with the three big storms (Harvey, Irma, Maria), and insurance claims continue to be filed and processed,"" Bowen said via Twitter message. ""A big component to the direct damage losses remains business interruption, and especially in the case of Maria in Puerto Rico, those direct impacts remain ongoing,"" Bowen said. ""The 2017 season is going to end near the top on an economic and insured loss basis once all is said and done. Regardless of what metric is used to determine 2017's ranking... the season was extraordinarily costly and will be used as one of the benchmark years against which future seasons are compared,"" Bowen said. Puerto Rico still has not woken up from the nightmare caused by Hurricane Maria. It's been 71 days since Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm, but residents there are still struggling without access to electricity, as well as other basic services. As of Thursday afternoon, electricity generation on Puerto Rico — which is not the same as the percentage of people who are receiving power — stood at 65 percent. About 7 percent of Puerto Rican residents are without access to safe drinking water, according to the territory's website. Repairs are still being made to electricity and transportation infrastructure in the U.S. Virgin Islands and other areas that in many cases were hit with two major hurricanes in a row. The Trump administration's response to Hurricane Maria, especially when compared to the mobilization mounted in the wake of other storms that struck the U.S. mainland, is widely viewed to be abysmal. A season of destructive hurricanes Even veteran hurricane forecasters were stunned by the beastly storms that prowled the Atlantic Ocean this season. Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in southeast Texas on Aug. 25 as a Category 4 storm, resulted in the heaviest rainstorm ever recorded in the country. The storm inundated large swaths of the Houston metro area, dumping as much as 5 feet of rain over the course of a few days. Such unprecedented rainfall turned highways into raging rivers, flooded petrochemical plants, and destroyed tens of thousands of cars, homes, and businesses. Harvey was followed by another Category 4 storm, Hurricane Irma, marking the first time the U.S. has been hit by two Category 4 storms in the same season. Irma reserved it greatest ferocity for islands in the Caribbean, practically wiping out the island of Barbuda, and stripping the lush vegetation of the Virgin Islands bare. Hurricane Irma remained a Category 5 storm with maximum sustained winds of 185 miles per hour for a consecutive 37 hours, a new world record, and also broke the record for the strongest hurricane observed in the Atlantic outside the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Based on its windspeed, it also tied for second on the list of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes of all-time, behind Hurricane Allen in 1980. Then came Hurricane Maria, which rapidly intensified on September 18, and also raked parts of the Leeward Islands and Caribbean. Maria caused widespread damage when it hit the tiny island of Dominica as a Category 5 storm, and became the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico since 1928. The Atlantic season kept setting records into October, when Hurricane Ophelia became the strongest storm to form so far east in the North Atlantic. By reaching Category 3 intensity, Ophelia also became the sixth major hurricane of Category 3 or greater to form during the 2017 season. Hurricane Ophelia underwent a transition into a powerful hybrid, and then a non-tropical storm, that struck Ireland with winds as strong as 119 miles per hour. While the hurricanes of 2017 were fierce, none of the Category 4 or 5 storms hit without extremely accurate warnings. In fact, preliminary data from the National Hurricane Center show that storm track forecasts for hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria were about 25 percent more accurate than average. Storm intensity forecasts, however, remained a bigger challenge, as some of these storms underwent periods of astonishingly rapid intensification that defied expectations. For millions from Houston to St. Johns, the off season will be spent rebuilding and attempting to get their lives back to normalcy.

Reuters,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of sexually assaulting a woman in 2006, the third criminal sex assault case brought against him. More than 70 women, mostly young actresses and women employed in other areas of the movie business, have accused the 66-year-old cofounder of the Miramax film studio of sexual misconduct, including rape, in a series of incidents dating back decades. The accusations gave rise to the #MeToo movement in which hundreds of women publicly accused powerful men in business, government and entertainment of sexual harassment and abuse, lifting a shroud that had long shielded such behavior. Weinstein has been free on $1 million bail following his May arrest and not guilty plea on charges he sexually assaulted two other women, one in 2004 and one in 2013. He has repeatedly denied having any non-consensual sexual encounters. Prosecutors contend that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on the woman who was his 2006 victim. The latest charges include two counts of predatory sexual assault, which carry a maximum life sentence, and one count criminal sexual act, also a felony. He entered his plea during a hearing in New York state Supreme Court.

Scott K. Johnson,"reader comments 0 The story explaining the incredible flooding in Houston during Hurricane Harvey has many chapters, ranging from meteorology to the history of groundwater use and development zoning. The chapter on climate change has already had a few pages filled in, thanks to a study quickly published by MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel. This week, two complementary studies flesh the chapter out a little more. The first paper comes from a group of scientists who have worked to rapidly analyze a number of extreme weather events over the past few years, including flooding in Europe and Louisiana last year. The general strategy for this type of undertaking is not entirely dissimilar from tracking the home run hitting of steroid-using baseball players. You can’t really know if an individual home run would have occurred sans steroids, but that’s not the point. Instead, you work out whether home runs like the one you just witnessed are generally being juiced. In this case, the researchers were able to build on their analysis of the nearby Louisiana deluge from 2016. As in that study, they analyzed the history of rainfall measurements in the region to work out just how unusual the incredible rainfall totals from Harvey were—and whether the chances of an event like that have changed over time. Even in today’s climate, Harvey’s rainfall was at least a 1,000-year event, meaning there’s just a one-in-a-thousand chance it happens in any given year. But the researchers see evidence that the odds would have been even smaller a century ago. They estimate that there has been a (roughly) 18-percent increase in the intensity of extreme rain events along this stretch of the Gulf Coast since the late 1800s. One of the simplest relationships in climate change is how the water-vapor capacity of air increases about 6-8 percent for every degree Celsius of warming. The Houston area has warmed just about 1°C, so that’s how much you might expect rainfall extremes to change if nothing else was going on. One thing that can amplify that simple relationship, though, is the fact that water vapor added to the atmosphere also releases heat when it condenses into droplets. This causes the air to keep rising until even more water is wrung out, which can mean stronger storm events. The rainfall records seem to support something like that scenario. Storms around Houston are producing more rain than they used to. To test the cause of this change in rainfall intensity, the researchers also simulated the region with several climate models. Model simulations like these would include the occurrence of “blocking high” pressure setups like the one that kept Hurricane Harvey pinned over Houston for so long. That is, after all, one way to get high rainfall totals. They threw out one model because it couldn’t do a good-enough job matching past extreme weather patterns in this specific area. Interestingly, the two models that passed that test produced slightly different answers. One model showed a 17-percent increase in extreme rainfall between 1861 and 2017—quite similar to the trend found in the actual rainfall observations. However, the other model simulated a smaller increase of 8 percent, which is close to the unamplified effect of water vapor capacity in warmer air. In the end, the researchers go with an average of the different estimates, concluding that our best understanding is that human-caused climate change has made modern storms—including Harvey—dump about 15 percent more rain. Another way to describe that is to say that a storm of Harvey’s magnitude is about three times more likely now than it was in the late 1800s. A second study, published by Mark Risser and Michael Wehner at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, performed a similar analysis of past weather station records. Their methods were a little different: they focused on 7-day rainfall totals rather than 3-day totals, for example, and checked for the influence of El Niño/La Niña conditions. But their results were basically the same. They estimate that Harvey’s rainfall was probably almost 19 percent higher due to global warming, which also means the probability of a storm of Harvey's size is now 3.5 times more likely. The researchers use the previous record-high 7-day rainfall as an example. In 1950, that would have been about a 200-year storm. But in 2017, it is closer to a 30-year storm. Although a 1,000-year storm is bound to happen somewhere in the world fairly regularly, it’s still ultimately “bad luck” when it happens to you. A number of chance events had to line up to make Hurricane Harvey as extreme as it was. But on the list of things humans did that made Harvey and its effects worse than it otherwise would have been, climate change cannot be ignored. Environmental Research Letters, 2017.

KRISTIN WONG,"Self-publishing means publishing your book on your own, or with the help of a self-publishing platform like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing or CreateSpace, which is also owned by Amazon. Barnes &amp; Noble also has a self-publishing platform. As a self-published author, you have more control of your work because you have more control of your deadlines and budget, said Nailah Harvey, author of Look Better in Writing. Some people do not work well with the pressure of third-party deadlines, so self-publishing may be a better fit for their personality. You also have full creative control over your work, Ms. Harvey said, whereas with a publisher, you may have to bend to their ideas for your book title, cover and content. Mr. Sethi, both a traditionally published and self-published author, said your choice will partly depend on whats more important to you: profit or credibility. Traditional publishing lends you the latter, while self-publishing can be more profitable because you wont have to give a percentage of sales to an agent and publisher. On the other hand, an agent and publisher might be able to help increase your reach to make those sales. Self-publishing also means your book will be available on only the platform you publish with, and it likely will never get on shelves in physical bookstores or libraries. If you opt to self-publish, Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, an online publishing platform for digital books and paperbacks, is an ideal place to start. The site includes manuscript templates you can download and follow. Youll write, edit, proofread and format the book before uploading it for approval. Self-publishing means you have to do all of the work, like designing a cover and proofreading, yourself (or hire people to help). While an agent will likely want to see the completed manuscript of a novel, a nonfiction book typically requires a proposal, which is a detailed outline of what your book is and why it matters. Rather than thinking of your proposal as an introduction to the book, think of it as a business case for why its worth a publishers time and investment.","No, it will not be easy.

GRAY CHAPMAN,"Eleanor Harvey, the manager for today’s show and a curator at the Smithsonian Museum of American Art, has participated in such demonstrations since her childhood. “Some of these kids grow up with real horses, and this is an extension of what they do,” Ms. Harvey said. “Some of us, this is vicariously what we would’ve liked to have done.” A few entries vividly depicted models clearing a fence or maneuvering around a barrel (for “Performance” classes); others were presented sans accessories, judged on their condition and their appropriateness for the class’s designated breed. Nearby, a young girl used a fluffy pink makeup brush to dust off her Saddlebred’s flanks before judges descended. Throughout the space, parents were draped in folding chairs, stranded without Wi-Fi or electrical outlets for up to eight hours. Among them was Brian Martin, 45, of Montclair, N.J., chaperoning his daughter, Ella, 13, and her friend, Cate Bates, 15. Back home, the girls share a leased pony named Leo, but in the world of Breyer they have entire stables of horses to themselves. Ella has around a hundred Breyers; Cate estimated she has about 250. Here in the exhibition hall, their “show strings” were fanned out neatly before them on towels and Bubble Wrap. “This is one of our favorite weekends of the year,” said Mr. Martin, remarkably serene for someone who had been sealed inside a convention center full of young equine enthusiasts since sunrise. He told me that Ella saved her allowance all year for Breyerfest, toting a wad of crumpled $5 and $10 bills in an envelope along for the journey. Cate and Ella are intimately familiar with the horse-obsessed corners of the internet. Cate has her own Breyer-specific Instagram account, and Ella is an avid viewer of model horse YouTube channels. (Facebook, Cate explained, is more for “the older people” — she only joined when she had to create an account for school, after which she made a beeline for the many model horse enthusiast groups scattered throughout the platform.) Both told me that, thanks to social media, they feel as though they’ve found their tribe of people who “get it” — not like in school, where Cate says her classmates sometimes “look at me like I’m strange” when she tries to explain her hobby.",Here comes the bridle: a wedding rehearsal for the model horses Quill and Sangria during Breyerfest at the Kentucky Horse Park.,2018-07-26T16:47:15Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Giddy Up, Girlfriend!",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/style/horse-girls-breyerfest.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/29/style/26BREYERFEST1/26BREYERFEST1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Harvey,0
Mark Kaufman,"Hurricanes and typhoons — the monstrous, destructive storms that bring extreme wind and rain to coasts around the world — are slowing their pace as they traverse the globe. After assessing every tropical cyclone on record between 1949 and 2016, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientist James Kossin found that the storms have slowed down in every ocean, save the Northern Indian. This research, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, concluded these storms are now moving about 10 percent slower on average than they did in the past, though regional speeds in specific oceans vary. SEE ALSO: Hurricane damage could triple in the U.S. if global warming goes unchecked At first blush, 10 percent might sound like a relatively small percentage, but in reality, it's a big deal, said Kossin, in an interview. A storm that sits still over one place for an extended period of time brings that much more wind and rain to that area. ""Nothing good can come of a slower storm,"" said Kossin. Hurricane Harvey on August 25, 2017, when it reached maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. Image: nOaa Hurricanes already bring a number of well-known hazards — flooding, pummeling winds, and surging seas — all which can prove fatal and wreak havoc on infrastructure. In a May 2018 report, NOAA said last year's Hurricane Harvey, which stalled over Houston, was responsible for the direct deaths of at least 68 Americans. ""It's safe to say you want them [hurricanes] to get out of your neighborhood as quickly as possible,"" said Kossin. Hurricane Harvey may have been exceptional — breaking rainfall records while dumping over four feet of rain onto Houston — but any cyclone can wreak havoc if slowed or stalled. ""Sitting still for two days is a big deal,"" Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane researcher at Florida International University who had no role in the study, said in an interview. Willoughby noted that there's another culprit at play here, too. With every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit) rise in global temperature, the atmosphere becomes capable of holding 7 percent more water vapor, which provides fuel for heavier downpours. A Houston resident paddles through his home following Hurricane Harvey. Image: John Glaser/CSM/REX/Shutterstock ""This research gives a pretty good picture of what we should expect in the future,"" said Willoughby. ""The threat to the U.S. is from flooding."" Atmospheric scientists, like Kossin, have a pretty good idea about why these storms are slowing down as well. Warming global temperatures, especially the accelerated heating of the Arctic, are disrupting the way air travels through the atmosphere. One of these changes amount to a weakening circulation of tropical air, particularly during the summer. These winds, and others, are hugely influential as they push major storms around ""a bit like a cork in a stream,"" said Kossin. ""It makes physical sense that they should be slowing down,"" said Willoughby, adding that there's still not quite enough historical storm data to say for certain that the storms have slowed as much as the new study shows. ""Stuff happened out in the ocean before 1950 that we didn’t know about,"" said Willoughby. Today, NOAA has a sophisticated group of weather-tracking satellites, so in the coming years scientists' grasp of storm trends will only improve. But at the same time, global temperatures will almost certainly increase, perhaps by 6 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century if the global community fails to rein in carbon emissions. Image: noaa Damage to U.S. communities and coastlines from future hurricanes are expected to hit the U.S. economy quite hard. Research published in the journal Environmental Research Letters found that future storms — enhanced by rising seas and carrying more water — could bring three times the amount of economic damage than infrastructure-pummeling tempests do today. Over the nearly 70 years of hurricane data Kossin analyzed, the planet warmed by half a degree Celsius (about 1 degree Fahrenheit) on average, but it's unknown what will happen with another degree of warming or more, said Kossin. There could be more than a 10 percent drop in storm speed — or perhaps less. What is known, however, is that while deaths from surging stormwaters on U.S. coastlines have gone down over the decades, inland flooding has become a substantially higher risk for death, said Kossin. People generally don't evacuate from these places during hurricanes, said Kossin. ""That's a scary idea,"" he said.","Hurricanes and typhoons — the monstrous, destructive storms that bring extreme wind and rain to coasts around the world — are slowing their pace as they traverse the globe.

Reuters Editorial,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Actor Uma Thurman has accused movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexually assaulting her at a London hotel after they worked together on the 1994 hit film “Pulp Fiction.” In a New York Times article on Saturday by columnist Maureen Dowd, Thurman broke her silence after saying in October that she would wait to speak out about inappropriate behavior in the workplace because she did not want to say anything in anger. Thurman became the latest of more than 70 women who have accused 65-year-old Weinstein of sexual misconduct, including rape. A spokeswoman for Weinstein said on Saturday that he had apologized to Thurman for making an “awkward pass” at her 25 years ago, but that her claims about being physically assaulted were untrue. In the Times article, Thurman, 47, said Weinstein pushed her down when she met him in his suite at London’s Savoy Hotel. “He tried to shove himself on me. He tried to expose himself. He did all kinds of unpleasant things. But he didn’t actually put his back into it and force me,” she told the newspaper.

LIVIA ALBECK-RIPKA,"Plan a meeting spot for your family. Deanna Frazier, a spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said that forgetting to do so was one of the most common mistakes when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas last year. “Cellphones may not work or you may not have your cellphone with you,” she said. “There were a lot of people who were looking for loved ones and disconnected from them. Those are the kinds of things that you need to think about.” Listen to local news media for the most up-to-date information on how to prepare and when to evacuate the area. “The biggest issue I see people running into is that they just wait too long,” said Alberto Moscoso, communications director for the Florida Division of Emergency Management. “When it comes to hurricane and storm preparation, now is always the right time.” Photograph or scan important documents like driver’s licenses, social security cards, passports, prescriptions, tax statements and other legal papers. Upload the images online for safekeeping. Store documents in a fireproof, watertight container, or take them with you. FEMA’s Emergency Financial First Aid Kit has a checklist of documents you’re likely to need to claim insurance and other benefits. Take irreplaceable keepsakes with you, if possible. Otherwise, move belongings with sentimental or monetary value upstairs or to high shelves to protect them from floodwaters. “We put a lot of stuff on the bed,” said Donald Avery, a Houston resident who was evacuated from his home during Harvey. The floodwaters wouldn’t be that high, he remembers thinking. “Everything we moved to the bed was destroyed.” But his wife’s photograph collection, which they moved upstairs, was undamaged.","Here are some tips for getting ready: Make a plan, bring documents, close lids, clear the yard, blast the freezer.",2018-09-11T16:01:31Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",How You Can Prepare to Evacuate Your Home for Hurricane Florence,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/us/hurricane-preparedness-evacuation.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/06/climate/floodprep-illo/floodprep-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Harvey,1
Gina Martinez,"Hurricanes are slowing down – and leaving behind a lot more damage when they make landfall, according to a new study. The study, published in the journal Nature, found that since 1949, tropical cyclones have decreased their speed by an average of 10% worldwide. The change is even more dramatic in storms that have made landfall from the North Atlantic – they’re moving 20 percent slower. The result is more rainfall and more damage to buildings as hurricanes hover over population centers for longer periods of time. “The unprecedented rainfall totals associated with the ‘stall’ of Hurricane Harvey over Texas in 2017 provide a notable example of the relationship between regional rainfall” and hurricane speed, wrote the study’s author, James P. Kossin of the NOAA’s Center for Weather and Climate in Madison, Wisconsin. Hurricane Harvey lingered over south Texas for more than a week last September, dumping up to 60 inches of rain that left most of Houston underwater and resulted in 93 deaths. Kossin argues that the slow-down is caused by global warming, which is both increasing rainfall and decreasing wind currents. Kossin told Nature that a 10% slow-down in storm speed corresponds to a 10% increase in rainfall when a hurricane makes landfall.",Hurricane Harvey is a devastating example of the trend,2018-06-06T20:11:34Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Hurricanes Are Slowing Down and Leaving More Damage When They Hit Land,http://time.com/5303486/hurricanes-slowing-down-study/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/hurricane-harvey-houston.jpeg?quality=85,time,Time,Harvey,1
Mahita Gajanan,"Celebrity chef and television host Anthony Bourdain, who died in France at the age of 61, is being remembered for his advocacy and allyship in the #MeToo movement. Bourdain openly discussed and criticized harassment and assault issues in the food industry — and Bourdain, as a man, took a hard look at his own past to question why women did not come to him to talk about such things. “I came out of a brutal, oppressive business that was historically unfriendly to women,” he said on The Daily Show in January. “I knew a lot of women, it turned out, who had stories about their experiences — about people I knew — who did not feel I was the sort of person they could confide in.” After celebrity chef John Besh was accused of sexual harassment by 25 women, Bourdain tweeted that it was “the beginning of an end of institutionalized Meathead Culture in the restaurant business.” Bourdain, too, had to reconcile with his own contribution to what he called the meathead culture. In an interview with Slate last October, Bourdain acknowledged how kitchens became a place for harassment, particularly when they are most often run by men who feel empowered to bully those below them. And although Bourdain said he tried to remove himself from a reputation of a “macho” persona, he knew it became a part of him after a certain point. “I am a guy on TV who sexualizes food. Who uses bad language. Who thinks our discomfort, our squeamishness, fear and discomfort around matters sexual is funny. I have done stupid offensive shit,” he told Slate. “And because I was a guy in a guy’s world who had celebrated a system—I was very proud of the fact that I had endured that.” Bourdain began speaking out after his girlfriend, the actor Asia Argento, accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault last October, the chef often spoke out about pervasive harassment and assault and vocally supported Argento. (Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex.) Many women and #MeToo advocates commended Bourdain for his continuous support. The actor Rose McGowan, who has accused Weinstein of rape, posted a video Friday, crying and encouraging people to reach out to suicide hotlines.

Crews came forward with his own story as a survivor of sexual assault in 2017, in the wake of accusations against Harvey Weinstein and the surge of the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse.
""For me to remain silent, I would have felt like a fraud,"" says Crews. ""In the year that's gone by, I've learned that silence is violence. They depend on you being quiet. 
""My advice to any survivor: I will not be shamed. I did nothing wrong.""

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"For Mr. Rosselló, the funding fight is a question of fairness. For every long-term rebuilding project underway in Puerto Rico at this point after Hurricane Maria, there were 28 projects underway in Texas for damage from Hurricane Harvey, and 32 projects in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, the governor said. Puerto Rico is getting much fewer and much lower resources than any comparable jurisdiction in the United States.
A University of Michigan analysis published in the journal BMJ Global Health in January found it took twice as long four months for Hurricane Maria survivors in Puerto Rico to receive a comparable amount of individual aid (about $1 billion) as Hurricane Harvey survivors in Texas and Hurricane Irma survivors in Florida, though Maria was stronger and more devastating. Maria killed an estimated 2,975 people in Puerto Rico.
In addition to the slow disbursement of aid, a report last month from the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Housing and Urban Development lacked a robust plan to monitor disaster relief grants, including $20 billion approved for Puerto Rico.
In Vieques, with the hospital out of commission, dialysis patients had to travel to the big island three times a week to get treatment for more than a year after the storm. Several patients died. Finally, in November, a mobile dialysis unit in a shiny trailer arrived at the temporary clinic, allowing local treatments to resume.
It wasnt easy, said Edwin Alvarado Cordero, a 58-year-old diabetic. Standing across the street from the pharmacy in Isabel Segunda, the bigger of the islands two towns, Mr. Alvarado recounted his thrice-weekly trips from Vieques to Humacao, which began at 4 a.m. and ended at 5:30 p.m.
Last year, on the ferry to the big island, Mr. Alvarado suffered a heart attack. He had open-heart surgery and survived. Though he can now receive dialysis in Vieques, he still travels to San Juan periodically to see his cardiologist. Specialists visit Vieques infrequently.
Its far, but its better there, Mr. Alvarado said. Whats left of the hospital here is grass and horses.

KATHRYN SHATTUCK,"Seven decades into her illustrious career, with 25 Emmys for “The Carol Burnett Show,” a Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Mark Twain Prize for American Humor already on her mantel, Ms. Burnett will receive the inaugural Peabody career achievement award on May 19. In a phone interview from her home in Santa Barbara, Calif., she talked about her role as a pioneering female comedian and what she finds funny — and doesn’t. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. At this stage, why take on another series? It was 12 shows, so it’s not a huge commitment, and I liked the kids. It’s a cute premise because we have three grown-up dilemmas for each show, and the kids give their advice on how to solve the problems. And there’s no script. It’s all unrehearsed, and the kids are not professional actors. It was a walk in the park. You famously discovered young talent like Vicki Lawrence and Bernadette Peters. But on “The Carol Burnett 50th Anniversary Special” in December, Jim Carrey reminisced about asking to come on your show as a kid. Is he the one who got away? Well, I didn’t know Jim when he was 10 years old. I did answer his letter, however. Vicki was 18 and had no professional experience, but she wrote me that people said that she reminded them of a younger me. And we were planning to have a segment where Harvey [Korman] and I would be a married couple raising my kid sister. She was going to be in a contest called Miss Fireball of Inglewood, and I told my husband: “I’ve got a feeling. Let’s go see this contest.” She won the contest, we auditioned her, and she got the role. That wouldn’t happen today. Why not? No network would allow us to hire somebody that raw. Now they have the sponsors, and they’ve got to approve everything and are too hands-on, as far as I’m concerned. And they don’t trust you. That was back in the covered-wagon days when they just gave you a show and said: “O.K., you’re the artist. Do it, and if it’s successful we’ll renew every year.” When you think of that Saturday night lineup with “All in the Family,” “M*A*S*H,” Mary [Tyler Moore], Bob Newhart and us, we all had free rein. The network left us alone, and that’s why those shows were so good. In the 1960s, you took advantage of an option in your contract with CBS that allowed you to host 30 hours of a variety show. But network executives wanted to put you in a sitcom because they thought variety was a man’s job. I never thought, oh my gosh, it’s a woman and dah, dah, dah. I just knew that’s what I wanted to do. I wanted an actual rep company, which is what our show was, even though it had my name on it. There were times when I would be supporting Harvey, or Harvey would be supporting Vicki. Everybody got a chance to shine, and I learned that from “The Garry Moore Show,” because I remember sitting around the table, reading the script, and Garry had a funny line or two. And he looked up and said: “You know what? Give this to Carol, or give this line to Durward [Kirby]. They can say it funnier than I can.” The generosity — but he was also smart because he said, “Whatever makes the show better is going to make our show successful.” In your 2016 memoir, “In Such Good Company,” you wrote about trying to maintain ladylike qualities while making demands of your male staff. Back in the day, the men — Jackie Gleason and Sid Caesar and Milton Berle — if they said: “Hey guys, this sketch sucks. Get with it! What’s the matter with you?” they were fine because they were guys. But if a woman did it, she would be labeled a bitch. So I tap-danced around it a lot. Like, if a sketch wasn’t working, I’d call the writers down to rehearsal and I’d say: “Can you help us out here? I’m not saying this right. Maybe you could come up with a different line that would make it easier for me to get a laugh.” But now, because women are more accepted as producers, writers and stars, like Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, I would say: “Guys, this isn’t working. Let’s go back to the drawing board.” Still, that’s a nice way to say it. I can’t stand confrontation. It makes me crazy. What about the censors? We never got called on anything except one time. We were doing a scene where I was in a nudist camp, and I’m behind a fence that says “Keep Out,” and my shoulders and legs are bare, and Harvey was interviewing me about what nudists do for recreation. He said, “How do you nudists dance?” My line was, “Very carefully.” Well, for some reason the program practices thought that was too dirty, and so we came up with the line we wanted in the first place: “Cheek to cheek.” They bought it. Female vs. male comics: What’s the difference? Now, I don’t think there’s much difference. You know, in stand-up, the ladies can get as graphic as the men — not that I like it in either case. I’m not a prude, but gratuitous blue material to me is not only not classy, it’s a cheap laugh. If you look at “All in the Family,” Mary, Dick Van Dyke, Bob Newhart, that was classy writing. They didn’t have to get blue to shock. If I hear another penis joke, I’m going to throw up. Or vagina.

Brandon Wiggins,"Matt Harvey's poor start to the season has seen him relegated to the New York Mets bullpen. Rich Schultz/Getty Images One-time New York Mets ace pitcher Matt Harvey has had an abysmal start to the 2018 season, having lost his spot in the Mets' starting rotation. In addition to his struggles on the mound, Harvey's off-the-pitch lifestyle, in particular, his love of late nights and partying, appears to be wearing thin with the Mets' front office and even in the locker room. Page Six recently reported that Harvey had been out partying in Los Angeles the night before he came in as a relief pitcher in a game against the Dodgers on Friday, a report that led to a telling response from the Mets' general manager. Furthermore, according to Mike Puma of the New York Post, one Mets' player said of Harvey's antics, ""It's just, what are you doing?"" Harvey's party boy lifestyle has been well documented for some time now, and last year Page Six reported that Harvey was out partying in New York City the night before he failed to show up to Citi Field for a game. In fairness to Harvey, it is impossible to say how much, if any, of his struggles on the mound are due to his lifestyle, as he has suffered some injuries over the years. Still, given that Harvey is in t he last year of his contract with the Mets, it would be prudent on his part to quit doing activities that might upset the team, or otherwise contribute to negative perceptions of his character that other teams might have developed. It is a sad decline for Harvey, a player who once looked the present and future of the Mets organization.","New York Mets pitcher Matt Harvey was out at a club the night before a game he pitched in, just the latest example of Harvey's love of partying.

"AJ Willingham, CNN","(CNN) To those who follow the NFL, the monstrous defensive powerhouse known as J.J. Watt needs no introduction. The Houston Texans star is one of the biggest names in the NFL. He works out a lot. He has strategically uncontroversial views on things like the #TakeAKnee movement. Even though he was born and raised in Wisconsin, he has stepped up time and time again to support his adoptive home of Houston. In short, he's basically a kind of Captain America, if Captain America also played football. Watt was born in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and played college football in the area, but has spent his whole professional career with the Houston Texans, who signed him in the first round of the 2011 draft. (Translation: he's good, he's rich and his team loves him.) He's a defensive end, which means he is both massive and athletic. The only place you don't want to meet a man like J.J. Watt is on the wrong end of the football field. In 2014, he signed a six-year, $100 million contract extension with the Texans. (Again: good, rich, loved.) In the last few years, Watt has suffered several major injuries, including a groin tear, a herniated disk and a leg fracture that have kept him off the field for prolonged periods of time. Nonetheless, his injuries didn't stop him from using his wealth and influence to pursue some serious do-goodery. His Hurricane Harvey heroism After Hurricane Harvey devastated areas around Houston and the rest of the Gulf Coast in August 2017, Watt embarked on what would be his most career-defining charitable effort to date. Through a YouCaring campaign and plenty of social media attention and help from some famous friends, Watt raised more than $37 million for victims of the floods and damage Harvey left behind. Because of his fundraising, he was awarded the 2017 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award, which is given to honor the charity and volunteer efforts of NFL players. His previous work with shooting victims Oddly -- and sadly -- enough, Watt's offer to the Santa Fe HS shooting victims' families isn't the first time he has reached out after such a tragedy. After the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012, Watt invited some of the children from Sandy Hook Elementary to meet him and participate in a day of football and much-needed fun at the Texans' stadium. His charity work and social views In addition to his support in times of tragedy, J.J. Watt is also the founder of the (aptly-named) J.J. Watt Foundation. The foundation funds after-school athletics programs and organizations several high-profile charity events a year. Watt's reputation as an all-American good guy exists during a time when the NFL is facing questions about what it means to be an American and, indeed, what it means to be a good guy. Watt has managed to stay at the margins of such controversies. During the #TakeAKnee movement, which headlined much of the 2017 season and intersected with Watt's Hurricane Harvey fundraising, Watt had this to say : "" I think that I can speak to what I've seen recently in the last month or so and the incredible nature of people coming together and the unity people showed in the midst of Hurricane Harvey, in the midst of Hurricane Irma, everybody in Puerto Rico helping out. It's incredible to see what people do when they come together for a common cause."" In the spirit of those comments, it should be noted that while Watt is an extraordinary force for good in the NFL and in the Houston community, he is far from the only athlete -- in Texas and in pro sports -- who donates their time, talent and fortune to others. During the same 2017 hurricane season that brought Harvey's wrath to Houston, several MLB players from Puerto Rico raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help out their homeland, which was crippled by Hurricane Maria. And in another meaningful moment of unity and support after the Santa Fe shooting, Texans players Julién Davenport and Kendall Lamm joined members of the Houston Police Department for their Saturday night patrol. Watt's latest offer of comfort to the Santa Fe HS families has netted him widespread support from fellow celebrities and athletes, and echoes a sentiment he tweeted out just days before the shooting. ""If you have the power to make someone happy, do it,"" he wrote. ""The world needs more of that.""","The Houston Texans player is basically a kind of Captain America, if Captain America also played football.",2018-05-21T17:15:21Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",NFL star helping out the Santa Fe victims' families has a long history of philanthropy,https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/21/us/jj-watt-who-is-texans-nfl-santa-fe-victims-trnd/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170829034158-j-j-watt-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,Harvey,0
Nick Summers,"In theory, anyone could have made it. The pair, though, are talented podcasters and talk about movies in a truly smart, thoughtful way. I love the bite-sized history lessons at the start of each episode, too, because they always teach me something new about my favorite movies. Leader covers everything including the director, how the film was funded, and the way it was released both domestically and internationally. Did you know, for instance, that Miramax (then owned by Disney) handled the release of Princess Mononoke in the US? And that Studio Ghibli mailed a samurai sword with a note that said ""no cuts"" to co-founder Harvey Weinstein? It's a wonderful way to kick off each episode. The review section that follows is just as interesting, however. Leader often recounts the first time he saw the film and how his feelings have changed, or stayed the same, since that first viewing. Cunningham, meanwhile, does an admirable job bringing an outsider's perspective to the conversation. He knows which movies are considered 'classics,' but doesn't have a problem challenging Princess Mononoke 's convoluted mythology, or the sudden and arguably unnecessary marriage proposal at the end of Whisper of the Heart. Occasionally, they're joined by wonderful guests such as film journalist and broadcaster Beth Webb and The Telegraph 's Robbie Collin, too. The roughly 30-minute podcast is perfect for Ghibli fans and newbies alike. There are six episodes at the time of writing, discussing My Neighbor Totoro, Grave of the Fireflies, Only Yesterday and more. The show will be going on hiatus soon -- it was launched, after all, to coincide with a now-complete Ghibli retrospective on Film4 -- but could continue with enough listener support.

Mark Kaufman,"On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its forecast for the looming 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, and it'll be an active one. Forecasters say that there's a 70 percent chance that the season will be active with hurricanes, but it's unlikely that we'll see the extremes of 2017, when six major storms (which have sustained destructive winds of at least 111 mph ) roared through the Atlantic. ""Last year was extremely active,"" Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said in an interview. ""It was one of the strongest seasons on record."" SEE ALSO: Fighting climate change could save the world trillions of dollars This coming year, NOAA's analysis of long-term climate trends in the Atlantic Ocean, the temperature of the ocean, and other factors, don't add up to conditions that would stoke an extreme hurricane season. ""Right now we're not seeing any strong climate signals that say the season would be as strong as last year,"" said Bell. But, NOAA is seeing the signal for a season that is either ""normal"" or ""above normal."" There's just a 25 percent chance that the season will be ""below normal."" Image: Noaa For perspective, the rare 2017 season saw 17 named storms (winds higher than 39 mph), six of which were major hurricanes of Category 3 or above, like hurricane Harvey and Irma last year. Bell said that a ""normal"" season would be 10 to 12 named storms, with five to six total hurricanes, one or two of which would be major, devastating cyclones (think Hurricane Harvey or Irma). There's a reasonable chance, about 35 percent, that these storm numbers and intensities could be punched up a little more, however, and enter the ""above normal"" spectrum. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30, though Bell notes the peak of the season is in August, September, and October. For this reason, NOAA will produce an updated forecast in early August. These are the names NOAA will use to name storms during this hurricane season. Image: NOAA The 2018 season begins as many areas are still reeling from the 2017 pummeling. Recovering from Hurricane Harvey alone has a price tag that exceeds $125 billion, according to NOAA. Puerto Rico is still in the process of recovering from Hurricane Maria, with more than 14,000 people still without power on the island, according to an ABC report. There are some 80 million Americans that live in hurricane territory, notes Bell, so he hopes people start preparing. This means getting flood insurance, having an evacuation plan, downloading the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) app, and heeding warnings. Since 1995, the Atlantic has experienced a high amount of hurricane activity said Bell, in large part due to a decades-long climate trend occurring in Atlantic, called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), in which warmer waters produce stronger storms. Some studies also suggest that as human-caused climate change worsens, extreme weather events could become more frequent and severe.","On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its forecast for the looming 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, and it'll be an active one.

Jennifer Peltz / AP,"(NEW YORK) — The New York Times and The New Yorker won the Pulitzer Prize for public service Monday for breaking the Harvey Weinstein scandal with reporting that galvanized the #MeToo movement and set off a national reckoning over sexual misconduct in the workplace. The Times and The Washington Post took the national reporting award for their coverage of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential race and contacts between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russian officials. The Press Democrat of Santa Rosa, California, received the breaking news reporting award for coverage of the wildfires that swept through California wine country last fall, killing 44 people and destroying thousands of homes. The Washington Post also won the investigative reporting prize for revealing allegations of sexual misconduct against Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama decades ago. The Republican former judge denied the accusations, but they factored heavily in the special election that Democrat Doug Jones went on to win. The Pulitzers, American journalism’s most prestigious awards, reflected a year of unrelenting news and unprecedented challenges for U.S. media, as Trump repeatedly branded reporting “fake news” and called journalists “the enemy of the people.” In announcing the prizes, Pulitzer administrator Dana Canedy said the winners “uphold the highest purpose of a free and independent press, even in the most trying of times.” “Their work is real news of the highest order, executed nobly, as journalism was always intended, without fear or favor,” she said. A string of stories in The Times and The Washington Post shined a light on connections between Russian officials and Trump’s 2016 campaign, ties now under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller. The president has branded the investigation a “witch hunt.” The Russia probe stories were “deeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically improved the public’s understanding,” Canedy said. In stories that appeared within days of each other in October, The Times and The New Yorker reported that movie mogul Weinstein faced allegations of sexual harassment and assault from a multitude of women in Hollywood going back decades and had secretly paid settlements to keep the claims from becoming public. Canedy said the Times’ Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey and The New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow produced “explosive, impactful journalism that exposed wealthy and powerful sexual predators.” The stories led to Weinstein’s ouster from the studio he co-founded, and he now faces criminal investigations in New York and Los Angeles. He has apologized for “the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past” but denied any non-consensual sexual contact. The stories’ impact soon spread beyond Weinstein to allegations against other prominent men in entertainment, politics and elsewhere, toppling such figures as “Today” show host Matt Lauer, actor Kevin Spacey, newsman Charlie Rose and Sen. Al Franken. Men and women, famous or not, have spoken about their own experiences of sexual harassment and assault in what has become known as the #MeToo movement.

Saqib Shah,"Although, it's difficult to chalk 2017 up as anything other than a lousy year, we can find some solace in the well-meaning ""how"" queries sent Google's way. Aside from an increase in political mobilization (as evidenced in the popularity of ""how to make a protest sign?""), we were asking ""how to help?"" more than ever. Spurred by natural disasters (like the California wildfires), people also looked for ways to help out within local communities by asking how to become firefighters, paramedics, social workers, and activists. ""In these moments and others, our collective humanity shined,"" remarked Google. The company itself marked the year by fully embracing hardware, but (judging by its trends) the Pixel 2 wasn't the handset search users were anticipating the most. That honor went to Apple's iPhone 8 and iPhone X, which came in at second and third place respectively on global search results. Staying on the tech side of things, Bitcoin was also in the mix, as people kept pace with its volatile price surges (while hopefully refraining from splashing their savings on the digital currency). When it came to celebs, the news cycle had us furiously looking up Matt Lauer and other men on the end of sexual misconduct allegations. Harvey Weinstein, on the other hand, whose outing at the hands of a New York Times expose opened the sexual harassment floodgates, wound up at number three. Kevin Spacey and Bill O' Reilly also made the cut. Meanwhile, soon-to-be princess Meghan Markle landed in second place and Gal Gadot just cracked the top ten. Elsewhere, in a grab bag of top US and global searches, we commemorated rock legends Tom Petty and Chester Bennington, gawked at Mayweather vs McGregor, binged Netflix's 13 Reasons Why, sought out the solar eclipse, and googled fidget spinners (bet you're not doing that anymore).","It's been a heck of a year.

WIRED Staff,"Every night, an hour before bed, I stash my phone inside a drawer in my living room. Most days I retrieve it the following morning, when I'm heading out the door. It's a simple habit, but one that has helped me reclaim some focus from my smartphone—my personal fix for a growing problem that user experience researchers at Google recently called an ""attention crisis."" Outside the house, though, it's a different story: My phone rarely leaves my side. I reach for it to record an interview, field a slack from my editor, or make plans with family—but succumbing to an Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook binge often leaves me feeling distracted and frazzled. So for the past couple weeks, I've been using an app called Flipd that works a bit like a digital drawer where I can hide my phone. But unlike other time management features currently in vogue, which work by passively tracking the time you spend using specific apps, Flipd requires actual intention to use—a fact that could help users keep their phones tucked away while breaking their impulsive phone-checking habits. Flipd's most basic feature is called the ""Light Lock."" It's a countdown that I activate when I want to avoid my phone. To use it, I decide how long I want to unplug—say, 30 minutes for a coffee date, or two hours for an uninterrupted writing session—and initiate the timer. Fans of the Pomodoro method and similar timeboxing strategies might recognize the approach of compartmentalizing tasks, but that's where the similarities end—and where the app gets interesting. The Light Lock uses two tricks to keep you off your phone. First, it tracks the time you spend disengaged from your device. But crucially, it only logs the time you spend consciously disengaged. ""We call these mindful minutes,"" says Flipd cofounder Alanna Harvey. She compares mindful minutes to a daily step goal. The app's latest feature, Flipd 180, encourages people to spend at least 180 minutes a day intentionally unplugged from their devices. It's not enough to not be on your phone; if you want credit for being offline, you must first proclaim your intention to do so by using the app. Initiating a countdown helps distinguish the time you decide to be off your phone (the positive habit you want to cultivate) from the time you happen to not be using it (which is mostly a matter of circumstance). The second trick is simple, but if you're like me, it might reveal how reflexive and unthinking your phone-checking habits have become: If you exit Flipd or open a different app, your session terminates. No more mindful minutes. You can, however, pause your timer (hence ""Light"" Lock). If you remember to pause before navigating away, your session remains active. To resume logging mindful minutes, return to Flipd and unpause to re-initiate your countdown. You're probably thinking: If the point is to encourage people to unplug, why even give them the option to interrupt their session? A pause-able timer sounds both counterintuitive and easy to circumvent. In practice, though, I had a hell of a time remembering to pause my timer. The result was a lot of aborted sessions. At first, I thought something was wrong with the app. On several instances, I revisited Flipd at the end of what I thought had been a prolonged break, only to find that I had made it just a few minutes—and on one occasion, a few seconds—into my session. But the app was working fine. Here's what actually happened: I was accessing my phone via the lock screen, briefly using it, and putting it away—without realizing or remembering it. On many phones, mine included, it's possible to launch apps directly from the lock screen. Firing up the camera on iOS is as easy as lifting your iPhone and swiping left. And when I see I've received a message from a friend, I just tap the WhatsApp notification on my lock screen. For me, these gestures are so automatic, I often perform them without thinking. That mindless compulsion is precisely the habit Flipd is designed to confront. ""The critical thing about Flipd is it helps you realize how easy it is to be pulled in by your phone,"" says Georgetown psychologist Kostadin Kushlev, who studies human-computer interaction and its impact on personal well-being, and is not involved with Flipd. Calling attention to an unwanted habit is just the first step. Fixing it often depends on understanding how the habit works—the cue that triggers your compulsion and your state of mind when you succumb to it. That's one reason recently unveiled time-management features from tech giants could ultimately fall short. Since May, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Instagram have all released tools that show users how much time they spend inside specific apps. Those tools might help users understand how they use their phones after the fact, but they do little to help them change their habits in the moment. By contrast, Flipd's pause feature introduces friction and mindfulness to an otherwise mindless and friction-free reflex, giving users a moment to consider what they're doing and why. Apps like Flipd could serve as a valuable complement to tech giants’ screen-time monitoring tools—assuming they work as intended. (Sample size of one and all that, but I've found Flipd to be helpful: Within a few days, I had stopped launching apps directly from my lock screen.) A large-scale, long-term study of Flipd users would shed more light on its usefulness. Harvey says such an investigation is currently underway. Kushlev is also suspicious of the app's 180-minute goal, which he says might be counterproductive for users who struggle to reach it. Indeed, early fitness trackers prescribed a daily 10,000-step goal, despite the average American logging only half that number— a disparity researchers found could actually discourage activity in some users. Personalized mindful-minute goals, Kushlev says, tailored to a user's habits, might be more effective.

Marcus Gilmer,"Hurricane Florence is slowly but surely moving toward landfall along the East Coast. While its winds have decreased, making the storm a Category 2, it's still an incredibly powerful and dangerous storm with extreme rains expected to fall over the course of the next few days in the Carolinas and Virginia as it slows near the coast. That slowdown could produce historic amounts of rain for that part of the country, if current forecasts hold. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Florence is growing: 5 things to know about the monster storm Meteorologist Ryan Maue of WeatherModels tweeted some projections on Thursday morning. Maue's models suggest that around 17 trillion gallons of rain will fall across North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia with some spots receiving as much as 30 inches of rain before Florence is finished. As Hurricane #Florence makes landfall — or tries to very slowly — the rainfall will add up quickly across the Carolinas but also Virginia... I'd bet on maximum totals &gt; 30"" in many counties... forecast totals from the adjacent states near landfall around 17 trillion gallons. pic.twitter.com/xcfio0u1fA — Ryan Maue | weathermodels.com (@RyanMaue) September 13, 2018 That is an astounding amount of rain, sure to lead to widespread flooding and billions of dollars in damage. ( Over 24 trillion gallons of rain fell on Texas and Louisiana thanks to Hurricane Harvey and we all saw what that did.) Maue uses multiple models, including data that's agreed upon by the National Hurricane Center, local National Weather Service offices, and the Weather Prediction Center, to come up with his forecasts. It could (hopefully!) be less or it could be (hopefully not!) more. Maue points to geography as a factor, saying that ""these storms have a tendency to really wring out the moisture when they come up against the [Appalachian] mountains."" The tropical cyclone-related rainfall records for the Southeast since 1950. 1870-1949 rain data do not reveal wetter storms for the Carolinas. As 40"" local amounts are possible from Florence, the rain forecast is beyond what has been previously seen/witnessed for the Carolinas. pic.twitter.com/BmVZQnZvhj — NWS WPC (@NWSWPC) September 12, 2018 It also won't help matters that a ridge will hold Florence in place, keeping the storm from moving very much for a few days. ""It's blocked right now to the north, to the west, and to the east right now,"" Maue said. ""So the only place it can really go is a little nudge south,"" until it can eventually go around the ridge and move north. The forecast amount of rain is hard to wrap your brain around. What does 17 trillion gallons look like? It would fill 26 million Olympic-size swimming pools (660,000 gallons each). That much water could fill up nearly 3.5 Great Salt Lakes. It's enough water to submerge around 81,500 square miles in a foot of water, which would cover the states of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Jersey. It's roughly 68 times the amount of water that was pumped out of New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. It's important to remember that these numbers are just predictions for now. We won't actually know how much rain falls on the U.S. from Florence until, well, it actually happens. Maue notes that the heaviest rain could reach inland all the way to Raleigh, which is about 150 miles from the North Carolina coast. The National Weather Service says local amounts in some areas could top 40 inches. There has been weather monitoring in the city of Wilmington, NC for nearly 150 years. The most recent NCEP WPC rainfall prediction for Hurricane #Florence would shatter the historical record for 7-day rainfall accumulation by more than a foot. pic.twitter.com/CsSrSfRMKE — Robert Rohde (@rarohde) September 13, 2018 Whatever the totals wind up being, Florence is sure to bring destructive winds, rain, and floods to the area, meaning a long clean-up and recovery to come.

Eric Berger,"Enlarge / Houston, on Monday, basically all across the city. reader comments 500 Saturday August 25 marks the one-year anniversary of the Texas landfall of Hurricane Harvey. Alongside Hurricane Katrina, it ranks as the costliest hurricane on record for the United States. Revisiting this story now, as another slow-moving hurricane pounds the Hawaiian islands with heavy rainfall and life threatening flooding, seems both appropriate and unfortunate at the same time. As such, we're resurfacing this first-person account from Ars' Houston-based space guru, Eric Berger. The piece originally ran on August 30, 2017 and appears unchanged below. HOUSTON—Lightning crashed all around as I dashed into the dark night. The parking lot outside my apartment building had become swollen with rains, a torrent about a foot deep rushing toward lower ground God knows where. Amazingly, the garage door rose when I punched the button on the opener. Inside I found what I expected to find—mayhem. In dismay, I scooped up a box of books that had been on the floor. As I did, one of the sodden bottom flaps gave way, and a heavy book splashed into the water: From Dawn to Decadence, a timeless account of the Western world's great works by Jacques Barzun. Almost immediately, a current from the rushing water beyond the garage door pulled the tome away, forever. Damn, I loved that book. An indescribably bad night had just gotten that little bit worse. This little scene played out on Sunday morning, around 4am, after sheets of rain from Hurricane Harvey had drenched southern Houston for the previous 12 hours. A few miles away, amidst the tempest, my wife sat on the front porch of her sister's new home. It had been built on pilings to keep it safe from flooding. But when 24 inches falls in less than 24 hours, as it did over Clear Creek south of Houston, bad things happen. Amanda and her sister watched as the flood waters rose, step by step, toward the porch and first story where they sat. A similar situation played itself out all across the fourth largest city in the country that night. Fearful, nervous, terrified people watched the water coming up. And the relentless rain, it never seemed to end. As bayous rose, emergency responders issued warnings on TV and social media: don't go into your attics unless there's an exit or you take an axe. And bring white towels with you, they said, so we can find you on rooftops. People catch a ride on a construction truck as they evacuate their homes after the area was inundated with flooding from Hurricane Harvey. This gallery highlights scenes from around a ravaged Houston. People take shelter at the George R.

Another flooded neighborhood (notice the Taco truck and flooded homes). Bottled water is among the most valuable commodities during a storm. Another scene from Houston. What a lot of neighborhoods look like right now. Creeks across the region are swollen. Nationally, Houston has a lousy reputation. It's too hot, too humid, and too, well, too sprawly. It is all of those things. And don't tell the Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau I said this, but it's not a great city to visit. There isn't much to do here that's touristy, especially during our sultry summers. But here's a little secret: Houston is a great place to live. It's the opposite of, ""It's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there."" Rather, Houston may not be a nice place to visit, but you would want to live there. I do. But not on that Saturday night. Nor the next day. Nor night. Nor, well, any time through Wednesday. As this article publishes, periodic heavy rains are still pulsing through parts of the upper Texas coast as Harvey finally pulls away. Already, the city has nearly set an annual record for rainfall, and the month is only August. The city, quite literally, is drowning. Allison This is not the first time I've experienced an epic flood in Houston. It was only 16 years ago that another tropical system, Allison, moved into the upper Texas coast. The storm had gone inland, up into the piney woods of Eastern Texas. But four days later it sagged back toward the coast and refueled itself on warmth and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. On the night of Friday, June 8, 2001, it would soak downtown Houston. I remember this night vividly. It predated the existence of smart phones, weather apps, and, well, I was younger and stupider then. So even though it was raining heavily that Friday evening, some friends and I left work and went to a local club to see a Bob Schneider show. The rain got so intense, that even as Schneider crooned songs from his new album, Lonelyland, we could hear the storms outside over the music. It was time to go. Outside, the roads were rushing with water, seeking their way to bayous, which in turn carry water out into the Gulf of Mexico. As I said my goodbyes and dashed to my car it dawned on me—how, exactly, was I going to get home? I'd recently bought a house a few miles northwest of downtown, but to get there from the club I'd have to cross Interstate 10, the freeway that spans the entirety of America, from Santa Monica, California to Jacksonville, Florida. That night, in central Houston, it had become a raging canal. I couldn't cross. My friends had been going the other way, they couldn't get anywhere either. The Saturday morning after Tropical Storm Allison was pretty bad. That night we ended up tromping around the Montrose area of Houston. It was such a surreal scene. The last thing you should do in floodwaters, especially at night, is to walk into them. You don't know how deep they are. You might stumble into a drain. And, yes, there are a few alligators and snakes in the bayous of Houston. But I was in my 20s then—again, young and stupid. Estimated as a 500-year flood by hydrologists, Allison was considered the reference inland rainfall event for Houston. At least now we knew how bad it could get here. The city could be hardened. When I finally made it home around noon the next day, I decided I didn't want to ever be caught unprepared for such a dire situation again. I began paying closer attention to the weather. As a science writer for the Houston Chronicle, I wrote stories about flooding and tropical weather. By Hurricane Katrina in 2005, I had a science blog and filled it with dispatches about the storm. Hurricane Rita followed three weeks later. By the time Hurricane Ike struck Texas in 2008, the third costliest hurricane in US history, I had the bug. I pursued a meteorology certification from Mississippi State University. I left the Chronicle in 2015 to cover space full time for Ars. But over the years I had built an audience I felt compelled to serve, so I started Space City Weather as kind of a hobby. And it more or less remained a hobby until last week, drawing perhaps 25,000 page views a week. I had some loyal fans, but really, who wanted to read forecasts day after day when the seven-day outlook called for hot, sunny days with a slight chance of rain? Harvey The atmospheric physics behind Harvey's prodigious rainmaking ability are pretty simple. A big low pressure system moves into the Texas coast, dragging a bunch of moisture with it. Usually, when big tropical systems achieve hurricane status, they have some capacity to forge their own steering currents. But when Hurricane Harvey made landfall, it ran into a ridge of high pressure over the southwestern United States. This blocked further movement. Once inland Friday night, Harvey was essentially a marble on a flat table, wobbling around. This is a particularly bad thing for people nearby such a storm, since it essentially becomes a conveyor belt for moisture from the Gulf to coastal areas. You've got this counter-clockwise circulation hoovering up moisture from the Gulf at lower levels of the atmosphere, creating a funnel of rising air. And when warm, moist air rises, it rains. And when a storm doesn't move far from the coast, it just keeps raining—and never really stops. Enlarge / Fact check: True. Harvey came inland about 200 miles south of Houston, and the outer rain bands pushed into Houston on Saturday, setting the stage for the first of several exceptionally wet nights. Houston lies a few dozen feet above sea level, and during normal rainfall residential yards drain into streets, streets drain into bayous, and bayous carry water into Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. But this was not normal rainfall; it was extreme tropical rainfall. Meteorologists measure rainfall rates in inches per hour at a given location. A rainfall rate of 0.5 inches per hour is heavy, while anything above 2.0 inches per hour is intense (you'd probably stop your car on a highway, pull over, and wait out the passing storm). Over Clear Creek near where I live, from 11pm to 1am that night, 10.6 inches of rain fell, about as much rainfall as New York City gets from October through December. That happened i n two hours. The next night, the heaviest band of rainfall set up over western Houston, where affluent suburbs are generally protected by two large reservoirs. The Addicks and Barker facilities were built before World War II following devastating floods in Houston. Combined they have a capacity to store about 400,000 acre-feet of water, or about the same amount of water that goes over Niagara Falls in 10 days. The reservoirs filled up for the first time ever during Harvey, forcing the US Army Corps of engineers to release water into bayous that were already flooded, worsening conditions downstream in central Houston. Dramatically, this occurred near the very height of the storm. It seems insane, but this was the best of several bad options. Had the Corps not done this, the dam walls might have failed, leading to a catastrophic release of a wall of water as much as 100 feet high.

Andrew Freedman,"President Trump's first official State of the Union speech began with a reminder of the disasters that have befallen Americans during the past year, from wildfires in California to three of the top 5 most expensive hurricanes in U.S. history. ""We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined,"" Trump said. ""We have endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America's soul, and the steel in America's spine."" During 2017, the U.S. was struck with 16 billion-dollar weather and climate events costing a total of $306 billion in damage, which set a new record. It was enough devastation to get attention of the global business and political elite, who in Davos, Switzerland, ranked climate change and extreme weather events as the greatest threat to global security and prosperity. SEE ALSO: Weather and climate disasters cost the U.S. a record $306 billion in 2017 It wasn't enough carnage, though, to get a climate denying president to make basic connections between the disasters befalling his nation, and human-caused climate change. Trump rightfully cited examples of courageous rescuers from Hurricane Harvey in Texas, and the deadly California wildfire season. But he did so totally divorced from the broader context that is raising the risks of more and bigger disasters in the years to come. Instead, he portrayed it almost as just a string of bad luck. Hurricane Harvey rainfall annual exceedance probabilities. Image: noaa. ""We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy, racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane,"" Trump said. He also pledged continued assistance to hard hit areas, from California to Florida to Puerto Rico. ""To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands — everywhere — we are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together, always,"" Trump said. His words likely rang hollow in some areas, like Puerto Rico, where FEMA's food and water deliveries stopped on Wednesday, as the agency officially shifts from a crisis to a recovery phase of the ongoing disaster. Nearly half a million people still lack power more than four months after the storm. scientists have made clear, in studies both before and soon after these extreme weather events, that climate change is ushering in a new era of extreme weather But scientists have made clear, in studies both before and soon after these extreme weather events, that climate change is ushering in a new era of extreme weather that requires policies to be put in place that make the country's infrastructure more resilient, and head off the worst consequences of climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, the Trump administration is mounting an all-out assault on not only environmental regulations, from the planned pullout of the Paris Climate Agreement to an executive order rescinding Obama-era protections mandating that infrastructure plans take sea level rise into account. The administration's new infrastructure plan would also gut the environmental review process for approving new roads, bridges, tunnels, and more, including reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, not to mention the changing risks of so-called ""100-year"" floods. Simply put, climate scientists nearly unanimously say that the climate of our grandparents is gone, and what was a 100-year flood is now occurring far more frequently as the climate warms. The fact that Trump is causing us to lag behind the shifting climate risks more damage from floods, wildfires, and hurricanes. Take Hurricane Harvey, for example, a storm so full of superlatives that meteorologists are still trying to wrap their heads around it. According to a recent assessment from the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Harvey which made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 storm in late August, was the most extreme rainstorm ever recorded in the U.S. The maximum rainfall total was a staggering 60.58 inches near Nederland, Texas, with 18 locations seeing more than 4 feet of rain during the course of a few days. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a large portion of the Houston area saw a 1,000-year or greater flood, meaning that it had a chance of less than 0.1 percent of occurring in any given year. But those odds are deceiving, because the probability of precipitation and heat extremes is rising in many locations as human activities belch more planet-warming greenhouse gases into the air. there was nothing purely natural about the disasters that befell this country in 2017 According to research by Adrian Borsa of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, which was discussed at a scientific conference in December, ground-based GPS sensors even detected an overall sinking of southeastern Texas by up to 1.5 centimeters under the sheer weight of the rainfall. The GPS network provided an estimated total size of the rainfall of about 24 to 34 trillion gallons of water, Borsa said during the Annual Meeting of the American Geophysical Union. Studies published since Harvey have shown that the storm's rainfall totals were made more likely due to global warming, since warming air and ocean temperatures have resulted in greater amounts of water vapor available for storm systems to tap into. One study, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, found that climate change likely increased Harvey's total rainfall in the Houston area by about 38 percent, and boosted the chances of observed rainfall by a factor of about 10. Other studies published since the storm, which have also focused on the changing odds of such an extreme flood event, have also found sizable increases in the risk due in large part to global warming. The aftermath of a firestorm that struck Santa Rosa, Calif., seen on Nov. 5, 2017. Image: george rose/Getty Images This year was also a terrifying preview of what may be to come for Californians, as a warmer, drier climate brings the ingredients together for fast-moving, large wildfires. This year's wildfire season was California's worst on record, with communities like Santa Rosa and Montecito now synonymous with disaster. Wildfire dangers, like flooding damage, are also intertwined with myriad development decisions that are putting more Americans in harms' way. For example, Houston is now wrestling with their longtime lack of zoning regulations, and how that worsened the flooding from Harvey. If Trump truly wants to be ""with"" us, as he said in his speech on Tuesday night, he could start by admitting the obvious — there was nothing purely natural about the disasters that befell this country in 2017, and his policies are only putting us in more danger for many years to come.","President Trump's first official State of the Union speech began with a reminder of the disasters that have befallen Americans during the past year, from wildfires in California to three of the top 5 most expensive hurricanes in U.S. history.

ADAM BAIDAWI,"However, experts were quick to note that Amazon, the world’s biggest retailer, had yet to flex its full retail muscles. “I’d say it’s early days — it’s day one,” said Jack O’Leary, a United States-based analyst at PlanetRetail RNG, a global retail insights firm. “As you see more sellers come to the marketplace, you’ll see a deeper assortment, depth, and price competition will only go up from there.” Mr. O’Leary pointed out that at Amazon’s launch, the Australian marketplace had only a few hundred sellers — or third-party vendors — who are now listing their products on the site. Globally, the company has millions of sellers, a volume seen as key to Amazon’s formula of providing impossibly large assortments of products at ruthlessly competitive prices. As the number of sellers increases — and the company’s pricing algorithm takes hold — its penetration into the marketplace will improve significantly, he said. Major Australian retailers, in the meantime, have long since begun preparing for Amazon’s entry into the marketplace. Some, like the electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi, expanded its shipping offerings to include same-day delivery in certain regions. Others, like Harvey Norman, have doubled-down on their physical presences — the company has placed what it dubs “flagship stores” in Ireland and throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Gerry Harvey, the company’s chairman, had previously said that Amazon would be “idiots” to launch their retail offering so close to Christmas. “We haven’t got to adjust to anything,” said Mr. Harvey, who insisted that his business had not altered its plans in anticipation of Amazon’s arrival. “We’ve been in business now for 56 years. I’ve always been keen and able to be ahead of the pack. The minute someone gets ahead of us, I’ll hand the badge in. They follow us, we don’t follow them.” Mr. Harvey complained about the “free publicity” that Amazon had received in the lead-up to the launch, and said their retail offerings had never posted a profit. (The company’s strategy is to build market share and pump the cash generated by its business into new growth initiatives like video streaming and devices.) Australians spend less online than Americans or Europeans, but their spending there is growing, with eBay and major local electronics retailers catering to the national market. Mr. O’Leary, who has studied Amazon’s impact globally, said that businesses seeking to match the company’s product variety and pricing were fighting a losing battle. “If you’re trying to out-Amazon Amazon — well, there are very few retailers that can compete on that level,” he said. “Really, you need to differentiate from Amazon with some sort of unique assortment or product offering. Additionally, store-based retailers can take advantage of their retail presence.” But for some small business owners, the disruption has created opportunity. “We’ve been following it very closely,” Tristan Swanwick, the co-founder of Swanwick Sleep, an Australian company that sells sleep-aiding glasses, said of Amazon’s debut in Australia. “As soon as Amazon officially announced they were coming to Australia, we started sending emails and making phone calls” to ensure they would be among the first to partner with Amazon in Australia, he added. Mr. Swanwick said that his company initially launched their business in the United States through Fulfilled By Amazon, a program that allows small businesses to have Amazon handle things like warehousing, delivery and customer service. “It really lowers the barrier for entry for small businesses getting started in e-commerce,” he said. Swanwick Sleep was among the first batch of merchants included in Amazon’s Australian offering, easing its efforts to penetrate the Australian market. “Our mother used her spare bedroom to store inventory for us,” he said. “She would go down to the post office, maybe two or three times a day, depending on demand, to send off orders to Australian customers.” “She’s one of the happiest people in Australia that Amazon is here — she gets her spare bedroom back,” he added.

Ari Shapiro,"Harvey Washington Wiley was instrumental in bringing about regulations to boost sanitation and decrease food adulteration. Historical/Corbis via Getty Images Unlabeled stimulants in soft drinks. Formaldehyde in meat and milk. Borax the stuff used to kill ants! used as a common food preservative. The American food industry was once a wild and dangerous place for the consumer. Deborah Blum's new book, The Poison Squad, is a true story about how Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley, named chief chemist of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1883, conducted a rather grisly experiment on human volunteers to help make food safer for consumers and his work still echoes on today. Wiley was an indefatigable activist for food safety regulations during a time when the food industry was organizing and adding substances to food without any oversight, using its might to put profits before people. But Wiley and his small band of chemists began methodically testing suspected harmful additives and revealing the effects of these dangerous compounds to the government and public. It was a long battle, but one that did make things better. Nevertheless, we still have debates today over what is safe for us to eat. NPR's Ari Shapiro talks to Blum about her new book and Wiley, a formidable pioneer of food-safety regulations. This interview has been edited for length and clarity, and contains some Web-only expanded answers. You start the book by noting that we have this conception of the food our ancestors ate as being pure and authentic, straight from the farm. What was the reality? It was about the opposite of that. To be fair, there were people who lived on the farm and ate wonderful produce from their gardens, but most people were in this period of migration to the cities. This is the rise of industrialized America in the late 19th century, so most people were eating manufactured, grocery store-bought food. I was actually shocked to discover it was horrifyingly fake, fraudulent and tainted by any and all chemicals [people] felt like putting in it. So what might people in 1900 have found in their milk, or their coffee, or their spices? I took a close look at milk, because it's a great example of just how bad things could get. Dairymen seeking to stretch their profits would thin it with water and not always clean water. At one point, there was a case in Indiana in which it was pond water. The family found worms wiggling in it. And pond water was actually some of the safer stuff that milk was contaminated with! That's exactly right, because once you had thinned the milk, you had to reconstitute it in all kinds of weird ways. People put chalk or plaster dust in it. They sometimes put in toxic dyes to make it more golden instead of grayish or bluish. And because it was prone to rot this was before pasteurization and refrigeration they would dump preservatives in it. The most popular one was formaldehyde, an embalming compound, which is not good for humans to ingest. You can actually go out and see newspaper headlines around the country during this period with ""embalmed milk scandals."" You tell stories of kids dying from eating candy that was contaminated with lead. Given that this was causing real suffering in consumers, what kinds of arguments were people making for leaving this unregulated? It's baffling, because you are in this period where food makers are knowingly using very bad things. I gave the example of arsenic, which was a green food dye also used to make the shellac that glosses up chocolate. But lead was used to color candies, and red lead was used in cheese. If people wanted to make a beautiful, orange cheddar cheese, they just dumped a little red lead in it. This is not people who didn't know it was bad, but there were things that made it permissible. There were no labels, and so there was no public pressure. It was just a pre-regulatory Wild West of food that permitted bad actors to do what they will, and so they did. It saved them a lot of money. You get this capitalistic feedback loop of people who were trying to make a living and wanting to make more of a living. The consumer was both the guinea pig and the victim. So along comes a protagonist of your story: Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley, chief chemist of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Why did he care so much about this issue? I've always thought of him as kind of a holy roller kind of chemist. He was the son of an itinerant preacher and farmer in Indiana who was also a conductor on the Underground Railroad. Wiley was raised to think that what he did needing to be a higher calling. He would describe chemistry that way: Chemistry is the service of good. So this tiny group of chemists that he commanded at the USDA was it on food safety. He took up that cause. Your book is called The Poison Squad, which comes from a project that he undertook that really shows his commitment. Describe what The Poison Squad was. Wiley basically goes out and recruits other people at the USDA, especially young clerks, to volunteer to dine very dangerously. The idea of The Poison Squad was that these young men would get three free meals a day, seven days a week all of them paid for by the U.S. government. They have to agree not to have snacks or eat outside of these free meals. These are super fancy meals cooked by a professional chef. All of the ingredients are amazing. The only catch is: You have to agree that half of you at any given period in this experiment are going to be given capsules that contain suspect food additives. And these did include formaldehyde, and the cleaning product Borax, and salicylic acid, which we know from aspirin. And the amazing thing is that there were people lining up to volunteer for this experiment. And you wonder, 'Is this crazy or what?' You are testing suspected toxic compounds on human volunteers. But he felt that was the only way he could deal with this. You had this rising tide of really dangerous food additives and there were no safety regulations. 'How do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea? I'll just test it on people.' And so he did. To no one's surprise, if you feed people formaldehyde, or arsenic or lead, they will get sick. And when you demonstrate that, why does it still remain so difficult to outlaw these substances in food? The food industry had been organizing itself to fight regulation. Wiley had been advocating and working with congressmen to get some kind of basic consumer protection. And these experiments caught national attention they were front-page news, there were songs about them and everyone was realizing that there is a lot of bad stuff in their food. There was an immediate pushback. Suddenly, congressmen are on the side of food business or getting offered more money. The food industry organizes to create a Food Manufacturers Association. They were phenomenally effective. They did a great job trying to damage Wiley's reputation publicly and deny what he was finding, and bullied and threatened congressmen to kill regulation every time it came up. Despite these long-fought fights, today there isn't formaldehyde and lead and arsenic in food the way that there was 100 years ago. Progress really was made! Yes, and I would be completely irresponsible if I said that food today is as dangerous as it was in the 19th century. Once the first food-safety law was passed in 1906, two years after Wiley finished his Poison Squad experiments, you see government stepping up against some of these extremely dangerous compounds. But we are still having fights about what's safe. The list of dyes that we have in food today is the exact list that Wiley approved, minus a couple that fell out when they became known to be more toxic. So we've both improved things, and not moved forward as much as Wiley would have liked or I have come to believe we should.","Deborah Blum's book, The Poison Squad, tells how Harvey Washington Wiley and his band of chemists crusaded to remove toxins, such as arsenic and borax, from food.

Kamakshi Ayyar,"On Oct. 4, a young Indian writer by the name of Mahima Kukreja tweeted that a popular, Mumbai-based comedian, Utsav Chakraborty, had once sent her an unsolicited photo of his penis. Other women responded by sharing stories of similar behavior from Chakraborty and Kukreja began tweeting screenshots of the messages she received (while blurring out the names of the accusers). She kicked off a firestorm. By the time Chakraborty apologized a day later, scores of Indian women — many of them journalists — had taken to Twitter to detail their experiences of sexual harassment and violation at the hands of senior figures in the media and entertainment industries and, in one case, a government official. The repercussions in recent days have included public apologies, resignations, and the sudden closure of a prominent Bollywood production house after one of its co-founders was accused of sexual assault. Almost a year after the allegations against Harvey Weinstein were revealed, the #MeToo movement has come to India in force. It has been a slow build up. In 2017, Raya Sarkar, a law student, compiled a list of alleged sexual harassers in academia, and earlier this year actress Sri Reddy stripped half-naked to protest sexual harassment in Bollywood. Then, in September, actress Tanushree Dutta accused film veteran Nana Patekar of misconduct with her on a film set in 2008. (Patekar has denied the allegation; Dutta has filed a police complaint.) The case sparked an outpouring of other #MeToo allegations on social media. Now Kukreja’s tweet has started a fresh wave and prompted the compilation of a list — consolidated from stories across social media platforms and shared as a Google spreadsheet — with more than 80 men on it, many of them prominent. “I wish there was a nicer way to drive the point home for men but they don’t listen,” says Bengaluru-based journalist Sandhya Menon, who took to Twitter in Kukreja’s wake to accuse three different editors at leading daily papers of touching her, texting her inappropriate comments, and forcibly kissing her when she worked with them in the past. (The latter editor, Gautam Adhikari, told TIME that he had “no recollection at all of these incidents from many years ago.” The first two have, respectively, gone on administrative leave and kept silent.) Both in terms of the the numbers of men being publicly accused, and their willingness to apologize, India has seen nothing comparable to #MeToo. This, after all, is a country where women who rebuff unwanted advances are often assaulted, raped, or have acid thrown in their faces. Frequent victim-shaming, deeply rooted chauvinism, and an infamously inefficient legal system usually deter women from naming perpetrators. The 39% spike in recorded crimes against women between 2012 and 2016 (when they totaled 338,954) could be attributed to more women being willing to come forward, but it remains the case that most sexual assault cases go unreported. Things have been slowly changing, however. There have been isolated, though important, instances of women taking workplace harassers to court; one, involving the former head of the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, could prove to be a watershed case. The brutal 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder, and the rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Kashmir in early 2018, also brought huge numbers of women onto the streets in protest and put the threats faced by Indian women into the global spotlight. The global #MeToo movement has now built on that momentum by giving more Indian women the courage to name names. Besides journalists and actors, other professional groups, such as lawyers, are starting their own campaigns. “There are many vocal women on Twitter and over the last six months they’ve created this atmosphere where people feel there is a chance of being believed,” Menon tells TIME. Responses from several companies and organizations has been swift, especially from newsrooms, where many instances of sexually inappropriate behavior are alleged to have taken place. The Times of India, Quint and the Hindustan Times have set up internal investigations, while HuffPost India has voiced its support for women accusing two former employees of inappropriate conduct. Prashant Jha, a bureau chief at the Hindustan Times, stepped down after allegations were made against him and Mayank Jain, a reporter with Business Standard, resigned after being accused. The Hindustan Times also announced it would hold mandatory weekly workshops on sexual harassment. All of this represents a seismic shift in media workplace attitudes. As recently as 2013, a managing editor was accused of trying to downplay sexual assault accusations made against a senior journalist at the publication Tehelka. (That editor vigorously denies any attempted hush-up and the journalist is currently facing trial.) The upcoming Mumbai Film Festival has meanwhile announced that it will not show films involving some of the men who have been accused in recent days, while streaming service Hotstar has cancelled the production of a new season of the show On Air with AIB — the comedy group with which Chakraborty was associated. But for many Indian women, #MeToo is less about seeking redress — and certainly not legal redress, given the legal logjams overwhelming India’s courts — so much as relieving years of pent-up emotion. “We are tired of holding it in,” says Divya Kartikeyan, a journalist in Chennai. Describing #MeToo as “a full body experience of collective healing,” she has been collating information from women about their experiences of sexual harassment. The incidents being shared range from sexually-colored conversations — such as suggestions of renting a room for a day and asking about the “ wildest sexual thing ” the woman has done — to alleged groping, assault, and rape. One of the most high profile men to be accused is M.J. Akbar, the current minister of state for external affairs and a former journalist. Multiple women have come on record to accuse Akbar of harassment and inappropriate behavior. He has not commented on the allegations and an official from the Ministry of External Affairs said it had no comment when contacted by TIME. Another prominent name is Chetan Bhagat, a leading author who featured on the TIME 100 list in 2010. Screenshots of inappropriate messages sent by Bhagat to a woman some years ago have been shared on social media. Bhagat did not respond to TIME’s email but has verified the messages in a Facebook post, in which he also apologized, saying “I should have had better judgement.” That is what many Indian women are now demanding of their male colleagues and acquaintances. “I expect men to reflect and figure out what is wrong. I’m happy to help but if you come from a place of wanting to challenge, rather than wanting to know, that isn’t going to help,” Menon says. Ultimately, though, neither judgement nor reflection are considered enough. “The most important part of an apology is change in behavior,” Menon adds. “I’d like to see that and reserve my judgement until then.”","Almost a year after the allegations against Harvey Weinstein were revealed, the #MeToo movement has come to India in force.",2018-10-12T09:19:59Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",‘People Feel There’s a Chance of Being Believed.’ India’s #MeToo Movement Gathers Momentum,http://time.com/5421509/india-metoo-sexual-harassment-feminism-women/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/gettyimages-1051870244.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,Harvey,0

KENDRA PIERRE-LOUIS,"The remains of a house in Perryville, Mo., after a tornado. Credit Jon Durr/Getty Images Extreme weather events caused a total of $306 billion in damage in the United States last year, making 2017 the most expensive year on record for natural disasters in the country, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday. A trio of major hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, contributed hundreds of billions to the total. But the year was seemingly mired in disaster, from a freeze in the Southeast that damaged fruit crops in March, to hail storms that whipped across Colorado, Oklahoma and other central states in May, to the tornadoes that struck the Midwest in June. Unusual consequences of extreme weather could be found all over the map. Thirteen cows died in a field in Pennington County, S.D., after ingesting anthrax spores from the soil; they had changed their grazing patterns during a drought that lasted much of the year in South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana. The cows’ demise was a small part of the $2.5 billion of damage that struck the three states. In all, there were 16 natural disasters that caused more than $1 billion of damage in 2017. In 1980, when NOAA first started tallying records, there were three, adjusted for inflation. Scientists cannot always say with certainty that a given natural disaster was influenced by climate change. But some may be related to warming, and the contiguous United States experienced its third-warmest year on record in 2017. The temperature average was 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average, said Jake Crouch, a climate scientist from NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center. Here are the 16 billion-dollar disasters from 2017: Some made headlines for weeks, and some were simply overtaken in the public’s consciousness by the next one.

Graeme McMillan,"Even though the year is grinding to a close—this is the last While You Were Offline column of 2017!—nothing is slowing down on the internet, where former Pentagon officials are talking about possible alien life, Bitcoin is apparently collapsing, and some really impressively bad reviews are circulating for Netflix’s big holiday release. Talk about going out with a bang and a whimper. But what else has been happening on this web we once called world and wide? Feast your eyes below, dear friends, and enjoy your holiday season. Let’s all meet up again in the year 2018. Taxing Plans What Happened: The Republican tax plan finally passes, on the third attempt, amid multiple examples of proof that this wasn’t the most considered attempt to reshape the American economy in history. What Really Happened: After what seemed like an eternity of panicked last minute revisions and rewritings, the House took up what seemed like the final Republican tax bill last week, and things went according to plan for the GOP. Sure, this is a bill that is fairly bad for the majority of Americans (no, really ), but it’s not as if there’s going to be something that happened immediately as it was passed that acted as a visual metaphor for how things were going to go, right? Still, that’s just gravity ! Surely there aren't any other easily avoidable problems that showcased how quickly this was rushed through the House without appropriate oversight, right? Yes, that’s the stuff. It didn’t matter in the end, however; after the Senate passed the bill, it just went back to the House the next day for a do-over: So, what does this bill actually do, anyway? …Oh. Make America great again, I guess? The Takeaway: Well, at least someone was pleased with the bill passing. President Trump's UN-Deniable Misstep What Happened: Despite a not-so-veiled threat from the US administration, the United Nations expressed its displeasure with President Trump’s attempts to destabilize the Middle East peace process. What Really Happened: Hey, remember when Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, ending decades of US foreign policy? Sure you do. In what can only be described as ""nothing even remotely resembling a surprise,"" it turns out that the rest of the world wasn’t happy with the decision, as became clear at the United Nations this week. Yes, the president threatened to cut US aid for countries that criticized the Jerusalem decision, because that’s apparently how diplomacy rolls these days. How did that go down with the rest of the UN, though? That’s embarrassing for the president. On the plus side, there’s a case to be made for the US helping international unity by being the bad guy that everyone else comes together to defy… The Takeaway: Maybe there is a way to try and turn it into a win from UN ambassador Nikki Haley’s point of view? So, About That Meryl Streep Street Art... What Happened: Anyone who bet on ""street art in Los Angeles obliquely referencing Harvey Weinstein"" as the latest front in the ongoing culture wars, you should probably consider playing the lottery. What Really Happened: The fallout of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein continued in an unexpected direction last week when Rose McGowan went after Meryl Streep on Twitter. In a now-deleted series of tweets, she wrote, “Actresses, like Meryl Streep, who happily worked for The Pig Monster, are wearing black @goldenglobes in a silent protest. YOUR SILENCE is THE problem. You’ll accept a fake award breathlessly &amp; affect no real change. I despise your hypocrisy. Maybe you should all wear Marchesa.” (McGowan later apologized for that last line, saying, “There is no map for this road I’m on, I will fuck up.”) Streep then responded via a statement from her publicist, denying that she knew about Weinstein’s activity: Many were impressed by Streep’s tone, and what she had to say. Others, however, were less impressed. Or, at least, that’s what appeared to be the case when a series of posters showing Streep with the text “She Knew” across her face started appearing in Los Angeles. If this was an attempt to build a consensus against Streep, however, it wasn’t going too well. And with good reason: The posters turned out to be the work of a right-wing guerrilla artist who wanted to protest the release of Streep’s upcoming movie The Post, about the Washington Post 's decision to publish reports on the Pentagon Papers, and Streep’s political criticism of President Trump. “She’s swiping at us so we’re swiping back,” the artist—who goes by the name of Sabo—told The Guardian. The declaration of intent didn’t go too well. The artist, however, was clearly enjoying his moment in the spotlight. He was also upset at the accusations of plagiarism. The Takeaway: But, by all means, let’s blame Meryl Streep for Harvey Weinstein's actions! That’s far easier than people taking responsibility, right? Hannity's Blunder What Happened: Fox News' Sean Hannity took to Twitter to complain about the media without checking his sources. What Really Happened: In this age of #FakeNews, it’s up to truth warriors like Fox News’ Sean Hannity to tell America what’s really going on, with the help of their trusted outlets. Isn’t that right, Sean? Of course, in his rush to lay down the righteous truth, Sean might not have noticed where his linked story originated. But, luckily, lots of other people did. Well, maybe no one noticed. Oh, no, wait. Turns out, lots and lots of people noticed. But surely Sean had an entirely convincing explanation for what had happened… …Yes, sure. That’s exactly what the original tweet said. Gotcha. The Takeaway: Let’s think of this as a teachable moment for all involved. Especially those of us impressed at how hilariously Hannity’s original tweet came to bite him on the tush. Pumpin’ Up the Volume, Breakin’ Down to the Beat What Happened: It’s almost New Year's Day! But what’s the best way to start 2018? Twitter has more than a few suggestions. What Really Happened: It’s almost 2018, which means it’s time for that all important question: How are you going to get your next year started? Last week, social media was there to answer that question, by ensuring that no matter what else is to come, your new year will start with an amazing soundtrack. To wit… Of course, this wasn’t the only way to start your 2018 off right, as Twitter was quick to remind you. Wait, that’s not right. How about these, instead? Of course, there are ways not to start your New Year, as well… The Takeaway: Before we even get to December 31, should we be worried that all these suggestions are setting up unrealistic expectations for what lies ahead?","Just in time for the new year, Americans got a new tax plan—and it was just one of many things the internet was worked up about last week.",2017-12-24T14:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Reactions to the GOP Tax Plan Top This Week's Internet News Roundup,https://www.wired.com/story/internet-week-151/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5a3d5fb6eb4788232f9423d2/191:100/pass/DT-TaxBill-FeatureArt-897259464.jpg,wired,Wired,Harvey,0
Jacob Shamsian,"John Malkovich defended his starring role in a new play inspired by former Hollywood mogul and alleged rapist Harvey Weinstein, saying it's a ""terrific piece of writing."" 
 ""Bitter Wheat"" was written by ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" and ""The Untouchables"" writer David Mamet, is scheduled to premiere in London's West End this summer. It's central character, Barney Fein, is ""a bloated monster — a studio head who, like his predecessor, the minotaur, devours the young he has lured into his cave,"" according to promotional material. Malkovich — best known for ""Bird Box,"" ""Being John Malkovich,"" and ""Con Air"" — plays Fein. 
 ""Of course it might upset people who've experienced the kind of treatment that the play contains and shows and describes,"" Malkovich told BBC News. ""A lot of people may not like it. But what can I do about that? Personally I think it's a terrific piece of writing."" 
 Malkovich said that while Mamet's play is inspired by Weinstein, the central character is not a direct representation of him. 
 ""It's not particularly Harvey Weinstein. It's a great deal about that business and a great deal about about how people in that business in positions, say, as studio heads have behaved really for more or less a century now,"" he told the BBC. ""If the idea maybe started as a reaction to all the news that came out in particular about Harvey Weinstein, I think David took the idea from there and went with it.""

But Malkovich, who starred in the Weinstein Company-distributed 1998 movie ""Rounders,"" said he wasn't aware of any accusations against him at the time.

Back in a 2005 interview recently reposted by Metro, SoraNews and Kobini, Studio Ghibli’s Hayao Miyazaki told The Guardian about the experience. At that time, Disney had the rights to Princess Mononoke in the United States, and Harvey Weinstein, who then headed up Disney subsidiary Miramax Films, was overseeing its release. According to The Guardian, the rumor was that Miyazaki sent Weinstein a samurai sword with “No cuts” on the blade. “Actually, my producer did that,” Miyazaki clarified, seeming to refer to longtime producer Toshio Suzuki. “Although I did go to New York to meet this man, this Harvey Weinstein, and I was bombarded with this aggressive attack, all these demands for cuts.” “I defeated him,” Miyazaki said at the time, smiling.","Among the many things for which former Hollywood mogul and alleged predator Harvey Weinstein was notorious were re-editing movies as he saw fit, earning the nickname “Harvey Scissorhands.” But when Weinstein was handling Princess Mononoke’s US release, Studio…",2018-02-22T12:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Kotaku.com'}",The Time Studio Ghibli Stood Up To Harvey Weinstein With A Samurai Sword,https://kotaku.com/the-time-studio-ghibli-stood-up-to-harvey-weinstein-wit-1823223914,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--cmmMX8sn--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_450,q_80,w_800/hgtu2jtwhlcporx8woyf.png",,Kotaku.com,Harvey,0
Laura Hudson,"For years, rumors of sexual harassment have swirled around comedian Louis CK. Now, five women have come forward to accuse him of sexual misconduct, as reported at The New York Times. Their accounts are remarkably similar, involving incidents where the Louie star either asked if he could masturbate in front of them, or simply did so without their consent. Although his agent said he would decline to comment, Louis CK previously brushed off rumors of sexual misconduct, telling Vulture in 2016, “I don’t care about that. That’s nothing to me. That’s not real.” According to the five women who have come forward at the Times, however, it was very real — and they’ve finally found a way to make him care about it. The accusations follow a massive wave of sexual misconduct allegations published at the Times and elsewhere, aimed at prominent men like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Roy Price, Ben Affleck, and even former president George H. W. Bush. Shortly before the publication of the article, Louis CK pulled out of an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and the New York City premiere for his new film I Love You, Daddy was canceled hours before it was scheduled to begin. The cancellation was attributed to “unexpected circumstances,” but those observing the aftermath of the Harvey Weinstein revelations have been vocally expecting this particular revelation for the past week. Louis CK wrote and directed the controversial I Love You, Daddy, and he stars as a television writer and producer whose teenage daughter (Chloë Moretz) is seduced by a predatory 68-year-old filmmaker (John Malkovich). The film explores the messy, controversial issues around sexual consent, an astonishingly hubristic subject choice for a filmmaker under a cloud of suspicion around sexual misconduct. One scene in the movie features a character pantomiming masturbation for an extended period of time, though Louis CK told the Times in September that it was not intended as an allusion to the rumors. “It’s funny. I didn’t think of that.” The comedian’s routine often included masturbation jokes, and in 2007, he told a radio show a story about exposing his genitals to an old man in public when he was younger, adding, “I don’t know why.” According to several of the women who came forward, the star was very aware of what he was doing when he masturbated in front of them or propositioned them — not only that it was non-consensual, but that it was wrong. Neither talent nor self-awareness are impediments to being a sexual abuser Actor and comedian Rebecca Corry told The New York Times that while she was working on a pilot in 2005, Louis CK came in as a guest star, and asked to enter her dressing room, where he planned to masturbate in front of her. When rebuffed, Corry said, “his face got red and he told me he had issues.” In 2015, she says he offered another apology, claiming that he “used to misread people back then.” Writer and performer Abby Schachner said that when she called CK to invite him to one of her shows in 2003, he started to tell her his sexual fantasies, and she could hear him masturbating on the other end. Later, he sent her a Facebook message that said, “I remember thinking what a repulsive person I was being by responding the way that I did.” Schachner said the experience discouraged her from pursuing a career in comedy. Alongside the accounts of three other women, these accusations paint a picture of a powerful man who was fully aware that he was a compulsive sexual harasser, routinely apologized for it, and yet failed to curb his behavior. It’s a stark reminder that neither talent nor self-awareness are impediments to being a sexual abuser. If anything, those traits only make harassers more adept at avoiding consequences — or at least, one hopes, they used to.","Yup, it finally happened",2017-11-09T21:39:50Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",Louis CK accused of sexual misconduct by five women,https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16630238/louis-ck-sexual-misconduct-accusations,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hIgvpKs5R-_Y-u_WpuryaLdtIl0=/0x25:1280x695/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3320774/louie.0.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,Harvey,0

Mallory Locklear,"C.K. was set to release a second stand up special with Netflix, following one that was released in April, but that special will no longer happen. A spokesperson for the company said, ""The allegations made by several women in the New York Times about Louis C.K.'s behavior are disturbing. Louis's unprofessional and inappropriate behavior with female colleagues has led us to decide not to produce a second stand up special, as had been planned."" Orchard has also scrapped C.K.'s upcoming film I Love You, Daddy and HBO has cut the comic from its lineup of its ""Night of Too Many Stars"" charity event. Older works of C.K.'s that have previously been available through HBO On Demand will also be taken down. Netflix also announced earlier this month that it would not air the final season of House of Cards if Kevin Spacey was involved, following reports of sexual assault committed by the actor. While it's definitely the right move to cut ties with these men who are now getting lots of attention for their despicable actions, it should be noted that at least in the cases of Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Louis C.K., these allegations have been swirling for years. The New York Times and Buzzfeed may have brought them to light in recent weeks, but outlets like Gawker reported on both Louis C.K. and Kevin Spacey years ago and as many have pointed out following the NYT's in-depth report on him, Weinstein's abusive behaviors have been not so subtly worked into a number of shows' dialogue.

Camila Domonoske,"Italian actress Asia Argento arrives at a film screening at the Cannes Film Festival in Cannes, France, on May 19. Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty Images Italian actress Asia Argento, one of the most prominent voices in the #MeToo movement, paid $380,000 to a man who accused her of sexually assaulting him when he was 17, according to a report by The New York Times based on legal documents anonymously leaked to the paper. Argento was one of many women who described harassment and assault by disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein. Argento accused him of rape, going public with her story in The New Yorker in October. Weinstein, who has been charged with raping two other women, has denied all the allegations of rape against him, maintaining he only had consensual sex. A month after that story published, according to the documents acquired by the Times, a man named Jimmy Bennett announced his notice of intent to sue Argento. Bennett said she sexually assaulted him when he was 17 (under the age of consent in California) and she was 37. The Times reports: ""That claim and the subsequent arrangement for payments are laid out in documents between lawyers for Ms. Argento and Mr. Bennett, a former child actor who once played her son in a movie. ""The documents, which were sent to The New York Times through encrypted email by an unidentified party, include a selfie dated May 9, 2013, of the two lying in bed. As part of the agreement, Mr. Bennett, who is now 22, gave the photograph and its copyright to Ms. Argento, now 42. Three people familiar with the case said the documents were authentic."" The deal was reached by April, according to the Times : It did not include a nondisclosure agreement, meaning Bennett was free to discuss his allegations if he wished, but did stop Bennett from suing Argento or posting his photo of the two of them in bed. Neither Argento nor Bennett have discussed the case with the Times, NPR has reached out to lawyers for both sides, as well as to Argento's agent, without any response. Rose McGowan, an actress and another Weinstein accuser who wrote an open letter on Argento's behalf in June after the death of Argento's partner Anthony Bourdain, tweeted on Monday : ""I got to know Asia Argento ten months ago. Our commonality is the shared pain of being assaulted by Harvey Weinstein. My heart is broken. I will continue my work on behalf of victims everywhere."" ""None of us know the truth of the situation and I'm sure more will be revealed. Be gentle,"" McGowan tweeted a few hours later. The New York Times report contains more details about the allegations against Argento. At the age of 7, the newspaper reports, Bennett was cast as Argento's son in The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, a movie Argento both starred in and directed. The two continued to refer to each other as mother and son in the years that followed. When Bennett was 17, according to the legal documents, he met Argento at her hotel room, where they had sex and she asked him to take photos. Photos on Instagram show the two of them together that day, with Argento calling Bennett ""my son my love."" ""As he was driven home, according to his claim, he began to feel 'extremely confused, mortified, and disgusted,' "" the Times writes. When Bennett later saw Argento speak publicly as a victim of sexual assault, it brought those memories ""to the forefront,"" his lawyer wrote in the notice of intent to sue. The lawyer wrote that the encounter was traumatizing, hindering Bennett's ability to earn money. Bennett had previously filed a lawsuit that accused his mother and stepfather of cheating him out of his earnings as an actor, the Times writes.","Argento has accused disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein of rape.

Curtis M. Wong,"Ward Horton had all but given up on his Broadway aspirations before landing his role in one of this season’s most acclaimed plays, “ Torch Song.” The actor stars alongside Michael Urie and Mercedes Ruehl in the production, a revamped version of Harvey Fierstein’s 1982 gay theatrical milestone, “Torch Song Trilogy,” which opened Nov. 1 at the Hayes Theatre in New York. He plays Ed Reiss, the on-again, off-again lover of sharp-tongued drag performer Arnold Beckoff (Urie). When the first of the show’s three acts begins in 1974, Ed is a closeted schoolteacher who frequents Manhattan gay bars and is aloof to all forms of intimacy. By the last of the three acts, set in 1980, the character has opened himself up to forming a chosen family with a same-sex partner. Growing up in North Carolina, Horton had dreamed of performing in theater. He’d cast his thespian dreams aside for a bit, taking a job in finance after college, but then returned to acting in 2001. He’d been primarily focused on film, with roles in “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Annabelle,” among other movies. Still, he couldn’t stop thinking about the “Torch Song” script, which he received before auditioning for the 2017 off-Broadway production of the show. “Honestly, it came out of nowhere. It wasn’t something I’d read when I was younger,” he said. “But when they sent it to me, I was fascinated by it [and] I knew it was going to be amazing.” Horton spoke to HuffPost about why the acclaimed show’s queer-inclusive themes ahead of their time in 1982 still resonate 36 years later. What challenged you the most about the story? I think, for me, the hardest part was making sure I placed myself in that time period. I struggled a little bit with, “Why does Arnold love Ed the way he does?” Because in 2018, Ed is not lovable. His conflict is so strong and his indecision is so apparent that someone like Arnold wouldn’t give Ed the time of day in 2018. What resonated most with you about the role of Ed? His being unabashedly honest, all the time, to a fault. No matter how conflicted he is, no matter how frustrated his view of the world is or his relationship with Arnold is, he’s always honest. And I think Arnold knows he’s always going to get honesty from him. Ed starts off focused on hiding his sexuality, but by the play’s end, he learns to embrace his authentic self. How did you find your way into that mindset? I needed to understand what it was like to be a closeted gay man during that time period. I read books on Stonewall. I interviewed a friend of mine who is about 55 years old, had a wife and kids and at around 35 or 40, realized he was living a lie. He’s an openly gay man now. Also, I’m working with a predominately gay cast. I learned, I listened, I absorbed and I loved. Arnold may be the protagonist of “Torch Song,” but it’s Ed who undergoes the biggest transformation by the end of the show. One of the things that attracted me to the role is the journey Ed takes. He starts off saying a lot of things that in 2018 seem pretty ignorant and, in some ways, cruel. I’d come off stage some nights and just be wrecked because the audience hated him, and I understood why. I understood how difficult it could be to watch someone resist something that we know that they want. But I found that, by the second act, if I could allow myself to really open up to the situation, this family and who Arnold is because he’s an amazing human being and someone I want to be with I could get back on the audience’s side a little bit. What’s the best advice Harvey Fierstein gave to you? He said, “If you don’t go home completely embarrassed, you’re not doing it right.” What does it mean to you to be presenting this show at such a politically charged time in the world? It’s really exciting and I’m proud to be a part of it. It’s important to tell stories like this. Challenge norms. And, you know, keep people thinking. One of the great things about our play is that it touches everybody. People walk away from our play and think, “I’m not alone.” Everybody has a family good, bad, whatever it is. We all have mothers of some sort, right? We need to make sure were not allowing certain voices to push us down push our communities down. Keep our foot on the pedal and make sure we continue the momentum we have. ""Torch Song"" star Ward Horton What do you think “Torch Song” has to say to a modern audience? I think it says we’ve come a long way, but reminds us how easily we could slip back into particular ways of thinking. The reactions are different than they were 35, 40 years ago. Harvey was able to put something on stage and imagine what the future could be. People went to the theater and they saw the future. They saw a family, a gay man who adopts a gay son and [together] they live life like a traditional family. And now it doesn’t seem so crazy, does it? I think that’s the importance of a play like this. It feels like, in the past couple of years, we’ve taken a step back, and I think that shows we need to fight harder. We need to make sure we’re not allowing certain voices to push us down push our communities down. Keep our foot on the pedal and make sure we continue the momentum we have. What would you say to an audience member who told you that he or she didn’t support marriage equality and other LGBTQ rights? I would give them a hug. I would hug them and thank them. Because for someone with opposing views to come to our play, it shows they’re making an effort. I feel like that’s what we need right now. And, after watching our play and having the views they have, they would definitely need a hug!

The city's top detective said it's now up to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance to move forward. Investigators have been working with multiple women who alleged that Weinstein raped them. NEW YORK (AP) — New York City's top detective said Wednesday police have gathered considerable evidence in the rape investigation of Harvey Weinstein but it's up to the district attorney to decide whether the disgraced media mogul gets indicted. ""It's his case right now,"" Chief Robert Boyce said of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, Jr. ""I would ask you to ask him... his schedule... where it goes forward."" The district attorney's office had no comment. Boyce said investigators have been working diligently with women who alleged Weinstein raped them. The probe stems from a report in October by ""Boardwalk Empire"" actress Paz de la Huerta, who said she Weinstein raped her twice in 2010. She also spoke publicly. This photo from Wednesday, Nov. 23, 2011 shows film producer Harvey Weinstein in New York. Associated Press/John Carucci Detectives have since traveled to Paris and Los Angeles to interview de la Huerta and others. They have sought cellphone, business and medical records. Witnesses were prepared to testify before a grand jury, which would determine whether Weinstein is indicted, Boyce said. The proceeding is secret. ""We've accumulated quite a bit of evidence,"" Boyce said. Prosecutors have said they are taking the investigation seriously. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office is reviewing five cases against Weinstein, two brought by the Beverly Hills Police Department and three from Los Angeles police. Weinstein's attorneys have said he denies any claim of non-consensual sex, and that they would respond in any ""appropriate legal forum, where necessary."" They had no additional comment Wednesday. The Manhattan District Attorney's office has investigated Weinstein before, only to eventually back off of filing a criminal charge. In 2015, police conducted a sting after an Italian model accused Weinstein of groping her, secretly recording Weinstein apologizing for this conduct. Vance ultimately decided there wasn't enough proof and didn't bring a case. Following criticism over the decision last year, prosecutors said police arranged the sting without their knowledge and there were other proof issues, but police pushed back saying they'd presented enough evidence. The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they speak publicly, which de la Huerta has done. ___ Associated Press Writer Michael Balsamo in Los Angeles contributed to this report.","Thomson Reuters The New York City Police Department says they've gathered ""quite a bit of evidence"" in the rape investigation of disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.

JOE COSCARELLI,"Last year, a judge ruled that Mr. Cosby could pursue a lawsuit against Ms. Constand based on two Twitter posts she wrote in 2014.

Larry Neumeister / AP,"(NEW YORK) — A second judge ruled Monday that a human trafficking law can be used in a civil lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein.
U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer in Manhattan made the finding as he let former Weinstein consultant Alexandra Canosa’s lawsuit proceed against Weinstein and two of his companies.
In her 2017 lawsuit, Canosa alleged that Weinstein on multiple occasions from 2010 to 2017 raped, sexually abused, intimidated and harassed her during what he maintained were business meetings in New York, Los Angeles, Malaysia and Budapest.
Canosa, a producer on Netflix’s “Marco Polo,” sought unspecified damages, saying Weinstein threatened she’d lose her job and he’d blackball her in the entertainment industry if she rejected sexual advances.
Engelmayer said Carnosa had “plausibly alleged” that Weinstein knowingly enticed or recruited her knowing he would use force or fraud to cause her to engage in a commercial sex act. Her lawsuit alleged that she expected and received career advances after coerced sexual activity.
The judge rejected arguments by Weinstein’s companies that the sex trafficking law was inappropriate because the lawsuit’s allegations were not the kind that the law was passed to address.
He wrote that arguments that the law was designed to “reach only caricatures of child slavery, and to exclude corporate-supported conduct, is wholly unpersuasive.”
Engelmayer said such arguments were a “self-serving distinction.”
“That the TWC Companies, as alleged, enticed Canosa to meet with Weinstein through the promise of production deals rather than the promise of crack, does not remove their conduct from the ambit of the statute,” he said. “Nor does the fact that, as alleged, the companies enabled Weinstein to force sexual acts on Canosa in expensive hotels rather than brothels.”
Weinstein’s lawyer Elior Shiloh said the judge erred in letting the human trafficking claim proceed and defense lawyers believe they will defeat the claim as the case proceeds.
Shiloh also said Canosa’s email communications “completely undermine the allegations.”
He said Canosa and her lawyers have asked that the email communications be kept under seal.
“They don’t want the truth to come out because it’ll ruin the whole case,” Shiloh said.
In his ruling, Engelmayer said he agreed with the reasoning of Judge Robert W. Sweet, who ruled last year in another civil lawsuit against Weinstein that the sex trafficking law was appropriately used.
“He is correct,” Engelmayer said of Sweet.
Scores of women have accused the movie mogul of sexual misconduct. He has denied non-consensual sex allegations.
In Monday’s ruling, Engelmayer also dismissed as defendants Weinstein’s brother and the directors of the Weinstein companies.

MICHAEL R. SISAK / AP,"(NEW YORK) — Harvey Weinstein’s high-profile criminal defense lawyer is leaving the movie producer’s rape case weeks after failing to get the charges dismissed.
Benjamin Brafman filed court papers on Thursday asking to withdraw as Weinstein’s lawyer. The filing came after a week of speculation about his involvement in the case.
A judge must still approve the move.
Weinstein and Brafman said in a joint statement that their split was amicable.
Brafman has advocated for Weinstein in and out of the courtroom.
He won a victory in October when prosecutors dropped part of the case after evidence surfaced that a police detective had coached a witness.
But he was disappointed last month when a judge rejected his push to throw out the rest of the case.
Weinstein’s trial is tentatively scheduled for May.

Reuters,"Harvey Weinstein. REUTERS/Steve Crisp US film and TV studio The Weinstein Company has filed for bankruptcy. The company, cofounded by Harvey Weinstein who dozens of women have accused of varying degree of sexual misconduct, says it has a stalking horse bid for its assets from the private equity firm Lantern Capital. The filing comes on the same day that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered the state attorney general to investigate how the Manhattan district attorney handled allegations against Weinstein. NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. film and TV studio The Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy in Delaware on Monday night. The Dallas-based private equity firm Lantern Capital has made a stalking horse bid for the firm, a person familiar with the matter said. An investor group led by former Obama administration official Maria Contreras-Sweet terminated its offer for the company earlier this month. The bid from Lantern will set the floor for higher and better offers for the studio in a bankruptcy court-supervised auction, added the person. The Weinstein Company has been looking for a buyer since its ex-chairman Harvey Weinsteinwas accused of sexual misconduct, including rape, by more than 70 women. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Spokespeople for The Weinstein Company and Lantern Capital did not immediately return calls for comment. The source could not be identified because the person was not authorized to speak to the media. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a lawsuit against the company and Bob and Harvey Weinstein last month, alleging that Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed employees and the company failed to respond. Bob Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein's brother, co-founded the company and is co-chairman. The lawsuit complicated negotiations for Contreras-Sweet's deal. New York Gov.

Matt Mayberry,"Being an entrepreneur and starting your own business can be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life, but also one of the most challenging and complicated ones. Certainly, entrepreneurship is not for the faint of heart. Related: How Businesses, Including Apple and Amazon, Are Helping Victims of Hurricane Harvey, and How You Can Too There will be days, especially in the beginning, when you'll feel like throwing in the towel and simply calling it quits. You will continually get punched in the mouth; you will frequently question whether you have what it takes; and you will likely watch as family and friends lose their faith in you, letting you know in no uncertain terms that they think you are crazy. But despite all this, I believe that if you can weather the storms and move forward amid the adversity crossing your path, you'll be in a much better position to win and come out victorious. Regardless of your journey, it's imperative that to be a successful entrepreneur, you'll have to overcome adversity and learn how to thrive in times of uncertainty. When the going gets incredibly tough, that's when you become that much closer to creating transformational breakthroughs. It's in the struggle that amazing breakthroughs are to be found, waiting to erupt. Given this theme of adversity, I recently sat down with Lorenzo Marquez, former vice president of marketing for Cosentino and now the founder and president of Marqet Group, a full-service marketing agency servicing the design and construction industry and stone fabrication in particular. Marquez not only made the jump into entrepreneurship and successfully started his own business, he also overcame an astounding number of hardships and setbacks throughout his journey when the unthinkable happened. Houston-based Marqet Group was growing in exposure, client base, team members and -- most important -- revenue, he told me. ""All of those start-up fears started fading away,"" he said. Related: When Hurricanes Harvey and Irma Struck, This App Hit the Top of the Charts. Here's What Its CEO Has Learned. The team had expanded to ten people in just five months, including graphic and web designers, account managers, copywriters and event and merchandising coordinators. ""Things were going the way any aspiring entrepreneur would dream of,"" Marquez said. Then, the night of August 26, 2017, happened. As Marquez told me, "" Hurricane Harvey hit the Texas Gulf Coast and completely shattered every sense of security, not only business wise, but also personally as well."" The next morning, he and his wife and their five children, with the youngest being only three months, plus their dog, had to be evacuated by boat to an apartment complex nearby with very minimal food and water available. The food and water that was available had to be shared by all of the families evacuated from nearby homes. The children were terrified, and, Marquez said, he began to let doubt win the battle in his mind. ""My sense of stability and security was shaken to the core,"" Marquez said. ""The fear of losing everything had now become a reality."" He and his family experienced the complete loss of their home, belongings, and cars. ""Everything was swept away, as our home sat with 5 inches of water inside for close to two weeks."" Marquez knew that he had to stay strong for his children. Not only was his family counting on him; so were his team members at work. With his back against the wall, Marquez made sure his family was safe, then turned to his employees and clients. Things were bad there too: His office building was flooded for weeks and employees were scattered, trying to deal with their own losses. But Marquez refused to put his business on the back burner. Facing the hardest time of his life, Marquez was able to regrow his business and achieve extraordinary heights. Here are three things that Marquez said he executed on to turn an extreme tragedy into an incredible breakthrough while at the same time growing a majorly successful business. These are three actionable ideas and strategies that you can implement into your own life and business to help you turn failure and adversity into a gift. 1. Feel the fear; then take action. Fear is real and will always be present in your life as an entrepreneur. If you don't ever experience fear, that means you aren't consistently stepping out of your comfort zone and going after your biggest goals and dreams. Where many people go wrong has nothing to do with fear itself, but with how they react to the fear. As Marquez told me, ""Fear attacked me when I first wanted to start my own business; then it tried to completely take over my life when Hurricane Harvey hit. I was more scared than I have ever been in my life, but I also knew that this major adversity carried a monumental opportunity along with it."" Marquez's message is, the next time you feel a lot of fear, don't fight it. Acknowledge that it's there and then take action. The best way to fight your fears is to use consistent and massive action, even if you feel lthat you aren't ready to do that. Marquez told me, ""Looking back on that horrific experience, I can honestly say that the most beneficial thing that I did for both my family and business was to develop the courage to take action despite all the fear that was attacking me."" In other words, breakthroughs occur when you look your fears straight on and develop the courage to take action. Here are two exercises that have greatly helped me overcome my fears and not let them paralyze me from moving forward. 2. Create a crystal-clear vision. Vision is everything. If you can't see yourself achieving it, it will never happen. Not only that, but creating a crystal-clear vision is critical in being able to overcome the short-term disappointments. Marquez told me: ""There is no way that my business would have survived if it wasn't for the clear and massive vision that I created. Every single time I felt like quitting, I pictured my family happy and safe while my business was thriving and serving the community."" Whether it's overcoming a personal tragedy as Marquez had to do, or moving forward despite the hardships you encounter in entrepreneurship, a clear vision is the starting point for all high success. If you haven't done so already, visualize what your ideal business and life looks like this week. Write that vision down, share it with others, then work the vision every waking moment. There is nothing more powerful than getting clear on what you want your life and business to stand for, then making that that a reality. 3. Develop a strong and positive support system. Building a business can often be a lonely experience, especially in the early stages. Marquez told me, ""I never knew how important a strong and positive support system truly was until my family and I were being rescued by boat when we lost our home. ""As the days and weeks went on, it was the support system that I had developed over the years that ultimately kept me going."" He continued: ""It was everyone, from friends and family to customers, who were constantly in my ear reminding me how powerful I am and that my family would without a doubt overcome this tragedy. They really helped me to believe that this negative experience would somehow turn into a positive."" Marquez is a perfect example of how critical a support system is for entrepreneurs. Not only is building your business daunting and challenging, but that happens amid the hard times of life that also unexpectedly pop up. The School of Social Work at the University at Buffalo has expressed ideas on why a strong support system is so important and how to cultivate one. Something that has worked exceptionally well for me, personally, is to try to pick one specific support person for each area of my life. I have people to whom I can turn when it comes to business, health, relationships and spiritual support. The story of Marquez and his family overcoming devastating loss in the face of Hurricane Harvey is just one example of thousands of brave Houstonians who exemplified what true courage and strength look like. Theirs was an example that we as entrepreneurs can all learn from. What impressed me the most about Marquez's story is that he didn't stop growing his business even when he and his family lost absolutely everything they owned. That's the type of obsession, perseverance and courage it takes to achieve greatness as an entrepreneur. How has life changed for the Marqet Group since the hurricane? The business just moved into a new 3,000-square-foot office, continues to grow its team and has seen its revenue hit a record high.

Rebecca Ruiz,"Gemma Serrano, a 19-year-old college student, took notice last fall as female celebrities accused Harvey Weinstein of being a serial sexual predator. She paid attention when Reese Witherspoon recounted being sexually assaulted by a director at 16 years old. She watched intently as young women recently lined up, one after the other, to give searing personal statements at the sentencing hearing of former U.S.A. Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar. Serrano noticed, perhaps more than other teens, because she shared something in common with the women in the news: A man she once trusted abused her, too. SEE ALSO: 10 books to read during the #MeToo era Serrano reported that abuse, which occurred when she was a child, to a school psychologist, who then informed authorities. From ages 13 to 17, Serrano attended Camp HOPE America, a program for traumatized children created by Alliance for HOPE International, a San Diego-based nonprofit that aids survivors of domestic violence, child abuse, elder abuse, sexual abuse, and human trafficking. Serrano went on to intern with the organization for two years, but she'd never publicly identified herself as a survivor until one day in mid-October when she used social media to declare ""#MeToo."" ""I feel... almost a sense of liberation. If they can do it, then I can do it as well."" ""I feel... almost a sense of liberation,"" she says. ""It was [once] a topic you shouldn't be speaking about. Seeing [the older generation] come out and talk about their experiences — if they can do it, then I can do it as well."" While the #MeToo movement often feels like an adult conversation about the assault that grown women (and men) endure, particularly in the workplace, it's clear that many children and young people are listening. The stories they hear on social media, through television, in school, and in conversations around their own dinner tables can feel empowering. Those stories can also traumatize, especially when young people feel they have no means to stop abuse or report it. Historically, 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys were victims of child sexual abuse by age 18. While that abuse has declined significantly over the past few decades, thanks in part to improved prevention, detection, and intervention efforts, 10 percent of all American children will still become victims of sexual violence by the time they reach adulthood. The perpetrator is most often someone in their social circle, a biological or nonbiological parent, or someone known to the child's family. If you or someone you know has been affected by incest, you can contact @RAINN for confidential, safe support at 1-800-656-4673. #SVU — Joyful Heart (@TheJHF) March 22, 2018 While the taboo of discussing child sexual abuse still persists, Casey Gwinn, president of Alliance for HOPE International, says #MeToo marks a tipping point he's never witnessed in his decades-long career advocating for survivors of sexual violence. In the last year, Gwinn says campers and kids involved with Alliance for HOPE International have been increasingly interested in discussing their most painful experiences, their candor growing rapidly in the wake of #MeToo. ""I do think there is a cultural shift that is happening,"" he says. ""The more [young people] see high-profile people, or the victims of Nassar, or Olympians and celebrities talking about sexual harassment and assault, I do think it is creating a platform — almost an invitation for kids to be more open about what they've experienced."" ""I do think it is creating a platform — almost an invitation for kids to be more open about what they've experienced."" Gwinn says his staff has adapted its Camp HOPE America program, which is offered in 15 states to children between the ages of seven and 17. The weeklong retreat is designed to make kids ""feel safe, seen, encouraged, and loved,"" and uses curriculum to help foster their self-confidence. Counselors are receiving additional training so they're better prepared to respond to campers who want to discuss sexual violence and others types of trauma they've endured. In previous years, campers usually stayed silent about those experiences, focusing instead on activities like rock climbing, creative arts, campfire sing-alongs, and discussions about resilience and empowerment. Chris Newlin, executive director of the National Children's Advocacy Center, a nonprofit organization that trains law enforcement and child abuse professionals to prevent and respond to maltreatment with a coordinated approach, says that one teenager cited the Nassar case when she recently reported sexual abuse to the center's forensic interview specialist. ""If they can talk about this, then so can I,” she said, referring to the young survivors of Nassar's abuse. Yet Newlin is skeptical of #MeToo's impact on children. He associates the movement with efforts to stop workplace harassment and assault, as well as the Time's Up campaign, which is focused on securing equal representation for women in American life. Newlin believes it's impossible to attribute a single cause to trends in the detection or reduction of child sexual abuse. Kids, he says, are constantly flooded with media, including the news, movies, and television shows, that might prompt them to reflect on and disclose their own trauma. What they see could be related to #MeToo, but it might have no relationship to the movement. Either way, Newlin welcomes the public conversation about sexual violence. His chief concern is making sure that children who do report abuse aren't re-traumatized by their experiences with law enforcement and frontline professionals. He's also passionate about helping young people understand and come to terms with their experiences, rather than feeling defined by them for a lifetime. ""There is hope in moving forward,"" Newlin says. ""I would want [survivors] to know that they're not alone. While they may feel alone, there are lots and lots of people who have gone through that."" Staffers for the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN) hotline have seen signs of a shift among young people in the past six months. By January, overall usage of the hotline had risen nearly 50 percent compared to the previous January. The number of kids contacting the hotline similarly increased by 45 percent during the same timeframe, and by mid-February, Larry Nassar's name overcame Bill Cosby's to become the most cited name in the hotline's history. ""There's a greater understanding that it's OK to ask for help."" ""One of the big evolutions we've seen, particularly in the wake of #MeToo, is a greater belief that if you come forward and talk about what happened, you'll be believed,"" says Scott Berkowitz, founder and president of RAINN. ""That kind of message has trickled down to kids. There's a greater understanding that it's OK to ask for help."" For children, seeking such help may begin with contacting a hotline, or confiding in a friend or trusted adult. Many professionals, such as hotline staff, school counselors, and physicians, are mandated by the government to report suspicion or evidence of child abuse to law enforcement or child protective services. When the subject comes up on the RAINN hotline, whose staff is mandated by state law to report the abuse of a minor when given detailed information, many young people try to work through their options, weighing the perceived or real risk of involving the authorities against trying to stop the person abusing them. They may fear being removed from their home and placed in foster care, being blamed by others for the arrest of the family's breadwinner, or making an accusation that's not taken seriously and having no means to escape their abuser. A survivor may or may not want to involve the criminal justice system. Working with law enforcement can sometimes be threatening or harmful, &amp; sometimes survivors aren't ready for that. #SupportSurvivors pic.twitter.com/mgZWG2tq8H — National Sexual Violence Resource Center (@NSVRC) March 16, 2018 While these unique concerns aren't reflected in the broader conversation about #MeToo, children may silently agonize over them while reading and hearing about the movement — and there are few places for them to share that burden with others. Serrano is trying to provide such an outlet for a small group of teens that she mentors through the Alliance for HOPE program. She says that prior to #MeToo, their conversations were casual and meant to be fun. Participants rarely discussed what they'd endured. That began to change last fall. Of the 10 teens she mentors, a few of them started talking about their traumatic experiences. Now Serrano listens and comforts as they express feelings of empowerment and grief. ""In the end, it was never their fault."" ""I think what I hope for young people to get out of [#MeToo] is to be able to talk about their situation in an environment where nobody is judging them, and maybe even become community leaders,"" she says. ""I would tell them not to be afraid,"" Serrano adds, addressing young survivors who are grappling with their abuse in the age of #MeToo. ""In the end, it was never their fault.""

VANESSA FRIEDMAN,"It was always going to be a loaded Pirelli year. After all, the pinup calendar (“the cal”) that made its name by framing soft-core skin shots in the aura of artistic expression and exclusivity has been engaged in something of a four-year effort to recast itself, after 50 years, as an socially conscious photographic statement. It began in 2015, when Annie Leibovitz was called in to rethink the 2016 edition and decided to cast an assortment of high-achieving women, including Ava DuVernay and Agnes Gund, in almost entirely clothed portraits to reflect the rise of the “shero.” That was followed by a calendar featuring Peter Lindbergh’s portraits of celebrities of all ages, including Helen Mirren, then 71, in their full, un-airbrushed, truth-in-appearance glory. Tim Walker photographed the next one, reimagining “Alice in Wonderland” with an entirely African-American cast, as styled by Edward Enninful, the first African-American editor of British Vogue. And then Harvey Weinstein happened, and then #MeToo happened, and then there were more women running for office in the United States than ever before, and then it was impossible not to wonder what Pirelli would do next.",The photographer Albert Watson and Gigi Hadid at the 2019 Pirelli calendar shoot.,2018-07-26T07:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Unbuttoned: The Pirelli Calendar Finally Makes Women Subjects Instead of Objects,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/style/pirelli-calendar-albert-watson-misty-copeland.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/26/style/26unbuttoned1/26unbuttoned1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Harvey,0
CATIE EDMONDSON and MARC TRACY,"Mr. Rodriguez recalled watching the news with his 13-year-old daughter last fall when the TV program did a segment on Harvey Weinstein’s sexual misconduct and the broader moment of reckoning it had spawned. “Oh my God — I have one of those,” Mr. Rodriguez told his daughter. “I have a ‘hashtag MeToo.’” David Mulvin, the captain of the wrestling team in 1978, remembered opening up a local paper and reading that other men had come forward to name Dr. Strauss as their abuser. “My jaw dropped,” he recalled. “I said, ‘So I didn’t do anything wrong.’” He said he had been masturbated by Dr. Strauss for nearly 20 minutes after seeking treatment for a fungal infection caused by a genital burn from his wrestling gear. Like Mr. Mulvin, some victims harbored shame and guilt for “leading on” Dr. Strauss, who killed himself in 2005, with the obvious physical response to abuse that female victims could not display, Mr. Nutter explained. “People felt guilty,” he said of teammates he has spoken to. “I guess they feel like an erection is an agreement. It’s saying, ‘This is something I like.’” Over drinks at a dive bar here, or seated in the corner of a deli, one weekend last month, the wrestlers reminisced and poked fun at their own reactions to the episodes, roaring with laughter.

Brendan Pierson,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Movie producer Harvey Weinstein’s lawyers asked a New York judge on Friday to dismiss rape and sexual assault charges against him, releasing emails between one of his accusers and Weinstein they said were not shown to the grand jury that indicted him. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone following accusations by more than 70 women, mostly young actresses and other women employed in the movie business, of sexual misconduct, including rape, dating back decades. In a motion filed in New York state court in Manhattan, Weinstein’s lawyers said the emails showed “a long-term, consensual, intimate relationship” between Weinstein and an unnamed woman who has accused him of raping her in 2013. Weinstein’s lawyers said they meant “not to ignore that rape can occur in relationships,” but that prosecutors should have shown the grand jurors the emails in order for them to make an “informed decision.” The woman and Weinstein communicated over a four-year period after the date she said he raped her, Weinstein’s lawyers said. A lawyer or representative for the woman was not immediately known to request comment on the motion. A spokesman for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, who is prosecuting the case, declined to comment on the motion. The case against Weinstein in Manhattan involves three women. Weinstein, 66, has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges and is free on $1 million bail. Weinstein lawyer Benjamin Brafman said in a statement that the motions “reveal the existence of exculpatory evidence.” The accusations against Weinstein led to the #MeToo movement in which hundreds of women publicly accuse powerful men in business, politics and entertainment of sexual harassment and abuse. Weinstein’s lawyers said charges against Weinstein in New York involving two other women were flawed and must be dismissed as well. One involves a former actress who said Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him in 2004. The other is a former production assistant who said he performed oral sex on her against her will in 2006. Weinstein’s lawyers said the charges relating to the former actress failed to provide enough detail because they did not say exactly when the assault happened, instead giving a three-month range. Prosecutors failed to give Weinstein adequate advance notice that they were presenting the “far more serious charges” to the grand jury of the allegation from 2006, his lawyers said. The former production assistant’s lawyer, Gloria Allred, said in response to Weinstein’s motion to dismiss that the grand jury “would not have indicted him if they did not find the testimony that they heard credible.” A lawyer or representative for the former actress was not immediately known to request comment. As accusations against Weinstein mounted, his company Weinstein Co fired him and filed for bankruptcy, and he was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Through his company and Miramax, Weinstein won plaudits and awards for movies including “Shakespeare in Love,” “Pulp Fiction” and “The King’s Speech.” Reporting By Brendan Pierson in New York; editing by Grant McCool","Movie producer Harvey Weinstein's lawyers asked a New York judge on Friday to dismiss rape and sexual assault charges against him, releasing emails between one of his accusers and Weinstein they said were not shown to the grand jury that indicted him.",2018-08-03T19:06:47Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Movie producer Weinstein seeks to dismiss sex charges based on emails,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-harvey-weinstein/movie-producer-weinstein-seeks-to-dismiss-sex-charges-based-on-emails-idUSKBN1KO2GG,https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180803&t=2&i=1289926794&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEE721F0,reuters,Reuters,Harvey,0
Tyler McCarthy,"Actress Asia Argento, one of the more prominent voices to accuse now-disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, was accused by child star Jimmy Bennett of setting up a sexual encounter with him in California when he was 17 – below the age of consent in that state – and she was 37. Argento had worked with Bennett 10 years earlier on the 2004 film “The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things” when he was 7 years old. He played the son of Argento’s character and the two reportedly remained close after the movie finished. In public social media posts over the years, they were known to refer to each other as variations of “mom” and “son.” Actor and musician Jimmy Bennett was revealed to have been paid money over an accusation of assault from Asia Argento. (GettyImages) The New York Times reported, citing court documents, that the actress and former girlfriend of the late Anthony Bourdain paid roughly $380,000 to Bennett after he confronted her regarding an alleged sexual encounter that took place in 2013 in a California hotel room. The legal age of consent in California is 18. Fox News does not normally name alleged victims of sexual assaults, but in this case a basic description of the facts makes Bennett easily identifiable. In the documents, Bennett sought to sue Argento for an alleged May 9, 2013 encounter at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Marina del Rey, Calif. Bennett arrived with a family member but Argento reportedly sent them away so she could be alone with him. At that time, Bennett alleges that she showed him notes she had previously written to him and gave him alcohol. She then reportedly kissed him, pushed him back on the bed, performed oral sex on him and then the two had intercourse. The documents also came with photos, reportedly taken by Bennett, of the two in bed together at the time. Jimmy Bennet in the 2004 film ""The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things."" (Palm Pictures) On the day of the alleged assault, the Italian actress posted a series of photos on Instagram of the two of them together. The first of which was captioned, “Waiting for my long lost son my love @jimmymbennett in trepidation #Marinadelrey smoking cigarettes like there was no next week.” Bennett himself responded, “I’m almost there! :)” Asia Argento starred alongside Jimmy Bennett when he was 7 years old. (Palm Pictures) Later in the day, Argento posted photos of the two of them together. In one caption she says it was the “happiest day of my life reunion with @jimmymbennett xox.” Another reads, ""My son my love until I will live."" Bennett sent Argento a Twitter message a month later in June that read, “Miss you momma!!!!” Bennett’s lawyers filed the paperwork in November 2017, just a month after Argento was quoted in the bombshell New Yorker article that outed Harvey Weinstein as a serial sexual predator to women in Hollywood. She accused the movie mogul of rape, but Weinstein has denied all accusations of non-consensual sex. In the court documents, Bennett reportedly says that the experience hindered his acting career. He got his start in the 2003 movie “Daddy Day Care” and may be recognizable to some as young James T. Kirk in the 2009 “Star Trek” film.

Sasha Savitsky,"NBC News let a Pulitzer Prize-winning story slip away because honchos at the Peacock network didn't want it to see the light of day, a former NBC News producer told the Daily Beast. In the website's bombshell report Thursday, NBC News producer Rich McHugh, who was working with Ronan Farrow on the reporter's investigation of alleged sexual misconduct by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, claimed that an order to stop pursuing the scathing story came from ""the very highest levels at NBC."" McHugh, who left the network's investigative unit earlier this month, told Fox News the order came as he and Farrow were preparing to travel to Los Angeles to interview a woman ""with a credible allegation of rape"" against the now-disgraced movie producer. ""I was told not to do the interview and ordered to stand down, thus effectively killing the story,"" McHugh said. ""That was unethical, and a massive breach of journalistic integrity. ""Is there anyone in the journalistic community who actually believes NBC didn’t breach its journalistic duty to continue reporting this story?"" McHugh added. ""Something else must have been going on."" The network told Fox News in a statement Thursday, ""The assertion that NBC News tried to kill the Weinstein story while Ronan Farrow was at NBC News, or even more ludicrously after he left NBC News, is an outright lie."" But according to The Daily Beast, it was NBC News president Noah Oppenheim who made the decision to nix Farrow's piece. The exec reportedly didn’t want to upset a Hollywood powerhouse such as Weinstein when he had ambitions of returning to the movie industry. Farrow and McHugh reportedly pitched the story investigating Hollywood's notorious ""casting couch"" practices in January 2017. The story originally was meant to air around that year's Oscars, which wouldn't have been good for the Hollywood-friendly Oppenheim, the screenwriter of several films including ""Jackie,"" ""The Maze Runner,"" and the first installment of the ""Divergent"" series. Insiders told Fox News at the time that NBC executives may have been wary of ruining relationships in Hollywood, and brittle from years of bad publicity and tabloid covers about its own stars’ behavior and personal lives. (L-R) Natalie Portman, Noah Oppenheim and Darren Aronofsky attend a panel discussion following the Official Academy Screening of ""Jackie,"" hosted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences at MOMA on November 29, 2016 in New York City. (Rob Kim/Stringer via Getty) NBC denies these issues had anything to do with their decision to kill the Weinstein story. But the network has been scrambling to give a credible explanation for why they sat on an explosive audiotape of a powerful man behaving badly. It's not just Oppenheim who has connections to the disgraced accused rapist. Back in 2013, Weinstein attended an Obama event at the Martha’s Vineyard home of Comcast CEO Brian Roberts. The Weinstein Company has had TV programs on NBC Universal stations, and Weinstein reportedly begged NBC Universal executive Ron Meyer for support when the harassment allegations began to surface. Additionally, Oppenheim’s boss, powerful NBC News Chairman Andy Lack, has allowed his subordinate to take heat for quashing the Weinstein story. Oppenheim’s role at NBC is far smaller than that of his counterparts at other networks since so much of NBC’s news operation reports directly to Lack. “He doesn’t do much other than spiking stories,” said an NBC News insider of Oppenheim. Andrew Lack is NBC's President and Chief Operating Officer. He has come under fire for his reported role in squashing Ronan Farrow's Harvey Weinstein expose. Farrow ultimately won a Pulitzer Prize for his reports on sexual misconduct by Weinstein and other powerful men, which ultimately saw the light of day as a series of articles in The New Yorker. Ironically, Farrow would not have won journalism's most coveted prize had NBC run his expose, as broadcast networks are not eligible for the Pulitzer. Farrow left NBC months ago.

RON NIXON,"WASHINGTON — Adm. Karl L. Schultz was named the 26th commandant of the Coast Guard on Friday, taking over a military service that is in the midst of a fleet modernization as it juggles homeland security priorities like intercepting drugs and migrants and responding to disasters. President Trump attended Admiral Schultz’s change of command ceremony, held on the first day of the annual hurricane season. “I envision our heading remaining generally steady,” Admiral Schultz said. It was a compliment to his predecessor Adm. Paul F. Zukunft, who had directed the fleet modernizing effort and steered the first budget increase in years to the Coast Guard, the 227-year-old military branch that is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security. Admiral Schultz had commanded the Coast Guard’s Atlantic area and last year oversaw the fleet’s response to Hurricanes Irma, Maria and Harvey. The service rescued nearly 12,000 people along the East Coast and in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands during the deadly 2017 hurricane season.",Adm. Karl L.

Kelly McLaughlin,"Harvey Weinstein arrives at the 1st Precinct in Manhattan in New York on May 25, 2018. Reuters Disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was quoted saying that he offered acting jobs in exchange for sex in an explosive interview that has since been retracted by The Spectator, a British magazine. In a story published on Friday, Weinstein discussed the sexual assault allegations against him with columnist Taki Theodoracopulus. He was quoted saying: ""You were born rich and privileged and you were handsome. I was born poor, ugly, Jewish and had to fight all my life to get somewhere."" ""You got lotsa girls, no girl looked at me until I made it big in Hollywood. Yes, I did offer them acting jobs in exchange for sex, but so did and still does everyone. But I never, ever forced myself on a single woman."" His quoted comments provoked a strong reaction among women who have accused him of sexual assault. Rose McGowan, who has alleged she was raped by Weinstein in 1997, slammed Theodoracopulos's column, saying the movie mogul's comments were ""clearly lies."" Asia Argento, who has also alleged Weinstein raped her, spoke out against the column, calling Weinstein a ""monster rapist."" Weinstein is facing life in prison over multiple charges of rape and sexual assault. He is out on $1 million bail and is due back in court in New York in September. His lawyer has said he has ""never engaged in non-consensual sexual behavior with anyone."" In the column, which was the first quoted interview of Weinstein since criminal charges against him arose, Theodoracopulos says he and the former Hollywood tycoon spoke at a New York office near Grand Central Station. Theodoracopulos said Weinstein's lawyer, Ben Brafman, was present at the time of their chat. Shortly after the column was published on The Spectator, Brafman said Weinstein was misquoted and that the pair had met for a ""social meeting."" ""I was present for the conversation; it was not an interview, but a social meeting between old friends,"" Benjamin Brafman said in a statement to Deadline. He added: ""Harvey and Taki did not discuss the case, nor would I allow him to. We talked about old Hollywood and the contrast to European culture, and I think Taki sees Harvey in that older light. ""Mr. Weinstein never said anything about trading movie roles for sexual favors. You have my word that Harvey did not say that,"" he said. Theodoracopulos, who initially called the interview a ""world exclusive,"" later retracted the interview, saying he ""may have misrepresented Harvey Weinstein's conversation."" He said: ""After 41 years as a Spectator columnist without a single retraction, I believe that I may have misrepresented Harvey Weinstein's conversation with me in New York last month. It was my mistake."" ""We were discussing Hollywood and I may have misunderstood certain things about the methods of that place,"" he added. ""I had nothing to do with the headline of my article and I hope I have not damaged his case.

Andrew Liptak,"CBS CEO and chairman Les Moonves will soon step down from his post following a new report from Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker, which brings new allegations of sexual misconduct, reports CNN. At the end of July, Farrow published a lengthy investigation in The New Yorker detailing allegation that Moonves fostered a workplace where sexual harassment was tolerated, and forcibly kissed and propositioned 6 women and threatened to retaliate when they resisted. At the time, Moonves said that had made “some women uncomfortable,” but denied allegations of deliberately harming careers. Following the publication of the report, CBS opened an investigation into the allegations, but allowed Moonves to stay onboard while it took place. Prosecutors in LA haven’t charged Moonves, saying that the statute of limitations on the allegations have since expired. Reports of negotiations over an exit package for Moonves circulated in the last week. CNN cites a pair of executives who say that a settlement for Moonves’ exit is in its final stages, and that the executive will resign on Monday morning, prior to the end of the investigation. Deadline reports that the $100 million payout that was rumored earlier this week is now off the table, and that the board is looking to fire Moonves “for cause, which changes everything.” Six additional women have come forward with new allegations This weekend, Farrow — who earned a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the sexual assault and harassment from Harvey Weinstein — published a new report that outlines additional accusations against Moonves. Six additional women have come forward, alleging “sexual harassment or assault in incidents that took place between the nineteen-eighties and the early aughts.” He details incidents in which Mooves is alleged to have exposed himself to women, forced them to perform oral sex on him, and “used physical violence and intimidation against them.” Another woman raised a new complaint against 60 Minutes executive producer Jeff Fager. In a statement to The New Yorker, Moonves says that some of the encounters happened, but that they were consensual, while CBS reaffirmed its commitment to its investigation.

Julia Naftulin,"The opioid crisis is still on the rise. In 2017, 2.1 million Americans dealt with opioid addiction, which includes drugs like prescription painkillers and heroin, according to the US Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS). 
 Sometimes opioid addicts will even share needles with each other to fuel their addictions, but former drug user Jesse Harvey started what he calls the ""Church of Safe Injection"" to give drug users access to clean needles, the Huffington Post reported. 
 While it may seem backwards to help drug addicts continue to use, the 26-year-old's concept has research-backed benefits. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the exchange of used needles has lead to the spread of HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. In response to this spread, 16 US states have allowed for the legal exchange of syringes and needles, hoping to decrease blood-borne disease rates. 
Harvey's service is unorthodox, but it does offer a way for people with drug addiction to stay safe and seek the treatment option that works for them.
 Spencer Platt/Getty Images 
To further help drug addicts, especially those who have been shunned from religious institutions for their substance abuse, Harvey opened his own clean needle exchange in the back of his Honda in Portland, Maine. The exchange, which he dubbed the ""Church of Safe Injection,"" is fueled by the belief that ""people who use drugs don't deserve to die,"" Harvey said in an op-ed he wrote in the Maine Press Herald. 
 When a person is addicted to opioids, they will stop at nothing to get their fix and might even use unsanitary needles that could spread diseases like HIV. In fact, when the CDC interviewed 112 people who contracted HIV in 2017, they discovered 96% of them had injected themselves with drugs using shared needles, INSIDER previously reported. Harvey knows of this trend firsthand, so he opened his needle exchange program to keep drug addicts as safe as possible. 
 In Maine, however, Harvey's service isn't allowed: Anyone who possesses more than 10 syringes at a time without a state-issued license is breaking the law, Huffington Post reported. 
 The Church of Safe Injection certainly houses more than 10 syringes. In fact, 18 branches of his church have been set up across the United States and are run based on the three rules Harvey set forth: Each ""church"" must accept anyone of any religious faith or lack therefore, serve marginalized people, and support the safety and health of drug users. 
Read more: There's a science-backed treatment for drug addiction that works — but it's nearly impossible to get
 To do that, Harvey parks his car near a park where Portland drug users convene and hands out free clean syringes plus Narcan, an overdose reversal medication. ""Politicians, law enforcement, and health care haven't taken the lead here, so our church is,"" Harvey wrote in his op-ed. 
 Even though he is breaking the law to help drug addicts, Harvey said he will continue to do so, and even apply to make the church a nonprofit organization. That way, he can set up a clean injection site instead of working out of his car. 
 Harvey's service is anything but orthodox, but it does offer a way for people with drug addiction to stay safe and seek the treatment option that works for them.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","All weather watchers’ eyes are on Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 beast on a collision course with the Carolina coast. But while the winds are generating headlines and there’s a lot of questions about what category it will be when it makes landfall, the real issue is the water. And there’s going to be lots of it. It’s not that Florence’s winds aren’t a big deal—they are likely to be extremely dangerous and produce deadly flying debris—but there’s going to be a potentially historic amount of rainfall inland and powerful storm surge along the coast. Together, they’re responsible for 76 percent of all direct hurricane deaths. “There’s an old saying that those that live near the water will eventually live in the water,” Stephen Strader, a geographer who studies disasters at Villanova, told Earther. So let’s talk about that water likely to inundate people. Florence is likely to be a copious rain maker owing to how it fast (or slow) it moves ashore. Unfortunately, the National Hurricane Center calls for it to slow down as it reaches the Carolinas and then crawl inland as the winds in the upper atmosphere steering it slacken. That means the storm will have more time to unload heavy rain over the entire area under its shroud. But the slowing also means the bands of the heaviest rain that swirl around the hurricane are likely to do what meteorologists call training, a phenomenon where rain bands pass over one location repeatedly. It’s essential a race track for rain and can cause massive amounts of water to pile up on the ground in a very short period. While the National Hurricane Center is currently forecasting a wide area of 15-20 inches of precipitations, higher localized totals are likely because of training. Some model runs show upwards of 40-50 inches could fall, obliterating the rainfall record for wettest storm set by Hurricane Floyd in 1999 when it dropped 24 inches of rain as it strafed the North Carolina coast. Models are but one piece of putting together a forecast, but the guidance they’re providing right now is really worrisome. “When these environmental wind patterns weaken, there is no mechanism to continue moving the [tropical cyclone],” Sarah Griffin, a tropical cyclone expert at the University of Wisconsin, told Earther. “A similar set-up happened with Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area last year, causing Harvey to move very little for about 2 days.” Harvey was, of course, the biggest rainfall event to ever hit the U.S. so this is an extremely worrisome comparison. Compounding the issue of flooding is the type of summer North Carolina has had. In a word, it’s been a rainy one. A number of weather stations right in the center of Florence’s cone of probability have had some of their wettest summers on record. That means soils are saturated and won’t be able to handle the deluge that’s coming. “A lot of regions are associated with soil that drains poorly to begin with,” Strader said. “One thing we do know is when you replace natural vegetation with parking lots and homes and impervious surfaces, you increase the runoff.” So the rain is a huge issue. But it will likely be compounded by powerful storm surge on the coast, which also has the potential to be exacerbated by the storm slowing down as it approaches land. “If it stalls offshore or near the coast, storm surge threat will increase dramatically,” Hal Needham, a storm surge expert and founder of Marine Weather and Climate, told Earther. Needham said the size of the storm will also play a big role. Right now, Florence is wrapping up an eyewall replacement cycle, a sign that the storm is re-intensifying and could grow larger. If it does grow, the bigger wind field will give it a wider reach to whip more water toward the coast. Since we’re more than two days away and surge is very localized, we don’t yet have specific forecasts from the National Hurricane Center. But again, there’s bad news preceding the storm. Areas in Florence’s path are already seeing floodwaters rising ahead of the storm and tides are projected to remain high in the run up to Florence’s arrival. You can in part thank sea level rise for that, as it makes sunny day floods more common. “Even if you don’t think you’ll have to evacuate, the best thing to do is treat this as a trial run.” We can’t talk about the potential impacts of this storm without talking about how many people now call the area in Florence’s path home. Strader pointed to the fact that since 1940, the population residing in Florence’s cone of probability grew 1,325 percent, including a large spurt in the wake of Hurricane Hugo—the last major hurricane to make landfall in the Carolinas—in 1989. That includes growth ringing metro areas like Myrtle Beach and Wilmington on the coast and Raleigh-Durham inland. “I’m concerned people may be taken off-guard by a change in forecast track,” Needham said. “People need to think not only about their elevation but their evacuation route. I’m also concerned for people inland who may think they will not be impacted by this event.” All the growth also means there’s a lot more of the pavement, which increases runoff and flooding. “It’s a backhand forehand slap with this event with the removal of natural wetlands that protect cities and landscape,” Strader said. Both Strader and Needham urged residents to have a plan in place before the hurricane arrives and pay attention to local authorities. South Carolina has already ordered the evacuation of a million people, and residents in the Outer Banks and elsewhere in North Carolina being told to go inland, ideally out of the river flood zone. If you live in these areas or anywhere else evacuation orders pop up, follow them even if you don’t feel you’re in harm’s way.","All weather watchers’ eyes are on Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 beast on a collision course with the Carolina coast.
