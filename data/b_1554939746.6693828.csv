Nick Douglas,"If I was setting up curriculum at a university, says engineer Foone Turing, Id make an entire semester-long class on the Challenger disaster, and make it required for any remotely STEM-oriented major. Because, says Foone, the disaster was a lot less random or simple than people tend to think. In a thread of 102 tweets, which you can read in essay form here, Foone explains the real reason behind the Challenger disaster, the 2003 Columbia disaster, the sinking of the Titanicand the last time you melted down from anxiety.
The Challenger disaster wasnt a single mistake or flaw or random chance that resulted in the death of seven people and the loss of a two billion dollar spaceship, says Foone. It was a whole series of mistakes and flaws and coincidences over a long time and at each step they figured they could get away with it because they figured the risks were minimal and they had plenty of engineering overhead. And they were right, most of the time. Then one day they werent.
Normalization of deviance
Foone describes the specific cascades of shortcuts and mistakes that led to these famous disasters, and the similar cascades that lead to horrific car crashes on supposedly safe roads. The common factor is that a system is built and stress-tested for one set of circumstances, then stretched a little further in regular use, then finally stretched so far, in a non-optimal situation, that something reaches a breaking point. And all the fudges and allowances fall apart in catastrophic failure. Foone calls this Normalization of Deviance.
A certain road, for example, is built for a 50 MPH speed limit. But because drivers will always push it, the engineer makes sure the road is safe all the way up to 70 MPH under normal conditions. Inevitably, drivers end up taking it at 60 MPH, since everyone knows thats still safe. And then a few people figure it must be safe to drive a little faster than the normal 60 MPH. And a few go even faster. And then it rains, and someone still goes 80 MPH and they crash and die.
Everyone designing a system is constantly fighting against normalization of deviance. And the more things are designed to accommodate misuse, the more the users misuse it. Were in an arms race. And not just designers and engineers, but all of uswere all designing our own lives with a normalization of deviance.
Personal disaster prep
Weve all been there at some point: failing a test because we pulled too many all-nighters, or missing a deadline because we couldnt find those extra hours we thought wed have on the weekend, or having a huge fight because we piled up too many tiny grievances with our partner, or going bankrupt for a medical bill because we spent as much as we earned and tried to live inside a rapacious capitalist system.
When it comes to following standard financial advice, how many of us can say we actually have three

Yes, the systems around us build in certain stressors and failure points, and until those systems are fixed, we have to try not to stack too many other stressors on top of them. Personally, as the father of a three-month-old baby, Im quite freshly aware of this! Before, if the laundry or dishes or grocery shopping didnt get done, enough other stuff was going smoothly that the household could function fine until the weekend. Raising a baby puts a lot more stress on the system, and it becomes crucial to run the dishwasher, or to load the laundry in time to get everything dry and folded before bedtime. A baby is a series of little catastrophes, so theres less room for the others.
Catastrophe-aware empathy
The second personal lesson (another big one for a new parent): everyone around you is also managing a whole system of pressures and impending disasters, sometimes a lot more than you are, so you should be patient and empathetic with them.
In less personal terms, this is why asking someone for just five minutes of their time or just a few bucks is a bigger ask than you think. Its why whenever you want something from someone else, you should think about every possible obstacle and sacrificetravel time, opportunity cost, incidental expensesand take them on yourself. Meet someone near their workplace, pay the tab, secretly pad out deadlines so a delay wont be a catastrophe.
In close relationships, look for each others normalizations of deviance, and help them de-escalate. Take things off each others plate, swap errands or appointments, combine resources, cover for each other during stressful periods. And give yourself that same empathy.
And then, of course, get ready to adapt, because normalization of deviance comes for us all. The best we can do is give it fewer chances to cause a disaster.

Megan Rose Dickey,"The lack of diversity issue in Silicon Valley touches all aspects of the industry — entrepreneurship, big tech company demographics and venture capital. While tech companies have been a bit more deliberate about fostering diversity and inclusion in the last few years — and have made a small bit of progress — the venture capital industry is still sorely lacking in that area. Just one percent of venture capitalists are Latinx and only three percent are black. White people, unsurprisingly, make up 70 percent of the venture capital industry, according to a recent analysis by Richard Kerby, a partner at Equal Ventures. Compared to Kerby’s 2016 analysis, women now make up 18 percent of the VC industry versus just 11 percent. At an intersectional level, black and Latinx women make up zero percent of the venture capital industry. Meanwhile, 40 percent of VCs went to either Stanford or Harvard. “Just TWO schools!,” Kerby wrote on Medium. “Why is that? Everyone wants to work with those they are most similar to, and education, gender, and race are attributes that allow people to find similarities in others.” He added, “With 82% of the industry being male, nearly 60% of the industry being white male, and 40% of the industry coming from just two academic institutions, it is no wonder that this industry feels so insular and less of meritocracy but more of a mirrortocracy.” So, in addition to a lack of racial and gender diversity, there’s also a lack of cognitive diversity. Be sure to head over to Kerby’s Medium post to learn more.","The lack of diversity issue in Silicon Valley touches all aspects of the industry — entrepreneurship, big tech company demographics and venture capital.

Devin Coldewey,"One would think that having one of the most high-profile breaches in recent memory would make a company take security to heart, but Equifax is full of surprises. The latest is that its MyEquifax.com site, to which the company invites those affected by its poor security practices to freeze and unfreeze their credit, itself has extremely poor security.
It’s all documented by security researcher Brian Krebs, who discovered the issue not in some special investigation but in the process of signing up at the site himself. What he found was that “getting an account at MyEquifax.com was easy. In fact, it was too easy.”
In matters of banking and credit, identity is a very important thing to establish. That’s why when you go to MyEquifax.com, it asks you for an email, then for your Social Security number and date of birth.
Slight problem: SSN and DOB were among the personal data leaked in the Equifax breach to begin with! And it doesn’t even check that you own the email address you submit. It does ask a few verification questions, but as Krebs points out these are often public information, such as the street you live on, or your mother’s maiden name, and as such rather worthless for security purposes.
One you have been “verified” with this process, you can immediately request a security freeze on your credit report, or unfreeze it if it’s frozen.
Oh, and don’t worry if you established a PIN for this purpose when setting this up previously, you won’t need that. Yes, this poorly secured website specifically does not require a PIN, though a PIN is required for the same requests via phone or email. When Krebs asked a company representative about this, they explained:
We deployed an experience that embraces both security standards (using a multi-factor and layered approach to verify the consumers identity) and reflects specific consumer feedback on managing security freezes and fraud alerts online without the use of a PIN. The account set-up process, which involves the creation of a username and password, relies on both user inputs and other factors to securely establish, verify, and authenticate that the consumers identity is connected to the consumer every time.
None of that is true. Even elementary security standards like confirming the email address aren’t “embraced,” and multi-factor authentication is trivial to bypass.
This is bad but at least Equifax isn’t alone: It looks like credit reporting agencies Transunion and Experian also have ways of getting around PINs. You’d just think that Equifax, having failed so badly at security before, would want to make its setup a little more robust even meeting basic standards would be good.
As Krebs points out, however, it’s in your interest to set up an account with your actual email address and information, since if you don’t, it seems pretty much anyone with a few data points on you can do so themselves, gaining the ability to freeze and unfreeze your credit.","One would think that having one of the most high-profile breaches in recent memory would make a company take security to heart, but Equifax is full of surprises.

Matt Simon,"California continues to take stock of its unprecedented conflagrations between the Camp Fire in the north, which on its own is the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, and the Woolsey Fire in the south, 82 lives have been lost so far, with hundreds more still missing. As firefighters keep battling the blazes, a new menace is emerging: debris flows. The rains are coming to California, as soon as Tuesday night, and the fires have primed the soil for another disaster that can claim yet more lives. The coastal town of Montecito, in Southern California, learned this lesson less than a year ago. Last December, the massive Thomas Fire burned through the hills, right up to the edges of town. Thanks to the communitys comprehensive fire preparedness plan, only 7 homes were lost. But a month later, the scorched hills outside of town let loose a storm-driven debris flow that enveloped the town, killing 21. The problem is a fundamental change to the soil itself. When a wildfire burns vegetation, it releases organic compounds. These compounds are heated in the fire, volatilize, and then re-condense on soil particles, says Brian Ebel, a hydrologist with the USGS. This soil normally absorbs water, but the organic compounds turn it hydrophobic, literally meaning fear of water. It is not an understatement: You can pour a bottle of water on this burned soil and itll bead right off, as if the dirt were polished marble. The water will pool up and sit there, and it can take more than an hour for it to penetrate fire-scorched soil, says Ebel. Problem number two: vegetation anchors the soil. When fire burns it away, the soil loosens. You can think of vegetation as a protective blanket, says Jason Kean, a hydrologist at the USGS. Without it, sediment has nothing to hold it in place. Before there's even rain, debris can roll down the hill and accumulate in channels. Now hydrologists and meteorologists are keeping a close eye on communities that butt up against these latest fires, where the conditions are set for catastrophic debris flows when the rain comes. Once it starts raining hard on a burn area, the things can get generated really fast, like five minutes, says Kean. The debris flow can carry boulders and trees along with mud, making it more dangerous than a regular flood or a dry landslide. When you mobilize themkeep them mobile with this muddy matrix in between themthey can go 3 kilometers, says Kean. The video below shows just how easily the flow tosses boulders around. Boulders can also act like a moving dam, retarding the flow. So you get this surging behavior, where these things are holding back a whole bunch of flow behind it, adds Kean. It really makes the flow depth increase several times what you'd get in a water-only flood. The Montecito debris flow got to be 30 feet deep at points, lodging boulders in trees. Humans are powerless to stop itsandbags just become more debris for the flow. But it can be predicted, giving residents a chance to evacuate. The work begins as soon as a wildfires smoke clears enough for satellites to get a good look at how badly areas have burned. This information is relayed to scientists on the ground, who enter those burned regions as soon as its safe. The greatest risk of debris flow is in the zones that burned the most intensely, and scientists spend two or three days wandering the fire perimeter taking soil samples. That involves testing the hydrophobicity of the soil, the water repellency, says Eric Huff, staff chief of Cal Fires Forest Practice Program, and actually getting down on hands and knees and looking at what that surface soil layer is showing, whether or not organic matter has been completely burned off. Kean and his colleagues then compare this data to their understanding of where debris flows have let loose in the area historically, building a map that captures the probability and potential volume of a debris flow. They also identify values at riskhuman life and structures that may be in danger. With all this data in mind, they can calculate how much rain you would need to potentially let loose a debris flow for different regions of the map. Often half an inch of rain in an hour is enough to kick one off, or as little as five minutes of heavy rain. It's kind of a run-of-the-mill storm, says Kean. It's heavy rain, but it's not particularly exceptional. So the National Weather Service carefully watches storms as they head into California. (Unfortunately, with climate change, California may see fewer yet more intense storms going forward.) As the rain approaches the coast, officials can send out wireless alerts, like you would get for an Amber alert, as well as warnings on TV and radio. Which brings us back to the Montecito disaster. Forecasters saw the storm coming, predicting it would drop an inch and a half of rain an hour. What we saw in reality that night was a 30-minute heavy rain that moved through that area, says Eric Boldt, a warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service. It was closer to six and a half inches per hour. And there's no computer models that exist today that can predict that type of rate. Officials had put voluntary evacuation orders in place, but not everyone heeded the advice. This was just after the Thomas Fire, after all. They had just been evacuated for two or three weeks over the holiday season, says Boldt. They were just getting comfortable back in their homes and they didn't want to leave again. If you havent cleared out in time and the flow comes, the recommendation is to shelter in placemoving to the upper story of your house, for instance. Out on the streets is exactly where you don't want to be, as the flow follows those paths. We've even seen people, if they were able to get up on their countertops in their kitchen, the mud came up to about that level, says Boldt. It's a different way of thinking about the impact because it's not the same as a flash flood. With a flash flood, you can see a river swelling and move to higher ground. Flee up a hill just before a debris flow, though, and that ground could kill you. The debris flow risk can persist for up to five years after a wildfire. So residents whose homes narrowly survived a wildfire may not realize theyre in danger of the surrounding hills for longer than a year. But the danger is most certainly there. Its a brutal consideration for those trying to recover from the Camp and Woolsey fires, but its also an extremely important one. A menace begets another menace.

Aarian Marshall,"On Wednesday morning, Hurricane Michael barreled through the Florida panhandle. The most powerful storm to hit the region since record-keeping began in the mid-19th century ran roughshod over the states northwest coasts, damaging two local hospitals enough that they have started evacuating their patients from the areaeven after the storm has left. At least seven people are dead, 900,000 homes and businesses have lost power, and an estimated 325,000 people who fled the storm have to find their way back home. And in a terrible twist, researchers have found that Hurricane Michael hit some of the states least prepared counties. Those researchersJohn Renne, a professor of urban and regional planning and the director of Florida Atlantic Universitys Center for Urban and Environmental Solutions, and doctoral student Andrea Ramosreviewed six sorts of emergency plans for all 67 of Floridas counties. (In Floridaas in most places in the US emergency preparations happen on the local level.) Renne and Ramos's work found the counties in Florida with the least comprehensive hurricane evacuation plans were mostly in the state's panhandlein the area hit by Hurricane Michael. Each plan that the academics evaluated deals with different sorts of incidents or populations: Special Needs Registries and Specialized Transportation Plans should give authorities information on where and how residents with special needs should travel during an emergency. Pick-up location plans are for those without access to their own vehicles or who cant drive. Pet evacuation plans are for residents with pets (and those unwilling to evacuate without them). Multihazard plans are for events that include both hurricanes and other issues like flooding or environmental contamination risk. Evacuation maps are publicly available, easily accessible plans for evacuation routes. Renne and Ramos graded the effectiveness of each of plan on a 0 to 2 point scale, for a possible 12 points in total. A well-developed scheme scored a two. Non-existent plans got a zero. In the end, ten counties, all in northern Florida or the states panhandle, got weak scoresfewer than four points. Of those, at least one county, Gulf County, is under a mandatory evacuation order this week. Four other counties under mandatory evacuation ordersBay, Dixie, Taylor, and Wakullareceived moderate scores, meaning their plans earned between five and eight points. (The research has not yet been peer reviewed.) On the face of it, these results arent so surprising, says Renne. These are some of the least inhabited areas in Florida, accounting for just 1 percent of the states total permanent population. Plus, most counties receiving weak or moderate scores arent on the coast. If youre not a coastal county, it makes sense that you dont pay as much attention to evacuation plans, Renne says. He also notes that the state of Florida on the whole is much better at disaster planning than other coastal states, many which are less frequently threatened by hurricanes. But that relative distance from the coast will become less of a safeguard as climate change stirs up slower-moving, rain dense weather events. Storms like Michael and Florence are teaching planners to expect even inland coastal flooding. (During last months deluge in the Carolinas, inland areas saw more than 10 feet of flooding after swollen rivers pushed past their banks.) Places are flooding now that may have never flooded before, Renne says. It will take months, maybe years, for authorities to fully understand what happened during this unusually catastrophic storm. Being underprepared is, of course, about risk. Just because a county didnt have complete contingencies for dealing with their most vulnerable populations doesnt mean more of them were affected during Michael. It may be that places with weak plans got lucky this time. But while rescue teams continue to rescue, and lineman work on getting communications up and running in northern Florida, Renne urges more localities to get serious about disaster planning. And for the state and federal authorities to get better about helping them to plan. Theres no measuring stick for evacuation plans, says Renne. Its time to create oneand use it.

Brian Barrett,"There are plenty of guides available on how to protect your data, how to secure yourself online, and how to stop digital snoops from tracking you across the web and then profiting from that intrusion. (Sorry, “monetization”.) You should do these things. But if a cascading series of revelations this past week has taught us anything, it's that all of those steps amount to triage. The things you can control add up to very little next to the things you can’t. It’s an obvious point, especially if you follow the privacy headlines. But a recent example of location-tracking gone wrong—in fairness, it rarely goes right—that unfolded over the last week or so underscores the severity of what you’re up against. On May 10, a New York Times report detailed a service, called Securus, that allegedly allowed a former sheriff to track people’s location, practically in real-time, without a court order. Securus technically requires legal documentation that authorizes use of its services. But senator Ron Wyden (D - Oregon) says Securus told his office that the company “never checks the legitimacy of those uploaded documents,” and that it does not feel obligated to do so. It offers a rubber stamp, then, to letting people know where virtually anyone in the US is standing at any given moment. On the heels of that report, ZDNet detailed how all four major US carriers sell location data to companies you’ve never heard of, without your explicit permission. In this specific case, Securus bought its access from a location aggregator called LocationSmart, which in turn bought it from the telecoms. All of these corporate relationships are arguably legal. ""We don’t really have federal laws that are focused on that backend sale of personal data,"" says Alan Butler, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ""A lot this is just the Wild, Wild West, honestly. That’s why the companies do whatever they want."" 'If they’re going to have this data and a claim to use it, then they absolutely have a responsibility to make sure it’s locked up tighter than Fort Knox.' Robert Xiao, Carnegie Mellon University That alone would be cause enough for alarm. There’s no opt-out for any of this location sharing. It happens simply by dint of having a cell phone plan. In a very real sense, you’re powerless to prevent your location being used as chattel. Google knows where you are most of the time too, but at least it lets you turn off location tracking, and to delete your history. The company also ostensibly uses the information to help Google Maps, search, and other services that benefit consumers to some degree. The only value AT&amp;T and Verizon create by selling location data to brokers lands on their bottom line. Also, it gets worse. By Wednesday, hackers breached Securus, passing some of the data on its servers—including usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords—along to tech site Motherboard. On Thursday, security reporter Brian Krebs revealed that LocationSmart had a security meltdown of its own; while the company says it abides by privacy best practices, including a requirement that someone give consent before being tracked, Carnegie Mellon researcher Robert Xiao discovered that a bug on its web site allowed anyone to locate around 200 million people in the US without their knowledge. “LocationSmart is committed to continuous improvement of its information privacy and security measures and is incorporating what it has learned from this incident into that process,” the company said in a statement Friday. LocationSmart says also that the bug has been fixed, and that it had not been exploited prior to Xiao’s discovery. When asked how they were sure that Xiao was the first to exploit the bug, LocationSmart told WIRED that it “reviewed its historical logs.” Xiao urges some skepticism regarding that last claim. “I would be curious to know how they know that,” he says. “The attack flow looks fairly normal. If they looked at their server logs, it would be hard to distinguish what I was doing from normal use.” Regardless, the absence of exploits wouldn’t excuse the sloppiness that created the bug in the first place. Xiao says it took only about 15 minutes of prodding to discover it, and that it stems from an unused feature that the company apparently never bothered to secure. It’s an unconscionable lapse, especially given the sensitive nature of LocationSmart’s business. “I’d almost prefer that they didn’t have access to this in the first place, that this business model didn’t exist,” says Xiao. “But if they’re going to have this data and a claim to use it, then they absolutely have a responsibility to make sure it’s locked up tighter than Fort Knox.” It’s a responsibility LocationSmart, and so many others who hold onto your data, abdicated. “Because they value profits above the privacy and safety of the Americans whose locations they traffic in, the wireless carriers and LocationSmart appear to have allowed nearly any hacker with a basic knowledge of websites to track the location of any American with a cell phone,” Senator Wyden said in a statement Friday. “The dangers from LocationSmart and other companies are limitless. If the FCC refuses to act after this revelation then future crimes against Americans will be the commissioners' heads.” (An FCC spokesperson says that ""the matter is being referred to the Enforcement Bureau,"" with no further comment.) Wyden’s office also confirmed that none of the four major carriers have responded to letters he sent last week, asking each of them to audit what third parties have access to location information, if and how their customers consented, and urging safeguards to better manage the fallout of these incidents. 'No individual consumer has any power to do anything about it. And where in the system does the solution come from?' Alan Butler, EPIC You couldn’t hope for a much better encapsulation of the hopeless state of data privacy in the US today. You can see the same casual security sloppiness with which LocationSmart and Securus treated your location in the countless exposed databases —revealing everything from personal information to voter records —or in the extremely, entirely, embarrassingly preventable Equifax breach. The same system that allows AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint to sell your location to companies you’ve never heard of also allows thousands of barely regulated, shadowy data brokers to know everything about not just where you are but who you are, and what you do online. And lack of tangible progress, the sense that this has all happened before and will happen again, the resignation; that’s the cumulative effect of years of breaches and leaks and carelessness that make this all feel so futile. This keeps happening, and keeps not getting fixed. ""No one takes the lead,"" says Butler. ""People acknowledge that it’s a problem, but no individual consumer has any power to do anything about it. And where in the system does the solution come from?"" Laws do restrict what consumer-facing companies can do with your data, but the data broker industry has largely slipped through the cracks. And without a centralized agency taking the lead on privacy in the US, or an omnibus law like Europe's GDPR to act as a wider safety net, that's not going to change. None of which means you should give up. You should still follow those guides, and adjust those settings. But you should also know that better privacy can only come if and when companies respect you enough to grant it. And if they continue not to, your only option is to yell loudly enough—at the FCC, at lawmakers, at anyone who will listen—that they no longer have a choice.

GAIL COLLINS,"His opponent, Nate McMurray, hoped that Collins would eventually get desperate. And if hes down, hes going to throw that Hail Mary, and if he does that, were going to intercept that ball, and were going to run it back, said the Democrat. The district is near Buffalo, where sports metaphors are very popular. Collins, who seems to rely heavily on mentioning the name of Nancy Pelosi whenever possible, is still a slight favorite to win in a district that Donald Trump won by 25 points. The voters still have more than a week to decide whether they really want a congressman who uses the Values section of his web page to define Personal Accountability as never increasing entitlement programs. Heres one bright spot: This isnt the worst year on record for indicted congressmen running to stay in office. Back in 1978, we had four. And there would have been five except that authorities in New York agreed to drop charges of soliciting sex from a minor against Representative Fred Richmond after Richmond, a Democrat, agreed to go to a counseling program. Still, two running in a general election is very unusual, said Prof. Allan Lichtman of American University. Lichtman, the author of The Embattled Vote in America, said the 1978 corruption stars included Michigan Democrat Charles Diggs, who was convicted and awaiting sentence when he won re-election. Pennsylvania boasted two indicted Democrats. One (bribery, perjury and influence-peddling) got re-elected. The other (conflict of interest) lost. Floridians voted out J.

Kirsten Korosec,"Uber is taking a page out of the federal government’s disaster response handbook. The ride-hailing company is centralizing how it responds to disasters, whether it’s flooding in North Carolina, a mass shooting in Las Vegas or an earthquake in Mexico City. Now, instead of taking a local-first (and sometimes reactionary) approach, the company’s global security center will monitor and coordinate responses 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The company, which announced the change in a blog post this week, has become part of the urban landscape. People use the Uber app to commute to work, attend concerts and other events, rent bikes (and eventually scooters) and even have food delivered. People have become increasingly reliant on the service, a responsibility that requires more than an app that connects drivers and riders. The GSC, as Uber calls it, monitors and flags issues that may affect its business and the communities in which it operates. From here, the GSC staff, which includes former military and security experts who speak a dozen different languages, coordinate with local Uber staff and city, county or state officials. The GSC is the entity that will make decisions on when to suspend service in an area or whether to cap surge pricing. The GSC might also lend support to local authorities, depending on their needs. This procedural change is another illustration of CEO Dara Khosrowshahis efforts to rehabilitate the company and its reputation. It also telegraphs the company’s push to work more closely with cities. In April, Khosrowshahi announced a series of new products to its app, including a deal with instant car-booking service Getaround to launch a product called UberRENT and a partnership with Masabi that lets users pay and book tickets for public transit in the Uber app. Uber also launched Movement in 2017, a tool that provides cities with traffic data.","Uber is taking a page out of the federal government’s disaster response handbook.

Adi Robertson,"Nobody expected great things out of today’s House Judiciary Committee hearing about social media platforms censoring conservatives. The hearing came on the heels of Congress’ multi-day session with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, where lawmakers exhaustively asked about the issue. Claims about large-scale censorship are basically unfalsifiable, and none of the tech companies invited even showed up. The whole thing looked potentially like a soapbox for vloggers Lynnette “Diamond” Hardaway and Rochelle “Silk” Richardson, who were invited to the hearing alongside a few policy experts. But the social media hearing was not just bland or tedious. It was depressingly, almost deliriously bad: full of bad arguments, bizarre tangents, and a lot of shouting. The hearing’s opening statements, by Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), set the tone for the next few hours. Goodlatte spoke portentously about the power and responsibility of social media platforms, invoking quotes from both Ronald Reagan and Mark Zuckerberg. Nadler, the committee’s ranking Democrat, was annoyed. “The central thesis of this hearing doesn’t hold up under even the most basic scrutiny,” he protested. “This committee can do better.” Diamond and Silk suggest Mark Zuckerberg tried to fix the election with Facebook’s ad algorithm Republican lawmakers like Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) spoke vaguely in favor of bills to make companies “liable” for their actions, while admitting that private companies could police platforms however they wanted. A few brought up Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the safe harbor rule Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) badly misinterpreted during Zuckerberg’s hearings. Most Democrats were either wearily contemptuous of the proceedings, or asked panelists unrelated questions about Cambridge Analytica and bot regulation. “This is a stupid and ridiculous hearing. The only reason I’m still here is I want to enter some facts into the record,” said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), plausibly speaking for a large chunk of the committee. For Republicans, the day was mostly an excuse to lecture Silicon Valley and heap praise on Hardaway and Richardson, albeit not always accurately — Rep. Steve Chabot (R-OH) addressed a question at one point to “Diamond and Spice.” It’s really not clear what transpired between the vloggers and Facebook’s policy team, and a ThinkProgress analysis found that their traffic dips were probably tied to broad algorithm changes. But the company’s letter dubbing them “unsafe to the community,” even if it was completely retracted, sounds plausibly sinister. Diamond and Silk escalated this complaint into a sweeping conspiracy where Mark Zuckerberg interfered in the 2018 elections (we’re not sure which ones) by manipulating conservative users’ advertising preferences so they’d be targeted with liberal ads. They proceeded to get into shouting matches with various committee members, as representatives pressed the pair about receiving money from the Trump campaign — something they claimed under oath had never happened, before admitting that they’d been reimbursed for plane tickets. “We can see that you do look at fake news,” Richardson sneered at Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), when he read out a line from an official Trump campaign finance filing, stating that Diamond and Silk had been paid for consulting. “Are you calling this FEC document fake?” Jeffries asked. Several outlets have chronicled the false or dubious statements Diamond and Silk made under oath during the hearing. They’re characterized as lying in some stories, and at the very least, they seemed indifferent to being particularly accurate. At one point Hardaway complained about people saying Facebook was a private company and not a public utility, because “they went public in 2012” — referring to the company going public on the stock market. Every member has left the Diamond & Silk hearing except Darrell Issa pic.twitter.com/OjJmtzPld2 — Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone) April 26, 2018 After nearly two and a half hours, the Judiciary Committee’s YouTube stream froze, cutting off the end of the hearing. Business Insider reporter Joe Perticone posted a picture of panelists sitting in front of a nearly empty row of desks, saying that only one committee member was still listening. The truncated video is now online, along with copies of panelists’ testimony, and we know the same things we did this morning: Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have inappropriately banned or restricted some conservative material, but there’s little evidence that they’re singling out conservatives rather than making mistakes across the board. Beyond the able testimony of TechFreedom president Berin Szóka, NYU Law professor Ari Waldman, and News Media Alliance CEO David Chavern, the finest thing to come out of this hearing was a beautiful vision for social media’s future, delivered by Rep. Lieu: Ted Lieu: “Let’s say they want to write an algorithm that promotes cats. Can the government stop them from doing that?” Berin Szóka: “Thankfully not.” Lieu: “And let’s say Facebook figures out, you know, promoting cats gets a lot more people to sign onto Facebook than promoting Diamond and Silk. Can the government intervene and stop Facebook from doing that?” Szóka: ”No.” Lieu: “And let’s say Twitter figures out, you know, we’re going to promote nice, cuddly images of furry animals rather than dismembered body parts. Can the government say you can’t do that?” Szóka: “No.” Mr. Lieu, please sponsor a funding bill for this new cat-only internet. The world will remember you as a hero.","The hearing, featuring vloggers Diamond and Silk, was not just bland or tedious.

The deaths follow a growing number of recent American military accidents, including two deadly collisions involving American warships in 2017, and will likely sharpen the spotlight on the countrys military operations in Asia.

A.A. Newton,"Natural disaster responses increasingly rely on electronic devices for communication. In the aftermath of a destructive storm, your phone or tablet can be a literal lifeline—so it needs to actually work. Losing the ability to communicate with the outside world makes it harder to coordinate relief efforts and downright impossible to let friends and family know you’re safe. Personal safety should always take top priority, but if your family disaster plan relies on smartphones or laptops in any way, it’s crucial that you take steps to prevent them from being damaged. Here are some ways to do just that. Waterproof Your Devices Obviously, keeping your electronics dry is crucial in a hurricane, and the easiest way to do this is to pack all of your tech in airtight, watertight plastic containers. If you have a vacuum sealer, perfect; seal your backup batteries, chargers, adapters, and cords in bags before packing them. If you don’t, Ziploc bags work well. In either case, silica gel packets provide extra dryness insurance, so long as they’re not already saturated with moisture. You can recharge saturated silica in a pinch by drying it out in a 200-250ºF oven for a few hours, but if you’re unsure how dry it is, buying fresh stuff from the hardware store is your best bet. Diversify Your Charger Portfolio A phone or laptop with a dead battery is completely useless, so be sure to pack lots of different battery-replenishing options in your go bag. Fully-charged external batteries are a must, and USB-compatible car chargers let you charge devices from any car with a working battery—just be sure to unplug the adapter when you’re done. Throw in a power strip or two to make the most of any functional power outlets you encounter, plus some extra connecting cables, and you should be fully covered. Get the Most Out of Your Smartphone The pocket-sized supercomputers we all carry around are lifesavers in an emergency situation, even when cell service or wifi is unavailable. Your smartphone can handle everything from first-aid apps to downloaded maps to quick-access document storage; figure out what information you need access to and download it to your phone. While you’re at it, take necessary precautions to maximize your phone’s battery life, which could make your life much easier in an extended power outage. Generally speaking you don't want to rely on technology at all in your disaster toolkit, but… Read more Read If you haven’t already, be sure to activate your phone’s emergency contact functions. Android users can add emergency contacts to their lock screen, and the Medical ID function of Apple’s Health app allows you to make relevant medical and contact information lock screen-accessible. Opt in to emergency notifications, too: Android settings are under the “Cell Broadcast” header, and iOs settings are in the “Government Alerts” section of the Notifications menu. Back Up Absolutely Everything If you rely on a physical hard drive for important file backups—or worse, don’t back anything up at all—get a cloud backup running ASAP. I use Backblaze, which is perfectly fine, but there are a ton of options out there. If you’re not sure where to start, Lifehacker has a few guides to online backup services that will help. Don’t forget to take photos and/or video of your house, yard, and any other property you have insured in case you need to file claims—and back those up, too. Use Social Media to Your Advantage A physical meeting place is crucial to an IRL emergency plan, but you should have a social media “meeting” plan too—especially if you have out-of-towners worrying about you. Consumer Reports recommends choosing one platform for check-ins and ensuring that every family member has the relevant app installed on their phone. As for far-flung family and friends, designate one person who lives out of the disaster zone as your liaison. Ask this person to be available for check-ins and do the work of updating other concerned parties so you can focus on more important things.","Natural disaster responses increasingly rely on electronic devices for communication.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"Over the course of this conflict, President Trump has emboldened Saudi and emirati leaders. He shares their antipathy for Iran and will sell them virtually any weapon they want. Now, the Trump administration, which also supplies the coalition with intelligence, refueling capabilities and other assistance, is sending mixed signals. While the Pentagon urged the coalition not to attack, a statement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday made no such explicit request. Instead, he made clear to the emirate leaders “our desire to address their security concerns while preserving the free flow of humanitarian aid and lifesaving commercial imports.” He mildly called for all sides to work with the United Nations on a political solution. The war began in 2014, when Houthi rebels and forces loyal to the ousted former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, took control of the capital, Sana, and much of the rest of the country. In 2015, the Saudi-led coalition, with President Barack Obama’s backing, launched airstrikes against the Houthi forces. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, both Sunni Arab nations, see the Al Hudaydah offensive as a way to break a stalemate in the war and deal a crippling blow to the indigenous Houthis and their backers in Shiite-led Iran, which the Sunnis consider their chief rival for regional influence. They have accused the Houthi rebels of using the port to smuggle in arms, including missiles, allegedly supplied by Iran to attack Saudi Arabia. A United Nations panel has expressed doubt that Al Hudaydah is a weapons transit point, and other experts question whether Iran provided the missiles.",Sudanese forces fighting alongside the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen pressed toward Al Hudaydah on Tuesday.,2018-06-13T02:06:27Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",On the Brink of Disaster in Yemen,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/opinion/yemen-saudi-attack-port-houthis.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/opinion/13yemenWeb/13yemenWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
ROGER COHEN,"The vote will certainly be closer as maximalist pro-Brexit zealots within her Conservative Party, who want no accommodation with the European Union, realize their insanity could end up delivering the sanity of Britain remaining. Its still more likely, however, that a deal twice defeated will be defeated a third time unless May tries this desperate gambit: Vote for the deal and I will resign March 30. She wont do that.
If her deal finally dies an irrevocable death, May will have to negotiate an extension with the European Union. The union will want to know what the extension beyond March 29 is for. It will probably favor a long extension because a short one is likely to be useless, given that nearly three years of negotiation have produced only mayhem.
Personally, I think an indefinite extension might be the solution lurking in the long grass. That way Britain could remain in the European Union forever while professing to want to leave. Brexit could be Britains Godot. Everyone would be happy.
That wont happen in this dour age. But I suspect a long extension will be granted with the reason for it getting fudged. If its not, no-deal Brexit looms again as imminent (in fact, it looms anyway as one possible outcome at the end of any long extension).
Once this whole mess goes beyond March 29 (many Brits would now prefer summary execution to more talk of Brexit), all bets are off. Britain could find itself voting in theEuropean Parliament election in May, a surreal exercise. In June, three years will have passed since the Brexit vote. Polls suggest opinion has shifted in favor of remaining. I cant imagine a long extension without either a general election or a second referendum: This will have to go back to the people.
I told you we are in Act IV, if that. Oh, yes, the Malthouse Compromise: You dont need to worry, dear reader. It was a fantasy. Whats real is that Britain is better off with more than a half-billion other people in the borderless European miracle that is the union.",This British national disaster has legs.

Aimée Lutkin,"If you have pets, you know they can create a mess. Some of that mess can be vacuumed up by your Roomba, and some of it will create an absolute disaster if it gets eaten by the robot vacuum. You know what I’m talking about. (I’m talking about poop.)

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","Hello friends. Friendly reminder that while our financial lives may seem like a disaster and we’re all stressed out about not having enough money, one of the few financial vehicles that actually benefits people who use it is the 401(k). In this story about a study reporting that 66 percent of millennials have $0 saved in their 401(k)s, Vice writes that, “It is worth noting, however, that 401(k)s are generally bullshit.” (Emphasis theirs.) Where to begin. Yes, I understand that 401(k)s aren’t magic. You need money to save money, not everyone has access to them (particularly as freelancers and gig economy workers comprise ever more of the workforce), and it can be overwhelming or seemingly impossible to think about saving for retirement when you have a mountain of student loan debt and your rent eats up half of your paycheck. Employers are much less generous than they used to be, and our retirement crisis exemplifies that all people, of all age groups, have trouble saving money. Defined benefit plans (a.k.a. pensions) were nice when they existed and were properly managed. Ideally, people would be getting more money. I’m not disputing any of this. But there is a general cynicism that permeates certain areas of the web/culture that basically seems to say, well, we’re all screwed, so why even try? I don’t think this is the intent, but I can’t help but see it as a consequence, and it’s irresponsible. If a bunch of publications that you trust tell you that 401(k)s are bullshit, and you don’t know any better, are you going to prioritize contributing to your retirement account? You can be mad about the system while still encouraging people to do what’s in their best interest, which is to put some money away for retirement. Here are some of the study’s other takeaways: Most employed people aged 21 to 32 who are saving for retirement have less than $20,000 saved The average balance is $67,891 83 percent of working Latinos and 70 percent of African Americans have nothing saved Only 55 percent of Millennials are eligible to participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan, compared to 77 percent of GenXers and 80 percent of Baby Boomers This puts them on par with other generations, per other studies: two-thirds of Americans across generations aren’t putting money into their 401(k) I am not trying to proselytize about 401(k)s and claim that they’re the ideal and ultimate financial product, or that you need to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and do better. As the study indicates, those working may not even have the option to use one, as our employers get ever more stingy. And I can’t make you save—particularly if you do not have the money to save—but I will say this: the system may be bullshit, but 401(k)s aren’t. Publications that are making a point to spotlight growing inequities and the dangers of permalancing and gig economy work—which they absolutely should—also need to take the time to educate people on what they can do to better their finances, particularly if employers and the government won’t. You can throw your hands up in the air and say everything sucks, but at the end of the day, you need money. It’s not something to be cavalier about. So if you are lucky enough to have access to a 401(k) at work and the ability to contribute, then contribute. Even just a tiny bit. Americans are shouldering around $1.48 trillion in student loan debt, and around 70% of college… Read more Read I’m not talking about aiming for the maximum (for 2018, that’s $18,500). But even if you contribute one or two percent of your paycheck, that’s exponentially better than contributing nothing at all. This is true for many reasons: If your employer offers a 401(k), they likely offer an employer match. And you should think of that money as part of your compensation. Would you be ok with your employer paying you $49k instead of $50k when you agreed to the latter? No? It’s the same thing with your 401(k) match. Suddenly your two percent contribution becomes four percent. They should be giving you the money anyway, but they’ve put this requirement on it, so you should do it regardless. If you don’t put in enough to get the match, you’re essentially forfeiting a portion of your salary. It lowers your taxable income, meaning you’re paying less in taxes and therefore taking home more money. Typically fees are lower than if you invested on your own, and you can gain exposure to expensive stocks you wouldn’t be able to otherwise (like the Amazons and Facebooks of the world). Compound! Interest! Please contribute something to yours, especially when you’re young. “If you go back and look at it historically, people who invested in a 401(k) have money in retirement,” says Kevin Dixon, senior market analyst at Market Traders Institute. “They’re incredibly intelligent vehicles. It’s a no-brainer, really.” So: Be mad. Understand that maxing out your retirement account alone likely still won’t be enough to live off of in retirement, and that many of us will be working long after we would like. Fight to keep the safety net in place, and push our government to expand it rather than quietly eroding it piece by piece. Understand your entire financial picture, beyond investing for retirement, and what needs to be done to put you in the best position possible. As the study suggests, lobby lawmakers to loosen ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which governs benefits) participation restrictions and back your workplace’s union. Demand that politicians institute the fiduciary rule. But don’t be fooled into thinking it’s better to tweet about how screwed we all are than to put a little money away in your 401(k). It might seem painful and fruitless now, but you’ll be better off. Use cynicism to demand more and better, but don’t let it harm your future finances in the meantime.","Hello friends.

Considering how much Los Angeles has been criticized for ignoring its history, this endeavor has drawn some cheers. “This is something of a victory for history, and the often fleeting life of local landmarks,” David L. Ulin, a former book critic for the Los Angeles Times, wrote in an essay celebrating the project. “For my money — or the developer’s — it’s also a welcome sign of Los Angeles growing up.” Continue reading the main story","Tuesday: California-as-Disaster, recreational marijuana, tax problems and the Formosa Cafe lives.",2017-12-26T14:00:53Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: Dark Depictions of a Sunny State,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/26/us/california-today-dark-depictions-of-a-sunny-state.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/26/us/26californiatoday/26californiatoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,1
"A.A. Newton on Vitals, shared by A.A. Newton to Lifehacker","Few skin conditions torpedo self-esteem the way acne does. As it turns out, a face full of painful lesions—not to mention unsolicited, tone-deaf advice from family and strangers alike—has a way of driving people into hiding. Throw in a whole internet’s worth of unverified anecdotes about banishing acne for good and you’ve got a recipe for disaster. Zits are unfair. We didn’t ask for them, we certainly don’t deserve to have them into adulthood,… Read more Read Treating acne is maddening. Even if your breakouts are under control, you may be left with dark spots, red spots, dents, and/or bumps—the ghosts of hell-zits past. Today’s super-saturated skincare market offers thousands of products that claim to fade acne scars, but frankly, very few of them work. Before you drench your face in retinol and acids to fade your acne scars, you should figure out what caused them in the first place—and if they’re even scars at all. What The Heck Are Acne Scars, Anyway? Scar tissue forms when an injury or illness damages your skin’s ability to produce collagen, the protein that gives skin its structure. As Dr. Meghan Feely, a board-certified dermatologist practicing in New York and New Jersey, explained to me in an email, the same process causes acne scars. Inflammation—redness, pain, and/or swelling—from deep-rooted zits can injure surrounding skin cells, altering the collagen they produce to repair injured skin. Depending on the amount of collagen the damaged cells produce, she explained, patients are left with either atrophic or hypertrophic scars. Atrophic scars happen when acne-damaged skin cells don’t produce enough collagen to refill the injured area, leaving indentations in the skin. Any dimpled, dented texture you notice after a breakout heals is caused by atrophic scarring. Typically, these scars present in one of three patterns: ice-pick (deep and narrow, like pinholes), boxcar (wide and squared-off), and rolling (wide and rounded). The shape and size of atrophic scars depends on the extent of the tissue damage, as well as how your skin typically heals from injury. When acne-damaged skin cells overproduce collagen, they leave hypertrophic scars, which are raised and often shiny. Hypertrophic scars occur more frequently in severe wounds that don’t close early on in the healing process: a surgical incision is less likely to leave a raised scar than, say, a massive cyst that repeatedly gets its head scratched off. However, whether or not you get hypertrophic scars mostly comes down to genetics. If your family members tend to develop raised, bumpy scars, you probably will, too. Generally, only very severe acne leaves scars. Age and family history influence their development to some extent, but according to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Diane Madfes, the biggest scarring predictors are the acne’s depth and duration. The deeper the zits, and the longer they go untreated, the more likely they are to cause permanent damage—which acne scars are, unfortunately. If you’re not sure what you’re dealing with, gently run your fingers over the spots in question. If they’re indented or raised, you have acne scars; if they’re smooth, but discolored, you have something else. If My Dark Spots Aren’t Acne Scars, What Are They? Not all breakouts leave scars. Mild lesions may not go deep enough to damage collagen-producing cells, and some deep-rooted zits don’t stick around long enough to cause permanent structural damage. However, inflammation from a breakout can piss off cells closer to the surface of your skin, causing them to function abnormally for awhile. This process is what causes some zits to leave dark or red spots when they heal. The color of a post-acne mark depends on which cells were damaged. Dark spots are caused by damaged melanocytes, which produce melanin, the pigment that gives our skin its color. These spots are usually brown, but can be purplish or bluish depending on your skin tone. This type of discoloration is called hyperpigmentation. Some breakouts leave red spots when they heal, which is a sign of damaged or irritated surface-level capillaries. Your body’s first response to illness or injury is usually to increase blood flow to the affected area, causing temporary redness and swelling known as erythema. Erythema usually dissipates once a wound has healed, but sometimes capillaries around the healing site are too damaged to immediately return to their normal, pre-injury state. Both of these conditions are caused by inflammation and persist after it clears, so their full names are post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or erythema—PIH or PIE for short. The superficial cell damage behind PIH and PIE is temporary, though the marks can take months or years to fade. If your post-acne marks aren’t clearly brown or red, you can figure out if they’re PIE or PIH by pushing on them gently with a fingertip. PIE temporarily disappears when pressed because doing so cuts off blood flow to the affected capillaries. Unlike blood, melanin is static, so PIH marks will look the same regardless of how much you poke at them. What Can I Do To Prevent Scarring And Pigmentation? The likelihood of developing scars, PIH, and/or PIE is mostly down to genetics, but as Dr. Madfes explains, inflicting additional trauma on already inflamed skin makes things worse: “Some people tend to pick at the acne scar, or the acne bump, because they feel a raised surface. [...] Light trauma should not cause marks, but if someone’s going to pick, try and get out the pus, or manipulate the area, [they’re] going to increase the incidence of scarring and hyperpigmentation.” Anything you can do to encourage proper healing, on the other hand, is good. Besides resisting the urge to squeeze, Dr. Madfes recommends keeping open lesions “moist and covered” until they heal—she specifically says Vaseline is a great wound protectant—and using a moisturizer with ceramides. However, she emphasizes that the best way to prevent picking—and, by extension, PIH/PIE or scars—is to resolve the acne that causes it in the first place. How Do I Get Rid of Them? Mild PIH and PIE—with no accompanying active acne—will resolve with on their own within a year. If that’s too long to wait, sunscreen is the surest way to speed up the fading process. When your skin darkens from sun exposure, your PIH does too; wearing a broad-spectrum, high-SPF formula every day protects your skin from further damage and helps it heal properly. Sunscreen is a wonder of technology. It’s the closest thing we have to an anti-aging miracle, and… Read more Read However, most people who seek treatment for PIH/PIE and scarring also have active acne—and every specialist I spoke to for this story agrees that resolving chronic acne is the first step to treating post-inflammatory marks. Mild acne can be effectively treated with over-the-counter products; Dr. Madfes recommends starting with a product containing micronized benzoyl peroxide like the Acne.org treatment or this cleanser from Differin. Non-micronized particles are too big to penetrate pores, and their irregular size and shape makes them prone to clumping together—which renders the medication less effective and more irritating. The retinoid adapalene —now available over the counter as Differin —effectively treats acne and PIH, as do ingredients like niacinamide and azelaic acid, although to a lesser extent. (I use and love Melazepam, which is a 20% azelaic acid cream.) Whichever treatment you choose, be patient: topical medications take at least three months to show results. Where’s a dermatologist when you need one? A recent investigation by Women’s Health details a… Read more Read Moderate to severe acne benefits from professional intervention, and the earlier, the better. If your insurance covers it, see a dermatologist as soon as possible. If you’re uninsured or have shitty insurance, find a skilled esthetician—a licensed professional who specializes in skincare techniques. Esthetician licensing requirements vary by state, and their individual areas of expertise range from waxing to laser resurfacing, so really do your research: check out their website, do a critical scan of Yelp reviews, and/or get recommendations from friends and family. (This also applies to dermatologists, by the way.) When you request an appointment, specifically ask to see an acne specialist. If there’s a long wait, put your name on the cancellation list and check in every few weeks. At your appointment, give the dermatologist or esthetician a detailed history of your acne—including medications you’ve tried in the past, any you take now, and your tendency to develop PIH, PIE, or scars—so they can decide how best to treat you. Both dermatologists and estheticians aim to resolve acne before treating pigmentation or scarring, but many medications and procedures do both at once. Topical retinoids (tretinoin, tazarotene, and adapalene) are proven multitaskers, and dermatologists frequently prescribe them to treat acne and hyperpigmentation. (Insurance companies notoriously skimp on topical prescription coverage, so if your tube of tretinoin costs two hundred dollars— not an exaggeration —look for manufacturer coupons and discount pharmacies to lower the price.) For patients with active acne and pigmentation to address, estheticians favor chemical peels. Licensed esthetician and acne specialist Mary Freihofner told me that she uses glycolic, mandelic, and salicylic acid peels for her acne clients with hyperpigmentation—but once the lesions have healed, she thinks microdermabrasion works faster. Erythema may not respond to hyperpigmentation treatments, and in those cases, Freihofner finds Vitamin C peels to be quite effective. A professional facial with a peel usually costs between eighty and two hundred dollars, depending on your location and the specific treatments you choose. If Acne Scars Are Permanent, What Can I Do About the Ones I Have? There are effective ways to treat acne scars, but they don’t come cheap. Since scarring is caused by damaged tissue in the dermis—the middle layer of skin—treating it requires some level of penetration. Many dermatologists, including Dr. Feely and Dr. Madfes, treat acne scarring by way of dermal resurfacing techniques, most of which involve lasers. Certain types of lasers can penetrate the epidermis—the outermost layer of skin—to stimulate collagen-producing cells in the dermis, reducing the appearance of scars over time. Lasers are less invasive than traditional surgical techniques, but all dermal penetration has risks: you don’t want to damage any nerves or blood vessels while you’re poking around down there. This is why laser resurfacing is performed only by specially trained, licensed professionals—and why it’s often expensive. One laser resurfacing session can cost anywhere from a hundred bucks to well over a thousand, depending on how much time under the laser you need. These procedures are elective and not technically medically necessary, so insurance won’t cover them; always get a quote before scheduling a session. You don’t necessarily have to see a dermatologist for laser therapy, though; many skincare clinics offer the same services. Raelle Levicke, a licensed esthetician and laser technician at About Face Skincare in Philadelphia, swears by fractionated lasers and intense pulsed light (IPL) treatments. She explained that surface-level treatments—chemical peels, microneedling, and microdermabrasion—are somewhat effective at fading hyperpigmentation, but they literally don’t go deep enough to treat scar tissue. Fractionated lasers are her weapon of choice for acne scars and severe hyperpigmentation, but she prefers IPL treatments for treating erythema. Depending on the case, her patients see results after two to four sessions. I know from experience how horrible it is to feel like you’re doomed to cycle between painful breakouts and scars forever, so if there’s one point I want to really hammer home, it’s this: find a licensed professional who specializes in acne treatment. A dermatologist who’s normally up to their eyeballs in melanomas—or an esthetician who mostly gives relaxing facials—will probably treat you differently than someone with years of experience treating acne. There’s someone out there who can help you—don’t give up until you find them.","Few skin conditions torpedo self-esteem the way acne does.
