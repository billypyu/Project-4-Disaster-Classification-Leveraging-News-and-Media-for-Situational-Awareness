Aimée Lutkin,"Storms can destroy your home and level your neighborhood, but even after they pass, flooding presents unique dangers you might not be aware of. Even walking through water, it turns out, can kill you. It’s grim to think about, but on the other hand, a little preparedness might save your life. On subreddit LifeProTips, user u /daynanfighter explained why it’s best to use a little boat to get from place to place, even if it seems like the flooding is walkable: For those in flooded areas, use extreme caution when walking on streets and sidewalks. Manhole covers are often forced off by the flood and can be extremely dangerous as people can fall in, get trapped, and drown. I’m from New Orleans where flooding is common. Rising water in sewers offen moves manhole covers(openings to the sewer) creating a very dangerous situation especially when water is being pumped through the sewers (as in during a flood). It creates underground rivers and people fall in and drown. Use a boat whenever possible while crossing flooded urban areas and use extreme caution when walking. They also recommended bring not only food and water, but an axe if you’re fleeing to the top level of your home—if the flooding is bad enough you could drown in your attic with no way to escape. If you don’t think you could hack through your own roof, consider the potential that the water might get higher before going to an upper story. In the comments, people shared other hidden dangers to be aware of when traversing a flooded neighborhood, including snakes. User u/ how-about-no-bitch gave a very in-depth analysis of how dangerous waterlogged snakes actually are, and a reminder to be aware in general of wildlife. They say snakes are for the most part trying to escape as well, so just stay out of their way. Here’s how: Just be aware of your surroundings and watch where you put your fingers and opening doors. Be careful around thick brush or low hanging branches. This is relevant to any flooding. You are going to see a whole lot of animals you didn’t realize were nearby. Also. For fucks sake watch out for fire ant floating islands. They will be more likely to fuck up your day more than most other animals. Other important mentions: the flood is almost certainly not composed of fresh running rainwater. It’s a mix of water and sewage, which means you could easily make yourself very ill while wading in it. Also, keep in mind downed power lines. Several people wrote they knew of folks who had been electrocuted while trying to escape their homes. Large bodies of water, even brand new ones created on your street, often have currents that could sweep you away. There will also be sudden rising waters at times, so what seemed traversable will be suddenly much less so. But, if you must walk through, use a probe ahead of you and cover up as much as possible to keep contaminated water out, according to u/ NoyzMaker : Don’t walk in flood waters at all unless you have boot or hip waders to keep all the water off your person. Most of that water is contaminated and a simple cut or scratch can easily get infected. Also always use a walking stick or other type of “probe” to test the stability of the space in front of you. Will keep you from getting stuck in sudden mud or open manhole covers like OP mentions since even something small like a water meter cover getting lifted can catch you off guard and twist your ankle. The general message: don’t walk around unless you absolutely have to.","Storms can destroy your home and level your neighborhood, but even after they pass, flooding presents unique dangers you might not be aware of.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Virginia K. Smith to Lifehacker","The Midwest floods continue to be a slow-moving disaster. Towns, farms, and infrastructure are still underwater in Nebraska, and water will take months to work through the vast network of rivers, creeks, and streams that drain the Upper Midwest into the Gulf of Mexico. 
The damage to the region could last much longer than that, though. It could require years to rebuild infrastructure, but the real challenge will be restoring the regions greatest resource, the reason there are so many farms there in the first place: its soil.
Early estimates indicate the floods could be responsible for $440 million in crop losses in Nebraska, which sits at the epicenter of the floods. That number could easily rise the longer floodwaters cut farmers off from fields and prevent spring plantings. Thats bad news for a state where one in four jobs are tied to or supported by farming, according to the states Department of Agriculture. States next door are dealing with their own varying levels of crisis from rivers overtopping their banks. 
Even after the floodwater recedes, the regions farms and the soil theyre built on could face a long road to recovery, spanning years or decades. To understand why, you have to understand how these floods happened. After an extremely wet fall, winter arrived with a fury. Repeated blasts of cold froze the soil and heavy snow piled up on top of it. Then came the bomb cyclone a few weeks ago. It unleashed a blizzard in western Nebraska, but the eastern portion of the state saw rain and lots of it. Nearly three-quarters of Nebraska weather stations are seeing an increase in winter rain, according to Climate Central (full disclosure: I helped with this analysis when I worked there), a hallmark of the warming world.
Soaked soils couldnt absorb the sudden influx of water, and so it began to run off into rivers and streams, scraping the earth away with it. Add in dam and levee failures, and the torrent truly clawed away at the Midwests most bountiful resource.
Basically what its going to do is going to erode the most productive topsoil, Mahdi Al-Kaisi, a soil and water specialist with Iowa States extension program, told Earther. This is why we need to think about climate change more seriously. Thats become very destructive to this whole system and put a lot of stress on these surfaces.
Its not even just the top layer of soil thats being ripped up and washed away. Where the floodwaters have receded, huge blocks of soil have been gouged away. The weight of the water has also compacted soil in some locations, while others are covered in sand and silt thats been swept up by engorged rivers, neither of which is as nutrient-rich or structured as the soil that supports the wheat, soybean, and corn crops. 
You have the good stuff moving away and not as good stuff moving in, Andrea Basche, an agronomist and soil scientist at the University of Nebraska, told Earther.
That puts farmers who depend on growing these crops for their livelihoods in a serious bind. They can try to plant this years crop, knowing productivity wont be as high as it was, or they can set about to the arduous task of restoring topsoil to a more productive state. The first step is just letting fields dry out, something that could take weeks or even months. Farmers can assess how much sand theyre looking at, though Al-Kaisi warned that using heavy equipment to do those assessments could disturb or breakup any topsoil that is left. 
For those lucky enough to be dealing with just a few inches of sand, they can just churn it up into the soil. But areas with more than 24 inches of sand could be lost causes. Nebraskas extension service suggests that farmers dealing with that situation [c]onsider the relative costs of moving the sand and of abandoning the crop area. Basche suggested that farmers could also use compost or restore wetlands and prairie as other possible solutions for rebuilding soil, but it still could take decades to restore productivity if it is ever the same in our lifetimes again.
That timeframe could mean many farmers and ranchers end up walking away rather than deal with mounting costs or the specter of bankruptcy. Farm revenue in Nebraska, while important, has been declining, and Trumps escalating trade wars have sapped an estimated $1 billion from Nebraska alone, according to the American Farm Bureau (though that number doesnt take into account programs designed to offset losses). The state of the soil only makes the situation more dire.
All this reveals yet another way climate change is upending the systems we rely on. Al-Kaisi said in the future, farmers could focus on low- or no-till agriculture, and planting cover crops could help mitigate some of the impacts of flooding. Systemic changes are also needed, including rethinking flood protection as climate change ups the odds of heavy downpours and rain falling on snow. 
It was not designed to handle this, John Remus, an Army Corps of Engineers manager said in a New York Times interview, referring to the intricate series of levees and dams that normally hold back the Missouri River. And the system will only be further taxed in the coming months, far from where the floods began. 
This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities, Ed Clark, director of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations National Water Center, said in a statement that went out with the agencys spring flood outlook. That outlook shows that areas all along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers face major flood risks through May, meaning more fields will face the scouring power of water.
We need to be really clear this is not just farmers problem, Al-Kaisi said. This is societys problem.

CHRISTOPHER MELE,"That flooding ripped up sidewalks, gutted many of the town’s quaint shops and carried off vehicles, depositing some of them blocks away. Mr. Miller said Sunday’s rain started around 2:45 p.m. and had not yet subsided as of around 6:30 p.m. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning until 10:30 p.m. and said a third wave of significant water was imminent.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The East Coast is bracing for another nor’easter this week, with the National Weather Service in Boston warning that the city and nearby coastlines could see three to four feet of storm surge flooding. This, in the same winter that the bomb cyclone turned many of Boston’s streets into frozen soup. Parts of the Northeast are getting hammered by frigid temperatures right now, just 24 hours after a … Read more Read Is it the latest sign of the end times? Not really. Winter storms like nor’easters, it turns out, routinely deliver worse flooding than hurricanes to this part of the world, a reality confirmed by a study published earlier this year, the Washington Post ’s Capital Weather Gang noted today. Why’s that, you might ask? The reason has everything to do with the difference in how nor’easters and hurricanes form—a difference that allows nor’easters to maintain hurricane-like central pressures and rip-roaring winds at latitudes where their tropical cousins typically fizzle out. “By the time a hurricane gets off New England, it’s over very cold water and starts to decay,” Jeff Masters, meteorologist and blogger with Weather Underground, told Earther. Hurricanes get their strength from oceanic heat, forming in warm equatorial regions where there’s plenty of evaporating water to condense into storm clouds. Nor’easters get their energy from an entirely different source: as Masters put it, the contrast in density between warm, moist air from the ocean and cold, dry air from the land. When these contrasting air masses collide, the cold dry air sinks, and releases energy. The technical term for the atmospheric set-up that drives the formation of a nor’easter is ‘ baroclinic instability.’ Unlike hurricanes, which form and thrive in tropical waters and feature a warm core, nor’easters form at mid-latitudes, and their cores are cold. Because they don’t rely on ocean heat for their energy, they can maintain hurricane-like central pressures and wind strengths at latitudes where hurricanes struggle to. This can lead to some very bad flooding. “Occasionally you get a strong hurricane up there [in the northeast], but they’re pretty uncommon,” Masters said. “It’s the big ‘nor’easters that dominate the record storm surge,” for the region. Models are calling for this week’s nor’easter to deliver damaging winds, heavy rain, and snowfall to the Eastern seaboard beginning on Thursday night, although the storm’s exact track remains uncertain, the Weather Channel reports. A coastal flood watch is in effect from Friday morning through Saturday afternoon for eastern Massachusetts, with the NWS warning that “moderate to major” coastal flooding that could inundate roads and basements and tear up beaches. Coastal flood watches are also in effect for much of Delaware and New Jersey, and parts of Queens and Long Island. Exacerbating the flood risk is the fact that this storm is due to coincide with the astronomical high tide—the full moon rises tomorrow. When the Sun, Moon and Earth are perfectly aligned, the gravitational tug-of-war causes the most extreme tides of the month. The coastal flood risk is expected to persist over three high tide cycles, thanks to the long-lived nature of this storm. “All three tides are expected to be in the top ten on record [for Boston], maybe in the top five,” Masters said said. Lastly, just in case you thought we were going to get through an entire weather post without mentioning climate change, you should know that for nor’easters as for hurricanes, sea level rise is adding inches to storm surge and making the coastal flooding threat worse. A recent study in Nature found that sea levels along the northern half of the Eastern seaboard have risen about an inch per decade since 1980, three to four times the global average rate. “That makes it a lot easier to get a record-high water level causing substantial damage,” Masters said.

Beth Skwarecki,"A hurricane’s category only tells you about its wind speed, but much of its devastation comes from flooding. With Hurricane Florence, some areas could see as many as 30 inches of rain plus ten feet of storm surge. What is a storm surge? The winds of a hurricane push water around, even while the storm is still in the ocean. Water that is pushed onto land becomes the storm surge. Think of how the tide can roll in from the sea and cover up land that was previously bare. It’s like that, except you have tides in addition to the storm surge, raising water levels even higher. Where does the storm surge happen? It’s not just an issue at the coast. Storm surges can cause flooding in upstream rivers, or in any low-lying areas the surge water reaches. North Carolina is so flat that the surge is expected to cause flooding many miles inland. How much flooding should we expect? Total flooding depends on the storm surge, including storm tides, plus rainfall. It varies depending on the exact contours of the land. And your safety in the storm depends on other factors as well: perhaps your house will be dry, but if all the roads are flooded, that doesn’t help you much. Bottom line, if you or a loved one are in the area, the most important map is an evacuation map. But if you’re curious about the predicted flooding, here is the storm surge prediction map from the National Hurricane Center. Predictions change as more information comes in, and the NHC notes that the map “includes many assumptions and has limitations, and it cannot tell you what amount of flooding will definitely occur at any given location.” Hurricane Florence is expected to make landfall along the Atlantic coast as early as this coming… Read more Read Rainfall predictions are shown on a separate map, and those predictions are likewise going to change as forecasters watch the storm approach.

Flooding has continued in swathes of Iowa, Missouri, and Nebraska, according to CNN.

Its rare for one to happen in the inland U.S., and this weeks storm resulted in severe weather across a massive stretch of the country.
Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts characterized the situation on Friday as historic flooding and extreme weather in nearly every region of the state. Flood teams throughout Nebraska have been rescuing stranded civilians since Thursday, CNN wrote.
CNN added that one man in the state, Columbus farmer James Wilke, received a distress call, headed out on his tractor, and died when a bridge collapsed:
According to CNN affiliate KMTV, a close family friend posted on social media about his last moments.
It is no surprise to anyone that knew James that when he got the phone call to assist emergency responders ... his answers would be yes, Jodi L. Hefti wrote on Facebook.
With the guidance of emergency responders, James drove his tractor over the Shell Creek bridge on the Monestary Road and the bridge gave out. James and the tractor went down into the flood water below.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"Waterways across the Carolinas and beyond swelled to record-breaking levels this week, with several rising more than 20 feet above their averages, according to National Weather Service data.

Christian Dreyer has seen this kind of flooding before, and he knows that the worst is yet to come.

The crew got some people out in vehicles, but in other cases, they had to drive boats up to their front doors. The flooding right now is caused mostly by storm surge, as the swollen ocean pushes rivers over their banks. It’s slow moving, Mr. Dreyer said, especially compared to the rushing floodwaters that will soon come from the opposite direction, down the rivers, as up to 40 inches of rain falls inland. “A surge is like a bathtub flooding,” said Mr. Dreyer, who is also a sergeant first class with the New Jersey State Police, as tornado warnings went off in the background. “When it comes down from the mountains, it’s all gravity.

 Rescue officials are trying to pump out water from the mine
Rescuers in India say they are hoping for a miracle to save 15 workers trapped inside a flooded coal mine in the north-eastern state of Meghalaya.
The men were trapped 11 days ago when sudden flooding blocked their exit. Officials hope they have found an air pocket in the main shaft to survive. 
Rescuers have been trying to drain the mine but have just two pumps and have asked for more resources. 
So-called ""rat-hole"" coal mining is widespread in the state, but illegal. 
Such mining involves digging pits into the ground to create a narrow hole to find coal. The trapped workers were inside one such mine in East Jaintia district.
""We are optimistic that the miners have found an air pocket [a dry area] in the main shaft, it will give us more time to reach them,"" Santosh Singh from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) said.
District authorities have asked the state government to provide better pumps to drain the shaft. Experts say the 370ft deep mine was particularly vulnerable to flooding since it was near a river. 
Most ""rat-hole"" miners are migrant labourers who come from neighbouring states to earn money.
Image copyrightSannio SiangshaiImage caption
 The miners have been trapped since mid-December
A complete ban on rat-hole mining was announced in 2014. Mine owners have since challenged the ban and some of their petitions are still pending in the Supreme Court. 
But the incident has highlighted that illegal coal mining continues to be rampant in the state.
Two activists were attacked last month, allegedly for collecting evidence of illegal coal extraction in East Jaintia district. 
The state's chief minister, Congrad Sangma, admitted to illegal mining in the area on Friday. ""We are doing all that we can to save the miners,"" he told reporters, adding that this practice ""was not acceptable"". 
Many in the district, which is rich in minerals and coal reserves, either directly or indirectly depend on such mines to earn money.
India is the world's third largest coal-producing nation and coal provides 60% of the country's energy needs, but the industry is poorly regulated. 
Workers, who are often faced with life-threatening situations, have little protection from health hazards.

Hawkins,"Bird released a new set of tools for cities that are struggling to manage the influx of shareable electric scooters flooding their streets — a phenomenon that the Venice, California-based startup helped create almost a year ago. The tools, which Bird calls its “GovTech Platform,” are intended to assist cities in better integrating e-scooters into their overall transportation networks, the company says. But it will only be applicable to Bird’s scooters, not those from other companies. The GovTech Platform includes a data dashboard for cities to track how its citizens are using electric scooters, as well as geofencing capabilities to prevent users from using or parking scooters in certain areas of the city. Bird has always offered anonymized data to cities in which it operates, but it admits that it can sometimes be clunky and difficult to parse through. In its initial release, the company’s dashboard will utilize API data on vehicle status and trips to create aggregated and categorized reports, in the hopes that it addresses any complaints for cities. Now with geofencing! With geofencing, the Bird app will tell riders locations within a city where e-scooters are prohibited. (This is sure to win supporters in New York City, where the company is pushing for legislation to legalize the use of e-scooters.) The company is updating its app to include easier ways for users to report unsafe riding, riding on sidewalks, or poor parking. And it will feature educational messages for riders about local rules and safety tips. The move comes as cities are increasingly passing new rules to regulate the use of app-enabled, dockless e-scooters that have exploded in popularity in recent months. While some celebrate their appearance as a quick, cheap, and non-polluting way to get across town, others held them up as the personification of tech-bro arrogance and complained that they were cluttering sidewalks and causing injuries. Already, scooters are available for short-term rental in over 60 cities in the US, and they are making inroads in Europe and the Middle East. San Francisco, where many of the first scooters appeared, is expected to announce the winners of five citywide permits in the coming days. As cities cracked down, the scooter startups have engaged in a concerted effort to rebrand themselves as willing partners that are ready to engage with lawmakers and public officials on ways to better integrate and regulate the dockless rideables. They’ve rolled out new products and initiatives that emphasize charitable giving, reached out to low-income communities, and vowed to contribute cash for infrastructure improvements. “The cities we serve are Bird’s number-one customer.” Bird’s GovTech Platform is the latest of such efforts. It’s aimed directly at building a sense of trust with cities and rebutting those criticisms that, in the initial months, scooter startups prioritized growth and scale over community outreach. “The cities we serve are Bird’s number-one customer, and partnering with them to deliver the data, insights, and products they need to advance their mobility programs and reduce congestion in their communities is essential,” said Travis VanderZanden, CEO and founder of Bird, in a statement. Bird is bringing in fresh blood to handle its expanding policy effort.

As aid began to pour in, neighbors across this blistered landscape tried to help one another.
Humanitarian groups are grappling with a double crisis: the brunt of the cyclone itself, and the severe flooding left in its wake.
Nearly a week after the storm hit, heavy rains were still endangering communities isolated by flooding, and complicating efforts by rescue workers to reach them. Rising floodwaters were threatening to partially submerge Buzi, a town of 200,000, not far from Beira, the United Nations warned.
Beira has become a place of refuge for people fleeing flooded areas, but on Wednesday, the whole town still lacked electricity. Cellphone service was extremely limited, and people thronged the few areas with connectivity along the main road.
Fallen trees had yet to be cleared from central Beira, an area with modern buildings and colonial Portuguese homes. Stores and other businesses were closed. There was no activity at the port, the sector that defines the city. Large stores owned by Indians and Chinese, more recent arrivals, were shuttered.
Roofs had been torn off many buildings, but the physical damage was limited.
The greatest destruction was found in the poor rural neighborhoods outside the city center. There, many poorly built houses had collapsed instantly when the storm hit.","Nearly a week after southern Africa was hit by one the worst natural disasters in decades, it was all rescue workers could do to try to reach the victims.",2019-03-20T23:15:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Rescuers Battle Flooding in Desperate Bid to Save Cyclone Victims,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/world/africa/cyclone-idai-rescue.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/20/world/20mozambique3/merlin_152347080_0a52cd69-308d-4aab-8299-e8666d2d11c5-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,flooding,1

ADEEL HASSAN,"A historic snowy winter is turning into record spring flooding across a wide area in the middle of the United States, as major rivers spill over their banks, break levees and inundate towns and farms. The governors of Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wisconsin have declared emergencies, and Iowas governor has issued a disaster proclamation. At least two people in Nebraska have died in the floodwaters, and two others are missing. 
Hundreds of families have fled their homes, especially in the Mississippi and Missouri flood plains, where levees were breached in many areas. Offutt Air Force Base, outside Omaha, said that one-third of the base was underwater on Sunday. Even the National Weather Service said it had to evacuate its offices in Omaha on Friday because of rising water.
Rain was the immediate cause. The Weather Services Omaha office recorded 1.37 inches last week; more fell to the north and west, with Norfolk, Neb., getting 2.27 inches Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lokoja, where the Niger and Benue rivers meet Heavy seasonal rains are a regular feature of life in Nigeria and towns close to the country's main rivers are particularly vulnerable. This year floods have killed at least 100 people with many thousands displaced, according to the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). A state of emergency has been declared in four of the worst-hit states: President Muhammadu Buhari has pledged $8.2m (£6.2m) for relief efforts. The NEMA has activated five local operation centres to coordinate emergency responses. Flooding regularly wreaks havoc in Nigeria: In 2017, floods affected 250,000 people in the eastern-central region In 2016, 92,000 were displaced and 38 died In 2015, more than 100,000 were displaced, with 53 deaths In 2012, devastating flooding forced two million Nigerians from their homes and 363 died, according to authorities ""Floods have become a perennial challenge with increasing intensity each year, leaving colossal losses and trauma,"" the Nigerian Meteorological Agency says. So why does Nigeria keep flooding, and is it getting worse? Affected areas Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Flooding near Kaduna River Nigeria hosts two of West Africa's great rivers: the Niger which enters the country from the north-west the Benue, which flows into Nigeria from its eastern neighbour Cameroon These two immense waterways meet in central Nigeria and then flow south as a single river on to the Atlantic Ocean. Much, though by no means all, of Nigeria's flooding occurs along these two rivers as their banks overflow in the rainy season. In 2012, hundreds of thousands of acres of land were flooded in Nigeria when the Benue and Niger over-spilled. That year, the Niger River reached a record-high level of 12.84m (42ft). In 2018, levels reached 11.06m, with fears that the heavy rain, expected to continue through October this year, could lead it to approach similar heights. There has also been extensive damage to farmlands, according ACAPS, a humanitarian data-analysis organisation, which is the mainstay of most livelihoods in the affected regions. Flooding is also caused by: the tidal movements of coastal waters, such as in the Delta region of the south-east saturated drainage systems, such as in the country's largest city, Lagos, in the south-west Are Nigeria's rains causing the floods? Heavy rainfall has certainly increased the likelihood of rivers overflowing and flash floods. And there's evidence to suggest increasing rainfall over time. Data from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency from 1981-2017, analysing 13 affected locations, reveals a rising trend in annual rainfall, which it says is likely to be a significant factor responsible for floods. But it's not just rain falling in Nigeria itself. Heavy precipitation upstream on the Benue and Niger rivers - in Cameroon, Mali and the country of Niger - contributes large volumes of water to Nigeria's river system, according to Zahrah Musa at the IHE Delft Institute for Water Education. Troublesome dams Another factor in Nigeria's flood problem are dams. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kainji dam Nigeria's three main electricity-generating dams, at Kainji and Jebba on the Niger river and the Shiroro dam on the Kaduna River, ""have become bloated"" by the heavy rains and excess water has had to be released downstream over the past month, says Hussaini Ibrahim, of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA). The uncompleted Zungeru dam, in Niger state, which is part-funded by the Chinese government, is also believed to be affecting areas once free from flooding. On the Benue River, the main concern is the Lagdo Dam, in neighbouring Cameroon, which has previously caused the river to swell by releasing water. In 2012, water flowing in from the Lagdo dam was blamed for 30 deaths in Nigeria. The Cameroonian authorities have yet to allow water to pour out from Lagdo during the current rainy season - but there are concerns in Nigeria that this might happen. Poor town planning Nigeria's population is expanding rapidly, currently estimated at 186 million, and the lack of proper town planning can make flooding worse in urban areas. ""Town planning in Nigeria is very weak,"" says Aliyu Salisu Barau, of Bayero University. ""These areas are affected by a lack of drainage networks."" The city of Lokoja, for example, at the meeting-point of Benue and Niger rivers, is particularly prone to flooding. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A man in a town near Lokoja, a heavily flooded area ""If you go to Lokoja, you see massive developments along the Niger River,"" says Mr Barau. These developments are almost always unregulated, with people building on floodplains, reducing the surface areas for water to travel, and without constructing drainage systems. Because of the unregulated nature of town planning, there's also limited information on how much land has been built on and therefore little assessment of the impact. In the city of Makurdi, for example, on the Benue river, Mr Barau says, ""one can see all forms of informal activities"" along the river bank. New land developments along the Niger River has more than doubled in Nassarwa and Kogi States, according to estimates. The dumping of waste in the streets can also prevent the steady flow of water and put pressure on the few urban drainage systems. It's also common, after the floods, for people to come back and start rebuilding in the same vulnerable areas. Hussaini Ibrahim, of the NSEMA, also points the finger at deforestation, which he says is happening across Nigeria. It's a resource that people use for fuel or to sell - but trees play an important role in storing rain-waters. Future floods If the impact of flooding is to be reduced in the future, the consequences of rapid urbanisation and poor urban planning need to be addressed. And greater co-operation with Nigeria's neighbours in the control of river levels will need to be achieved in order to avoid dangerous surges in water levels during the periods of heavy rain. The wider issue of the increasing rainfall levels identified by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency is one that some in Nigeria have attributed to climate change.",An estimated 100 people have died in floods.

MATT STEVENS,"Photo Brian Croteau loading sandbags onto his bike on Thursday in Provincetown, Mass., as he prepared for a powerful storm. Credit Steve Heaslip/The Cape Cod Times, via Associated Press A sprawling winter storm barreled toward the Atlantic Coast on Thursday and was expected to pound most of it with a potent mix of rain, snow, gusty winds and storm surge that forecasters warn could flood neighborhoods, knock out power and destroy homes. “Take this storm seriously!” the National Weather Service’s Boston branch warned on Twitter late Thursday afternoon. “This is a LIFE &amp; DEATH situation for those living along the coast.” The effects of the nor’easter, which could linger through Saturday or beyond, are expected to stretch as far south as Georgia and South Carolina, all the way north to Maine. Weather officials say 10 inches of snow — or perhaps more — could blanket parts of New York; some areas of New England could get three to four inches of rain; and some coastal towns are expected to be hit with winds of 50 miles per hour or more. Alerts have been issued up and down the coast, but experts are warning that some of the most severe flooding could occur in places like Cape Cod, Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts where the Weather Service said roads, basements and other structures could become inundated by three feet of water or more. In those areas, officials said, the most severe coastal flooding was likely to occur during the high tides Friday night and Saturday afternoon. “Some neighborhoods may be cut off for an extended time,” the Weather Service said in a written warning. “This is a dangerous storm, and evacuation of some neighborhoods may be necessary.” Winter Storm #Riley will become an intense #noreaster with locally major, long-lived coastal #flooding, high winds, and heavy, wet #snow that could lead to widespread power outages. https://t.co/XjELnjHJis pic.twitter.com/KAAcpib2cC — The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) March 1, 2018 The dire messages prompted Gov.

LEAH C. STOKES,"We say the extreme rain caused this disaster. We say it was the fire. And we say that multiple years of drought didn’t help. But what caused the rain, the fire and the drought? There is a clear climate signature in the disaster in Santa Barbara. We know that climate change is making California’s extreme rainfall events more frequent. We know it’s worsening our fires. We know that it contributed substantially to the latest drought. There are simpler stories we could tell. Stories with more proximate causes: Those people bought in dangerous places. Those people should have left their homes. Those people are somehow to blame. These events are normal. These things just happen there. But these simple stories mask a larger truth. How many times do we need to hear adjectives in their superlative form before we spot a pattern: largest, rainiest, driest, deadliest? Records, by their nature, are not meant to be set annually. And yet that’s what is happening. The costliest year for natural disasters in the United States was 2017. One of the longest and most severe droughts in California history concluded for most parts of the state in 2017. The five warmest years on record have all occurred since 2006, with 2017 expected to be one of the warmest yet again. I have researched climate change policy for over a decade now. For a long time, we assumed that climate policy was stalled because it was a problem for the future. Or it would affect other people. Poorer people. Animals. Ecosystems. We assumed those parts of the world were separate from us. That we were somehow insulated. I didn’t expect to see it in my own backyard so soon. Climate change devastated ecosystems, species and neighborhoods in Houston and much of struggling Puerto Rico last year. Now climate change has ravaged one of the wealthiest ZIP codes in the country. We know now that even the richest among us is not insulated. These extreme events are getting worse. But when I read the news after each fresh disaster, I rarely see a mention of climate change. Whether it’s coverage of a fire in my backyard or a powerful hurricane in the Caribbean, this bigger story is usually missing. To say that it is too soon to talk about the causes of a crisis is wrongheaded. We must connect the dots. Climate change helped cost my friends’ businesses’ revenue. Climate change helped put my community in chaos for weeks. Climate change paved the way for lost lives next door. If climate victims here and across the globe understood that carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels played a role in their losses, perhaps they would rise up to demand policy changes. We know this could happen because research from the political scientist Regina Bateson, now a congressional candidate in California, shows that being a crime victim can spur people into activism. Perhaps some of the people affected by the fires in California, the hurricanes in Puerto Rico and Texas, and the drought in the Dakotas will be similarly motivated. Maybe some of these climate change victims will become the climate policy champions we sorely need. It is never too soon after one of these disasters to speak truth about climate change’s role. If anything, it is too late. If we do not name the problem, we cannot hope to solve it. For my community, as much as yours, I hope we will.

ALAN BLINDER,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The center of Tropical Depression Florence has left the Carolinas. But the chaos that the storm unleashed is nowhere near finished. Days of record-breaking rain have pushed rivers over their banks, and water levels — still rising in some places — are unlikely to recede fully for days. The authorities and volunteers in North and South Carolina are carrying out rescues by air and water, curfews are in effect, and many thousands of people remain out of their homes. Here are the latest developments: • Wilmington, N.C., a city of about 119,000 residents, has been cut off, with roads leading to it submerged.

"Eliott C. McLaughlin, CNN","(CNN) After the deadly flooding of 2016, Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said Ellicott City was reduced to a ""war zone"" and likened it to the scene of disaster movie set. On Monday, Kittleman said the flooding of 2018 was much nastier. Authorities were still in the assessment stage on a soggy Memorial Day, trying to determine exactly how much worse. Particularly worrying, Kittleman said, is a 25- to 30-foot-wide hole just north of Main Street, where the ground appears to have buckled under the weight of the flooding. ""There are a lot of people whose lives are going to be devastated again, and they've been working so hard to come back and we just need to be there for them and to tell them... all of our resources are there to help them,"" Kittleman said. ""I can't imagine what they're going through. I couldn't imagine what they went through two years ago, and now it's even worse."" The first concern is people. Emergency responders conducted 30 rescues Monday morning as they continued their search for a missing man, identified as Eddison Hermond. Sarah Lopez was at a restaurant, attending a birthday party with Hermond when the flooding began, she told CNN. Hermond left to help a woman rescue her cat from a pet store. Witnesses returned and said Hermond slipped into the river and was carried away, said Lopez, whose husband met Hermond 20 years ago in the US Air Force. As rescuers continue searching for Hermond, there were no reports of deaths or major injuries as of early Monday, Kittleman said. The 2016 flood killed two people, when floodwaters swept away their vehicles. Gas and electricity have been shut down on Main Street, where water ran through buildings as if it were a tributary of the nearby Patapsco River, which swelled to record levels during Sunday's storms. The river is a major waterway that feeds into the Chesapeake Bay. Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric said it will need to survey the damage to its infrastructure before providing a timeline for restoring service. Flooding claimed the old courthouse, Kittleman said, and there are homes on the west end of downtown whose foundations and basements are gone. ""A lot of the businesses, the first floors are gone, like they were two years ago,"" he said. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency Sunday in Howard County. Marked by quaint shops in the bottom floors of brick, stone slab and siding-clad buildings, the historic downtown is a major draw in this community of about 66,000 people located about 12 miles west of Baltimore. Main Street, also known as Frederick Road, was transformed into a waterway over the weekend, as brown water sluiced through town, destroying shops and upending cars. In some areas, the water rose above the buildings' first floors. To understand what authorities were surveying Monday, it's perhaps helpful to understand what happened fewer than two years ago. After 6 inches of rain fell on the flood-prone community in about two hours, residents say the flooding came from nowhere in 2016. In addition to the two people killed, more than two dozen buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed. Residents formed human chains to pluck their neighbors from the rushing waters. Kittleman said at the time that it was the worst devastation in Howard County in 50 years, but the town rallied around the slogan ""Ellicott City Strong"" and got to the arduous work of putting their community back together again. When the rain came Sunday, many residents remained in the throes of recovery. The county was working on stormwater retention ponds and preparing to install additional piping. Money from a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant had just arrived and was slated for repairs and construction, Kittleman said. ""There are things that we are doing. It just can't be done in less than two years,"" he said. ""After the flood in 2016 and working on the recovery there, you can't get things done in a year or two. It just can't happen. And you saw, we get the money from FEMA two years later. That's how it works."" More than 8 inches in 15 hours The river rose 17.8 feet in two hours Sunday afternoon, to 24.1 feet, a record from the previous high of 23.6 feet. The National Weather Service, which issued a flash flood warning for southeastern Howard County through early Monday, reported that parts of the greater Baltimore area got isolated rainfall of more than 9 inches. Three to 6 inches was common throughout the metro area. In parts of Ellicott, more than 8 inches fell between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. Sunday, the weather service said. The eastern portion of the community saw more than 7 inches in that timespan, while the southwestern side of town received more than 5 inches of the wet stuff. There are possibilities that another inch could fall, the NWS said, and though that doesn't sound like much rain, it means trouble for the already saturated ground and burgeoning rivers. Aside from the Patapsco River, there are four other smaller waterways running through and around the Ellicott. The Howard County Department of Fire and Rescue Services urged residents to evacuate downtown or move to higher ground while rescue teams fanned out through the area. They're being asked to stay away from Main Street until authorities can ensure buildings are safe to enter. The Roger Carter Community Center is open for those who need a place to shelter. Gov. Hogan toured the area Sunday with Kittleman. He lamented the destruction, noting that just two weeks earlier, he had visited the historic downtown and spoken with business owners about rebuilding efforts. ""The place looked terrific,"" he said. ""It's just devastating because people have their lives tied up in this and went through a heck of a lot and came back and now they're starting all over again."" Kittleman expressed confidence Monday that Ellicott could make another comeback. ""This is where we're one Howard again, and we'll be one Ellicott City,"" he said. ""We will be stronger in the future. We really will, folks. This is not a place that gives in. We didn't give in in 2016. We're not going to give in in 2018."" Asked what he'd say to downtown business owners who have their doubts about reopening after being hammered twice in 22 months, Kittleman said he sees their side of things. ""I can totally understand what they're saying. If I was in their shoes, I'd probably be reassessing that myself."" CNN's Paul P. Murphy, Lindy Royce, Emanuella Grinberg and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","After the deadly flooding of 2016, Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said Ellicott City was reduced to a ""war zone"" and likened it to the scene of disaster movie set.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption Riverside communities are at risk of flooding after a string of emergencies at the hydroelectric project ""I was in Puerto Valdivia when the first alarm sounded. It was very chaotic. No-one knew whether to run for the hills or along the road, whether to grab the children or grab the elderly. Everyone was going crazy,"" says Teresa Jaramillo recalling the moment on 12 May when flash flooding hit her small riverside community. Puerto Valdivia is just one of the communities affected by a series of emergencies which have hit Colombia's largest hydroelectric dam project, Hidroituango. Tens of thousands of people living downstream from the dam have been evacuated and the emergencies just keep coming. Rising water The Hidroituango dam over the river Cauca, about 175km (110 miles) north of the city of Medellín, was just months from completion when on 28 April a landslide near the site blocked a tunnel built to divert the river's flow while construction was going on. As the project was almost finished, two other tunnels built for the same purpose had already been sealed by the company building the dam, Empresas Públicas de Medellín (EPM). This meant that the tunnel blocked by the landslide was the only remaining outlet. Image copyright Nicolas Bedoya Image caption The project was due to be finished by the end of the year Image copyright Nicolas Bedoya Image caption Supporters of the dam say it will eventually account for 17% of Colombia's power capacity Further landslides followed and with water levels rising and all outlets now blocked, EPM decided to flood the dam's turbine rooms on 10 May to release the river's increasing pressure on the structure. While the move caused irreparable damage to transformers and other systems which had already been installed in the turbine room, it did reduce water levels. But only two days later, one of the sealed tunnels naturally unblocked, causing water to gush through it and creating flash floods further downstream. Cut off Puerto Valdivia lay in the path of the flash foods. Fifty-nine homes, a school and a health centre were destroyed and more than 600 people were displaced. Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption Dozens of homes were destroyed in the flash floods on 12 May Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption Almost 25,000 people have been displaced and many had to seek shelter in gymnasiums León Taborda is one of them. ""The Cauca river took my house. What do I do?"" he asks. ""My wife doesn't want to return to Puerto Valdivia anymore, even if we could. The peace of mind I had there, I won't ever be able to regain it, not living there or anywhere else."" And Hidroituango's troubles seem far from over. Experts have warned that there is a renewed risk of landslides from nearby mountainsides which could block the water-intake tunnels for the turbine room, as well as the spillway, potentially compromising the integrity of the entire hydroelectric project. Image copyright Nicolas Bedoya Image caption The risk of landslides from the steep mountainsides remains Almost 24,000 people living downstream of the dam have already been evacuated due to this risk. Another 380 people living upstream have been displaced by the premature filling of the dam's reservoir. And the residents of Ituango, the town nearest the dam, have been left cut off after the only bridge connecting it to the rest of the country was submerged by the rising waters on 4 May. Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption Some bridges were submerged while others were destroyed by the force of the water Lack of food Community leader Teresa Jaramillo says the situation is particularly critical in rural communities which have been isolated for three weeks now. Even the areas not directly at risk of landslides or flooding have begun to feel the effects of the mass evacuation of the riverside communities and the lack of trade. Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption With many communities cut off,,locals are worried about a lack of supplies ""We only produce plantain and yucca. Everything else is beginning to run out, all other goods,"" rural leaders say. Many have so far ignored calls for them to evacuate their land but they say the lack of food is becoming an issue. ""If we have to go to the camps, well, we will have to, but Valdivia is also collapsing with so many people,"" one man said. Continuing risk At a recent news conference, EPM's CEO Jorge Londoño said that communities near the dam would continue to be at risk until the company had figured out a permanent solution. He suggested that in order to fix the problem, EPM would have to construct a new tunnel to reduce the levels of the flooded river in a controlled fashion, a process likely to take several months. Environmental activists, who have long opposed the hydroelectric project because of what they say are the inherent dangers in damming Colombia's second-largest river, complain about a lack of oversight. ""How can it be that the same company that is causing so much damage is the one pretending to provide the solutions?"" asks Isabel Zuleta, leader of local environmental organisation Ríos Vivos. ""What does that tell us? That in Colombia there is no one that controls the big corporations,"" she says. Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption Isabel Zuleta has long been opposed to the hydroelectric power project Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption She says residents no longer trust EPM to fix the problems With the entire workforce evacuated from the site again on Tuesday because of new warnings of landslides, many people living both up- and downstream from the megaproject are in a state of fear. Ms Zuleta says trust has been eroded. ""They said there was no problem, that there was no danger, that everything was under control."" Image copyright Pablo Cuellar Image caption After the flash flooding of 12 May, people living in riverside communities fear for their future She says that people do not want quick fixes but a river which is allowed to flow freely. But with the project far advanced - it was due to be completed by the end of the year - and its backers maintaining that it will account for about 17% of Colombia's power capacity, that is unlikely to happen.

WINNIE HU and PATRICK McGEEHAN,"After three days of delays and cancellations, stranded passengers at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City faced more misery on Sunday afternoon when a water main break disrupted flight schedules and closed bathrooms. A water main break in Terminal 4 sent people fleeing in a partial evacuation and left bags and suitcases in water. Entire areas of the terminal, including the heavily used bathrooms at both ends of the ground floor waiting area, were cordoned off. Outside, the taxi stand was shut down while the traffic lanes closest to the terminal were cleared. VIDEO from JFK water main break. pic.twitter.com/FfW1RoEXfZ — New York City Alerts (@NYCityAlerts) Jan. 7, 2018 “You would think with water mains breaking all over town they would have a contingency plan,” said Michael Rossiter, 54, of Jersey City. “A couple of guys with squeegees doesn’t seem to do the job.” As Mr. Rossiter waited, water spread across the terminal floor, flooding a diner and newsstand while terminal employees, state troopers and others rushed to sop up water with wide-brushed mops. Mr. Rossiter said he and his family “just want to get home — and now this.” The continuing chaos at the airport drew harsh condemnation from Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat of New York, who called Sunday for “a thorough review” of the airport and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to find out what went wrong, especially since Thursday’s storm had not come as a surprise. “They should have been way better prepared, plain and simple,” he said. “JFK has to follow the Boy Scouts’ motto: ‘Be prepared.’ They weren’t.” Mr. Schumer said he wanted to know what would be done to prevent this from happening again with more cold weather on the horizon.

MATT STEVENS,"Forecasters said they expect the Florida Panhandle as well as parts of eastern and central Alabama and western Georgia to get between four and eight inches of rain through Tuesday, with some isolated areas getting as much as a foot; they warned that flash flooding was possible in Florida, much of Alabama, and western Georgia. Storm surge in Florida could cause water to rise as high as three feet from the Aucilla River to Mexico Beach, they said. Isolated tornadoes were also possible over parts of Georgia and southeast Alabama. After the exceptionally destructive season last year, forecasters said last week that the possibility of a weak El Niño, along with near-average sea surface temperatures, suggest that this year’s hurricane season will be normal or only slightly more active than average. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s forecasters predicted a 70 percent likelihood of 10 to 16 named storms this year with winds of 39 miles per hour or higher. Hurricane season runs from June 1 until Nov. 1 and peaks from mid-August through late October. Last year, there were 17 named storms, 10 of which became hurricanes ; the first named storm was Arlene — a rare preseason tropical storm that arrived in April. “We’re not expecting the season to be one of the most active on record,” said Gerry Bell, lead hurricane season forecaster with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center. But, he added, “It’s time to start getting prepared.”","The storm struck Laguna Beach, Fla., just before 5 p.m. with wind speeds of about 45 m.p.h.

NORIMITSU ONISHI,"At the house, his daughter confirmed that the man, Francisco Madjai Mussengere, had been killed by a collapsing roof, and had died waiting for an ambulance blocked by debris. He was 71, she said, adding, He was able to ride the public bus for free.
His oldest son, Elias Francisco, 39, was busy preparing a simple eulogy. In an old, worn notebook, he had recorded the important dates of his fathers life: 1981, arrived in Beira; 1988, joins the Zion Church; 1991-1999, serves as a church elder; 2016, elected pastor.
He had one wife, the son read, and left behind five children and 28 grandchildren.
The family lived not far from a brick factory where Mr. Mussengere had long worked as a supervisor, said the daughter, Graca Francisco. He had left the capital, Maputo, in 1981 to come to Beira to work at the factory.
But after he retired, the factory owner reneged on a promise to build Mr. Mussengere a proper home, she and her brothers said. Instead, he lived in a tiny cinder-block structure.
The unfulfilled dream of a cozy retirement home gnawed at Mr. Mussengere in recent years so much so that he had instructed his children to keep fighting for a new house in the event of his death.
Now, that house has killed him, Ms. Francisco said.","Nearly a week after southern Africa was hit by one the worst natural disasters in decades, it was all rescue workers could do to try to reach the victims.",2019-03-20T23:15:30Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Rescuers Battle Flooding in Desperate Bid to Save Cyclone Victims,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/world/africa/mozambique-cyclone.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/20/world/20mozambique3/merlin_152347080_0a52cd69-308d-4aab-8299-e8666d2d11c5-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,flooding,1

 Townsville has received more than a metre of rain in just a week
Thousands of residents in and around the Australian city of Townsville have been warned of ""unprecedented flooding"" after dam gates were fully opened on Sunday as monsoon rains continued.
Rain in the state of Queensland, where Townsville is located, has swollen the Ross River dam beyond its capacity.
Officials earlier warned that up to 20,000 homes could be flooded.
Cars and livestock have already been swept away around the coastal city in the north-eastern state.
On Sunday, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology warned of ""risk to life and property"" as the dam gates serving the Ross River were ""opened to their full setting"". 
""Conditions will change rapidly and continuously. Stay informed, look for updates and follow advice of emergency services,"" the bureau said.
It added that the dam would release up to 1,900 cubic metres of water a second, a ""dangerously high"" amount.
Townsville has received more than a metre of rain in just a week - beating the previous record set in 1998, in what became known as the Night of Noah.

Several Midwestern states are reeling from historic flooding which hit the area a few weeks ago.
Thousands of people have been evacuated, and vast swathes of farmland has been destroyed. 
For many in Iowa, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Minnesota and South Dakota the recovery effort has been slow and painful, as people return to their homes.
As images of submerged farms were broadcast across the country, many looked for ways to help.
Here are some of the acts of kindness to emerge in the wake of the devastation.
'Any shoes are better than wet shoes'
When Addy Tritt, 25, noticed her local discount shoe shop was closing down she decided to buy out their entire stock.
Ms Tritt then donated the 204 pairs of shoes, valued at $6,000 (£4,555), to families affected by the floods. 
""I wanted them to go to people who actually needed them,"" Ms Tritt told CBS News.
After spending two hours negotiating with the the shop's head office, Ms Tritt paid just $100 (£76) for the entire stock. 
Image copyrightAddy TrittImage caption
 Addy Tritt donated 204 pairs of shoes to Nebraska flood victims
Of Ms Tritt's haul, 162 pairs were baby shoes, two were men's shoes and the rest were women's, according to the the Associated Press.
""Any shoes are better than wet shoes,"" Ms Tritt said. ""If people feel lost, they should try volunteering and donating. It gives me such fulfilment and I want others to feel the way I do.""
The shoes were part of a shipment to Nebraska farmers organised by a local student agricultural group. 
Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts said farmers were some of the worst affected by ""the most widespread destruction we have ever seen in our state's history"".
'Island hopping in Nebraska!'
With many roads in the region made impassable by floodwater, some volunteers took to the skies to rescue stranded residents. 
Adam Marshall, has been a private pilot for three years, and when he started to receive calls for help from people trapped in the nearby town of Fremont he fired up his small propeller plane. 
Mr Marshall told CNN that he has made more than 30 trips, and described it as ""island hopping in Nebraska"".
""My phone just started blowing up, and I told my wife, 'I think I'm going to be gone for a couple of days'.""
""I transported the entire Midland University dance team to Omaha so they wouldn't miss their commercial flight and a woman named Allie who has five kids and had been cut off from her family,"" he said.
Surrounded by rising floodwaters, Gary Fouraker was rushed to hospital after doctors suspected he had blood clots in his lungs. 
However, there was no room for his wife Marcia to travel with him in the helicopter. 
""I've never been scared like I was [at that point]"", Ms Fouraker told CNN. ""The roads weren't open.""
Mr Marshall came to her rescue, delivering Ms Fouraker to her husband's bedside an hour later. 
""I just really admire the way he, and so many other pilots, have really stepped up to help people,"" Ms Fouraker said.
""Most people had a look of relief when they got a ride,"" Mr Marshall reflected. ""I got a lot of hugs the last few days!""
'I've never escorted hay'
Derek Jilek, from North Dakota, knew he wanted to help when he saw photos of flooded farms across the Midwest. 
He posted on Facebook calling on his ""farm and ranch neighbours"" to donate a few hay bales to those who had been hit by the floods. 
Vast swathes of farmland was destroyed by the floodwater, and many farmers have struggled to feed their livestock.
What started as a small effort to collect donations, turned into a nine truck convoy carrying thousands of dollars worth of farming supplies and equipment. 
""I guess when you're helping or volunteering, I always heard that you do what you know. We know cows and we know trucking, so that's what we did,"" Mr Jilek told local news station WOWT. 
The convoy received a police escort for part of the 600 mile (965km) journey, with a new police department taking over as the trucks crossed county boundaries.
Sgt Dan Kensinger, from the Stark County Sheriff's Department, said, ""This was new to me. We've done funeral escorts and various other things. I've never escorted hay.""","As devastating flooding continues to affect the US Midwest, stories of kindness and charity have emerged.",2019-04-03T17:28:59Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Woman buys out shoe store to help flood victims,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47794159,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D474/production/_106288345_55816599-305810056731146-5839318225745084416-n.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,flooding,1
Shannon Connellan,"Japan is experiencing what could be one of the worst weather-related disasters in its history, following the heaviest rainfall the country has experienced for decades. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe warned of a ""race against time"" to rescue flood victims on Sunday, as emergency response teams in the country's western regions search for at least 60 missing, after floods and landslides caused by torrential rains killed over 100 people. SEE ALSO: California's wine country fire has been brewing for years Since the downpours started Thursday, evacuations had been ordered for up to 5.9 million people in 19 prefectures, according to The Japan Times, but this has been scaled back to 2 million since the weekend. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency is reported to have counted over 30,000 people accommodated in temporary evacuation centres as of Sunday. Some of the affected areas include Kyoto, Yamaguchi, Ehime, Fukuoka, Kagoshima, Hyogo, Shiga, Gifu, Kochi and Saga, with the Hiroshima and Okayama Prefectures among the hardest hit. It's the worst weather-related disaster in the country since 2011, when nearly 100 people were killed by two typhoons in August and September. The Times reports over 1,000 people in Okayama found themselves trapped on rooftops after the Oda River burst, with many rescued by helicopter or boat. It's hard to imagine this happening to you, but photographs taken of the affected areas bring these tragic events a little closer to home.

SANDRA E. GARCIA,"Tropical Storm Isaac was strengthening and the National Hurricane Center expected it to be upgraded to a hurricane by Sunday night. It was headed toward the Caribbean, but no warnings had been posted. In the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Helene was close to the Cabo Verde Islands off the coast of Africa and was expected to go out to sea after it passes the islands. In the Pacific, Tropical Storm Paul was southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. Forecasters expected it to remain a tropical storm and head out into the open water. A second tropical storm in the Pacific, Olivia, could threaten Hawaii in a couple of days, but it was too early to tell, Mr. Feltgen said. Having five systems in the Western Hemisphere is fairly common for this time of year. Sept. 10 is considered the statistical peak of the hurricane season, Mr. Feltgen, said, adding, “This is right on target.” Last year at this time, Hurricanes Irma, Jose and Katia were billowing in the Atlantic basin. “This is not unusual,” Mr. Feltgen said. “But there is no such a thing as just a storm.” Separately, parts of Ohio saw close to nine inches of rain over the weekend brought by the remnants of Tropical Storm Gordon. Ben Gelber, a meteorologist at the NBC affiliate WCMH-TV, described the rain as “really excessive,” noting that most of the state got three to five inches and some pockets saw as much as nine inches.","The National Hurricane Center warned of two life-threatening impacts, especially for South Carolina: storm surge at the coast and freshwater flooding from prolonged rain.",2018-09-09T21:05:54Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Hurricane Florence Strengthening and Targeting the Southeast Coast, Forecasters Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/09/us/hurricane-florence-isaac-weather-path.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/09/us/10-xp-florence/10-xp-florence-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,flooding,1
KAI SCHULTZ,"Cyclones occur in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean ; in the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific, such severe storms are called hurricanes. “There was no forewarning,” Sekhar Lukose Kuriakose, of the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority, said by telephone. “There was no scientific means of establishing that this was going to become a cyclone.” But fishermen, saying the government had been slow to notify people of the storm, organized protests on Saturday in Kerala and in Tamil Nadu, blocking roads and pooling resources and boats to try to locate the missing. Speaking to the families of missing fishermen in Tamil Nadu villages, India’s defense minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, said on Sunday that the country’s navy, air force and coast guard were doing everything possible to try to find the missing fishermen. “I speak with folded hands,” she told the crowd, in which wives of the missing fishermen wept. “We have not stopped searching for them.” Several hundred fishermen have been rescued, the Kerala disaster management agency said. The state has announced compensation payments of about $15,000 each for the families of those who have died. Mr. Kuriakose said that some of the missing fishermen had already been out at sea days before the cyclone formed. Before gathering force, the storm killed at least 13 people last week in neighboring Sri Lanka, uprooting trees, forcing schools to shut and disrupting air travel. The India Meteorological Department said the cyclone was expected to weaken gradually in the next couple of days as it moved north toward the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Heavy rainfall was forecast for the area on Tuesday and officials have advised fishermen in southern Gujarat and northern Maharashtra to stay on shore.

Nicole Gallucci,"Snow may be dominating headlines in the wake of Thursday's "" bomb cyclone,"" but coastal flooding has proven to be another serious danger in places along the East Coast. In addition to blizzard conditions, Massachusetts has been walloped with the combination of astronomical high tides and strong onshore winds up to 75 mph. The resulting coastal flooding reached record levels in Boston, with severe flooding reported all along the coast. SEE ALSO: A 'bomb cyclone,' explained Flood waters took over sidewalks and streets, trapped cars, and shut down subway stations. The severity of the floods, which exceeded the region's benchmark storm of the Blizzard of 1978, was caused by a combination of high astronomical tides from Monday's supermoon, the timing of the storm that brought the strongest winds onto the coast at high tide, and a rising sea level over the past few decades. Perfect storm of ingredients for a major coastal flood 1) Supermoon Monday (high astro tides) 2) Worst of the storm hitting *at* high tide 3) Ice hunks chucked ashore from recent arctic cold 4) Some sea level rise since 1978 also 'helps' — Eric Fisher (@ericfisher) January 4, 2018 'The Blizzard of 1978' gets some competition In February of1978 a winter storm struck New England that set records and killed 54 people. Much like that benchmark storm, this year's bomb cyclone's high tides and fierce winds meant a lot of flooding. In Boston back in '78, waves reached higher than 10 feet. Thursday's images of seawalls being breached and water pouring into streets were eerily reminiscent of the major blizzard 40 years ago.

Down by the aquarium, the water is coming up onto part of the harbor walk. “I’ve never seen anything close to this,” Rene Miller, a resident in a nearby building, said. “There was water over my boots, in the road.” (Also: dog out with owner) pic.twitter.com/uryAseE4kO — Steven with a ph (@steveannear) January 4, 2018 In an afternoon tweet, Boston's National Weather Service forecast office noted that though water from the coastal flooding will take hours and perhaps days to drain, they believe the worst is behind them. But super cold temperatures coming in next will likely cause water that's washed ashore to freeze. Other parts of Massachusetts and the Northeast Boston isn't the only part of Massachusetts that experienced flooding. Cities like Salem and Gloucester also saw treacherous water levels as the snow fell. Coastal flooding has also affected Maine and New Hampshire, as well as New Jersey, among other states. Meanwhile in Baltimore, the same bomb cyclone brought powerful winds out of the west, which pushed water away, bringing in the lowest tide levels since 1997.","Snow may be dominating headlines in the wake of Thursday's "" bomb cyclone,"" but coastal flooding has proven to be another serious danger in places along the East Coast.

MIHIR ZAVERI,"Tropical Storm Lane drenched parts of Hawaii with about four feet of rain as it crept past the state on Saturday, causing flash floods and prompting evacuations even as it dissipated over the islands’ rugged slopes. The storm had weakened over several days from a Category 5 storm, with maximum winds now reaching up to 60 miles per hour, according to the National Weather Service. But its plodding pace — just 3 m.p.h. — prolonged the rains. Some 46 inches fell on the eastern side of the Island of Hawaii, where landslides shut down roads and search-and-rescue efforts were underway. Flash flood warnings were still in effect on Saturday morning. Kelly Wooten, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii County Civil Defense, which has been coordinating the emergency response in hard-hit areas on Hawaii Island, said the agency had not yet been able to assess the damage from the storm. She said police, fire and other departments were working to keep people off the roads, as some areas were still under water. Ms. Wooten said no injuries or deaths had been reported so far. The county would be clearing debris and opening closed roads over the next few days, she added, as it recovered from a series of landslides.","Although Lane was downgraded to a tropical storm and its winds are forecast to weaken, rainfall totals are increasing, and the authorities warn of dangerous flash flooding.",2018-08-25T18:45:23Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Hurricane Lane, Now a Tropical Storm, Batters Hawaii With Heavy Rain",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/25/us/hawaii-hurricane-lane-tropical-storm.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/26/us/26hawaii/26hawaii-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,flooding,1

Dell Cameron,"Fake comments submitted to a federal agency after a notice of proposed rulemaking is something that, even just a few years ago, no one would’ve really given two shits about. Even typing “notice of proposed rulemaking” right now is making me incredibly sleepy. But after 24 million comments were filed in response to the FCC’s Restoring Internet Freedom Order (that’s the one that killed net neutrality), Americans from all walks of life suddenly began paying attention to erstwhile- borrring bureaucratic procedures that, were it not for the net neutrality fight’s energizing effect, would’ve been like listening to Ben Bernanke discuss the Great Depression’s effect on credit intermediation after swallowing a bottle of Ambien. So here we are: Instead of playing on their phones, high school students were watching an FCC open meeting in class, of their own volition, and groaning loudly (the way they do) every time someone used a dummy phrase like “heavy-handed” or “light-touch regulation,” which is sadly every five to 10 seconds. But it’s not just rowdy internet freedom fighters getting drowned out by swarms of fake comments aimed at convincing federal regulators the public feels one way when, in reality, the complete opposite is true. As The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, fake comments criticized a proposed Labor Department rule that would “require investment advisors handling retirement accounts to act in the best interest of clients.” Among a group of 50 people who allegedly filed comments on the rule and were contacted by the Journal, 40 percent said they didn’t actual write the comment that was filed using their name, address and phone number. One of the comments, supposedly filed by a Pennsylvania man who later agreed to go on the record and say he never wrote it, read: “I do not need, do not want and object to any federal interference in my retirement planning.” It’s mostly known by now that while federal agencies have to accept public comments, they don’t actually have to consider any of what they say. Nevertheless, making a “materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent” statement to a federal agency (like, say, using someone else’s name without their consent) is a felony. This apparently happened millions of times during the FCC’s rulemaking process. But the agency’s Trump-appointed chairman, Ajit Pai, has declined to aid any law enforcement investigation into the matter—partly, we assume, because the lead investigator, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, is turning out to be one of the administration’s worst nightmares. Whereas the FCC established a rule that its IT team wouldn’t do anything to block fake comments—mostly out of concern that it would be accused of censoring comments that didn’t align with its political agenda—the Labor Department told the Journal that its happy to delete any comments reported to be fraudulent. In addition to the Labor Department and the FCC, the Journal also reported that it has identified fake comments plaguing dockets at three other federal agencies. While it’s easy to comprehend why someone would seek to tamper with the FCC’s comment system at the height of the net neutrality debate—its high number of comments serving as an indicator of exigent and widespread public concern—one has to wonder what kind of sick bastard would try to game a rulemaking process that affects how senior citizens receive retirement advice. Is there no decency left?

Aimée Lutkin,"Hurricane Florence has hit the North Carolina coast, already causing massive flooding in inland towns along rivers. Meteorologists are anticipating that Florence will linger and move further inland over the weekend, which means a lot of people are going to need rescue and relief. Here’s how you can help. Local Organizations Though it’s quite easy to donate to the American Red Cross via text, and they’re incredibly well-known across the country, they’re also an organization that’s been plagued with accusations of mismanagement and other mistakes. In general, it’s often best to contribute to local groups who have a better idea of what’s needed and a smaller internal infrastructure sucking up money. For the purposes of this article, we’re focusing on those. The North Carolina Community Foundation (NCCF) is a “highly-rated charity currently providing aid to the Carolinas ahead of Florence” according to ABC News, and it partners with local charities, so you know your money is being directed by people most familiar with the area. Here’s their website for donations. There are also South Carolina and Georgia state chapters of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster who each offer recommendations of which relief organizations they would choose, if you want to investigate where your money is headed. Finally, there’s The North Carolina Disaster Fund, which purports to assist with “unmet needs in the aftermath of a disaster.” These are the groups that will be in the Carolinas helping people get back on their feet long after the waters recede. Team Rubicon Team Rubicon is a group of military veterans who mobilize for rescue efforts in disasters. According to their website, they have 9,979 volunteers across VA, NC, SC, and GA and have already positioned equipment and boats along the coast to sweep in where they’re needed. Americares Americares focuses on health in disaster relief, and they currently have a response team ready for North Carolina: “The storm is on track to make a direct hit on the East Coast and impact much of the southern United States in the coming days,” Americares Director of Emergency Response Brian Scheel said in a statement Monday. “Our response team has been activated and is ready to meet the immediate health needs in affected communities.” Donations to Americares are directed to emergency medicine and other health supplies, and you can contribute here. GlobalGiving GlobalGiving supports local and grassroots groups working to restore areas hit by disasters, and they’ve already started their Hurricane Florence relief fund. Some of that money will be directed towards immediate needs, but much of it will go towards long term projects restoring the community once the storm has passed. Things are… not great now. Hurricane season is clobbering the Caribbean, earthquakes are plaguing… Read more Read American Humane and the Charleston Animal Society Don’t forget our furry friends. Vulnerable animals will need to be rescued from homes where they are abandoned and shelter animals will also be in need.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Rescue workers are concerned about what might happen when monsoon rains hit Rescuers in Thailand are racing against the weather to free 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. Heavy rains are expected to hit in a matter of days and could see water levels rise, threatening the area where the group has taken refuge. The region of Chiang Rai has for the past few days experienced a brief window of dry weather. Rescuers are now considering how best to bring the group to safety. ""We are racing against time before we found them,"" Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osotthanakorn said at a press conference on Thursday morning. ""Now we are racing against water."" Media caption Bill Whitehouse from the British Cave Rescue Council explains how the boys and their coach might be rescued If the rain stops for long enough, there is a possibility that the group could walk out of the Tham Luang cave complex, rather than having to dive. The total journey from the cave's entrance to the trapped group currently takes a total of 11 hours - six hours in and five hours back out. Many of the boys can't swim, and all will have to be taught basic diving skills if they are to leave that way. Helier Cheung, BBC News, Tham Luang cave Rescue teams are working in extremely difficult conditions. The heat has been sweltering and unrelenting, at over 30C, while much of the site is submerged in squelchy mud that is several inches thick in places and extremely slippery. But the work has continued at an unrelenting pace - as everyone is aware that, once the monsoon rains start, rescue efforts will be much more difficult. Meanwhile, hundreds of workers are helping to keep the site in order, with road engineers laying gravel to try and secure the mud, workers for the Thai royal kitchen providing hot food for everyone, and volunteers handing out water bottles and ice lollies to those on site. One local civil servant, who had volunteered to help hand out supplies, said he did not know the boys personally but had decided to help because ""I consider the boys in the caves as my brothers"". The Thai military has previously said that if they can't dive out, the group may have to wait up to four months for flooding to recede before they can leave. Food and other supplies are being put in place for that outcome. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Rescuers are working around the clock to pump water out of the Tham Luang cave complex Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda later stressed the urgency of the evacuation, adding that rain was forecast ""in the next few days"", the Bangkok Post reported. Attempts are being made to reduce the risk of further flooding by pumping water from the cave system, Mr Anupong said. Water levels have dropped by more than 40cm (15in) since Wednesday, with rescue workers now able to walk through a 1.5km (0.9 mile) stretch from the entrance to what's being called the third chamber. Media caption The boys can be seen introducing themselves next to a diver in a wetsuit About 128 million litres of water had been pumped out by Thursday, with the water levels coming down at an average rate of 1.5cm per hour. The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach went missing on 23 June. It is believed they entered the cave when it was dry and sudden heavy rains blocked the exit. They were found on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the mouth of the cave on Monday night by two British rescuer divers.

Jennie Dusheck,"Climate change used to seem like something that would confront our grandchildrena distant concern. Now, though, its staring us right in the face when we get up in the morning. People wade through seawater on sunlit Miami streets ; the Florida Panhandle, which rarely sees hurricanes, was recently flattened by a megastorm; and every year bigger and more frequent wildfires burn through Australia and California. As our planet warms up, the climate-related changes across the U.S. are well underway. Even if you havent had to cope with climate related problems yet, it may not be long before you have to protect your home from extreme weather, fire, flooding, or even sea level rise. To find out how climate change may affect your area, check out climate risks by region using the U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit. A short video introduces the different parts of the website. You might want to go to the Steps to Resilience section that offers way to assess and reduce your risk. For example, your flood risk depends not just on your own home and where it sits, but also on things like how the city has channeled nearby creeks and what size culverts your local department of public works has installed beneath your street or road. When it rains harder than ever before, undersized culverts may be overwhelmed and creeks can back up and jump their banks, flooding homes and roads. In Santa Cruz, California, the citys climate action manager Tiffany Wise-West, PhD, has posted a detailed action plan, including a Practical Adaptation Actions for Residents. Were not covering every little thing, she says, but the Citys simple web page is a place for ordinary people to start. Santa Cruz County is one of the rare places that already has a detailed plan for the future. Ask your city and county government if they have a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan like this one. But even if your area doesnt, you can rough out a way to address the specific risks your home could face. In general, climate change experts talk about two ways of addressing climate change, preventing it and dealing with the consequences. Here we are focused on dealing with the consequences of climate change, sometimes called climate adaptation. Sea Level Rise Is your seaside condo at risk of looking like the castle in the bottom of a goldfish bowl? To find out, look up your area on Climate Centrals Surging Seas Risk Zone Map. Older climate models predict 1 to 4 feet of sea level rise by 2100. But depending on how quickly major ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica collapse, the sea could rise a dozen meters or more. For now, we dont know for sure when that might happen. For example, East Antarctics largest ice sheet is threatened by warm sea water slipping underneath it. That could set the front of it afloat and allow the massive landbound part to slide into the seaenough to raise global sea levels by nearly four meters (12 feet). Wise-West says the Santa Cruz plan is about the same whether the sea rises a meter in 80 years or sooner. Its just a matter of moving up the schedule, she says, looking serious. If you look at Port Arthur, Texas, on the Surging Seas website and set sea level to one meter (3 feet), you can glimpse the future. Here is Port Arthur today: Port Arthur is home to 50,000 people and the largest oil refinery in the United States. Heres what it could look like with one meter of sea level rise: That means that if you lived in Port Arthur, youd have to think about not only how sea level rise would affect your own backyard, but also how it would affect the oil refinery and how that would affect you. Thats a lesson to cast your net wide when thinking about how climate change might affect you through indirect effects. Go to your own address on the Surging Seas website and see what one meter of sea level rise looks like. Maybe your home is fine but the nearest fire station, the grocery store, and a power plant 30 miles down the coast will all be underwater. Think about the infrastructure you count on. Will it be okay? If the front steps of your condo are underwater, check your insurance policy to see, first, if you have purchased flood insurance and, second, if storm surges and sea level rise are covered. Have an emergency kit and an emergency plan for evacuating in case of a storm surge. But think longer term, too. You could put stilts under your house.

But there is a difference. Floods eventually recede. Even with climate change, it might be 10 or 50 years before another flood occurs in that location. Sea level rise not only doesnt recede, it will keep rising for the foreseeable future. If the sea is lapping at your driveway at high tide, it will be at your doorstep in time. If you are in doubt about whether your home could be affected by sea level rise, its not too soon to start thinking about moving inland, whether thats a just mile to higher ground or to another state. Boise, Idaho, is lovely and livable. Hotter Summers Government maps can help you estimate how much hotter itll get where you live. Phoenix, for example, is expected to go from about 92 days a year over 100 degrees F to 132 days a year by 2060. Until you move to (really lovely) Boise, here are a few things that will help protect your house from extreme heat: Paint your house white, and use the palest roofing you can find. Plant trees around your house to provide shade. Seal every crack in your attic. Insulate the attic and walls. Dont run an attic fanit may cool off the attic, but it will suck cool air right out of your house. Seal all gaps around electrical outlets or pipes coming through the wall. Weather strip your doors and replace leaky windows. Use fans to pull in cooler air in at night. Extreme Wind Hurricanes are becoming more powerful and more common. This is because warmer ocean water adds energy to tropical storms as they form. Meanwhile, tornados are occurring farther east than they used to and even showing up in unlikely places, such as California. Both kinds of extreme wind destroy buildings by ripping off roofs and hurling heavy objects through the air. Most building codes were written for relatively mild winds. You can build a house like this one that will withstand a category 5 hurricane. But if thats not in your budget, make your own house a bit sturdier with wind-resistant roofing, garage doors, and storm shutters. As always, be prepared to evacuate to a safer place when hurricanes are headed for your house.","Climate change used to seem like something that would confront our grandchildren—a distant concern.

Catie Keck,"Washington, DC, has a serious rat problem on its hands, and it has little to do with the shady goings-on at some of the highest levels of government. No, were talking real, honest to god rat kings who are wreaking havoc on the nations capital. The Associated Press reported Wednesday that the DC region is facing a serious problem with Rattus Norvegicus, or the brown rat, an infestation thats being exacerbated by both a population spike as well as mild winters. With their numbers on the rise, DC now trails New York and Los Angeles for its rat population, the Associated Press reported: The pest control company Orkin ranks Washington as Americas fourth Rattiest City, based on the number of new service calls per year. Thats up one spot from the previous year and just behind Los Angeles and New York; Chicago has been ranked No. 1 for four consecutive years. While Washington doesnt boast New Yorks famous subway monsters, anecdotal evidence is piling up that the rodents are on the march. In September, a viral video showed security camera footage of a rat pulling a fire alarm, forcing the evacuation of an apartment building. Even more unnerving is the ability with which our rat overlords are apparently adapting. Andre Pittman, an employee with the Health Department, told the Associated Press: Rats adapt to everything. They can be like geniuses. Officials are using everything from dry ice to poison to try to keep their numbers at bay, to no avail. Weve known some time that the areas rat population is a serious issue. The Washington Post reported in August that DC saw a record number of rat-related reports to the citys non-emergency line, with more than 5,300 in 2017, up 50 percent from the year before. Mark Eckenwiler, vice chair of a local Advisory Neighborhood Commission, described DCs rodent problem to the paper as an eternal war. And Capitol Hill is among the areas where the rodents numbers are highest, the Post wrote: The neighborhood with the highest number of complaints in 2017 was Petworth, followed by Columbia Heights, Capitol Hill, Near Northeast, 16th Street Heights, Logan Circle, Park View, U Street and Shaw. Complaints in those neighborhoods represented about 43 percent of the complaints lodged last year. From 2016 to 2017, those neighborhoods saw between a 25 percent to 74 percent increase in rodent complaints. This year, they are on pace to see a repeat or increase in the number. Rats are notorious procreators and can breed throughout the year, and consistently mild winters in DC are evidently allowing them to do just that, according to the Associated Press. Beyond that, the issue is also linked to the rising number of people in the area. Gerard Brown of the Department of Healths rodent control division told the Associated Press: More people with more money means more restaurants, which means more garbage, which means more rat food. All-out rat anarchy is imminent, comrades. Brace yourselves.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","South Carolina has been dealing with flooding since Florence arrived at the coast on September 13. More than a week later, the situation is only worsening for some coastal residents. Potentially record-breaking flood waters are set to inundate areas that didnt see much flooding last week along the northeastern coast of South Carolina, home to the popular Grand Strand beaches. Thats because rain can take a little while to travel downhill through rivers and streams before reaching the ocean. In this case, were talking about rain making its way through the Yadkin-Pee Dee River Basin, which covers more than 7,000 square miles from northern North Carolina to the South Carolina coast. You can think of the Yadkin-Pee Dee River Basin as a bathtub, according to Frank Alsheimer, the science and operations officer at the National Weather Services office in Columbia, South Carolina. This particular event is extremely uncommon. It doesnt matter where you fill up a bathtub with water, its going to fill up anyway because you have edges on either side, Alsheimer told Earther. Any rain that falls, all the way up this far north as northern North Carolina, gets into the basin and very slowly drains down toward the coast. This drainageinto the communities in Georgetown County, South Carolina, as well as the cities of Conway and Myrtle Beachcould affect up to 30,000 people in the area, said Derrec Becker, the chief communications officer at the South Carolina Emergency Management Division to Earther. No mandatory evacuations are in place yet, but many are self-evacuating as they brace for more water. The 11 shelters in South Carolina are just 3 percent occupied so far, Becker told Earther. [The flooding is] probably going to get more severe, he said. Currently, flood waters along the Waccamaw River near Conway, South Carolina, sit at about 20.75 feet, Alsheimer said. This already breaks the previous record of 17.9 feet. And its more than 10 feet above the flood stage for the Waccamaw River, which is fueling the dangerous situation in these areas. Still, an additional two feet of floodwater is forecasted to impact the region by Wednesday. The record-breaking nature of the flood threat speaks to the fact that while rainfall tends to be localized along the basin, this time, the basin got hit from all angles. This particular event is extremely uncommon, Alsheimer said. Were talking about unprecedented levels we havent seen before, and because of that, were going to have a lot of personal suffering of people who live in areas that were never flooded before but will be flooded because of this event. This storm has already left at least 42 people dead throughout North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. Its laid the groundwork for a public health crisis due to released animal feces, carcasses, and toxic waste. And some places havent even seen the worst of it.","South Carolina has been dealing with flooding since Florence arrived at the coast on September 13.

Danny Crichton,"Never ask a wireless engineer working on the NYC subway system “What can go wrong?” Flooding, ice, brake dust, and power outages relentlessly attack the network components. Rats — many, many rats — can eat power and fiber optic cables and bring down the whole system. Humans are no different, as their curiosity or malice strikes a blow against wireless hardware (literally and metaphorically). Serverless software deployment to the cloud, this is not. New York City officially got wireless service in every underground subway station a little more than a year ago, and I was curious what work went into the buildout of this system as well as how it will expand in the future. That curiosity is part of a series of articles I’ve written on an observed pattern known as cost disease, the massively inflating costs of basic human services like health care, housing, infrastructure, and education. The United States spends trillions of dollars on each of these fields, massively outspending similar nations for little and often even negative gain. Despite the importance of reining in costs, experts are befuddled at the underlying causes of cost disease amid a laundry list of potential factors, including complicated procurement processes, labor rules, underinvestment in software, productivity gains in affiliated fields, environmental regulations, and the list goes on. I explored a bit about health care, and the skyrocketing costs in that field, despite the fact that few people in the industry understand those costs at all. Activity-based costing appears to be one potential solution there that startups are pursuing. I also looked at California High Speed Rail and the massively spiraling costs of that boondoggle, as well as some of the startups trying to improve efficiency in that category. This past week, I explored the challenges of what appears at first glance to be a relatively simple problem: how do you get wireless service in New York City subway tunnels? Cellular technology is hardly novel, and transit systems throughout the world have been able to modernize in some cases more than a decade ago. While riders may desperately want their YouTube videos underground, the real value of such a system is for the business operations of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (the MTA, which operates the NYC subway among other commuter rail and bus systems). Ticketing systems, arrival time indicators, emergency services, and other critical services are all run through this wireless system. There is in fact a startup working on the problem, Transit Wireless. The company was formed in 2005 to respond to a request for proposals from the MTA and filled with veteran telecom executives. The authority rewarded the contract to Transit Wireless, which now holds a 27-year license to operate cellular service in the subway system. William Bayne, the CEO of the company, explained that an important component of the contract was that the company couldn’t rely on taxpayer funding. “Our license requires us to design, build, own, operate, and finance the network,” he said. Transit Wireless raised its own equity capital to cover the costs of deploying the system, and generates revenues as the service provider over the life of the license. In fact, MTA receives a stream of revenue from Transit Wireless as well. The company faced a number of challenges in building out the system. The first challenge was that the installation could not disrupt transit customers. Bayne said, “We had to figure out how to deploy network and equipment while minimizing disruption of the transit system itself.” That meant working overnight when labor costs are higher, and also placed the company at the mercy of the MTA’s maintenance windows to install network equipment. Even more challenging was securing the right equipment. The NYC subway “is a 110-year-old system with low ceilings and lots of water, and it wasn’t designed to embrace a lot of electronics,” Bayne said. Wireless equipment “had to withstand all of these changes in environmental conditions: cold, heat, water, brake dust. Everything had to be passively cooled and fully-enclosed so it didn’t ingest any of the environment into the equipment.” That specialized, “mil-spec” equipment doesn’t come cheap. As with the story of any infrastructure, particularly in New York, rolling out wireless connectivity to 282 active underground stations was anything but cheap. The final cost of the rollout was north of $300 million for Transit Wireless, a dramatic increase from early estimates which said that the project would cost “ up to $200 million.” As a private entity spending private dollars, the company obviously had enormous incentives to hold down costs. Perhaps more importantly for riders and the MTA itself, the timeline of the project ended up dragging. The first six stations in the system began offering wireless services in September 2011, about six years after the original contract signing. In the MTA’s announcement, the remainder of the rollout was expected to happen “within four years,” but another six years would actually pass before all remaining underground stations got service around New Year’s Day 2017. In all, it took about twelve years from contract signing to project completion. While the costs and time required to build out the network were significant, Transit Wireless believes that the infrastructure it has built will stand the test of time. It designed the system to be “future-proof” by installing a fiber optic backbone with significantly more capacity than needed to handle whatever new technology might come, such as 5G wireless services. It also built a series of five data centers that act as data infrastructure hubs for the subway system, potentially lowering the cost of offering new services in the future. The company, whose network spans much of New York City, hopes to be a core provider of smart city services in the future. Bayne envisions a world where real-time information about transit systems could be fused together, giving consumers access to smart transportation solutions — think connecting Uber and Lyft to smart bikes, parking meters, and the subway system to create a seamless, adaptive transportation system. In addition to the smart city initiatives, Transit Wireless obviously is eyeing the tunnels as one of the most important infrastructure challenges going forward. Given the age of the tunnel construction, they are much narrower than the engineering standards used today for modern transit systems. In some cases, installed equipment has to fit within just a handful of inches of space lest a moving train rip the equipment right off the wall. “We have to be extremely precise on how we deploy equipment in there to be very precise to stay within those clearance envelopes,” Bayne said. Currently, the company is offering a pilot demonstration of tunnel service on the shuttle between Times Square and Grand Central Station, which launched in December. The lessons of the rollout are ultimately a question of desires from transit customers (who also happen to be voters) — how badly do we want new infrastructure, and how much are we willing to be inconvenienced to get it? We can’t have nice things today and also want no schedule changes in a system that operates 24/7 every day of the year. Unless we as transit riders say loudly and clearly “inconvenience me today for a better tomorrow,” keep expecting the same compromises to happen.

"Nicole Chavez, CNN","(CNN) Water appears to have receded in some areas of the Carolinas, but more flooding from Hurricane Florence could arrive through the weekend, officials say. More than a dozen rivers in North and South Carolina already have overflowed their banks and the water -- particularly the Waccamaw River, which spans both states -- is expected to swell putting additional residents in harm's way. Officers were going door-to-door along the river in Brunswick County, North Carolina encouraging residents to evacuate. President Donald Trump met with first responders in Conway, South Carolina on Wednesday and warned them of the danger of rising rivers. ""It's going to get rough for South Carolina,"" he told them. ""You're going to have a rebuilding process, and we are behind you from day one,"" Trump said, calling this the ""calm before the storm, because you're going to have a lot of water."" Conway's city spokesman Taylor Newell said water could be ""4 feet higher"" there than when Hurricane Matthew struck in 2016. In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents to ""stay alert"" as water rises. ""People in flood prone areas or near waterways need to remain alert as rivers crest and stay above their banks in coming days,"" Cooper said. Bodies of women trapped in flooded police van recovered There are still unanswered questions surrounding the deaths of two mental health patients who drowned Tuesday in a prison transport van swept away by rising floodwater in South Carolina. The victims, whose bodies were recovered by divers on Wednesday, were identified as Windy Newton, 45, and Nicolette Green, 43, the Horry County Sheriff's Office said. The women were being transported by sheriff's deputies from a hospital in Loris and from the Waccamaw Center for Mental Health in Conway to McLeod Health Darlington, CNN affiliate WPDE reported. The two deputies escaped the vehicle but were unable to open the doors to get the women out, authorities said. They have been placed on administrative leave, the sheriff's office said. ""We are sorry,"" Horry County Sheriff Phillip Thompson told reporters Wednesday. ""We take a lot of pride in what we do. We work hard to protect and to serve our citizens. We are just very sorry that this event has taken place."" The investigation has been handed over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and the sheriff's office has launched an internal investigation, officials said. The women are among at least 36 people who have died because of the storm. Thousands remain in shelters More than 8,100 people are taking refuge at dozens of shelters across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, according to the Red Cross. Of those, approximately 7,800 are in shelters in North Carolina. Some residents are waiting until the floodwater recedes from their homes. Others can't get to their neighborhoods because the extensive road closures or simply because they don't have a ride home. And some who went home have returned after finding out they don't have power, CNN affiliate WRAL reported. Roads have been so impassable in Kinston, North Carolina, the National Guard has used helicopters to distribute water. In Conway, South Carolina some residents were heading home Wednesday but only to collect their belongings and evacuate again after officials say more flooding could be on the way. ""We are cautioning everyone not to be overconfident,"" City Administrator Adam Emrick said. ""The water is going to come back up. We are worried about Friday."" Chris Ross has been staying at a shelter since he fled his Fayetteville home about a week ago when the National Guard pulled people out of his neighborhood. ""People can only take so much,"" Ross told WRAL. ""It's wearing on a lot of people here, trying to keep their sanity together."" Even after farmers moved thousands of animals to higher ground ahead of the storm, many have suffered losses. North Carolina farms lost an estimated 3.4 million poultry birds and 5,500 pigs, the state Department of Agriculture &amp; Consumer Services said. Allison Cavenaugh and her husband, who own a home and a poultry farm with 80,000 chickens in Wallace, North Carolina, returned home for the first time this week on a boat just to find out that their chickens have drowned. ""It's all gone,"" Cavenaugh told WRAL. North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler, who conducted an aerial survey of damage on Tuesday, said the flooding has affected the top six agricultural counties in the state. ""This was an unprecedented storm with flooding expected to exceed that from any other storms in recent memory,"" Troxler said in a statement. ""The footprint of flooding from this storm covers much of the same area hit by flooding from Hurricane Matthew in 2016, which only worsens the burden on these farmers."" In South Carolina, farmers face damage to cotton, peanut and hemp crops, the state said. CNN's Jay Croft, Steve Almasy, Amanda Watts, Andrea Diaz and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","Water appears to have receded in some areas of the Carolinas, but more flooding from Hurricane Florence could arrive through the weekend, officials say.",2018-09-20T10:32:45Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",The Carolinas brace for even more flooding,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/20/us/florence-aftermath-wxc/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180919164431-little-pee-dee-river-south-carolina-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,flooding,1
SHERI FINK,"What seems like a small detail might resonate in unanticipated ways. For example, well into production on the Magazine story, the editor, Luke Mitchell, allowed me to add a sentence about innovations that included the fact that in Charleston County, S.C., people could provide information to 911 online.
I learned later that several 911 directors reached out to Charlestons 911 director for more information. One was John Dejung from Dane County, Wis. Hurricane Harvey had awakened him to the possibility that his 911 system, one of the largest in a state prone to ice storms, blizzards and tornadoes, might get so bogged down or debilitated that we might want to rely on alternatives to phones. Dane County set aside $10,000 in next years budget for the purchase of a system that will allow people to reach 911 online if necessary in a major disaster.
That alone would likely not have saved Caseys life, but it may save someones. There are myriad ways in which we and the infrastructure and systems we rely on remain unprepared to contend with the natural disasters that seem to arrive ever more frequently and catastrophically.

A.A. Newton,"The National Hurricane Center expects Hurricane Florence to cause “ life-threatening, catastrophic flash flooding ” when it makes landfall later this week, and now there’s a tool that gives us an idea of just how catastrophic that impact will be. This tracker from ESRI Media takes the familiar prediction model and uses it to calculate some key demographic data for the area inside the error cone. ESRI’s tracker shows the total population, total households, and total educational organizations in Florence’s projected path: Clicking on the individual items in the legend pulls up more data, including the proportion of the total population that’s over age 65, and how many of the total households are below the poverty line. At the time of writing, 16% of the affected population is over 65, with 15% of affected households living in poverty; the median household income is $51,000. Whether you’re smack dab in the danger zone or watching the storm from afar, you should know how to correctly read an error cone projection. ESRI has an efficient summary in the description of their tracker (emphasis mine) that hits on the main points: “The Cone of Uncertainty...represents the probable track of the center of a tropical cyclone, and is formed by enclosing the area swept out by a set of circles along the forecast track (at 12, 24, 36 hours, etc). It is important to note that the area affected by a tropical cyclone can extend well beyond the confines of the cone enclosing the most likely track area of the center.” In other words, if your city—or your loved ones’—is outside the error cone, it just means that the center of the storm isn’t expected to pass over; areas outside the cone can still expect high winds and heavy rain, and should watch local forecasts extra-carefully in the days to come. That’s the most important thing to take away from error cone projections, but if you’d like a more in-depth explainer, this Wall Street Journal piece briefly explains how they’re calculated, how to correctly interpret them, and what the limitations are.

Mark Kaufman,"Last weekend, Ellicott City's quaint Main Street, with red, white, and blue decorations draped from storefronts, became a churning brown river. While several factors resulted in this Maryland town's second ""1,000-year storm"" occurring in just the last 22 months, one increasingly significant contribution to the flooding is the amount of water vapor accumulating in Earth's warming atmosphere. The flooding in Maryland fits within the broader context of how human-caused climate change is altering our atmosphere, making these extreme events more commonplace in the future. SEE ALSO: 2018's hurricane season will be active, but probably not as bad as last year NASA scientists say that average global temperatures have been on a ""rapid warming trend"" in the last four decades. This warming means that the air is capable of holding more water. Specifically, for every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, the air can hold 7 percent more water. Accordingly, this loads storm systems with more water. ""So when it rains, it really, really pours, in the future — and now,"" Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in an interview. ""This is super basic physics and chemistry,"" said Marvel of increased temperatures allowing the air to absorb more water. Today, the consequences of this elementary science are pummeling the U.S. ""We’ve already observed an increase in heavy precipitation events,"" said Marvel. In 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report showing extreme, single day downpours have been on the rise since the late 1970s. The United States' 2014 National Climate Assessment — guided by 13 federal agencies — found that ""Across most of the United States, the heaviest rainfall events have become heavier and more frequent."" ""Increases in extreme precipitation are projected for all U.S. regions,"" the report added. Image: U.S. government/National climate assessment That said, Marvel emphasizes it's inaccurate to say that any extreme downpour was the direct or single result of more water vapor being held in the warmer air. Destructive weather will still happen — but now it has an added kick — human-induced global warming. ""Unlucky, bad things happen all the time,"" said Marvel. ""Weather happens, but we know what climate change is doing."" Tropical cyclones, for example, have ravaged U.S. coastlines throughout history, and will continue to do so. The first named storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Alberto — which is not a hurricane but is still carrying bounties of water — has now causing flooding so severe in North Carolina that the National Weather Service tweeted ""HEED ALL EVACUATION ORDERS IMMEDIATELY!"" in areas around the Lake Tahoma dam.

Marvel uses disgraced U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong, who admitted to doping, as an analogy. The talented Armstrong would still have probably won some races without enhancing his performance with prohibited drugs.

RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.,"The amount the ground can soak up is limited, because it is so wet, but thats a lot better than having it frozen, because frozen ground is like a parking lot, Mr. Pearson added. Water just flows right off.
Over all, he said, the storm does not seem as powerful at this point as the March tempest, but it still has a lot of moisture and lot of potential to cause a lot of problems, he said. Its still going to pack a punch.
Forecasters say that for a storm to officially qualify as a bomb cyclone, the atmospheric pressure must drop at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, creating a particularly strong and rapidly intensifying storm. This one might not produce quite that steep a pressure drop, they say.
But temperatures are set to plunge quickly just the same, as a low-pressure system drawing in moisture to the Midwest is displaced by a high-pressure system full of colder air. Omaha, for example, is predicted to see its daytime high temperature fall from almost 80 degrees on Monday to about 40 degrees on Friday.
The bigger flood risk this time may center on the Mississippi River and its swollen tributaries rather than the Missouri River, where levels have been receding, said Jeff Berardelli, a meteorologist.
It will be a more prolific snow producer and a more blinding blizzard than the bomb cyclone was, Mr. Berardelli said of the new storm, partly because it may idle over much of the Midwest for a time.
Its likely going to slow down and stall, he said. Literally, the storm will barely move.
But like Mr. Pearson, Mr. Berardelli said that a higher proportion of snow than rain may be a good thing.
If it melts over a longer period of time, that would be better, he said. We dont want it all happening in a day or two.","Flooding in the town of Hamburg, Iowa, on March 20.

MICHAEL KIMMELMAN and CHRISTOPHER GREGORY,"People usually opt to preserve their communities and ties to the land, even if it means living in harms way, points out Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist at N.Y.U. whose specialty is social resilience. They have seen enough projects go wrong to suspect that theyre better off risking the next big storm and staying home, where at least they have friends and family nearby.
Carmen Ayendez, who lived in Vietnam much of her life, said her father four years ago took up the governments offer of a new home in Sunset Harbor, one of three housing projects built by the municipality of Guaynabo Vietnam straddles Guaynabo, a mostly prosperous district outside San Juan, and the adjacent municipality of Cataño with the purpose of relocating Vietnams residents.
When her father died two days after signing the new lease, Ms. Ayendez took over the house. But shortly after moving, she started waking in the night, unable to breathe.
It turned out the new house was plagued by mold. Ms. Ayendez hasnt been able to get rid of it. When Maria hit, her roof cracked. She was supposed to be safer in Sunset Harbor.
I preferred living in Vietnam, she said. I built my own house there on a piece of land that my dad gave me when I was 19. It was a wooden house. It had bats and worms, but not mold. I had my friends and neighbors. The roof wasnt very secure, but it was home.
To protect its residents from evictions and gentrification, San Juans largest barrio, on the banks of the Martín Peña canal, has been operating as a community land trust for some years. It ensures everyone in the barrio has rights, a stake and a say. The trust has negotiated voluntary relocations where the clogged, polluted and frequently overflowing canal needs to be dredged or widened and homes get in the way.
Evelyn Quiñones, 63, one of the communitys leaders, showed me the house she agreed to move to a few years ago, on a street just outside the barrio. The decision to leave wasnt easy, she said. It made all the difference that the choice to move was hers, the new house was in good shape and that her relocation improved conditions for people inside the barrio.",Hurricane Maria led to a host of new plans to fix island barrios plagued by chronic flooding.

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","California was hit this week with a massive atmospheric river, with the state bracing for potential mudslides and flooding. By Thursday, multiple counties were reporting record rainfall amid chaotic road closures and unprecedented flash floods.
A highway in Riverside County outside of Los Angeles was completely eroded by flooding in staggering footage shared by the California Department of Transportation on Thursday. As of early Friday morning, road closures were still in effect throughout the region, and authorities cautioned drivers against attempting to drive through flooded areas.
Palm Springs also saw significant flooding, with the Palm Springs Desert Sun reporting that several people needed to be rescued after floodwaters left them stranded. According to the National Weather Service San Diego, Palm Springs was walloped by its third all-time rainfall in a 24-hour period and its wettest Valentines Day on record.
San Diego reported record moisture in the atmosphere, according to the National Weather Service, and San Diegos Palomar Observatory was hit with a historic 10 inches of downpour for its rainiest day since it began keeping a record. Road closures were reported throughout the area as the result of fallen trees and debris as well as other issues related to the storm.
Up north, a mudslide in Sausalito resulted in one home sliding down a hill and smashing into another house, the Associated Press reported, and more than four dozen properties needed to be evacuated as a result of the storm.
During the incident, a woman was reportedly buried under mud and debris for two hours while a rescue crew worked to free her. According to the Los Angeles Times, rescuers found her after noticing her hand poking out from under part of the wreckage.
Surprisingly, she was in great condition, Southern Marin Fire District Captain Doug Paterson told the Los Angeles Times. She was talking to us. She was alert. She was able to tell us exactly what had happened.
In neighboring San Francisco, the torrential downpour resulted in the cancellation or delay of hundreds of flights. According to the National Weather Service Bay Area, several flood warnings and advisories remained in effect as of early Friday morning.

Nature was showing its fickle side on Wednesday, with blizzard conditions, heavy snow and frigid air expected to pound parts of the Rockies and the Plains, just a day after the weather was sunny and idyllic in some of those same places.
The storm, caused by a low-pressure system moving east from the Pacific Ocean, is expected to bring temperature drops of about 50 degrees to places like Denver, where it was in the mid-70s and sunny on Tuesday but could drop to the mid-20s by Wednesday night, with 55-mile-an-hour wind gusts and up to 10 inches of snow. Whiteout conditions could make driving nearly impossible, forecasters said.
The effects of the low-pressure system will be felt from Colorado through Michigan, with heavy snow and thunderstorms, and even down into Texas, where dry conditions and high winds have led to fire warnings.

Rachel Becker,"Climate change is already making devastating hurricanes wetter — and similar storms are likely to unleash more rain and faster winds by the end of the century, new research says. When Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria struck the US in rapid succession in the fall of 2017, the storms and their aftermaths killed thousands of people and caused an estimated $265 billion in damage. Harvey became the second costliest storm after Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005. Now, new research published today in the journal Nature suggests that climate change made Irma, Maria, and Katrina drop more rain than they would have in a pre-industrial world. The study also predicts that in a warmer future, these storms would be even wetter and windier. A second paper (also published today in Nature) took a closer look at Hurricane Harvey. It shows another way people may have made the storm’s rain and flooding more severe: by building cities. Hurricanes should, theoretically, be more intense and wetter on a hotter planet. After all, warm ocean water fuels hurricanes, and warmer air holds more moisture — which means more rain. Recent studies back that up; analyses of Hurricane Harvey, for instance, reported that 15 percent or more of the rainfall could be attributed to global warming. “It’s a very important confirmation.” Today’s paper provides yet more evidence about the ways in which climate change shapes extreme weather events, says Dim Coumou, an atmospheric scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research who was not involved in the study. “It’s a very important confirmation of our understanding of how hurricanes change with global warming.” Climate scientist Michael Mann says that some of the results make perfect sense. “We expect greater rainfall and flooding from hurricanes as ocean surface temperatures and atmospheric moisture content increases in a warming world.” But he cautions that the papers use a single climate model, so “it is difficult to draw other general conclusions from these studies.” The study started because Christina Patricola, a climate scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, wanted to find out how exactly climate change fit into the recent spate of devastating storms. So she simulated more than a dozen hurricanes, including Hurricane Katrina. She and her co-author Michael Wehner plugged in ocean temperature, atmospheric conditions, and watched the simulated storms spin toward land. The models weren’t perfect, the study acknowledges: the simulations didn’t quite capture Hurricane Maria’s track, or the rapid intensifications of Katrina, Maria, and Irma. But the models were close — and that’s where the experiments could start. Patricola tweaked the conditions to watch what would happen if Katrina, Irma, and Maria had unfolded in a pre-industrial world, and found that global warming boosted the deluge by between 4 and 9 percent. The team also analyzed wind speeds, but didn’t see much of a contribution of global warming for the recent storms. That could change in the future. Patricola found that if we continue to burn fossil fuels unchecked through the year 2100, some of those same storms would drop 25 to 30 percent more rain, and the winds would blow up to 33 miles per hour faster. It’s a thorough, convincing study, Coumou says — but there are still some big questions left to answer. The study doesn’t examine how climate change might alter the speed at which hurricanes travel along their paths, for example, or how future hurricane rainfall and storm surge might combine to drive heavy flooding. The question of flooding is where today’s second study comes in. Hydrologist Gabriele Villarini at the University of Iowa and his colleagues at Princeton University took a close look at Hurricane Harvey, which dumped five feet of rain on Houston and killed at least 93 people. Previous studies analyzed at how much of that rainfall could be attributed to global warming, and found it was around 15 precent or more. And we’d expect that when developers slap down impermeable surfaces like concrete and asphalt, the amount of water slicking off those surfaces increases. “The skyline, the tall buildings, the city footprint — we don’t know which one is more important.” But Villarini’s team took a slightly different tack and looked at how the city’s footprint and skyline might have changed both runoff and the rain. They modeled how much rain the hurricane would have dropped on the city had the buildings been replaced with farm fields. And they found that the rough texture of the city with its buildings and complicated skyline snagged and slowed down the humid air flowing over it, boosting conditions for precipitation. To be clear, Hurricane Harvey would have dropped rain over Houston no matter what was there. But the presence of the city exacerbated the flooding across Houston by about 21 times, on average, the study says. The team doesn’t know precisely why. “The skyline, the tall buildings, the city footprint — we don’t know which one is more important,” Villarini says. They also don’t know if these findings are specific to Harvey, or whether they’d hold up when another storm hits a different city. “I don’t think there’s one single way of dealing with this problem.” Still, the findings suggest that urbanization could make the flooding impacts of hurricanes worse, and in multiple different ways. “This is, as far as I know, a new result and, as the authors point out, has important implications for urban planning,” Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at MIT who was not involved in the study, says in a statement emailed to The Verge. Together, the two studies show that we need to be ready for the complex ways a warmer world could change extreme weather events. And preparing for these events won’t be easy, according to Villarini. Politicians, urban developers, and engineers will all have to be involved, and will have to work together to figure out ways for their communities to survive future storms. “I don’t think there’s one single way of dealing with this problem,” he says.","New research published in the journal Nature suggests that climate change made Hurricanes Irma, Maria, and Katrina drop more rain than they would have in a pre-industrial world.

Natasha Lomas,"The style transfer craze kicked off by an app called Prisma a couple of years ago led to a tsunami of painterly selfies flooding social feeds for several months, as we reported at the time, before the rapacious, face-snapping hoards shifted their attention toward fresh spectacles. But that’s not the end of the story.
The same tech is now creeping into (paper) kids’ books, via a partnership between children’s publisher startup, Kabook, and Prisma Labs: aka the b2b entity that the original app makers pivoted to in late 2017.
So instead of AI sending robots into a human-slaying frenzy, per the usual dystopian sci-fi storyline, we find ourselves confronted with neural nets being used to serve up contextual illustrations of children so parents can gift personalized books that seamlessly insert a child’s likeness into the story, thereby casting them as a character in the tale.
Not the end of the world then. Well, not unless you view this kind of self-centered content manipulation as a threat to children’s imaginations and developing sense of empathy. (The research on any ‘little princes in training’ will, unfortunately, have to wait a few decades to come through though.)
The Kabook integration is the first consumer product partnership that Prisma Labs has scored, according to a press release from the pair.
And while they note there are other publishing services that offer the chance to insert a bit of custom text and photography into a book they claim their collaboration is the only publishing technology that does this “seamlessly”, i.e. thanks to the AI’s style blending fingers.
We are excited to be able to work directly with the team at Kabook! to create a truly unique user experience; one that has offered young readers a completely personalized way to enjoy reading, said Andrey Usoltsev, CEO of Prisma Labs, in a statement.
Part of our mission at Prisma Labs is to develop new ways for people to express their emotions through digital creations, and through this partnership with Kabook! we are able to take that one step further and bring that to life on the pages of an actual book.
Kabook, which was set up last year — describing itself as “a technology-based” children’s book publisher, with a focus on kids aged 0-7 years — is currently offering four stories that can be personalized with a kid’s AI-generated likeness.
Three of the books incorporate just one custom image into the story. While a fourth, called Hornswoggled!, makes uses of seven photos in a pirate-themed buried treasure adventure. 
The personalized stories start at $24.99 per book, with hard and soft cover versions available.","The style transfer craze kicked off by an app called Prisma a couple of years ago led to a tsunami of painterly selfies flooding social feeds for several months, as we reported at the time, before the rapacious, face-snapping hoards shifted their attention to…",2019-01-17T15:20:15Z,"{'id': 'techcrunch', 'name': 'TechCrunch'}",Prisma’s style transfer tech creeps into kids’ books,http://techcrunch.com/2019/01/17/prismas-style-transfer-tech-creeps-into-kids-books/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kabook-Image1.jpg?w=514,techcrunch,TechCrunch,flooding,1
Zack Whittaker,"Jigsaw, the cybersecurity-focused division owned by Google parent Alphabet, is now allowing political organizations in Europe to sign up for its anti-web-flooding technology for free.
Until now, the free-to-use technology designed to protect political campaigns and websites against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks dubbed Project Shield was only available to news sites and journalists, human rights sites and elections monitoring sites in the U.S.
Now, Jigsaw is extending those protections to European political operators ahead of contentious parliamentary elections later this year.
The anti-DDoS technology aims to protect websites and services from being pummeled with tons of junk internet traffic from multiple sources at once. It protects against several types of DDoS attacks and not just the traditional layer 3 or 4 protocol-based attacks but also the more powerful layer 7 attacks that involve large volume, often thanks to DNS amplification.
By caching a website, the technology absorbs a lot of the malicious traffic, and filtering harmful traffic keeps sites running.
Jigsaw’s move comes at a time when highly anticipated elections are expected to adjust political powers across the continent particularly in what’s left of the European Union, after the controversial British departure from the EU, known as “Brexit.” Anti-political actors and nation-state hackers have long worked hard in Europe to disrupt elections and sow discord in an effort to discredit results.
Some have outright launched flooding attacks to down websites at a time when they’re most needed.
In the last year alone, several flooding attacks left critical websites downed for hours and longer. Election sites from Tennessee to the Czech Republic were downed in an effort to disrupt the voting process.
Project Shield said it’s offering the service for free to all European political organizations and campaigns, said Jigsaw’s Dan Keyserling in an email to TechCrunch. That’s in contrast to existing providers, like Cloudflare, that sell DDoS protection.
“The spread of DDoS attacks is a global issue,” said Keyserling. “Just scanning the news showed us it is a growing problem.”","Jigsaw, the cybersecurity-focused division owned by Google parent Alphabet, is now allowing political organizations in Europe to sign up for its anti-web-flooding technology for free.

Josh Constine,"Instagram has been earning money from businesses flooding its social network with spam notifications. Instagram hypocritically continues to sell ad space to services that charge clients for fake followers or that automatically follow/unfollow other people to get them to follow the client back. This is despite Instagram reiterating a ban on these businesses in November and threatening the accounts of people who employ them.
A TechCrunch investigation initially found 17 services selling fake followers or automated notification spam for luring in followers that were openly advertising on Instagram despite blatantly violating the network’s policies. This demonstrates Instagrams failure to adequately police its app and ad platform. That neglect led to users being distracted by notifications for follows and Likes generated by bots or fake accounts. Instagram raked in revenue from these services while they diluted the quality of Instagram notifications and wasted peoples time.
In response to our investigation, Instagram tells me its removed all ads as well as disabled all the Facebook Pages and Instagram accounts of the services we reported were violating its policies. Pages and accounts that themselves weren’t in violation but whose ads were have been banned from advertising on Facebook and Instagram. However, a day later TechCrunch still found ads from two of these services on Instagram, and discovered five more companies paying to promote policy-violating follower growth services.
This raises a big question about whether Instagram properly protects its community from spammers. Why would it take a journalists investigation to remove these ads and businesses that brazenly broke Instagrams rules when the company is supposed to have technical and human moderation systems in place? The Facebook-owned apps quest to move fast to grow its user base and business seems to have raced beyond what its watchdogs could safeguard.

I first began this investigation a month ago after being pestered with Instagram Stories ads by a service called GramGorilla. The slicked-back hipster salesmen boasted how many followers he gained with the service and that I could pay to do the same. The ads linked to the website of a division of Krends Marketing where for $46 to $126 per month, it promised to score me 1000 to 2500 Instagram followers.
Some apps like this sell followers directly, though these are typically fake accounts. They might boost your follower count (unless theyre detected and terminated) but wont actually engage with your content or help your business, and end up dragging down your metrics so Instagram shows your posts to fewer people. But I discovered that GramGorilla/Krends and the majority of apps selling Instagram audience growth do something even worse.
You give these scammy businesses your Instagram username and password, plus some relevant topics or demographics, and they automatically follow and unfollow, like, and comment on strangers Instagram profiles. The goal is to generate notifications those strangers will see in hopes that theyll get curious or want to reciprocate and so therefore follow you back. By triggering enough of this notification spam, they trick enough strangers to follow you to justify the monthly subscription fee.
That pissed me off. Facebook, Instagram, and other social networks send enough real notifications as is, growth hacking their way to more engagement, ad views, and daily user counts. But at least they have to weigh the risk of annoying you so much that you turn off notifications all together. Services that sell followers dont care if they pollute Instagram and ruin your experience as long as they make money. Theyre classic villains in the tragedy of the commons of our attention.
This led me to start cataloging these spam company ads, and I was startled by how many different ones I saw. Soon, Instagrams ad targeting and retargeting algorithms were backfiring, purposefully feeding me ads for similar companies that also violated Instagrams policies.
The 17 services selling followers or spam that I originally indexed were Krends Marketing / GramGorilla, SocialUpgrade, MagicSocial, EZ-Grow, Xplod Social, Macurex, GoGrowthly, Instashop / IG Shops, TrendBee, JW Social Media Marketing, YR Charisma, Instagrocery, SocialSensational, SocialFuse, WeGrowSocial, IGWildfire, and GramFlare. TrendBee and GramFlare were found to still be running Instagram ads after the platform said they’ve been banned from doing so. Upon further investigation after Instagram’s supposed crackdown, I discovered five more services sell prohibited growth services: FireSocial, InstaMason/IWentMissing, NexStore2019, InstaGrow, and Servantify.
Knowingly Poisoning The Well
I wanted to find out if these companies were aware that they violate Instagram’s policies and how they justify generating spam. Most hide their contact info and merely provide a customer support email, but eventually I was able to get on the phone with some of the founders.
“What we’re doing is obviously against their terms of service” said GoGrowthly’s co-founder who refused to provide their name. “We’re going in and piggybacking off their free platform and not giving them any of the revenue. Instagram doesn’t like us at all. We utilize private proxies depending on clients’ geographic location. That’s sort of our trick to reduce any sort of liability” so clients’ accounts don’t get shut down, they said. “Its a careful line that we tread with Instagram. Similar to SEO companies and Google, Google wants the best results for customers and customers want the best results for them. Theres a delicate dance” said Macurex founder Gun Hudson.
EZ-Grow’s co-founder Elon refused to give his last name on the record, but told me “[Clients] always need something new. At first it was follows and likes. Now we even watch Stories for them. Every new feature that Instagram has we take advantage of it to make more visibility for our clients.” He says EZ-Grow spends $500 per day on Instagram ads, which are its core strategy for finding new customers. SocialFuse founder Alexander Heit says his company spends a couple hundred dollars per day on Instagram and Facebook ads, and was worried when Instagram reiterated its ban on his kind of service in November, but says “We thought that we were definitely going to get shut down but nothing has changed on our end.”
Several of the founders tried to defend their notification spam services by saying that at least they weren’t selling fake followers. Lacking any self-awareness, Macurex’s Hudson said “If its done the wrong way it can ruin the user experience. There are all sorts of marketers who will market in untasteful or spammy ways. Instagram needs to keep a check on that.” GoGrowthly’s founder actually told me “We’re actually doing good for the community by generating those targeted interactions.” WeGrowSocial’s co-founder Brandon also refused to give his last name, but was willing to rat out his competitor SocialSensational for selling followers.
Only EZ-Grow’s Elon seemed to have a moment of clarity. “Because the targeting goes to the right people . . . and it’s something they would like, it’s not spam” he said before his epiphany. “People can also look at it as spam, maybe.”
Instagram Finally Shuts Down The Spammers
In response to our findings, an Instagram spokesperson provided this lengthy statement confirming it’s shut down the ads and accounts of the violators we discovered, claiming that it works hard to fight spam, and admitting it needs to do better:
“Nobody likes receiving spammy follows, likes and comments. It’s really important to us that the interactions people have on Instagram are genuine, and we’re working hard to keep the community free from spammy behavior. Services that offer to boost an account’s popularity via inauthentic likes, comments and followers, as well as ads that promote these services, aren’t allowed on Instagram. We’ve taken action on the services raised in this article, including removing violating ads, disabling Pages and accounts, and stopping Pages from placing further ads. We have various systems in place that help us catch and remove these types of ads before anyone sees them, but given the number of ads uploaded to our platform every day, there are times when some still manage to slip through. We know we have more to do in this area and we’re committed to improving.
Instagram tells me it uses machine learning tools to identify accounts that pay third-party apps to boost their popularity and claims to remove inauthentic engagement before it reaches the recipient of the notifications. By nullifying the results of these services, Instagram believes users will have less incentive to use them. It uses automated systems to evaluate the images, captions, and landing pages of all its ads before they run, and sends some to human moderators. It claims this lets it catch most policy-violating ads, and that users can report those it misses.
But these ads and their associated accounts were filled with terms like “get followers”, “boost your Instagram followers”, “real followers”, “grow your engagement”, “get verified”, “engagement automation”, and other terms tightly linked to policy-violating services. That casts doubt on just how hard Instagram was working on this problem. It may have simply relied on cheap and scalable technical approaches to catching services with spam bots or fake accounts instead of properly screening ads or employing sufficient numbers of human moderators to police the network.
That misplaced dependence on AI and other tech solutions appears to be a trend in the industry. When I recently reported that child sexual abuse imagery was easy to find on WhatsApp and Microsoft Bing, both seemed to be understaffing the human moderation team that could have hunted down this illegal content with common sense where complex algorithms failed. As with Instagram, these products have highly profitable parent companies who can afford to pour more dollars in policy enforcement.
Kicking these services off Instagram is an important step, but the company must be more proactive. Social networks and self-serve ad networks have been treated as efficient cash cows for too long. The profits from these products should be reinvested in policing them. Otherwise, crooks will happily fleece users for our money and attention.

Mark Kaufman,"In Nebraska and Iowa there's a brown sea where there should be homes, roads, gas stations, and open country. 
Historic floods have deluged vast swaths of the Midwest even flooding a third of the U.S. Air Force base that houses the nation's critical U.S. Strategic Command. But the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says the floods aren't nearly over. The agency's 2019 Spring Outlook found that nearly two-thirds of the lower 48 states are at risk for flooding in the coming months. 
""The extensive flooding weve seen in the past two weeks will continue through May and become more dire and may be exacerbated in the coming weeks as the water flows downstream, Ed Clark, director of NOAAs National Water Center, said in a statement. 
This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities. 
None of this is supposed to be under water.
Here's what the Missouri River looks like just across from Nebraska City into Iowa. If you ever drive to Kansas City, you're probably familiar with this interchange of I-29 and Highway 2. The Missouri looks like an ocean.#NSP575pic.twitter.com/kwkkAs5fha

Regions in Nebraska, Minnesota, and Iowa have already seen historic flooding, with some major rivers particularly the Missouri River absolutely smashing previous flood records by some four feet. What's more, many of the nation's well-engineered levees have failed to contain the record floodwaters. 
The dramatic flooding which is already forecast to cost well over $1 billion in damages is consistent with a big uptick in heavy rains over the last half-century: Between 1958 and 2012, the amount of rain in the heaviest rainfall events in the Midwest shot up by a whopping 37 percent, according to U.S. government scientists. 
SEE ALSO: This scientist keeps winning money from people who bet against climate change
This is in large part due to Earth's changing atmosphere. Specifically, the climate has warmed by 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit), and because of simple physics, the warmer air is able to hold more water vapor. Specifically, for every 1 degree Celsius of warming, the air can hold seven percent more water. 
After the rapid melting of winter snow and deluges of rain in mid-March, NOAA expects the flood risk to continue as more rain falls and then travels down already overloaded rivers.
Extreme flooding along the Missouri River.

""As this excess water flows downstream through the river basins, the flood threat will become worse and geographically more widespread,"" NOAA concluded.
The agency forecasts flood risk by accounting for how much snow is left to melt, areas experiencing drought, how saturated soils are with moisture, the depth of frozen soil, the height of rivers, and expected precipitation. As the floodmap shows, regions near the Mississipi river and vast swaths of land in the Great Plains and Midwest are at risk for major and moderate flooding.

Marcus Gilmer,"With a giant nor'easter slamming into the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, forecasters are using warnings with dire language to inform coastal residents of Massachusetts that this storm will not be an ordinary event. In fact, record coastal flooding is anticipated in Boston and other parts of eastern Massachusetts, which is leading the National Weather Service to come out with statements that it rarely, if ever, issues. SEE ALSO: Intense nor'easter may demolish coastal flood records, knock out power to millions The coastal flooding is the result of a long fetch of easterly winds, reaching hurricane force (75 miles per hour), pointed squarely at the north-south coast of eastern Massachusetts. The combination of astronomical high tides, astorm surge of 3 to 5 feet, storm surge, and waves of up to 30 feet just just offshore, is already inundating the coastline with water levels well above normal tide levels, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). At high tide on Friday morning, the water in Boston Harbor reached 14.36 feet, which was the third-highest water level on record. And the worst of this storm is yet to come. For the high tide on Friday night, the NWS is forecasting a record water level will be set in Boston of between 15.4 and 15.7 feet, beating the old record set just two months ago. The long-lasting flooding and battering waves has prompted unusually drastic language in the NWS' warnings (emphasis ours). Damage to some shoreline structures may occur. There will likely be widespread inundation of coastal roads and basements with life-threatening inundation depths above 3 or more feet possible in some locations. Some neighborhoods may be cut off for an extended time. This is a dangerous storm, and evacuation of some neighborhoods may be necessary. Another major impact from the storm will likely be beach erosion, prompting this warning from the NWS: ""Very severe to extreme erosion is likely and may compromise protective dunes, seawalls and other structures. This storm may be capable of producing one or more new inlets."" In other words, this storm could simply smash through existing land, to create new islands. The NWS's Coastal Flood Threat and Inundation map shows where the worst flooding is expected along the Massachusetts coast, with water levels of nearly 15 feet expected in locations like Gloucester Harbor, Revere, Scituate, and Boston. The coastal flooding could break records all along Massachusetts' coast, including the Boston area, records that were just set in early January thanks to the ""Bomb Cyclone"" that whipped through the area. There's a major difference between that storm and this one, even though both are intensifying rapidly enough to be called meteorological bombs. Unlike with the ""Bomb Cyclone,"" which moved through quickly, a high pressure area over Greenland (also known as a ""Greenland block"") will keep the current storm system pinned in place for days. This means the storm will last through several high tide cycles along the North Atlantic coast, making damage more likely.

DAVID ZUCCHINO,"A plastic bag of prescription medicine was on the coffee table. There was plenty of food, bottled water, batteries and candles. Home-cooked meals, prepared by Mr. Winner’s daughter, were in the refrigerator. A diesel generator was hooked up on the cement porch, along with a supply of fuel. The house is made of cinder block and cement, with a 2-inch-thick front door insulated with horsehair. “It’s Fort Knox over there,” said Mr. Winner’s daughter, Annette Winner. Like many holdouts, Mr. Winner stays because he is most comfortable at home and believes that his presence might, in some ineffable way, help protect the place. He worries about looters, too. Seven security cameras around his property beam images to a monitor next to his recliner. “If you leave, you’re likely to lose everything,” he said. “I’d worry to death that I might have been able to save something.” Another holdout, Willard Killough III, 44, who has survived every hurricane and storm in Carolina Beach since the early 1990s, said there is something else at play. “Sure, they say, ‘This is my home and I’m never leaving,’ but I think maybe there’s a sense of adventure there, too,” he said. Mr. Killough does not plan to leave for Florence, either. Brad Swain, a behavioral researcher at a center affiliated with Duke University who wrote a 2017 analysis titled “The Psychology of Riding It Out,” concluded that many people do not perceive hurricanes as especially dangerous.

RICHARD FAUSSET and AMY HARMON,"Five swift-water rescue teams and volunteers were responding to calls from people who were stranded, Ms. Parker said. She said many calls were for multiple people in need of help, including one from a home in the low-lying Fairfield Harbor neighborhood, with nine people who were heading to the attic. On Friday morning, a boat finally pulled up in front of the home where Meghan Margarum had been awaiting rescue all night with two other people and a dog. “Our front door flew off and our first level started to fill with water,” Ms. Margarum said by phone. The home had three stories. “We went up. It was crazy.’’ At around 11 p.m. Ms. Margarum texted her friend, Calli Donohue, 43, who lives in nearby James City. Ms. Donohue called 911 for her friend. “They just said they’ll get to them as soon as they can but they’re not sending anybody out right now because it’s too dangerous,” Ms. Donohue said. “I said ‘O.K., thank you. Have a good night. Sorry to have bothered you, guys.’ They’re overwhelmed.” So Ms. Donohue turned to social media, posting on Facebook. One friend passed it on to another and finally to someone Ms. Donohue knew from having been her Postal Service mail carrier. That woman had links to an ad hoc rescue group that had deployed with boats to the region before the arrival of the storm. It was still windy and rainy Friday morning when a small skiff arrived outside Ms. Margarum’s open door. “There were some people from Texas, some people from all over coming to help just rescue people that they said 911 responders wouldn’t respond to,” Ms. Margarum said. The boat took the group and some neighbors to dry ground and then others drove them to nearby Trent Park Elementary School, where Ms. Donohue picked up Ms. Margarum, and drove her to her house around 9:30 this morning. The house had no power, and Ms. Donohue had one conclusion. “Maybe listen to emergency services and get out,” she said. On New Bern’s Facebook page, the Police Department warned residents whose homes were flooded not to go into the attic unless they had a way to cut through the ceiling for ventilation.","Volunteers rescued three children from their flooded home in James City, N.C., just outside of New Bern, on Friday.

Rayne Ellis,"Deadly storms across Italy have brought Venice face-to-face with one of the city's worst floods in at least a decade leaving residents, store owners, and tourists alike fending off knee-high flood water. New photos of the flooding show tourists and residents in boots trudging through the ancient city. But flooding in Venice is nothing new. A few times during winter, strong winds push water from the Adriatic Sea into the Venetian Lagoon, causing high tides and minor but widespread flooding across the ancient island. Tourists gather to take pictures in knee-high water in the Piazza San Marco. Image: Getty Images However, every so often, the floods surpass normal levels and become a major hazard to everyone on the island and officials will sound sirens to warn the island that something more serious is coming. This week, the flood sirens rang loud from one of the 15 designated bell towers within the city. SEE ALSO: Earths carbon dioxide levels are likely the highest they've been in 15 million years Officials estimate that the Venetian Lagoon has risen 160 cm (5 feet 3 inches), making it the worst flood since 1979, and leaving nearly 80 percent of the city under water. Some of the parts of the the city most severely affected by the floods are the historic Piazza San Marco and Rialto Bridge which include structures that are centuries old. City officials create lifted walkways in anticipation of the high flooding. Image: Getty Images Floods like this used to be f ew and far between. But now major floods happen around once every four years, and scientists think that human-caused climate change is at least in part to blame. Plus, it doesn't help that the petrified logs holding the city afloat are sinking. Venice has reportedly sunk 6 feet since the city's medieval heyday. In order to avert continuous catastrophe, back in 2003 the Italian government began working on Project Mose Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico to help curb the effects of sea level rise on Venice. The three arrows point to the locations of the three barriers within the Mose project. Image: google maps The idea was to create three barriers to blockade the flow of water from the Adriatic into the Venetian Lagoon. The barriers would shut when scientists expected the highest tides. So far, two of the three have been completed, with a third one approaching completion in the coming years. The project should be finished within the next two or three years. In the meantime, Venice has other mechanisms in place to defend against the floods. Climate change, sinking stilts, and strong winds are putting Venice in significant danger of facing worse and worse floods. Image: Getty Images Drains are in every city square. Lifted walkways are put in place. Homes and storefronts, especially those facing the lagoon, have 1 foot barriers on their front doors, or their doors are lifted off the ground entirely. The 5 foot tide is expected to lessen throughout the rest of the week so hopefully Venice will have time to recover before it has to sound the flood alarms again.","Deadly storms across Italy have brought Venice face-to-face with one of the city's worst floods in at least a decade — leaving residents, store owners, and tourists alike fending off knee-high flood water.

SHASTA DARLINGTON,"SÃO PAULO, Brazil A mining dam burst in southeastern Brazil on Friday, flooding nearby homes, submerging cars and buses under a river of sludge and leaving 200 people missing, according to the rescue workers searching for them.
The accident, in the town of Brumadinho, comes just three years after a dam burst in Mariana, 75 miles away, killing 19 people and causing one of the worst environmental disasters in Brazils history.

JOSEPH HANANIA,"In a separate interview, the Parks Department commissioner, Mitchell J. Silver, said that unlike passive parks that double as floodplains, like those by Jamaica Bay, East River Park has structures, lights and synthetic turf, which does not do well in floods. And with the river projected to rise two and a half feet in 30 years, raising the park is the only way to save it.
By bringing in landfill and soil by barge, the new plan allows for daytime construction away from the highway, minimizing traffic disruptions. After its scheduled March 2020 launch, the new plan can thus be completed in three years rather than five, with flood protection in place by 2022.
Still, the parks closing under either plan has left people like Joan Reinmuth, a retired nurse and 30-year East Village resident, doubtful. This park is more than a recreation facility, she said. These kids in NYCHA houses dont take vacation cruises. They dont shop at Zabars for fish; they fish to eat. Early mornings, men are shaving in the fountains.
At last weeks meeting, Susan Stetzer, district manager for Community Board 3, got a commitment that after initially shutting the park down, the city will look to reopen it in sections.

George Dvorsky,"From floods and rain to droughts and unseasonably warm conditions, here’s the weather that Americans can expect in the coming months. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its long term weather forecast for Spring 2018, the period running from April until the end of June. Importantly, NOAA’s projections are just that: projections. They’re based on probabilities churned from intense number crunching and historical data. As always, stay tune to local weather conditions for more accurate reports as the season unfolds. Temperatures are expected to be above average for the southern two-thirds of the continental United States, extending from California to the central Plains and into the Northeast. Places most likely to be warmer than usual this spring include an area extending from the southwest across Texas and into the Gulf Coast. The northern half of Alaska and Hawaii should also be warmer than usual. Only the northern rockies will see temperatures below the norm. Right now, more than a quarter of the United States is experiencing drought, including southern California, the southwest, the northern and southern High Plains, and parts of the Southeast. NOAA expects drought to continue in most of these places, and even expand by June. On the positive side, drought conditions should wane in the northern Plains and the lower Missouri Valley owing to the usual spring rains. Speaking of rain, those of you in the northern United States can expect wetter-than-average conditions this spring, from the northern High Plains through to the Great Lakes region, Ohio Valley, and into the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Hawaii and northern Alaska are also expected to see a bit more rain than usual. Below average precipitation is expected in the west and south, including California, the south-central plains—and in Texas and areas of Oklahoma where drought conditions are in effect. Spring hasn’t arrived, but heavy rainfall has already triggered flooding in the Ohio and Mississippi River basins, and record flooding has been recorded in the lower Great Lakes region. Until the end of May, folks in the lower Mississippi Valley, the Ohio River Basin, the Illinois River Basin, and in parts of the lower Missouri River Basin, should expect moderate flooding. People living near the Columbia River and upper Missouri River Basin aren’t off the hook, either, where minor flooding is possible thanks to the heavy snowpack that built up this winter. Mike Halpert from NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center can tell you a bit more about what to expect this spring in this video.

Ed Cara,"Theres no shortage of horrible things that will become more common in the near future due to climate change, like coastal flooding, extreme weather, and disease-causing ticks, to name a few. But new research published Thursday in PLOS-One adds another annoyance to the list: Allergy-causing ragweed. The common ragweed, or Ambrosia artemisiifolia as its formally called, is a voracious plant known for quickly overtaking whatever environment its suited to inhabit. The plant grows annually through the warmer parts of the year in the U.S. Importantly for us, its also an abundant source of pollen, making it one of the leading triggers of hay fever and asthma. Though native to parts of North America, ragweed has invaded much of Europe, Asia, and other areas with relatively temperate weather, including some of the Southern United States. Given ragweeds love of warmer temperatures, scientists have feared that climate change has and will continue to help it spread further. Theres already research suggesting that this is happening in Europe, but the authors of this latest study say theirs is the first to consider the future of ragweed in North America. It was surprising that nobody had looked at ragweed distributions in the U.S.: As climate conditions are changing, where will it spread to in the future? said lead author Michael Case, who worked on the study during his time as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington, in a statement. The researchers created different models to predict ragweeds growth within the Eastern U.S. They stuck to that region because of the availability of data on when and where ragweed already grows. They ran 13 models, changing up variables like the amount of rain during August and the average temperature, for two different scenarios (a future where greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb and one where we show some restraint in emissions) in two time periods (the 2050s and the 2070s). Even in the more optimistic scenario, the majority of models predicted that, by 2050, ragweed will encroach into new areas of the U.S., including Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and more parts of New York. And through climate change might drive ragweed away from some areas, the overall distribution of the plantmeasured in square kilometerswill likely nearly double by the 2050s. Our results show that common ragweed is projected to have substantially more suitable climate space in the future across the eastern U.S, the authors wrote. The news isnt entirely bad, though. Thats because the effects of climate change on wildlife can be complex. And strangely enough, the team also found that by the 2070s, ragweed distribution might start to shrink from the peak levels seen in the 2050s, thanks to more extreme swings in temperature and precipitation (ragweed, like humans, doesnt love weather thats too hot or too cold). Of course, even those levels are much higher than what we see today, so its not a great silver lining. Still, the researchers hope (perhaps futilely) that their findings will encourage public health experts and local governments to appreciate the threat of ragweed invasion in the years to come. Hay fever alone, for instance, already affects some 23 million Americans annually, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology. Weed control boards, for example, might include ragweed on their list to keep an eye out and monitor for, Case said. Historically they might not have been looking for ragweed, but our study suggests maybe they should start looking for it.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","I regret to inform you that winter is not, in fact, over. A powerful storm is set to spin up in the Midwest this week. And if youre getting deja vu looking at the weather map up top, youre not alone.
The swirling mass of air forecast to blast the region with blustery winds, snow, and rain bears more than a passing resemblance to last months bomb cyclone that devastated the region. While this weeks storm might not be quite as strong, it will unleash a wave of misery in places still suffering from flooding.
The gnarly weather pattern will follow a similar evolution to last months bomb cyclone. A storm will come racing on the back of a strong jet stream dipping across the west through the first half of the week. As the jet stream swoops back up into the Midwest on Wednesday, it will pull ample moisture from the Gulf of Mexico up to meet cold air from the north. Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Minnesota are all under winter storm watches. The contrasting air temperatures will have winds whipping up to 35 mph and six or more inches of snow are forecast, according to the National Weather Service. Other parts of the Upper Midwest could also see snow through Thursday before the storm swirls into the Ohio River Valley, and its extremely likely those winter storm watches could expand to other areas and be upgraded to warnings. Blizzard-like conditions are also possible, so it wouldnt be wholly shocking to see the National Weather Service issue blizzard warnings at some point either.
While the storm is no joke, its also not likely to be quite as potent as last months bomb cyclone, which arrived with hurricane-force winds and record-setting low pressure. Thats because the environment isnt as conducive to as powerful a storm this time around. The temperature gradient on either side of the fronta key ingredient for winter storms to bomb outwont be as extreme. That means this storm might not meet the textbook definition of a bomb cyclone, a term that applies to storms that see their central pressure drop 24 millibars in 24 hours. 
But textbook definitions aside, this storm poses a serious risk to the region still recovering from flooding last month. Data kept by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows thatMidwest soil moisture levels are in the 99th percentile, which is to say that soils are extremely waterlogged. The new batch of rain and snow is like pouring a can of gas on a fire. Except instead of the flames rising higher, the water will. 
If youre wondering what climate change looks like, this is it. A warmer atmosphere can hold more water, unleashing more deluges and with them, more floods. With saturated soil, water is once again expected to run off into rivers and streams, many of which are still swollen. In the Missouri River basin, 26 flood gaugesin NOAAs networkare in a state of major or moderate flooding. In the Upper Mississippi basin, 56 gauges are at those levels of flooding. The new influx of water will add to the flood woes and is likely to tip other gauges back toward moderate or major flooding.
That could add to the billions of dollars in losses and once again raise the specter of flooding at Superfund sites. And it will add to the slow moving torrent of water working down the Mississippi River toward the Gulf of Mexico. That wall of water is forecast to unleash historic flooding through May, according to NOAA.","I regret to inform you that winter is not, in fact, over.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","In a year of wild heat waves, wildfires, and record-setting hurricanes, why not add one more weird weather phenomenon to the list? Tropical Depression Rosa made landfall in Baja California on Monday and is crawling into the Southwest, bringing with it the threat of flash floods from southern Arizona to Idaho. All told, 9 million people are under a flash flood watch or warning as of Tuesday morning Mountain Time as Rosa lumbers inland. The storm attained Category 4 status at its peak late last week, but has lost steam since then (at least in the wind department). It made landfall as a tropical storm in Baja California late last night and has since become Rosas lowly remnant low. But the winds were never the biggest concern for the Southwest. Instead, its the threat of torrential rain as the storm brings tropical moisture to an arid landscape. More than half an inch of rain has already fallen in and around Phoenix, making this one of the heaviest rain events to hit the city since 1990. Phoenix is already up to its seventh-wettest October on record despite it being just Oct. 2. With the heaviest bands of rain to come in the afternoon, the storm is likely to continue climbing the record books. All told, up to six inches of rain are expected in Arizonas mountains. That may not sound like a lot, especially after Florences recent deluge in the Carolinas, but the parched soil ups the risk of runoff. The scenic slot canyons and dry washes that cut across the desert landscape are disguised highways for water, waiting for rain events like this to send torrents rushing downstream. A recent drought has hardened soils even further, which could help accelerate the runoff process. Large portions of the Four Corners area are in exceptional or extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Rosas rain will certainly help alleviate that drought, but it will also exact a toll on the desert landscape and those living in it. Indeed, footage from Phoenixitself chock full of impervious pavementand the surrounding area shows that roads are already becoming inundated as the aforementioned dry washes fill up with frothing, muddy water. The Utah National Guard has already been activated according to CBS News, and we could see more resources mobilized as flooding continues to unfold. Its weird but not unprecedented for tropical systems to amble into the Southwest. Tropical Depression Storm Newton reached Arizona in 2016, the last tropical system to hit the region. Rosas remnants are just the latest example of a growing problem: Heavy rain events are on the rise owing to a warmer atmosphere. Were seeing that trend driven by named storms like hurricanes Harvey, Lane, and Florence as well as random rain events like the one that hit Kauai in April. The Southwest has seen a five percent increase in heavy downpours since 1958 even as the region becomes drier, according to the most recent National Climate Assessment. This type of weather whiplash poses a huge infrastructure challenge as city and state planners have to figure out how to prepare communities both for downpours and water conservation in increasingly dry times.","In a year of wild heat waves, wildfires, and record-setting hurricanes, why not add one more weird weather phenomenon to the list?

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","When last weeks bomb cyclone hit the Midwest, it was hard to imagine the inundation it could bring amid whiteout conditions and more than a foot of snow. But the warm weather that wrapped in behind it quickly melted out all that white stuff and unleashed historic flooding across parts of Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas, and Missouri.
Floodwaters have worked their way down the rivers that run like arteries through the region, overtop the banks of the Missouri, Platte, Elkhorn, and more. Dams have been destroyed, bridges and other infrastructure have been washed away, and small towns have been cut off from the outside world, surrounded by moats of muddy water. The flooding has also paralyzed the various military bases scattered across the region, with waters lapping up against Fort Leavenworth and Offutt Air Force Base, home U.S. Strategic Command. As Task and Purpose helpfully notes, that means the base that oversees the Pentagons nuclear strategic deterrence and global strike capabilities is largely underwater. 
The situation also neatly illustrates how climate changewhich is leading to more intense precipitationis a threat multiplier.
As of Monday, nine flood gauges operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration remained at major flood stage with another 17 in moderate flood stages. While the on-the-ground photos show the human toll of the floods, satellites are the best way to get a handle on the full scope of whats happening in the Midwest.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The byzantine networks of rivers and streams that drain the Midwest is facing a flooding crisis of historic proportions. The multibillion disaster centered in Nebraska will spread this spring, with above average rainfall expected to cause floods to impact some 200 million Americans living near rivers. And it wont necessarily end once it reaches the Gulf of Mexico.
This springs floods will shape this summers dead zone. The area of low oxygen is an annual occurrence driven in large part by nutrient-laden runoff that washes down the Mississippi River and its many tributaries, fueling algae blooms when it reaches the Gulf. The dead zone in 2017 was the largest thats ever been recorded at nearly 9,000 square miles, and while its much too early to say exactly how big this summers dead zone will be, the flooding weve seen so far doesnt bode well. Another enormous dead zone would put pressure on Gulf marine life and fisheries
The flooding we see this month, in March, may ultimately determine the size of the Gulf of Mexico dead zone in August, Kimberly Van Meter, a researcher who studies water and ecosystems at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told Earther.
And this years floods are already shaping up to record setting. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the upper Mississippi and Red River of the North basins have doubled their normal spring rainfall totals. That includes areas that were smacked by a rare bomb cyclone earlier this month that dumped rain on snow and set the flooding overtaking the region in motion. NOAA forecasts indicate areas all along the Mississippi River basin could face major flooding through Mayas snow continues to melt amid a forecast for heavier than normal rainfall over the next few months.
As the floodwater wash over farmers fields, theyll do more than strip soil. They can also scoop up fertilizer and other organic matter and transport it downriver. The nutrient-rich water will reach the Gulf of Mexico sometime in June, which will kickstart the dead zone.
In the simplest terms, the more nitrate that is transported downstream to the Gulf, the larger the size of the dead zone, Van Meter said. Nitrate is food for algae, and spring floods essentially deliver a large, delicious meal to the Gulf just as temperatures start to rise and the algae start to grow. Decades of fertilizer application and intensive livestock production across the Mississippi River Basin have created large stores of nitrate in the landscape, just waiting for the next flood to carry them to the Gulf.
As that algae bloom grows, it hoovers up all the oxygen that marine life needs to survive. The process is known as hypoxia, and chokes marine life to death. But they also take a toll on humans as well. Separate algae blooms in Lake Erie have befouled drinking water. Those along Floridas coasts have harmed the tourism industry. The Gulf of Mexico dead zone creates its own hardships.
Weve got data that its essentially a doughnut hole that forms with brown shrimp where they are avoiding areas that are low oxygen and theyre congregating on the edge, David Kidwell, a researcher at NOAAs National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, told Earther.
Recent NOAA-funded research has shown that the dead zone can cause small and large shrimp prices to fluctuate, with fishermen catching fewer high-value large shrimp when a dead zone is present. Climate change is liable to make blooms worse by intensifying the hydrological cycle and warming waters. Whether the historic flooding that just hit the Midwest leads to a historic dead zone is not set in stone, though. 
Kidwell said that the annual dead zone forecast NOAA and the U.S. Geological Service puts out in early summer is based in large part on discharge of the Mississippi River as well as the pure nutrient levels in the river at that time, but other factors could dull their impact. A hurricanewhich would offer its own set of problemscould churn up the Gulf and staunch the algae bloom.
Regardless of what happens this season, its clear that something has to change in how we manage land and floodwaters. Nancy Rabalais, a marine ecologist at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, told Earther that it does not make sense is to rebuild in floodplains if the end goal is to limit the Gulf dead zone (to say nothing of exposing communities upstream to floodwaters). Reducing the amount of farmland in the floodplain so would ultimately cut down on fertilizer and animal waste being swept into streams and eventually the Gulf. Rabalais said, though, that she knew what this means economically to the agriculture community if floodplains were put off limits.
That neatly illustrates the tradeoffs and hard discussions society will be forced to havefarmers or fishermen? Midwest or Gulf Coast?the longer we put off addressing climate change, which is set to make heavy downpours and flooding even worse. Starting those conversations now makes a lot more sense than, say, holding sham votes.","The byzantine networks of rivers and streams that drain the Midwest is facing a flooding crisis of historic proportions.

MITCH SMITH,"Despite those tensions, several people on the reservation said they would have liked to see a more robust National Guard and state government presence during the storm response. As members of the tribe volunteered to cook meals and unload food delivery trucks on Friday, and as people checked on older neighbors who lived far from the highway, some of the biggest needs remained unmet.
We just need the technical skills, said Mary Tobacco, who was helping lead recovery efforts, but who became stranded herself on Friday as rising water made it impossible to leave her home on a butte. (The water was moving too fast, she said, to make it out in her kayak.)
Tribal officials were still working to determine whether as many as four deaths in the past two weeks could be attributed to the storm, including some involving patients who needed medical help and could not be reached by ambulance. The tribes police chief, Robert Ecoffey, said on Friday that it was not known whether those people would have survived if an ambulance had reached them.
In the meantime, some on Pine Ridge were hunkering down for what could be weeks more with little or no access to the outside world.
Bernadine Rowland, stranded since March 12, said Saturday that she and her grandchildren had remained in good spirits and had passed the days by watching Netflix and YouTube videos.

Tom McKay,"Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators have churned out across the country on Saturday to support the March for Our Lives movement demanding action on gun control and that politicians begin standing up to the National Rifle Association. That movement is spearheaded by student survivors of mass shootings, particularly those who attended the Parkland, Florida high school where a gunman killed at least 17 people in February, and the NRA hasn’t been quiet about how it feels about all this ( incoherent rage ). But it’s apparently been preparing for this moment by trying to dominate the digital airwaves over the past few weeks. Per an investigation by the Chicago Tribune, while the NRA may have initially fallen back of its familiar strategy of taking a long social media weekend after the massacre, four days later it returned with a weeks-long digital advertising campaign that saw average spending spike to nearly $50,000 a day. The Tribune reported that in the 24-day period preceding the mass killing at Parkland, digital ad data company Pathmatics estimates the NRA spent about $11,300 a day—and that daily total more than quadrupled to $47,300 during the 24-day period following its obligatory period of mourning. The NRA didn’t change its rhetoric or avenue of approach, the paper reported, but it did spend so much money that its ads began flooding the web, particularly Facebook and YouTube: Nearly all of the increase was on social media, primarily Facebook, where the NRA took its spending from an average of $4,400 a day in the three weeks prior to Parkland to $34,000 a day in the three weeks after the silence. Florida was heavily targeted in the post-tragedy ad burst. The state went from ninth most targeted in January to third between mid-February and mid-March.... For the past year, the NRA had been ranked No. 706 by Pathmatics on its list of top YouTube video advertisers. In the period since Feb. 21, the gun-rights group jumped into the top 100 at No. 92. According to the Tribune, the NRA spent “rather carelessly” (or perhaps rather callously), with its membership-drive ads appearing on YouTube channels like “Kids’ Toys,” including a video of a “young girl unboxing a doll from Disney’s popular Doc McStuffins show.” As the paper noted, if the NRA ran such ads targeting children on television, they might come into conflict with Federal Trade Commission rules—but most of those rules are not in effect for online ads. Though the NRA has increased its efforts to appeal to young people as its primary demographic of white males continues to age, Bowdoin College professor Michael Franz told the Tribune it looked more like sloppiness: Franz said he finds it bizarre that the NRA would advertise to kids on toy video channels – but it could be as simple as the organization aiming its spending at the most popular YouTube channels to spread its message about membership. “It suggests that they’re buying ad time based off of presumed reach as opposed to audience,” he said. “We shouldn’t infer too much sophistication on the part of their outreach strategy.” In any case, the NRA took Parkland as a signal to turn on the money spigot and didn’t pay too much attention to where the cash was flowing. This is completely in accordance with their make a lot of noise now, think later strategy—which has recently seen them do everything from record videos seemingly threatening their critics to launching a far-right media outlet and smearing mass shooting survivors —but it’s also a sign of an organization threatened by the scale of the movement assembling to fight them. It’s an indication that the NRA knows public concern about increasingly deadly mass shootings is a long-term existential threat to its existence. In any case, if you’ve been seeing a lot of NRA propaganda flood your Facebook timeline or YouTube pre-roll ads lately, this is why. But it’s possible the NRA could face more consequences on some of these sites soon. While the two sites are apparently willing to take the NRA’s money for now, YouTube did announce this week it would be restricting more firearm-related content. It and other tech giants like Apple and Amazon are also increasingly under pressure to boot the NRA’s TV channel.

Andrew Freedman,"Just a few days after a powerful storm caused widespread damage across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, another potent nor'easter is tracking toward the region. This one won't be quite as strong as the last event, which was so massive that it caused damage as far away as the Bahamas and Puerto Rico, but it will have more cold air to work with, making a foot or more of snow more likely, especially across interior portions of New England. The storm will exacerbate the coastal flooding that never completely dissipated in the wake of the last intense storm and astronomical high tides that hit beginning on March 1. In coastal Massachusetts, the first nor'easter severely weakened or destroyed shoreline infrastructure in many communities, making the high waves and coastal flooding from this upcoming storm even more of a threat. SEE ALSO: This one picture sums up climate change's growing role in coastal flooding In general, as sea levels rise in response to global warming, weather ""bombs"" like the two storms in the last week will be capable of causing more severe coastal flooding, since their storm surge will ride on top of a higher baseline of water. And anytime that a major storm coincides with astronomical high tides, as the March 1-4 event did, look out for records to fall along with seawalls. National Weather Service snowfall forecast for New York City. Image: nws. Coastal storms, including weather systems that undergo the process known as bombogenesis, in which the minimum central air pressure drops by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours, are not unusual at this time of year along the East Coast. However, it is rare to see two back-to-back intense storms, both of which would qualify as ""bomb cyclones"" or ""weather bombs,"" occur within a few days of each other.

The snowfall forecast for major cities in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast is an extremely difficult one, given multiple factors that could cut down on totals, or conversely, drastically raise them. So far, the consensus forecasts call for about 6 to 8 inches to fall in the Philadelphia area, with much more snow to the northwest of the city, and similar amounts in New York City. Quite a gradient in snowfall across RI and MA for Wednesday's storm. Nothing in Boston but almost a foot in Bedford, MA (near I-195/128). 2-4"" for Providence but over a foot in NW RI. Note: Ratios likely less than 10:1 for some of these areas, so snow totals will be less overall. pic.twitter.com/MeNuIhoSET — Jason Furtado (@wxjay) March 6, 2018 The Hudson Valley of New York, however, could pick up a foot-and-a-half of snow. In Boston, the snow is expected to mix with rain for much of the time, cutting down on totals there.

Marcello Rossi,"This story originally appeared on CityLab and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. On a gray, late-winter day, a converted chapel in the Arsenal, the city’s medieval boatyard, hummed with 21st-century activity. Engineers were looking at screens that displayed tables, maps, and charts on the conditions of the Venetian Lagoon. This was the MOSE control center: the operational heart of a megaproject to protect Venice, one of the world’s most beautiful cities, from threatening waters. For nearly seven years, the engineers here have raised and lowered virtual doors, gathering a series of data to be conveyed into a sophisticated forecasting model. Spread across dozens of islands and known as “the floating city” for its ubiquitous canals and bridges, Venice has grappled with inundation for centuries. But due to natural subsidence and the higher tides caused by global warming, the city is more vulnerable to flooding than ever before. So a flood barrier seemed like the obvious way to thwart future disasters. MOSE (an acronym for Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico, or “Experimental Electromechanical Module”) is one of the world’s largest and highest-profile civil-engineering works. It consists of a series of retractable floodgates stretching across the mouths of the lagoon’s three inlets. These gates can be raised on command to create a temporary wall against the sea in the event of a high tide. Work on MOSE began in 2003, but after countless delays (caused by a corruption scandal and financial and structural issues), the barrier has yet to be completed. The hard part is done, however, and most of the engineers at the control center were confident that the system will become fully operational soon. Since the final leg of construction has been stalled for months, though, no one could say exactly when. Some said later this year; others said 2020 was closer to reality. Whatever the date, it still remains unclear whether MOSE will adequately protect the city. And if so, for how long? MOSE operates on the principle of tidal gates. In calm weather, the gates fill with water and sit on the seabed. But when a high tide threatens, the water is pushed out by compressed air that’s pumped in. This allows the gates to surface and prevent the tide from entering the lagoon. When the surge subsides, the gates again fill with water and sink back to the bottom. “The idea is quite old,” said Paola Malanotte-Rizzoli, a physical oceanographer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was among the panel of experts enlisted by the Italian government to come up with a solution. “We have evidence that Venetian engineers drafted mechanical contraptions to hold back the sea as long ago as in the 18th century.” Nevertheless, a barrage of criticism has accompanied the project since its beginning. Environmental groups said that construction of the barrier would jeopardize the marine ecosystem beyond repair, while some politicians opposed the idea, stating that there were too many unknowns and that a cheaper solution was needed. Many experts agree, however, that when the seas rise, there aren’t many alternatives to building a barrier to stop it—especially in a one-of-a-kind city like Venice. “The concept behind MOSE is good,” said Jörg Imberger, an environmental engineer who teaches ocean sciences at the University of Miami. “But it all depends on what is meant by protection.” According to Imberger, if everything goes as planned, MOSE will protect Venice from floods like the catastrophic one in 1966 for the next three decades or so. “But since the gates are raised only when the tide reaches 110 centimeters [roughly 43 inches], MOSE won’t avoid the flooding phenomenon that already takes place in low-lying sites like Saint Mark’s Square, which inundates when the tide gets above 80 centimeters [about 32 inches],” he said. “This could be potentially fixed by lifting the barrier at lower tides. But that would have some adverse effects on the health of the lagoon.” The outlook gets foggier when it comes to the long run. Like much else in this world, MOSE’s effectiveness depends on how much carbon dioxide is pumped into the atmosphere over coming decades, and hence how fast sea levels rise during the barrier’s 50-year lifespan. Furthermore, conflicting statements on its engineering parameters do little to clarify. According to a 2011 UNESCO report, three sea-level-rise scenarios for 2100 were considered during the planning phase: 16 centimeters (about 6 inches), 22 centimeters (about 9 inches), and 31.4 centimeters (approximately one foot). Planners suggested using the second one, labeled as “prudent.” But today, even the third scenario seems over-optimistic. With climate change, the Mediterranean Sea is projected to rise up to five feet before 2100, meaning that mean water level could reach the critical threshold of 110 centimeters. That would cause Venice to suffer flooding twice a day at high tide. Malanotte-Rizzoli maintains that MOSE was engineered to handle about 2 feet of sea-level rise. The New Venice Consortium, the organization entrusted with building the barrier, says the same, but this reporter could find no evidence that this was an official project goal. The question of capabilities is crucial, not only because sea-level rise makes higher storm surges more likely, but because it will require the barrier to activate more often—increasing wear and tear on a structure that has already experienced structural problems. According to Georg Umgiesser, an oceanographer at the Italian National Research Council’s Institute of Marine Sciences, with 50 centimeters (about 20 inches) of sea-level rise, the barrier will be closed once a day, whereas with 70 centimeters (about 28 inches), the gates will be closed more often than they are open. “More frequent closing doesn’t only imply additional maintenance costs,” Umgiesser said, “but an ever-increasing dependence on the barrier to avert severe flooding. A failure could be devastating.” Over the years, alternatives to a seawall have been proposed. Some offered tweaks to the system of mobile gates, while others involved different technologies. Still others were aimed only at making the flooding more bearable. So far, though, none has found wide support. At any rate, it seems clear that Venice, like many other coastal cities around the world, won’t be saved by a barrier alone. “Since the 1966 flood, the frequency of tides over 110 centimeters has doubled each decade,” said Giovanni Cecconi, head of the Venice Resilience Lab. “And this trend is not going to stop anytime soon, even if emissions were curbed.” “It’s obvious that MOSE is not a magic wand,” he continued, “but rather something that will allow us to take time to figure out and implement new ways to cope with a crisis.” More Climate Science","Finally, construction is finishing on the delayed barrier to protect the city from high tides.

"Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN","(CNN)A pilot for 10 years, Adam Liston was at work, away from his small Nebraska community, when record flooding forced his wife and two kids to evacuate. When he got back, he knew what he had to do. 
""When I was able to return to Nebraska and saw the devastation, I just knew I had to help in the best way I could. And that was fly people in and out of the isolated town of Fremont,"" Liston, 29, of nearby Woodcliff, told CNN. ""I know how helpless I felt being away from my family during this, and I wanted to reunite as many people as I could.""
Liston is among an impromptu crew of private pilots who have offered free flights to residents stranded in Fremont. Deadly flooding in parts of Nebraska has turned whole communities into islands as the Platte and Elkhorn rivers swelled to record highs. 
Fremont's 28,000 residents were cut off at the height of the flooding. Flood records have been shattered in 17 places, and more rivers will likely break cresting records this week, the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency said.
Liston personally airlifted about 40 people thanks to a crowdfunding campaign launched with the help of his wife, Mandi, he said. 
""I started at 8 a.m. on Sunday, running purely on generous donations, but by noon, dozens more pilots and planes showed up, eager to help,"" he added. ""It was a full community effort."" 
More than 30 airplanes have flown into the Fremont Municipal Airport since the flooding began to help more than 500 flood victims, said Jim Kjeldgaard, owner and operator of Fremont Aviation. The pilots, who've come from across Nebraska and neighboring Kansas and Wyoming, are donating their time to help shuttle stranded residents to and from their hometowns. 
""We've had an awful lot of airplanes and a heck of a lot of people. It was pretty much chaos a few days ago; the situation is somewhat under control now, as some of the highways are opening back up,"" Kjeldgaard told CNN Tuesday morning.
""These people are taking days off of work to do this,"" he said. ""The general aviation people and some business aircraft have stepped right up to the plate. They took care of the situation the best it could be taken care of, considering.""
'Most people had a look of relief when they got a ride'
Another pilot, Adam Marshall, told CNN he heard about the airlifting effort from a guy he met just a couple of weeks ago. The man hangars his airplane in a building next to Marshall's. 
""He texted me and asked if I could help, and I thought it was a great opportunity to use my pilot skills for good,"" Marshall said. 
Marshall, who has been a private pilot for almost three years, said he made more than 30 trips between Fremont and Omaha's Millard neighborhood and transported about 40 people. His phone was ringing nonstop for two days from people asking to be transported, he said. 
""I transported the entire Midland University dance team to Omaha so they wouldn't miss their commercial flight and a woman named Allie who has five kids and had been cut off from her family,"" he said, noting that two of the children were 18-month-old twins. 
""I transported another woman whose husband had been airlifted to Omaha but she couldn't be with him because the roads were closed and there was no room in the helicopter,"" Marshall said. 
""Most people had a look of relief when they got a ride,"" he said. ""I got a lot of hugs the last few days!""
In Kjeldgaard's 48 years in the business, he's never seen a response quite like this, he said. 
""We've had flood situations here before but never this magnitude. We never needed this evacuation-type response. I've been here 48 years,"" he said. 
""That's the outpouring from general aviation pilots,"" he added. ""We're a close-knit community, even if we're a long ways away. You hate to see disasters like this happen, but the support was very nice to see.""

"JACK HEALY, RICHARD FAUSSET and CAMPBELL ROBERTSON","But the mind-set seemed to have fully changed.

Andrew Freedman,"The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast are in for a wild ride during the next few days as a nor'easter rapidly intensifies off the East Coast of the U.S. The storm will bring with it an array of life-threatening hazards, from record-breaking coastal flooding and hurricane force winds, to cement-like wet snow that will bring down trees and power lines. The storm will undergo bombogenesis, a process in which the minimum central air pressure will drop by at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. In general, the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm. The rapid drop in air pressure will kick up extremely strong winds, which will help bring air travel to a halt in some of the biggest cities in the country, from Boston to Washington, D.C., due to high winds and heavy precipitation. SEE ALSO: Dangerous storm targets Northeast, Mid-Atlantic with high winds, coastal flooding, inland snow Along the Massachusetts shoreline, coastal flooding is likely to exceed all of the benchmark floods of the past, including the Blizzard of 1978, and possibly the highest water level on record in Boston, which was set earlier this winter. Up and down the coast of eastern Massachusetts, a 3-to-5-foot storm surge on top of high astronomical high tides, coupled with angry seas with building waves, will do significant damage to shoreline infrastructure, including homes and businesses. A man walks through a flooded section of Brant Rock in Marshfield, Mass., on Jan. 4, 2018, as the afternoon high tide struck during the blizzard.

That storm flooded a subway station and shut down portions of the city. This event has the potential to do even more damage in the low-lying, coastal city. Communities to the north and south of Boston, will also see major coastal flooding on par with some of the biggest coastal storms on record. Cape Cod looks to be in line for some of the highest winds and waves, and its beaches are prone to erosion. Chart showing atmospheric spin at around 15,000 feet, depicting a closed upper level low south of New England, a telltale sign of an intense Nor'easter. Image: tropicaltidbits.com The overall weather pattern in which this nor'easter is forming is going to prevent the storm from skipping east, out to sea, quickly. This will heighten the storm's impacts, making coastal flooding last through multiple high tides, as east to northeast winds drive water ashore in Massachusetts, parts of Long Island, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. A sprawling, intense area of high pressure parked over Greenland is serving as a giant stop sign in the atmosphere, pinning storms like this close to the U.S. coast. Such a high pressure area is known as a ""Greenland block,"" and it's a prerequisite for producing a severe winter weather event in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Here's what to expect in the big cities of the Northeast, along with more details on the threat of heavy, wet snow making it all the way to the coast, which could spread power outage closer to highly populated areas. Computer model projection showing sea level pressure and winds just above the Earth's surface on March 2, 2018. Image: tropicaltidbits.com Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Philadelphia: In these cities, heavy rain on Thursday night and Friday, along with extremely windy conditions on Friday will be the biggest impacts from the storm. Some coastal flooding is possible in the Philadelphia area as well. Wind gusts could exceed 60 miles per hour on Friday in the D.C. area, as the region will be located between the deepening low pressure area offshore and high pressure to the west, causing a wind tunnel effect. New York City: In New York, the official forecast is for a sloppy, messy, windswept rainstorm. The precipitation may mix with or change to snow at times, but any accumulations are highly uncertain at this time. It's possible that the storm will manufacture enough cold air through dynamical cooling to turn the rain to heavy snow late on Friday into Saturday morning, which would create a host of problems in the city and nearby suburbs, but this is not a high-confidence forecast scenario. Winds will gust to at least 50 to 60 miles per hour along the coast, and moderate to major coastal flooding is possible at high tides, which is also the case in coastal New Jersey. Storm surge of 3-5 feet with big wave action is no joke. Take this storm very seriously if you are at the coast. Major flooding is expected.

Snowfall amounts, however, hinge on how much temperatures cool down during the storm, with anywhere from 3 to 6 inches of snow to a foot of heavy, wet snow possible. Snowfall exceeding 3 inches could cause widespread power outages, given the weight of the wet snow on trees and power lines. The Halloween nor'easter of 2011 dumped about a foot of snow in Hartford, causing a weeklong power outage. Boston: The strongest winds, most severe storm surge, and historic coastal flooding all appear to be focused on Beantown and other locations in eastern Massachusetts. Winds could gust to hurricane force — 75 miles per hour — in the area, and a combination of high astronomical tides, a 3-to-5-foot storm surge, and destructive waves are likely to produce historic coastal flooding in many areas during multiple high tides.

Coastal flooding is an increasing hazard in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast in part because of sea level rise caused by global warming.

Mark Kaufman,"In 1948, Air Force Secretary Stuart Symington stationed the United States' long-range nuclear bombers at Offutt Air Force Base in eastern Nebraska, a location safe in the middle of the nation and well-insulated from the coast.
But 70 years later, the base now home to the U.S. Strategic Command which deters ""catastrophic actions from adversaries and poses an immediate threat to any actor who questions U.S. resolve by demonstrating our capabilities"" isn't safe from historic and record-setting floods. 
Intense rains on top of the rapid melting of ample snow has inundated large swathes of Nebraska and a full one-third of the Offutt Air Force Base, including the headquarters building.
NASA's Landsat 8 satellite captured before and after images of the flooding which the European Union Earth Observation Programme called ""biblical."" The overloaded river burgeoned in size, creeping into Offutt, neighborhoods, and farmlands. 
Satellite image from March 20, 2018, a year prior to the flooding.

A number of potent factors mixed to create what Offutt Air Force Base Commander Mike Manion has labeled a ""1,000 year flood"" meaning there's only a one in 1,000 chance of such an extreme event happening in any given year. 
NASA noted that exceptionally cold Arctic blasts (from a wobbly polar vortex) preserved bounties of snow that soon rapidly melted when ""unusually warm"" March air produced massive amounts of runoff. Exacerbating matters, the winter's freeze made the ground less absorbent when extreme downpours then slammed the region. 
SEE ALSO: The Green New Deal: Historians weigh in on the immense scale required to pull it off
If that wasn't enough, big rains in 2018 had already ""loaded the dice even more,"" meteorologist Bryce Anderson noted on Twitter: A thawed ground, already saturated with water, wouldn't have been able to soak up much water anyway, he said
On top of this confluence of extreme weather events, Earth's atmosphere is considerably different than it was a century ago. Specifically, the climate has warmed by 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit), and due to simple physics, the warmer air is able to hold more water vapor. Specifically, for every 1 degree Celsius of warming, the air can hold seven percent more water.
That means more intense downpours. Between 1958 and 2012, the amount of rain in the heaviest rainfall events in the midwest shot up by 37 percent, according to U.S. government scientists.
Forthcoming research will reveal the role climate change played during these floods, though atmospheric scientists expect this same climate lever to bring more intense precipitation blasts to other parts of the nation in the near future, notably California.

Peter Szekely,"(Reuters) - The floods that have devastated large swaths of Nebraska and Iowa since late last week left house pets homeless, inflicted an unknown toll on livestock and led to several daring water rescues of animals from dogs to horses. 
Rescuers in the Omaha area, where the Platte, Elkhorn and Missouri rivers began spilling over their banks last week, have been working overtime to save dogs and cats along with their owners, sometimes at risk to themselves. 
“It becomes very difficult and it does put our rescuers in harms way, because you have animals that can potentially try to bite or fight,” Rescue Lieutenant Jami Mitchell of Waterloo Fire/Rescue in Nebraska said by phone on Tuesday. 
Along with the 189 adults and eight children pulled from flooded homes in Waterloo, about 20 miles west of Omaha, Mitchell tallied 87 dogs, eight cats, one rabbit, two birds, two hamsters and 26 horses. 
“We’ve had some families that have had up to six dogs that were loaded on an air boat at the same time as the families being evacuated from flood waters,” she said. 
The rain- and snow-melt-induced flooding in the middle of the country’s farm belt has killed at least four people and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, killing untold numbers of livestock. 
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue told Fox Business Network on Tuesday that the governors of Nebraska and Iowa told him that up to 1 million calves may have been killed. 
But Nebraska Agriculture Department Director Steve Wellman said there were no reliable numbers of animals lost to flooding. 
Ranchers, some of whom have used air boats to bring feed to flood-stranded herds, are bracing for the possibility of additional problems with their livestock once the waters recede, Nebraska Cattlemen spokeswoman Talia Goes said. 
“Standing in the cold water and being cold certainly isn’t good for the health of the animal,” she said by phone. 
Two Omaha area shelters for people evacuated from their homes are letting animal owners keep their pets during their stay, easing the strain on animal shelters and the stress on people forced to flee their homes. 
“It’s helped the folks staying here; they’ve been through enough,” said Josh Murray, spokesman for the Omaha/Council Bluffs Metro Region Office of the American Red Cross. 
Nebraska Humane Society Vice President Mark Langan said a dozen horses have been led out of raging flood waters along with dogs, cats and other pets that the agency is sheltering. 
“We are nearing capacity, but we always figure out a way to find room,” said Langan. 
In some cases, the flooding has uncovered animal hoarders, such as a house on the outskirts of Omaha where teams pulled out 75 cats and dogs, Muddy Paws Second Chance Rescue President Terri Larson said. 
“Right now, we’re doing a water rescue for eight feral dogs and a couple of birds,” Larson said by phone. “It’s been crazy.”

I've just never seen this much snow in my life."" Boston Fire Department tweeted photos of flooded streets and firefighters braving hurricane-force winds while rescuing a man trapped in his water. Boston25 reporter Jason Solowski called it a “big soupy mess” in Boston, while Jacob Long showed his soaked legs after moving through flooded sidewalks. “Word to the wise. Flooded sidewalks can be deeper than they appear. Went to help a woman get across the street to her car and stepped off a big curb. The water is freeeeeeeeezing. Time to change,” Long tweeted. Quincy police said officers rescued at least 20 people as of Thursday afternoon, warning drivers to stay off the roads by using the hashtag “don’t drown, turn around.” In Chatham, several cars were seen “floating” through the street while water rose through a barrier island and reach a condo complex, according to Masslive.com. The storm knocked out power to more than 5,500 homes and businesses Thursday morning in Provincetown, Massachusetts, on the outermost tip of Cape Cod, which was being lashed with hurricane-force wind gusts, the Eversource electric utility said. Much of that power was restored by early afternoon. The storm system left at least three people dead in North Carolina from vehicle crashes. Two men died Wednesday night when their truck overturned into a creek in Moore County southwest of the Raleigh-Durham area. Sgt. Michael Baker identified the two killed to The Associated Press as the driver, 57-year-old Michael Alexander Wilson, and a passenger, 73-year-old Jerry David Wilson. Both were from Bear Creek.

George Dvorsky,"A former Thailand navy SEAL has died while working to save 12 boys and their coach from the submerged Tham Luang cave complex, the New York Times reports. The death comes as a heavy blow to the rescue mission, as monsoon rains threaten further flooding and as oxygen levels inside the chamber have started to drop. Around 1:00 am local time this morning, Saman Gunan, a 38-year-old retired Thai navy SEAL, was on his way out of the cave system after delivering extra oxygen canisters along the route to the trapped boys and their coach when he ran out of oxygen and lost consciousness. His partner, who was unable to revive him, brought his body back to the mouth of the cave. “His job was to deliver oxygen,” Passakorn Boonyaluck, the deputy governor of the Chiang Rai region, told reporters. “He did not have enough on his way back.” Saman, who had left the Thai navy, returned to help with the rescue mission. In respect for his efforts, the Thai king said he’ll sponsor the funeral. It’s doubtful the boys will be told about the diver’s death, as the news would likely damage their morale even further, and at a time when they need to build both their physical and psychological health. “I can guarantee that we will not panic, we will not stop our mission, we will not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste,” Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yukongkaew told reporters this morning. “But even though we have lost one man, we still have faith to carry out our work,” he said, adding that, “We are trained to expect risks at anytime. It’s part of the job.” The diver’s death underscores the danger of a rescue attempt. A round trip to the boys takes 11 hours, six of which, en route to the chamber, are against the current. Visibility is practically nil, and some passageways are mere crawlspaces. The 12 soccer players and their coach have been trapped in the Tham Luang cave complex for nearly two weeks. They were discovered by expert divers on July 2, about 2.5 miles (4 km) from the mouth of the cave. The “Wild Boars” team entered the cave when it was dry, but flood waters trapped them inside. Heavy monsoon rains are expected to resume on Sunday, presenting a challenge for rescue workers who are desperately trying to pump water out of the caves. Oxygen levels within the chamber are another concern. The demand for oxygen has increased owing to the presence of the support team members, who are currently attending to the boys. The oxygen level in the chamber is now at 15 percent, down from the usual 21 percent, the BBC reports. Oxygen canisters are being delivered to the chamber, along with food and medical supplies. Rescuers are currently working to connect a three mile (5 km) cable to the chamber to supply oxygen, along with a fiber optic cable for communication. A plan to leave the boys in the caves until the monsoon season ends—which won’t happen for another four months—is appearing less feasible with each passing day and hour. A rescue attempt through the submerged passages seems inevitable. “At first, we thought the children could stay for a long time,” said Apakorn, “but now things have changed, we have a limited time.” The expected rains will likely replenish the caves with water, but as the monsoon season progresses, there’s a heightened chance that sinkholes and streams will flood the cramped chamber. To complicate matters, the boys have never used scuba gear, and some don’t know how to swim. Sadly, the death of Saman Gunan shows how perilous the situation really is—even for experienced navy SEAL divers.

Tom McKay,"Donald Trump may be Twitter’s most infamous shitposter, but he’s also leading the charge flooding Facebook with political ads. According to a new analysis, he’s the number one spender on the site, flanked by Planned Parenthood and Texas Democrat Rep. Beto O’Rourke. Per the New York Times, the $274,000 Trump’s campaign and his political action committee have dropped on Facebook ads since early May, earning some 37 million impressions, far outpaces the $188,000 dropped by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which got 24 million impressions. O’Rourke, who currently engaged in a risky bid to w in Sen. Ted Cruz’s seat, spent $194,400 to reach 13 million. Most other politicians were far behind, spending “well under $100,000 on ads on the social network, reaching only hundreds of thousands of Facebook users,” the TImes wrote. That’s consistent with prior reporting that emphasized Trump’s team really, really likes pouring money into the site, spending $44 million to Clinton’s $28 million on Facebook ads and with a far higher clickthrough rate due to their more inflammatory content. (More recently, Trump has been on a spending spree promoting Brett Kavanaugh, his noxious Supreme Court nominee.) The data comes by way of a study by New York University researchers which puts the total amount of US political advertising on Facebook since May at somewhere between $13.9 million to just shy of $72 million, or somewhere between just over 1.4 billion to nearly 3.9 billion impressions. To reach their estimates, researchers examined Facebook’s newly created database of ads with political content, which launched in May in response to widespread dismay over alleged Russian infiltration of the site that reached as many as 126 million Facebook users. The new system requires political ad purchasers to verify their identities as citizens or permanent residents, with ads flagged as political archived on a Facebook domain. The Times writes: That means Facebook’s political ad archive largely provides a portrait of domestic activity, spotlighting both the digital ad buying of Democratic and Republican elected officials and political candidates, as well as nonprofit organizations, for-profit groups and PACs. The archive also shows how much these ads were actually consumed by the social network’s users. The paper added that while the analysis concluded that “left-wing” groups were represented heavily among the top spenders, the NYU researchers were unable to determine which side of the political spectrum was spending more in general on Facebook: The N.Y.U. researchers broke out the top 449 spenders of political ads on Facebook since May for The New York Times. Of those, 210 were left-wing groups, 124 were right-wing groups and 115 groups were politically neutral, they said. Damon McCoy, who conducted the study with two fellow researchers, Laura Edelson and Shikhar Sakhuja, said they were not able to tally the total spending for Republicans and Democrats because their analysis was ongoing, though they planned to release those figures in the future.... But the new study found a healthy amount of activity from what the researchers described as left-leaning politicians. Of the top 20 political candidates and PACs purchasing Facebook ads, 12 were identified as Democrats while eight were Republicans, according to data provided by the N.Y.U. researchers. Facebook’s database provides a decent look at the performance of individual ads, the Times wrote, but lacks the capability to give third parties the ability to capture the full extent of advertising on the site, seemingly by design. For example, one of the researchers on the study, Damon McCoy, told the paper groups sometimes place ads under multiple names. The researchers wrote that because the database was apparently designed “with human interaction as the primary use case”—in other words, it conveniently lacks an API which would allow them to pull the full data set—they were only able to pull “approximately the first 6,000 ads returned by a search.” Though the researchers commended Facebook’s political advertising transparency tools, they also noted “coarse-grained ranges of impressions and amount spent per ad on political content ads makes it difficult to perform precise analysis of Facebook’s Archive of Ads With Political Content.” So that’s fun! It also explains why there is a nearly $60 million gap between the low and high end estimates of total spending. While the researchers added that Facebook plans to release the API “later this year,” they added that the urgency of the 2018 midterm elections compelled them to move forward without the full data set. Arguably, even the full set would not necessarily provide full transparency, given the growing influence of dark money groups which do not need to disclose their donors to the public or, as of Tuesday, the government, and can theoretically name themselves ambiguous things like Americans for Voting in Elections. And even this partial analysis showed tens of thousands of unvetted political ads had slipped past Facebook’s radar. The researchers also identified some 43,575 political ads without named sponsors, according to the Times, meaning that Facebook staff had only noticed that they did not pass through the verification process and taken them down until after they were live on the site. The researchers wrote that while the length of time such unvetted ads stayed on the site decreased from 14.1 days at the start of the time period in question to 5.6 days by June 24th, “5.6 days is still a relatively long delay, indicating that Facebook should likely continue investing effort into reducing this delay.” It is unclear how many other political ads could be slipping by unnoticed, since only those actually caught by Facebook could appear in the archive. One additional little nugget noticed by the researchers: Trump’s official campaign committee and his PAC appear to be sharing the same Facebook real estate in possible violation of campaign finance laws: “It is also interesting that this PAC and President Trump’s campaign committee are both linking political content ads to the same Facebook page. One of the rules for PACs is that they cannot coordinate with a politician’s campaign organization.” Might want to fix that! In any case, congratulations to our large, angry POTUS for being number one in political ads on the internet’s dumbest website.

"Paul P. Murphy, CNN","(CNN) Authorities in Georgetown County, South Carolina, are urging thousands of people to evacuate ahead of historic flooding in an area where multiple swollen rivers converge.

Parts of Georgetown County will see at least 10 feet of flooding, forecasters say. Key words: at least. The flooding is expected to begin Tuesday and will last through the weekend. ""The Pee Dee River is the big elephant in the room,"" Georgetown County Administrator Sal Hemingway said in a press conference Thursday. The Great Pee Dee and the larger Waccamaw River have already swollen to record levels upstream -- as demonstrated by the flooding 40 miles north in and around Conway, where the Waccamaw is still rising -- and that water is now traveling downstream at historic levels. There is no benchmark for comparison, not even the destruction wrought by Hurricane Matthew last year, Hemingway said. Making matters worse is the potential for tides to exacerbate floodwater levels. Normally, from low tide to high tide, Georgetown sees about a 3-foot difference in the water level where the Great Pee Dee River meets Winyah Bay. Monday night's full moon means high tides will be even higher. If the rivers hit peak crest during a high tide, flooding will spread even farther into the city. How the city is preparing The rainfall that Florence dumped on North Carolina has been crawling downriver for more than two weeks. It's now set to inundate the homes and businesses belonging to Georgetown County's more than 61,000 people -- almost 8,000 of whom are being urged to evacuate. A significant portion of the city is expected to be underwater. Critical infrastructure is already being prepared and hardened. Along Highway 17, which connects Georgetown to the nearby South Carolina coast and its beaches, flood barriers are being erected. Officials worry that the flooding could wash away the portion of the highway that links the bridges spanning the Great Pee Dee and Waccamaw rivers. As a precaution, the South Carolina National Guard is building a floating ribbon bridge, capable of carrying heavy equipment, across the Waccamaw River. All 19 Georgetown County schools were closed Monday until further notice. Several are ""at risk for substantial flooding damage,"" county officials say. Two of them, Georgetown High School and Waccamaw Middle School, have opened as pet-friendly shelters. The Georgetown County Water and Sewer District is also scrambling to prepare. The Waccamaw River, which supplies drinking water for the county, will soon contain dangerous pollutants from the floodwater. Ray Gagnon, executive director of the water district, told reporters that the district is working to protect all of its facilities in the ""inundation zone,"" and preparing other sources of water -- including aquifers, recovery wells, groundwater wells and the county's interconnect with the nearby Grand Strand Water and Sewer Authority. Sandbags are also being distributed -- up to 10 per household -- but the county warned on its Facebook page, ""Keep in mind that sandbags will not seal out water."" Thomas Cafe sits on Front Street, the main drag in Georgetown. It looks almost exactly like did it did when it opened in 1929. The menu and the booths are original, as is most of the decor -- even the refrigerator. In its 89-year history, it has never flooded before. Matthew's floodwater reached only to its back door. ""We're expected to get water in this time,"" said Olivia Goins, who has waited tables there for five years. On Tuesday, the cafe won't be serving its famous $10.95 shrimp and grits. It will close for one of the few times in its history so employees can remove the fridges and freezers ahead of the flood. Like many residents and business owners in the city, they're trying to prepare in any way they can, but in the end, there's not much they can do. ""Water is water,"" Goins said bluntly. There's nothing anyone can really do; the floodwater is coming and, by all forecasts, will be catastrophic. Goins and the city of Georgetown are stuck playing the waiting game. CNN's Haley Brink, Judson Jones and Keith Allen contributed to this report.","Authorities in Georgetown County, South Carolina, are urging thousands of people to evacuate ahead of historic flooding in an area where multiple swollen rivers converge.",2018-09-24T16:41:35Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Flooding is headed to a town where several swollen rivers converge,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/24/us/florence-georgetown-flooding-wxc/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180924112152-04-thomas-cafe-flood-map-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,flooding,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Officials have told evacuated residents: ""We want you home, but you can't come yet"" The coastal city of Wilmington, North Carolina has been completely cut off from the rest of the state because of deepening flood waters. Officials say all roads in and out are now impassable and have warned evacuated residents to stay away. Reports describe the city, which has a population of about 120,000, as an island within the state. About 400 people there have been rescued from flood waters, and most of the city remains without power. The National Weather Service has warned of at least two further days of possible flash flooding in the area before conditions are forecast to improve. ""Do not come here,"" New Hanover County Commission Chairman Woody White said. ""Our roads are flooded, there is no access into Wilmington...We want you home, but you can't come yet."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some businesses, including the famously resilient Waffle House chain, have remained open in the 'marooned' city Two of the first known fatalities - that of a mother and her seven-month son - were reported in the city on Friday morning. The area is usually best known as a filming location for US dramas One Tree Hill and Dawson's Creek. US basketball legend Michael Jordan - who is fundraising to help residents affected by the storm - also grew up in the city. Many roads inside Wilmington are still passable for residents who defied evacuation orders to ride the storm out. But a city-wide curfew has been extended after five people were arrested on suspicion of looting from a store in the city on Saturday. What is the latest on the storm? At least 17 people are now reported to have died in storm-related incidents in North and South Carolina since Florence made landfall as a category one hurricane on Thursday. It has now weakened into a tropical depression with winds of 35mph (55km/h), according to the National Hurricane Centre. Media caption Gusts &amp; floods: the impact of the storm Some parts of the Carolinas have seen up to 40in (100cm) of rain since Thursday - and officials have warned river levels are yet to peak in places. ""The storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now,"" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Sunday. ""Wherever you live in North Carolina, be alert for sudden flooding."" The governor also warned of the potential danger of landslides once the weather system reached more mountainous areas. The US coast guard and volunteer boats have been helping people left stricken by rising flood waters across the states. Officials in North Carolina have said about 900 people have been rescued from floodwaters there, and about 15,000 people still in emergency shelters. US President Donald Trump has declared a disaster in several North Carolina counties - a move that frees up federal funding for recovery efforts. He has praised federal and local law enforcement response to the storm on Twitter several times and the White House has indicated he may visit the affected area in coming days. Power companies are working to restore power to the almost 650,000 homes and businesses that are still without electricity. The centre of the storm is still over North Carolina but is expected to accelerate north on Sunday night local time before turning to head toward New England on Tuesday. What do we know of the victims? Eleven deaths were reported in North Carolina, and at least six have been reported in South Carolina. A mother and her seven-month child who died when a tree fell on their house in Wilmington were the first known deaths reported. Among the other fatalities were two men in their 70s who died in Lenoir County - one had been connecting extension cords and another was blown by high winds when checking on his dogs. Four road deaths in South Carolina have been blamed on the storm, and two people died from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a generator inside their home. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged. Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h Houses suffer damage, severe flooding Storm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h Some roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"• Nearly half the flights at New York’s LaGuardia Airport and around a quarter of the flights at Newark Liberty International Airport were called off. The Newark airport also sidelined its AirTrain because of high winds and replaced it with shuttle buses. • More than 200,000 people were without power in Virginia, Dominion Energy reported, mostly in the northern part of the state. Forecasters were warning that other parts of the East Coast might lose power, too. • The National Weather Service said coastal flooding from high seas and storm surge could impact areas from New Jersey to Massachusetts, and warned of inland flooding from the heavy rains. • New York City and Long Island can expect heavy rain — an estimated two to three inches — and some snow mixed in, but the biggest concern will be the damaging winds in the afternoon and evening. Read more in New York Today. • Some communities in Massachusetts, including Scituate and Newburyport, urged residents to evacuate ahead of the storm. The state’s governor, Charlie Baker, warned Friday’s storm could be more severe than the Jan. 4 storm that brought historic flooding to the city. Another ‘bomb cyclone’ is expected. The dire warnings prompted Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York to activate the State Emergency Operations Center on Thursday. Governor Baker of Massachusetts said he had called in the National Guard. The Jan. 4 storm gained much attention in part because some meteorologists described it as a “bomb cyclone.” (The name essentially derives from how quickly the barometric pressure falls.) Meteorologists say the pressure in the center of this weekend’s storm will plummet so fast that it, too, is likely to become a bomb cyclone. Kim Buttrick, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s office in Taunton, Mass., said the storm was essentially an area of low pressure that was moving northeast — strengthening and spiraling before it comes to a halt for about two days. While the system spins north, the strong winds will whip out around it, Ms. Buttrick said, churning up the seas and adding to the conditions that, along with “astronomically high tides” and other factors, could create the catastrophic flooding. Video The rising waters are looking ‘really bad’ near Boston. At Revere Beach, north of Boston, the tumultuous Atlantic Ocean was churning up on the shore on Friday morning, and threatening to flood homes and businesses along the beach. “The water is bad, really bad,” said Fernando Loaiza, the manager of Antonia’s restaurant. Motorists were inching slowly along the boulevard that runs the length of the beach. All along the Massachusetts coast, residents were bracing for high tides. Combined with buffeting winds, seas were expected to surge beyond the record-breaking levels of the Jan. 4 storm, which caused major damage. Already, high winds have taken down trees and branches, hurling them across train tracks and stalling subway and commuter trains, and power losses have been reported across the region. Reporting was contributed by Jess Bidgood and Katharine Q. Seelye from Boston; Matt Stevens and Alexandra S. Levine from New York; and Mitch Smith from Chicago.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Violent storms across swathes of the Southeast have caused several deaths and caused major flooding this weekend, with landslides also reported in several areas. Rain in parts of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee reached an astonishing one to one and a half feet, according to CBS News contributing meteorologist Jeff Berardelli.
Per the Associated Press, a tornado in Columbus, Mississippi killed one woman in a house undergoing renovation, while a man in Knox County, Tennessee drowned after his vehicle was submerged in floodwaters. The tornado resulted in 12 other injuries, but they are not believed to be life-threatening, Columbus Mayor Robert Smith Sr. told the AP. An additional death was reported in Craighead County, Arkansas, after a 76-year-old man and his vehicle was swept away by high water after seemingly driving around barricades, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
Destruction in Columbus included damage at First Pentecostal Church that Rev. Steve Blaylock described as a total loss, while sheds and outbuildings in the citys east side were mostly demolished, the AP wrote. Used-car dealer Lee Lawrence said the storm demolished four buildings on his lot and blew out car windows, telling the AP it will be a start-over deal. I cant say it will come back better or stronger, but well come back.
The AP wrote:
A photographer working for The AP in Columbus said some antique cars on Lawrences lot were parked among the damage and a nearby pet grooming business appeared now to be mostly twisted piles of metal. A printing shop had been speared by a pipe with great force and what seemed to be a vacant commercial building nearby appeared heavily damaged.
Some 300 river gauges across the Southeast remained above flood levels on Sunday, according to CNN.
Tennessees Knox County was put under a flash flood warning on Saturday afternoon, CNN reported, with the National Weather Service advising residents that this is a particularly dangerous situation. Seek higher ground now. Amid the rising floodwaters, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency declared a state of emergency. Officials also implemented regional states of emergency in Alabama and Mississippi.
There were additional reports of rockslides wiping out part of Interstate 40 near the Tennessee-North Carolina border, with all lanes covered by rocks, trees, and dirt. Construction engineer Ted Adams of the North Carolina Department of Transportations District 14 told the Citizen Times it was a small slide with rocks falling from a pretty high elevation, and when they were hitting the road, they were bouncing into the eastbound lanes. The road may be closed for up to a week, the paper wrote.
Mudslides in Chattanooga also wiped out a Subway retail location on Saturday morning. Per the Times Free Press, owner Owen Megahee closed the location on Friday after observing an adjacent hill seemed about to collapse.
If they had it open, and employees and customers had been in there, wed be talking about something much more serious, fire department spokesman Bruce Garner told the paper. People could have been hurt or killed for sure.
Nearby, the Dunlap Fire Department posted a video of rising floodwaters spilling well over the boundaries of a waterway on Saturday.
The city of Nashville broke a rainfall record, with its February the wettest in over a century, CNN reported. In Lynchburg, between Nashville and Chattanooga, the grounds of the Jack Daniels distillery were flooded, though employee Henry Feldhaus IV told CNN that all employees and stores of whiskey were safe.
While the storms are largely over, CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar said that many of the floods will not crest until later in the week as rains continue to drain into waterways. According to the AP, tens of thousands of Appalachian Power customers in West Virginia remained without electricity as of Sunday afternoon.

AJ Dellinger,"In addition to flooding social media with false news stories, propaganda-spreading bots, and all sorts of online chicanery during the 2016 US presidential campaign, Russian trolls also reportedly attempted to erode Americans’ trust in local news by posing as city newspapers. According to NPR, operatives working for the Kremlin-linked troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency created at least 48 separate Twitter accounts that were designed to look like the local newspaper for a number of major US cities. With help from the Alliance for Securing Democracy, NPR found that the account existed well before the 2016 election got into full swing. One account made up to look like the defunct Chicago Daily News, which was shuttered in 1978, was created in May 2014. By July 2016, the account had amassed more than 19,000 followers. The Russian-run accounts, which have since been suspended by Twitter, included @ElPasoTopNews, @MilwaukeeVoice, @CamdenCityNews, and @Seattle_Post—all of which were modeled to appear as though they were trusted local papers. Of course, none of them were—but the accounts all behaved relatively normally. Perhaps the strangest thing about this particular campaign is that, according to NPR, none of the accounts bothered to spread misinformation or propaganda. Instead, they played it entirely straight and diligently tweeted out real local stories without any spin. According to the report, the apparent plan for the accounts was to build up trust over the course of several years before launching some sort of disinformation campaign. Here’s what Bret Schafer, a social media analyst for the Alliance for Securing Democracy, told NPR : “They set them up for a reason. And if at any given moment, they wanted to operationalize this network of what seemed to be local American news handles, they can significantly influence the narrative on a breaking news story,” Schafer told NPR. “But now instead of just showing up online and flooding it with news sites, they have these accounts with two years of credible history.” A campaign targeting local news does make some sense. The fake stories that spread on Facebook during the run-up to the election were often hosted on sites designed to look like local news publications. Americans also generally trust their local news much more than national news organizations. According to a 2016 Pew Research poll, 82 percent of people had some or a lot of trust in their local press. A 2017 poll from Morning Consult found that 41 percent of registered voters were more likely to trust local news outlets to report honestly than the national alternatives. Just 27 percent said they have more faith in the truthfulness of national news coverage. Whatever the intention of the Russian-run fake newspaper accounts, we’ll never know for sure since they have been shut down. The local news appears safe from Russian interference for the time being—now to figure out what to do about interference from places like Sinclair.

MARIANA ALFARO,"“Residents should not return to their homes without an escort for safety reasons,” the police department posted on Facebook. John G. Ducey, the mayor, added that “they’re not going to be moving back anytime quickly.” “This is the exact opposite of anywhere that flooded during Sandy,” Mr. Ducey said. “This is the northwest portion of town. It never flooded before. I never even got a complaint about water in the road.” Some in New Jersey blamed the scale of the flooding on climate change — and politics. Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, said that changes to waterway protections had left the state more vulnerable. “We continue to see more and more flood events across our state, affecting homes and communities and putting our waterways at risk,” Mr. Tittel said. “More development creates more impervious surfaces and destroys floodplains and wetlands,” he added. “This all contributes to increased flooding and storm water runoff, further putting communities at risk.”","Flash floods swept through New York and New Jersey over the last three days, leading to states of emergency and evacuations across the region.",2018-08-14T23:23:35Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",You Got the Flood Warning on Your Phone.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Mario Aguilar to Gizmodo","California gets most of its rain during the winter, but this wet season has proven especially juicy so far. The moisture parade continued on Wednesday with a major atmospheric river descended on the Golden State, raising concerns of flooding and mudslides as it dumps heavy rain and snow across a wide region through Thursday evening.
Atmospheric rivers are exactly what they sound like: long, narrow, sky-high bands of moisture originating in the tropical Pacific that speed across the ocean toward the U.S. West Coast, unleashing rain at lower elevations and snow at higher elevations. According to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, big atmospheric river events can carry roughly the same amount of water as the mouth of the Mississippi.
Just a few of these events can deliver half of the West Coasts annual rainfall, making them an important source of replenishment for ever-precarious water supplies. But when theyre as intense as the moisture plume that began to arrive this morning, they can also cause flooding, which parts of the the Bay Area are already starting to experience. As warm, moist air sweeps over snow-covered mountains further inland, its likely to melt snow thats been building up at mid-elevations, triggering even worse flooding for communities in the foothills.
At the highest elevations in the Sierra Nevada, the remaining moisture will be squeezed out as snow that the National Weather Service says could total up to a whopping seven feet in some places.
Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLAs Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, said the rain Californias poised to receive could really decimate the middle elevation snowpack thats been building in the inland mountains between about 3,000 and 5,000 feet of elevation. Tonight, the big flood risk looks like itll come in those regions, Swain told Earther.
Further south, Los Angeles is starting to pick up some light rain, with a lot more expected on Thursday. The National Weather Service Los Angeles is calling for 1-2.5 inches of rain along the coastline with 2.5-4 inches of rain and even higher totals locally across the foothills and mountains through Thursday night. That raises the risk of roadway flooding as water hits soils that have already received more than their average dose of wet season rainfall. And floods arent the only worry: as all this water hits barren landscapes recently torched by wildfires, it could destabilize the soil, triggering rock and mudslides similar to those seen near Santa Barbara last year.
You might be wondering if all this wild weather is in any way connected to Seattles recent run of epic snowfall. The short answer is, kind of! Swain explained that the same atmospheric setup thats caused volley after volley of precipitation to fall as snow over the Emerald Citynamely, a parade of storms marching down the West Coast and encountering Arctic air over Western Canada, possibly a remnant of the recent polar vortex disruptionhas also brought a substantial amount of powder further south into California.
Thats part of the reason snowpack levels are high right now and flooding from the incoming tropical moisture could get hairy. Swain also emphasized that the merging of the subtropical jet stream bearing this weeks atmospheric river with the cold air already in place will create a big complex storm system that could be difficult to predict.
As a final note, this weeks rain event will be the first atmospheric river scientists can classify according to a brand-new scale. Developed by researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and detailed last week in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, the scale takes into account the amount of time an atmospheric river lingers over an area and the amount of water vapor contained within it to give the event a 1-5 intensity ranking. In a sense, its not unlike the Saffir-Simpson scale used to rank hurricanes.
Swain reckons this weeks rainfall event is a pretty solid four out of five.
Thats where the impacts are expected to be high enough theres mostly hazardous rather than beneficial, he said.","California gets most of its rain during the winter, but this wet season has proven especially juicy so far.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The countrys midsection is about to be hit by a rare, potentially record setting bomb cyclone that will bring everything from rain to snow to hurricane-force winds and could leave severe flooding in its wake from Texas to Minnesota. So if you live in that area, listen up!
The mayhem is already beginning as moisture streams from the Pacific into the Southwest, where winter storm warnings are in effect as of Tuesday afternoon. Up to two feet of snow could fall in New Mexicos Sangre de Cristo Mountains, accompanied by winds whipping across ridge tops at speeds of up to 75 mph, according to the National Weather Service. That alone would be pretty wild, but its only a precursor to Wednesdays weather mayhem.
As the storm pushes inland, its pressurewhich drops as storms get strongeris expected to dip into the range of 970 millibars. Thats roughly on par with an average Category 2 Atlantic hurricane and could challenge the all-time low pressure record for Kansas. The drop will be driven by the storms winds as they wrap around its core in a counter clockwise direction, bringing moist, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico in contact with cold air from the Upper Midwest and Canada. The movement of the winds is called cyclonic, and pressure is expected to drop more than 24 millibars in 24 hours, which means this storm is shaping up to fulfill the criteria for a rare inland bomb cyclone. It could even take on a hurricane-like appearance.
The fascinating thing about this storm is how quickly it will intensify and the possible record-low pressures it will produce in the Plains, Jason Furtado, a meteorology professor at the University of Oklahoma, told Earther. Another neat thing is that some models are indicating that this storm will strengthen so quickly, it could develop an eye-like feature in the center of the storm. This is a very rare for non-tropical systems and even more so for storms in the central U.S. (Its also rare for noreasters, which tend to be more comma-shaped.)
Weather geekery aside, the storm is going to make a mess of things. The area facing wind gusts up to 60 mphthe equivalent of a mature tropical stormstretches for more than 1,000 miles from Sturgis, South Dakota to the Texas-Mexico border. For comparison, the reach of Sandys tropical storm-force winds was 1,150 miles from edge to edge, although even thats not a perfect comparison, since tropical storm winds start at 39 mph.
So about those winds. The most intense blasts could rip up to 75 mph in the Rockies and Southern Plains. The rotation of the storm will also create what Furtado called a moisture pipeline straight out of the Gulf of Mexico. That means not only will it be windy, but also snowy. The National Weather Service is forecasting up to a foot or more of snow from Colorado to the Dakotas. Blizzard warnings are also in effect for large part of the region, and they could expand as the storm begins its onslaught.
Even after the storm clears out on Wednesday night, its impacts could linger.

,"At a Glance Rain from Winter Storm Oliver has melted snow and triggered flooding in parts of several regions. Water rescues have been reported from Texas to Michigan, and roads have been shut down. A woman died in Illinois when her car crashed into a flooded ditch. A train derailed near Grand Rapids, Michigan, and it's believed the track was washed out by flooding. Winter Storm Oliver's warm side melted snow and triggered flooding in parts of the South and Midwest, and at least one death has been blamed on the nasty weather. Illinois State Police said a 52-year-old woman died early Tuesday morning when her vehicle rolled into a flooded ditch and was submerged along Illinois Route 45 near Peotone, the Chicago Tribune reported. Peotone Fire Chief William Schreiber told the Tribune that several other vehicles were recovered from the flooded intersection, but they didn't discover this particular car until hours later. ""At five o'clock in the morning, it was dark. We could not see that vehicle,"" Schreiber told the Tribune. Peotone is located about 45 miles south of Chicago. As the Illinois River continued to rise Wednesday morning, residents in the town of Marseilles who live near the waterway were told to evacuate by the afternoon. The town southwest of Chicago has a population of about 5,000. (MORE: After Flooding Rains, Severe Weather Next? ) Flooding problems were also reported in Indiana on Tuesday. In Elkhart County, crews in boats rescued residents from a dozen homes along the Baugo Creek, the Associated Press reported. ""This city has not seen flooding like this in the last 45 years,"" Mayor Tim Neese told the Elkhart Truth. ""We also had record snowfall in addition to consistent rain."" In the city of Goshen, officials declared a local state of emergency and requested traffic be limited to emergency personnel, according to AP. In the northwestern Indiana town of Lake Station, authorities evacuated residents away from floodwaters Wednesday afternoon, according to CBS Chicago. In La Porte, the local wastewater treatment plant overflowed for just the fourth time over the course of 10 years, according to the South Bend Tribune. (MORE: Flooding Concern Growing ) Because of flooding along the Ohio River, the Horseshoe Southern Indiana Casino and Hotel in Elizabeth announced a temporary closure for the first time since 2015, WDRB.com reported. There was no timetable for the hotel's reopening. The flooding extended up into Michigan's Lower Peninsula, where many roads were closed Tuesday because they were overtaken by floodwaters. Along the Muskegon River, some residents in Croton Township were urged to evacuate their homes and stay away from flooded areas, the AP reported via MLive.com. Some schools in mid-Michigan were closed Wednesday because of the flooding, the AP also said. State authorities say two railroad workers sustained nonlife-threatening injuries after two freight train engines were derailed near Grand Rapids. Heavy rains may have triggered a washout that caused the trains to come off their tracks. A state of emergency was declared in Clare County Tuesday and three of the county's major school districts have been shut down due to the flooding, also according to MLive. In the Cincinnati area, the Ohio River remained swollen, and officials prepared for additional rainfall. Water rescues were reported as far south as Texas, where residents needed to be removed from their flooded homes near White Rock Creek in Dallas as water levels rose rapidly late Tuesday night, according to the National Weather Service. Northeast of Dallas, many roads were flooded in the Wylie area Tuesday night, the NWS also said. In Dallas, rescue crews have been searching for people who may have been inside of a white vehicle that was seen floating in the Trinity River Wednesday, NBCDFW.com reports. Police say a witness told them they spotted the car driving into the water before it was swept away. Dive teams are currently searching the waterway. Power outages have also been reported in the Lone Star State. As of Wednesday afternoon, more than 29,300 were without power, according to PowerOutage.us. More than a dozen students had to be rescued in Arkansas Wednesday after their school bus ran off-road and became stuck in flooding, AP reports. No injuries were reported. Train Derails Near Grand Rapids, Michigan South of Grand Rapids, a train derailment was reported along the Grand Elk Railroad at about 9:45 p.m. EST Tuesday night in the town of Wyoming, according to MLive.com. The derailment, which was blamed on a compromised track that had been washed out by flooding, occurred near U.S. 131, WZZM-TV reported.

TYLER PAGER,"But Ms. Lee had driven around a barricade and onto a road that the authorities had closed because of flooding. As a result, the sheriffs office of Union County, N.C., charged her on Monday with involuntary manslaughter, which could carry a sentence of 13 to 16 months in prison. Kaiden Lee-Welch died in the floodwaters of Hurricane Florence. Credit Union County Sheriff's Office, via Associated Press The tragic death of this child and the circumstances surrounding this case are heartbreaking, the sheriff, Eddie Cathey, said in a statement. We continue to pray for all those suffering as a result of this childs death. However, after a very thorough investigation and taking all facts into consideration and applying the law, we feel that these charges are appropriate. Ms. Lee also faces a misdemeanor charge of driving on a closed highway. South Carolina authorities are still investigating a similar deadly incident in that state during the storm. Two women seeking mental health treatment were being transported in a van driven by sheriffs deputies to hospitals away from the coast when the deputies drove around a barricade and onto a closed road. When the van became trapped in floodwaters, the deputies managed to escape but were unable to free the women, Nicolette Green, 43, and Wendy Newton, 45, who drowned. The Horry County Sheriffs office fired the two deputies, Stephen Flood and Joshua Bishop, last week.

Adam Rosenberg,"Paris is flooding. Although heavy rains that inundated the city throughout the week stopped on Friday, continued flooding from the Seine — the river that cuts through France's capital — is still causing concern. SEE ALSO: The Doomsday Clock is a gimmick, but why it just moved closer to midnight is deadly serious By Wednesday, the water level had hit 16 feet, more than double the Seine's average 6.5-foot depth. While French meteorological service Meteo France no longer expects floodwaters to cross the 20-foot mark at their deepest, as previously predicted, it'll be close. Paris police told CNN that water in parts of the Seine will reach 5.95 meters, or just shy of 20 feet, during the evening hours of Sunday night into Monday morning. It's not quite at the level of a 1910 flood that saw the Seine's deepest point rise to almost 28 feet. It's also short of a June 2016 flood, which saw the Seine's water level hit 21 feet. The second incident is obviously more alarming, since this latest flood is the second such incident in a two-year period. ""Two floodings of the Seine river in less than two years — we have to change, we have to change the way we build this city,"" Colombe Brossel, deputy mayor of Paris, told CNN. ""We have to understand that climatic change is not a word, it's a reality."" Studies have shown that heavy precipitation events such as this one are becoming more likely and severe as the climate continues to warm, due to human emissions of greenhouse gases. As the city works to mitigate the effects of flooding and start the lengthy clean-up process, resilient Parisians have stepped up to document the impact of the deluge on social media.","Paris is flooding.

Kirsten Korosec,"Uber is taking a page out of the federal government’s disaster response handbook. The ride-hailing company is centralizing how it responds to disasters, whether it’s flooding in North Carolina, a mass shooting in Las Vegas or an earthquake in Mexico City. Now, instead of taking a local-first (and sometimes reactionary) approach, the company’s global security center will monitor and coordinate responses 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The company, which announced the change in a blog post this week, has become part of the urban landscape. People use the Uber app to commute to work, attend concerts and other events, rent bikes (and eventually scooters) and even have food delivered. People have become increasingly reliant on the service, a responsibility that requires more than an app that connects drivers and riders. The GSC, as Uber calls it, monitors and flags issues that may affect its business and the communities in which it operates. From here, the GSC staff, which includes former military and security experts who speak a dozen different languages, coordinate with local Uber staff and city, county or state officials. The GSC is the entity that will make decisions on when to suspend service in an area or whether to cap surge pricing. The GSC might also lend support to local authorities, depending on their needs. This procedural change is another illustration of CEO Dara Khosrowshahis efforts to rehabilitate the company and its reputation. It also telegraphs the company’s push to work more closely with cities. In April, Khosrowshahi announced a series of new products to its app, including a deal with instant car-booking service Getaround to launch a product called UberRENT and a partnership with Masabi that lets users pay and book tickets for public transit in the Uber app. Uber also launched Movement in 2017, a tool that provides cities with traffic data.","Uber is taking a page out of the federal government’s disaster response handbook.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The tragic situation in the Midwest continues to unfold more than two weeks after a bomb cyclone brought in snow that eventually melted, triggering floods that destroyed farms and threatened tribal communities. The latest areas under scrutiny are Superfund sites, whose toxic pollutants can be spread far and wide by floodwaters.
 Currently on the radar for federal and state officials are seven Superfund sites and a landfill across Iowa, Nebraska, and Missouri, states that are still experiencing some minor to major flooding as of Thursday. These are some of the most contaminated sites in the U.S., and when floodwaters hit them, they can become major threats to human and environmental health if their pollutants travel off site, as was seen in Houston after Hurricane Harvey.
Superfund sites contain some of the most dangerous chemicals known to humankind, Jacob Carter, a research scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists Center for Science and Democracy, told Earther.
Thats why the Environmental Protection Agency is nowmonitoring a bunch of Superfund sites closely, although so far, it seems to think all of them are doing okay.
The EPA has taken action on two Superfunds in particular, it announced Tuesday: Nebraska Ordnance Plant, a former munitions production plant in Mead, Nebraska, and Conservation Chemical Corporation in Kansas City, Missouri, which used to store chemicals. The agency hasnt spotted any contaminant releases at either, but floodwaters did hit them hard.
When you have these floods, you have debris and mud and silt left over, so whatever pollution is in the river doesnt stay in the river. Its going to stay behind as the waters recede and be in the street, in the playground, in the persons basement, what have you.
The EPA told Earther italso flagged another two sites in Iowa with water on the property that didnt require actionthe Railroad Avenue Groundwater Contamination Site in West Des Moines and the Mid-America Tanning Company Site near Sergeant Bluff. The Lawrence Todtz Farm Site in Iowawasnt flooded, but its been made inaccessible due to the flooding, so the EPA is also monitoring it. And the EPA, in coordination with state environmental agencies, is keeping tabs on another two Superfund sites in Nebraskawhere the flooding has paused clean up activities, as well as a landfill in the City of St. Joseph in Missouri that isnt a Superfund. 
The Nebraska Ordnance Plant, which sits in the states still slightly-flooded southeast corner, has its soil and groundwater contaminated with potentially carcinogenic substances like trichloroethene (or TCE), as well as explosives. The facility saw its groundwater treatment plant and extraction wells, which help remove the TCE, temporarily shut down because authorities couldnt access them and to avoid any treated water from mixing with the floodwaters. They are all back up and running now.
This is only one of the facilities the state of Nebraska is monitoring. Others will still require close attention as the floodwaters recedeespecially if anything strange turns up in the states drinking water.
Right now, a combination of flood waters and damaged roads are keeping responders from a few of Nebraska Superfund Sites for inspection. Those sites have not been fully evaluated yet, Amanda Woita, a public information officer with the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), told Earther in an email. DEQs primary responsibility is protecting public health. That includes testing drinking water and assessing other important infrastructure, such as community drinking water wells and sewage treatment plants. The department is in that phase right now. 
Back in Missouri, the Conservation Chemical Corporations soil and groundwater are also contaminated with carcinogenic chemicals like benzene and TCE. The site experienced flooding, but the EPA reports that it didnt stop its clean-up operations in response. Instead, more groundwater was extracted to help keep pace with the floodwaters. 
Half of Missouris St. Joseph City Landfill has become flooded, according to Brian Quinn, the information officer for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. He told Earther in an email that the non-hazardous landfill was last inspected in January 2018, and the department will conduct another investigation once the waters recede to make sure the asphalt and soil cap covering the garbage is still in place.
All in all, the EPA hasnt issued any public health alerts or advisories in wake of these floods, the agency told Earther. But there could still be trouble as the floodwaters migrate farther down the Mississippi River in Missouri. John Hickey, the executive director of the states Sierra Club chapter, is worried that the many coal ash disposal sites in the eastern portion of the state along the Mississippi could pose a threat if floodwaters breach them. Coal ash landfills and ponds often contain heavy metals like lead and mercury, which are hazardous to human health. Similar flooding concerns were raised in North Carolina in wake of Hurricane Florence last year. 
 But the Superfund sites that have already experienced flooding worry Hickey, too.
When you have these floods, you have debris and mud and silt left over, so whatever pollution is in the river doesnt stay in the river, Hickey told Earther. Its going to stay behind as the waters recede and be in the street, in the playground, in the persons basement, what have you.
Americans experienced that reality firsthand in 2017 after Hurricane Harvey damaged 13 Superfund sites in Texas, leading to mass contamination from one site alone. It took the EPA eight months to begin cleaning up that site, the San Jacinto River Waste Pits, and cleanup is slated to go on another year or more. Then, there was Hurricane Maria, which flooded a lead-contaminated Superfund in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, leaving residents worried about contamination long after the natural disaster.

As Carter noted, low-income communities and people of color tend to be closest to these facilities, so theyre the most at risk. 
These are some of the most disenfranchised communities in the United States, he told Earther. [They] dont have a ton of power in the United States, and they will be the ones impacted by this flooding at Superfund sites.
The EPA is well aware of the threat that floodingwhich is set to intensify in the Midwest in a warmer worldposes to these sites. Its Climate Adaptation Plan published in 2014 makes this clear: Inundation and flooding may lead to transport of contaminants through surface soils, ground water, surface waters, and/or coastal waters. 
Former President Barack Obama issued an executive order that wouldve required all federal departments, including those that manage Superfunds, prepare for future flood risks. President Donald Trump, predictably, rescinded it. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations spring flood outlook, heavier than usual rainfall is set to bring historic, widespread flooding to the Midwest through May.
Whether or not the latest bout of floods caused any Superfund sites to spread their contaminants, it seems clear these sites will only become more vulnerable. We better ready up.
Correction: An earlier version of this post indicated that eight Superfund sites have dealt with floodwaters. One of those sites, a landfill, is not actually a Superfund. The text and headline have been updated accordingly. We have also updated to clarify that the Nebraska Ordnance Plant was shut down to avoid treated water from mixing with floodwaters in addition to access issues.","The tragic situation in the Midwest continues to unfold more than two weeks after a bomb cyclone brought in snow that eventually melted, triggering floods that destroyed farms and threatened tribal communities.

"Jennifer Gray, CNN","(CNN)While beautiful spring temperatures have settled into the Plains and Midwest, don't get used to it. There's a storm on the way that's going to remind Midwesterners that winter isn't over until it's over. 
The potential is there for a ""bomb cyclone"" to impact the Plains this week. That's an area of low pressure that drops 24 millibars in 24 hours -- aka a potent, rapidly intensifying storm system. 
This would be the second time in less than a month a storm of this magnitude has developed in the Plains. It's rare enough to have one form inland, much less, two.
Typically we see ""bomb cyclones"" form off the US East Coast in the form of nor'easters. 
Right now the forecast models have the storm teetering on the edge of bomb cyclone criteria. Either way, this storm is forecast to unleash a variety of wild weather this week. 
Things begin to unravel Tuesday
This powerful storm is forecast to develop Tuesday in the Rockies, where it will rapidly intensify and bring blizzard-like conditions to the Plains on Wednesday.
Winter storm watches are already posted for parts of Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska and Minnesota.
Arctic air will dive south, bringing frigid temperatures and possible blizzard conditions for portions of the Rockies, Plains and even Great Lakes. 
Up to 18 inches of snow will be possible with wind gusts of 45-50 mph in the Dakotas, along with white-out conditions.
Thursday the bottom drops out
Overnight temperatures in the Plains will drop 40 degrees in just 12 hours.
Thursday the storm will reach the Midwest, bringing with it the heavy snow. Ten inches of snow is possible for places like Minneapolis. 
Air travel will be drastically slowed, and road travel will be treacherous. 
The snow is not the only hazard from the storm.
In the warmer air to the south, severe weather could break out Wednesday afternoon and evening in parts of Kansas and Nebraska. 
On Thursday the threat will shift farther east into Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee. Tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds are likely with some of the storms.
The storm will exacerbate flooding concerns through the Midwest
Additional flooding in the Plains by the weekend is likely. 
We've already seen significant flooding along the Red River because of melting snow. Now with additional rain and snowmelt, more flooding will be expected. 
In South Dakota and Western Minnesota, the James and Elm rivers will continue to experience moderate to major flooding. 
Any additional rain and snow will cause these rivers to rise even higher. There's also the threat of ice jam flooding through the weekend. 
Even if this storm doesn't become a bomb cyclone, it's still going to be extremely powerful. And after temperatures hit the mid-60s to mid-70s this past weekend, the drastic change will leave millions of Americans wishing spring weather would hurry and stay.
CNN Meteorologist Dave Hennen and Allie Mazurek contributed to this report","While beautiful spring temperatures have settled into the Plains and Midwest, don't get used to it.

Computer models had been showing this storm threat for about the past week, giving meteorologists higher than average confidence in calling for a significant event. Models are also hinting at a third storm to come late this weekend, which, if it were to occur, would make for an incredibly rare string of powerful storms in a part of the country that had seen relatively quiet and unusually mild weather since January.

Frank Bainimarama said Fiji had entered a ""frightening new era"" of extreme weather that needed to be confronted. His comments came after Cyclone Josie caused deaths and flooding on Fiji's main island, Viti Levu, at the weekend. In 2016, a cyclone hit Fiji leaving 44 people dead and wiping out one-third of the nation's economic production. Four people have died in severe flooding caused by Cyclone Josie, according to Reuters news agency. ""We are now at an almost constant level of threat from these extreme weather events,"" Mr Bainimarama said on Tuesday, adding that powerful cyclones in the region were becoming ""more severe"" as a result of climate change. ""We need to get the message out loud and clear to the entire world about the absolute need to confront this crisis head on,"" he said. ""As a nation we are starting to build our resilience in response to the frightening new era that is upon us,"" he added.

"Aaron Kessler, CNN","(CNN) When a hurricane hits, people often focus too much on its category -- which only measures wind -- and not on the massive amounts of rain that accompany a storm. For days, federal and state emergency managers cautioned that Hurricane Florence's danger was primarily about rainfall and catastrophic flooding, as rivers overflowed throughout the Carolinas and into Virginia. Especially now that pockets of sunshine have broken out, and the rain is gone, it's easy to think the worst is over. But take a look: the map below shows gauges monitored by the National Weather Service that measure where rivers were flooding on Saturday, a day after Florence made landfall in North Carolina. That might not look too bad, all things considered, right? But take a look at how many more flooding events were recorded by Sunday night. And finally, here is what things looked like along the rivers as of Tuesday afternoon. Four days after Florence made landfall, 45 gauges now measure flooding along rivers throughout the region. And there could be more challenges ahead -- the Cape Fear River in North Carolina may not crest until later Tuesday or even Wednesday, where it could reach an estimated 61.5 feet near Fayetteville. In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster warned residents that the waters hadn't crested there either in many areas. He said with the wind and rain gone, the state's emergency resources are being marshaled to combat river flooding. ""We've had two threats. One is the hurricane with the wind and the water and the surge, and that part is over,"" McMaster said. ""But the second part, which has been predicted with great certainty, is the flooding, and we know it's coming."" CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","The storm may have lost strength, and the sun has come out in some areas.

"Nicole Chavez and Dakin Andone, CNN","(CNN) After an agonizing week of ravaging floodwaters, rising rivers, power outages and dozens of deaths, the Florence-weary Carolinas are facing the possibility of more flooding over the weekend. At least 44 people have died since the hurricane slammed into the coast last week. While the rain subsided, some rivers are still rising, and North and South Carolina officials warn the flooding danger is far from over. ""The Cape Fear River will crest again this weekend, along with the Lumber River,"" the North Carolina Department of Transportation tweeted Friday, adding that the Neuse will rise Monday. ""Additionally, new areas are flooding with little warning. Due to this, travel isn't recommended south of US 64,"" it said. While some roads are not flooded, they may have damage and hazardous debris that makes it dangerous to drive or walk on them, state officials said. In South Carolina, emergency officials issued a stern warning on avoiding the roads: ""I know we sound redundant, but it bears repeating: Turn around, don't drown!"" the state's emergency management department tweeted. A week after Hurricane Florence made landfall, the trillions of gallons of water it dumped over the Carolinas are slowly moving toward the sea and leaving a path of destruction behind. Residential streets have turned into rivers and freeways have morphed into waterways. Storm recovery will cost $1.2 billion In North Carolina, flooded rivers have left thousands of evacuees living in shelters and hundreds of roads underwater. The water has receded in some places, but as it moves downstream, officials say, thousands of people could be in danger until next week. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division said Friday a number of rivers -- the Waccamaw, Lynches, Little Pee Dee and Big Pee Dee -- are forecast to crest east of Interstate 95 this weekend and early next week. Residents were warned the confluence of the Big Pee Dee and Little Pee Dee rivers -- where they merge -- could reach flood levels even greater than those seen during Hurricane Matthew. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the state's resources and personnel have shifted to the Pee Dee region. Authorities have said 23 out of the 46 counties in South Carolina could potentially be impacted by flooding. Residents in those areas are still recovering from the 2015 catastrophic floods in the Carolinas as well as from the widespread damage of Hurricane Matthew in 2016 In Conway, South Carolina, authorities said residents could see damage in homes that have not flooded before. Officials are also worried about contamination and environmental hazards from the storm, including the potential effects of coal ash. Coal ash is an industrial waste created by coal-burning power plants, and can carry health risks. Flooding from the Cape Fear River caused breaches in a dam at a cooling lake at Duke Energy's LV Sutton Plant in Wilmington, North Carolina, prompting the company to shut down the natural gas plant Friday, Duke Energy said in a statement. ""Water is now exiting the cooling lake through breaches -- one large and several smaller -- on the southern end of the impoundment,"" the statement said. It noted there are two coal ash basins on the site, but said there was ""no visible ash in the cooling lake. A landfill containing disposed ash from the site has not been affected by the cooling lake, it said. An earlier statement from Duke Energy explained the LV Sutton coal power plant was retired in 2013, and today the plant operates as a natural gas plant. Most of the people died in North Carolina Of the 44 people killed, three have been in Virginia, 32 in North Carolina and nine in South Carolina, officials said. The deaths include two mental health patients killed in South Carolina's Horry County. The women, Windy Newton, 45, and Nicolette Green, 43, drowned Tuesday in a prison transport van when sheriff's deputies couldn't open the doors of the vehicle, authorities said.","After an agonizing week of ravaging floodwaters, rising rivers, power outages and dozens of deaths, the Florence-weary Carolinas are facing the possibility of more flooding over the weekend.",2018-09-22T09:59:04Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",44 dead as Florence-weary Carolinas face more flooding and rising rivers,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/22/us/florence-carolinas-flooding-saturday-wxc/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180920235843-03-florence-flooding-0920-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,flooding,1
"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Imagine a future where the United States is experiencing multiple Katrina or Sandy-like storms at the same time—all while wildfires rage in the West. Right now, the Department of Defense is in no way ready to handle that, said Francesco Femia, the co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security, a nonpartisan think tank made up of military and security experts. “Though we’re capable of managing a lot of natural disasters, a future with runaway climate change is one that’s going to become very difficult to manage even here at home,” Femia told Earther. Luckily, the Department of Defense is one of the few federal agencies that still treats climate change as a threat under President Donald Trump. On Monday, the president signed a $716 billion defense bill that Congress passed earlier this summer. It includes plans to prepare current and future military bases and military facilities for “environmental condition projections,” such as sea level rise and increased flooding. There’s also an entire section devoted to the rapidly-melting Arctic, which Russia and China are eyeing to take over. “The Department of Defense is witnessing and really on the frontlines of a lot of these changes,” Femia said. “They’ve got military bases across the world, including at sea level. They’re seeing the effects of flooding. They’re seeing the effects of wildfires and what that does to their own capabilities and priorities.” Apparently, ramping up global military efforts is one way to get the president to support climate legislation. “This bill just starts to scratch the surface of what kind of capabilities the military will need as the Arctic melts.” Sure, this bill doesn’t explicitly call out climate change by name once, but that doesn’t diminish its value. The bill lays out plans to adapt military infrastructure around the world to our changing environment and climate. That’s in line with last year’s defense spending bill, for which former President Barack Obama had laid the groundwork. The new bill requires Secretary of Defense James Mattis to prepare a report on a new Arctic strategy by June 1, 2019. This means taking a look at the sea vessels the U.S. has for this region—like icebreakers, of which the U.S. has just two ( Russia has 40 ). The bill requires that the U.S. keep at least six icebreakers starting in fiscal year 2029. Another important piece, said Femia, is the bill’s attention to training for future operations in the Arctic. “There’s an expectation of there needing to be greater capacities for search and rescues in the Arctic as we get more commercial activity and more activity, in general, in the Arctic, and we’re not really prepared to handle that level of activity,” Femia said. “This bill just starts to scratch the surface of what kind of capabilities the military will need as the Arctic melts.” This bill comes after months of back and forth between members of Congress and the Department of Defense on the importance of highlighting climate change’s roles in reports and assessments the department puts out. More than 40 House representatives in both parties sent Mattis a letter in July expressing concern that an assessment had not mentioned climate change outright. That followed a January letter from over 100 lawmakers concerning Trump’s National Security Strategy, which also failed to mention climate change. The security of military bases abroad and here in the U.S. are at risk as sea levels begin to rise and flooding becomes more imminent. The Union of Concerned Scientists published a report in 2016 that found bases along the East and Gulf Coast—where many military members live with their families—could see flooding 100 times a year by midcentury if sea level rises even moderately. Members of Congress are not scared to discuss their concerns around climate change and national security. Neither is the Department of Defense. As for the president? He’s got a long way to go.","Imagine a future where the United States is experiencing multiple Katrina or Sandy-like storms at the same time—all while wildfires rage in the West.

Tom McKay,"Conspiracy theorist and Infowars founder Alex Jones, that guy who thinks the government is flooding waterways with chemicals that turn frogs gay and also that mass shooting survivors are paid-off “ crisis actors,” announced on Saturday night that YouTube was planning on deleting his channel, which has nearly 2.3 million subscribers and thousands of videos. But according to YouTube, that’s yet another fiction Jones cooked up. Some context: Jones has recently been on thin ice with YouTube, and this week he was reportedly one strike away from a total ban after using the channel to spread “crisis actor” theories about the survivors of a school massacre in Parkland, Florida. Infowars’ DC bureau chief and resident Barack-Obama-is-gay expert, Jerome Corsi, found his own account purged just a few days ago —though YouTube later restored the channel and did not reply to repeated requests for comment as to why from Gizmodo, and it’s walked backed bans of at least some right-wing content lately. Lots of people have essentially been waiting for the hammer to drop on Jones’ presumably profitable main YouTube channel, which he conveniently uses to advertise his line of pricey and dubious health supplements, but it just hasn’t happened yet despite a massive exodus in advertisers. Infowars also reportedly has 11 YouTube channels in total. On Saturday, Jones tweeted the purge was finally coming and directed viewers to a new channel, “Infowars Censored.” “The Alex Jones channel with billions of views is frozen,” he wrote. “We have been told it will be deleted tomorrow and all 33 thousands videos will be erased.” According to YouTube, this just isn’t what is happening, that’s not how the process works (there’s a three strikes policy and appeals process), and they didn’t tell him that. Instead, there are no plans to summarily delete Jones’ account on Sunday at present, but the company did recently inform him about the advertisers fleeing his channel. YouTube’s rules page also notes banned users “are prohibited from accessing, possessing, or creating” further accounts, so if someone as high-profile as Jones was truly going to be kicked off the site, simply creating a new channel is not going to work. (Just look at Twitter white supremacist Tim “Baked Alaska” Gionet, who tried to evade a ban on the social network by returning with the not-so-clever handle @notbakedalaska and was promptly banned again.) One might also note that Jones is in the middle of Operation Paul Revere 2018, a pledge drive claiming Infowars needs donations to fight back against censorship. It’s possible that Jones received a third strike of some kind as he claimed, and there seems to be a lot of momentum lately towards shutting down one of his most prominent platforms—but Jones’ relationship to the truth is best described as estranged. There’s no reason to believe his narrative on whatever is happening now or whatever happens next. We’ll update this story as more information becomes available.","Conspiracy theorist and Infowars founder Alex Jones, that guy who thinks the government is flooding waterways with chemicals that turn frogs gay and also that mass shooting survivors are paid-off “crisis actors,” announced on Saturday night that YouTube was p…",2018-03-04T15:45:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Gizmodo.com'}","As Advertisers Flee, Alex Jones Claims His YouTube Ban Will Come Today",https://gizmodo.com/as-advertisers-flee-alex-jones-claims-his-youtube-ban-1823495431,"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--2eNtCu6k--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_450,q_80,w_800/ykuyepjru5w5msgqaito.png",,Gizmodo.com,flooding,1

(CNN)Satellite images show just how high the water has risen along the Platte and Missouri Rivers, including a large portion of a US Air Force Base under water.
Upstream from Scribner, Nebraska, on the Elkhorn River, a flood gauge measured its second highest crest: 17.65 feet. The flood gauge just downstream from the town stopped reporting on Wednesday when minor flooding was taking place; it could have been affected by ice floes.
The images show how the Elkhorn River temporarily made the town of Scribner an island. It appears, looking at satellite imagery, the only connection for the almost 900 residents of the town was Highway 275.
Normally, the Logan Creek Dredge, the river that flows into the Elkhorn River, is barely visible. It, too, far exceeds its usual banks.
Downstream in Waterloo, Nebraska, the Elkhorn River rose to 24.64 feet, the highest ever measured.
It beat the previous record, set in 1962, by more than 5 feet. The Platte River, to the left in the image, also was at historic levels farther upstream, in Leshara, Nebraska.
How much water was flowing in the Platte River is apparent by how far it exceeds its banks between North Bend and Fremont, Nebraska.
The 28,000 residents of Fremont were cut off during the height of the flooding. While no injuries were reported, authorities were conducting rescue missions across the city.
In Ashland, Nebraska, the Platte River also saw record levels of flooding. The river there 24.35 feet on Saturday was over a foot higher than ever recorded.
The river swelled so much there, it cut through swathes of farmland, turning the highest points into islands.
Offutt Air Force Base sits along the Missouri River just south of Omaha, Nebarska. Satellite imagery from Planet Labs Inc. shows much of the base sitting in Missouri River floodwaters.
Floodwaters made it into some 30 buildings on base and nine aircraft were evacuated because of the flooding, officials said. They included eight variations of a C135, and one E4B, an advanced airborne command post known as a ""doomsday plane.""
One of the most dramatic images shows the mouth of the Platte River where it meets the Missouri River near La Platte, Nebraska.
The Sarpy County Sheriff's Office said it's still not safe enough to allow residents of the Hanson and Chris Lakes area back into their homes. A flood gauge just downstream on the Missouri River pegged its level at 40.62 feet on Saturday, over 4 feet above the historic crest.","Satellite images show just how high the water has risen along the Platte and Missouri Rivers, including a large portion of a US Air Force Base under water.",2019-03-18T21:54:42Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Satellite images show Nebraska and Iowa rivers swallowing towns,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/18/us/nebraska-iowa-floods-before-after-satellite-images-trnd/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190318151844-oafb-missour-after-super-tease.jpg,cnn,CNN,flooding,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Los Angeles PD Image caption Burned out areas from wildfires are more susceptible to flooding and mudflow At least two people are dead amid mudslides in Southern California, where heavy rains triggered flooding and massive run-off, US media report. ""Waist-deep"" mudslides in areas scorched by wildfires last month shut down more than 30 miles (48km) of the main coastal highway, officials say. Emergency crews are working to rescue multiple people trapped in vehicles and homes, a Santa Barbara official said. At least eight people were injured and thousands have fled ahead of the rain. Heavy rain run-off caused waist-deep mudflow in the Montecito, where some homes were knocked from their foundations, Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason told the Los Angeles Times newspaper. Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kelly Huber told the newspaper two people were found dead on Tuesday in Montecito and may have been killed as result of the storm. Wildfires in December, including the Thomas Fire, swept through the area burning vegetation that helps prevent flooding and landslides. Thousands of California residents were asked to evacuate on Monday for the second time in two months. Homeowners in the area shared photos of mud in their homes. Several roads are closed due to mudslides and debris, including the major thoroughfare Highway 101. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption and leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. ""Recent burn areas will be especially vulnerable where dangerous mud and debris flows are possible,"" said the National Weather Service in a statement. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) shared a warning for California homeowners explaining that homes that had never flooded before were now at risk. About 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders on Monday. This comes after a record-setting year of $306 billion (£226 billion) of weather and climate-related disaster costs in the United States, the third warmest year on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The storm over California is expected to produce 4 inches to 7 inches (10 to 18 cm) in the foothills and 9 inches (23 cm) in select areas.

Aarian Marshall,"On Wednesday morning, Hurricane Michael barreled through the Florida panhandle. The most powerful storm to hit the region since record-keeping began in the mid-19th century ran roughshod over the states northwest coasts, damaging two local hospitals enough that they have started evacuating their patients from the areaeven after the storm has left. At least seven people are dead, 900,000 homes and businesses have lost power, and an estimated 325,000 people who fled the storm have to find their way back home. And in a terrible twist, researchers have found that Hurricane Michael hit some of the states least prepared counties.

Renne and Ramos's work found the counties in Florida with the least comprehensive hurricane evacuation plans were mostly in the state's panhandlein the area hit by Hurricane Michael. Each plan that the academics evaluated deals with different sorts of incidents or populations: Special Needs Registries and Specialized Transportation Plans should give authorities information on where and how residents with special needs should travel during an emergency. Pick-up location plans are for those without access to their own vehicles or who cant drive. Pet evacuation plans are for residents with pets (and those unwilling to evacuate without them). Multihazard plans are for events that include both hurricanes and other issues like flooding or environmental contamination risk. Evacuation maps are publicly available, easily accessible plans for evacuation routes. Renne and Ramos graded the effectiveness of each of plan on a 0 to 2 point scale, for a possible 12 points in total. A well-developed scheme scored a two. Non-existent plans got a zero. In the end, ten counties, all in northern Florida or the states panhandle, got weak scoresfewer than four points. Of those, at least one county, Gulf County, is under a mandatory evacuation order this week. Four other counties under mandatory evacuation ordersBay, Dixie, Taylor, and Wakullareceived moderate scores, meaning their plans earned between five and eight points. (The research has not yet been peer reviewed.) On the face of it, these results arent so surprising, says Renne. These are some of the least inhabited areas in Florida, accounting for just 1 percent of the states total permanent population. Plus, most counties receiving weak or moderate scores arent on the coast. If youre not a coastal county, it makes sense that you dont pay as much attention to evacuation plans, Renne says. He also notes that the state of Florida on the whole is much better at disaster planning than other coastal states, many which are less frequently threatened by hurricanes. But that relative distance from the coast will become less of a safeguard as climate change stirs up slower-moving, rain dense weather events. Storms like Michael and Florence are teaching planners to expect even inland coastal flooding. (During last months deluge in the Carolinas, inland areas saw more than 10 feet of flooding after swollen rivers pushed past their banks.) Places are flooding now that may have never flooded before, Renne says. It will take months, maybe years, for authorities to fully understand what happened during this unusually catastrophic storm. Being underprepared is, of course, about risk. Just because a county didnt have complete contingencies for dealing with their most vulnerable populations doesnt mean more of them were affected during Michael. It may be that places with weak plans got lucky this time. But while rescue teams continue to rescue, and lineman work on getting communications up and running in northern Florida, Renne urges more localities to get serious about disaster planning. And for the state and federal authorities to get better about helping them to plan. Theres no measuring stick for evacuation plans, says Renne. Its time to create oneand use it.

Mark Kaufman,"Cyclone Idai left death, destruction, and a sprawling inland sea in its wake. 
The powerful tropical cyclone which struck Mozambique last Thursday as the equivalent of a Category 2 or 3 hurricane with winds of around 100 mph has left at least 150 dead and 600,000 in need of help in the flooded nation said the EU, though the Associated Press reports over 300 fatalities as of March 21 when accounting for deaths in neighboring Zimbabwe.
The cyclone's widespread flooding in part overshadowed by simultaneous and historic flooding in the Midwest has left behind an inundated area some 200 square miles in size (518 square kilometers), with the inland sea reaching up to 15 miles wide, according to satellite images from the European Space Agency (ESA). 
The destruction is particularly severe around Mozambique's fourth largest city, Beira. 
SEE ALSO: The West accepts its drought-ridden future, slashes water use
""The situation is terrible. The scale of devastation is enormous. It seems that 90 per cent of the area is completely destroyed,"" said the Red Cross's Jamie LeSueur, who is working in the region. 
Though there's little evidence showing that the planet is experiencing more cyclones and hurricanes, there is mounting evidence that illustrates these storms are growing stronger compared to storms in the 21st century.
What's more, cyclones, like any big storm today, can now carry more water: The world has warmed by 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1 Celsius, over the last century, and for every 1 degree C of warming, the atmosphere holds seven percent more water. 
Since the 1960s, only three tropical storms of category 3 or stronger have hit Mozambique, according to Weather.com.
When the total number of fatalities are confirmed and the great inland sea dissipates, Idai's rampage may end up being the worst storm on record in the Southern Hemisphere, the EU noted.","Cyclone Idai left death, destruction, and a sprawling inland sea in its wake.

Melanie Ehrenkranz,"Los Angeles locals are blaming navigation app Waze for hellish driving through a dangerously steep street in the area. But despite complaints, Waze isn’t changing its service just to accommodate drivers who can’t handle a freakin’ hill. Baxter Street is not the city’s steepest street, but the Echo Park stretch has reportedly seen an uptick in accidents, and residents want Waze to remove it from its service altogether. The street has a 30-percent grade, which makes it steeper than San Francisco’s Lombard Street, CBS reports. “They said they couldn’t do that because it involves changing the algorithm of the app in a weird way,” Baxter resident Robbie Adams told the Los Angeles Times. Adams and other residents sent a letter to Waze asking it to either remove the street as a suggested route or list it as hazardous when it’s raining. Waze spokeswoman Julie Mossler told Gizmodo in a statement that the service is “the best place to check for conditions you may consider hazardous,” and that the company allows users to inform each other of dangerous conditions, such as flooding or steepness. “We service several streets in San Francisco with a similar gradient to Baxter Street without complaint,” Mossler added. “Not only that, we’re expected to by local drivers. For this reason and others, it’s not possible for us to anticipate drivers’ reaction to a specific road and make a rule based on gradient, especially on public roads.” Mossler also stated that Waze maps accurately indicate conditions of the road, both in respect to the laws governing the area or through temporary issues, listing potholes and flooding as examples. “While Angelenos have questioned the gradient of the hill on Baxter Street, the city has placed a public road there, which means it should be considered usable within Waze to permit residents to navigate home, to assist in emergency response, and more,” she said. “Should local government choose to make a change, we will of course update our maps.” Waze’s statement doesn’t attribute its unwillingness to remove the steep street from its service to tricky algorithms. Rather, the company seemingly believes that, in comparison to similarly sloping streets, Baxter isn’t the worst one it sends users on. And San Franciscans don’t seem to be complaining.","Los Angeles locals are blaming navigation app Waze for hellish driving through a dangerously steep street in the area.

Andrew Freedman,"A major nor'easter is taking aim at the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, bringing an array of life-threatening hazards, from hurricane-force winds to record-breaking coastal flooding. Based on current forecasts, it's clear that this storm is likely to be more damaging than the so-called ""Bomb Cyclone"" that struck in early January. Technically, the storm, like many winter storms in the Northern Hemisphere, will rapidly intensify once it gets going on Thursday night and Friday morning. During the course of 24 hours, its minimum central air pressure — a key measure of the storm's intensity — is expected to plummet by more than 24 millibars. This would be sufficient to qualify the storm as undergoing a process known as bombogenesis (which, incidentally would also make a great heavy metal band name). SEE ALSO: Intense nor'easter may demolish coastal flood records, knock out power to millions By that standard, one could also call this storm a ""bomb,"" or even a ""bomb cyclone."" Some media outlets, like CNN, Mother Jones, and AccuWeather, are doing just that in their headlines, thereby reprising the name used for the fastest-intensifying winter storm ever observed off the East Coast. But there are major problems with this using this nomenclature in headlines about this storm. Computer model projection of sea level pressure and low-level wind speeds on March 2, 2018. Image: tropicaltidbits.com When facing a major storm threat, it's important that the public focuses on the hazards they are likely to face. This storm is going to have a broader, more damaging footprint across a larger amount of real estate than the ""Bomb Cyclone"" did in January. Power outages from this storm, for example, are likely to spread from the Washington, D.C., area, northward to upstate New York, and eastward to Boston. In addition, many of the other impacts from this storm will exceed those of the January 4 storm, particularly when it comes to coastal flooding. The National Weather Service forecast office in Boston is using dire language to warn people of the flood threat, noting that this is a ""LIFE-THREATENING SITUATION"" along the coast, where record flooding is likely from a combination of high astronomical tides, a 3-to-5-foot storm surge, and towering waves up to 35 feet high just offshore. The National Weather Service expects seas that may exceed 15.3 feet at the Boston Harbor tidal gauge, which would be an all-time record, beating the one set during the Jan. 4 ""Bomb Cyclone"" by about 2 inches. This is a rather incredible depiction. Bombs the low to ~972mb nestling it just south of the cape with a series of wind maxima/meso lows landfalling into Boston/Cape Cod. I hope folks have done what they can to prepare. pic.twitter.com/i35EQ0cHPU — Taylor Trogdon (@TTrogdon) March 1, 2018 Mashable was one of the first media outlets (along with the Washington Post 's Capital Weather Gang) to call the exceptional nor'easter in early January the ""Bomb Cyclone."" The storm dumped heavy snow across Southern New England, and set a record for the highest-recorded water level in Boston. The setup for this storm looks far worse, in part because it is going to be traveling slowly, exposing the Massachusetts coastline to major coastal flooding during at least three tide cycles, whereas the ""Bomb Cyclone"" was moving quickly when it struck. Another aspect of this storm that is different, and potentially far more destructive, is the type of snow it will produce. The ""Bomb Cyclone"" had plenty of Arctic air to work with, making the snow that fell on New England light and fluffy. This storm, however, will dump pasty, wet cement-like snow on upstate New York, and the higher elevations of Connecticut and Massachusetts. The weight of such snow on tree limbs and power lines tends to cause significant power outages. This event will be different from the January 4 storm in two big ways: more wave energy coming from offshore and THREE tide cycles instead of one and done. Both equate to increased damage potential. — Matt Noyes NBC10 Boston &amp; NECN (@MattNBCBoston) March 1, 2018 The bottom line is that if the media were to call this upcoming storm another ""Bomb Cyclone,"" as other outlets are starting to do, we would run the risk of confusing readers into thinking that the impacts of the storm and its characteristics will be the same. In many ways — from coastal flooding to the storm's wind and wave field, as well as the power outage footprint — this upcoming storm will be worse. Using the Internet-friendly ""Bomb Cyclone"" moniker here would be to the detriment of public understanding of this weather phenomenon. Yes, this storm will undergo bombogenesis. Yes, you could call it a ""bomb."" But it will likely end up being remembered for being even more damaging than the January storm.","A major nor'easter is taking aim at the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, bringing an array of life-threatening hazards, from hurricane-force winds to record-breaking coastal flooding.

Nicole Gallucci,"Venice is currently experiencing the worst flooding it's seen in a decade, but one restaurant refuses to let the knee-high water impact business. As the city begins to recover from the intense storms that recently hit Italy, killing several people, the restaurant in Venice has its doors open and is serving anyone daring enough to venture out into the flood. A video, shared to Simone Sciascia 's Facebook page on Monday, shows staff carrying pizzas to serve customers like it's just another day at work. Servers are seen wading through the flooded restaurant where diners are sitting at tables enjoying their food. And nearly everyone is wearing tall protective rain boots of some sort. Now that's dedication. The end of the video offers a look at the streets of Venice, which still remain significantly flooded. Nearly 80 percent of the city was flooded after water levels rose an estimated 160 centimeters (5 feet, 3 inches) above sea level during the storms. And along with streets and local businesses, noteworthy areas and historical landmarks like St. Mark's Square, the Rialto bridge, the Piazza San Marco, and more, have been impacted by the floods. Though flooding is common throughout Italy especially as winter nears and winds carry water from the Adriatic Sea into the Venetian Lagoon this level of water is the worst Venice has experienced since 1979. SEE ALSO: Dramatic photos show the worst flood to hit Venice in 10 years As noted in an earlier article, Italy now experiences major flooding every four years or so, which means people have started taking necessary precautions to deal with the water ahead of time.

As Venice's 5-foot tide continues to drop throughout the course of the week, we're sure more and more restaurants will start re-opening their doors.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Tropical Storm Michael is bringing damaging winds and life-threatening flash flooding over portions of North Carolina and Virginia before heading off into the Atlantic Ocean, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Thursday. The center of Michael will bring gale- to storm-force winds over portions of southeastern Virginia, extreme northeastern North Carolina, and the Delmarva Peninsula late on Thursday night and on Friday morning when it becomes post-tropical off the Mid-Atlantic coast, the Miami-based weather forecaster said. Michael, the third most powerful hurricane ever to hit the U.S. mainland, smashed into Florida’s northwest coast near the small town of Mexico Beach on Wednesday as a Category 4 hurricane with 155-mile-per-hour (250-kilometer-per-hour) winds. It left at least 7 dead and tore apart coastal towns. By 8 p.m. (0000 GMT) on Thursday, the storm was located about 5 miles (10 km) northwest of Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, with maximum sustained winds of 50 miles-per-hour (85 kph). Reporting by K.

Gina Cherelus,"(Reuters) - Florida’s governor mobilized National Guard troops and thousands of Gulf Coast residents were ordered evacuated on Monday, two days before Hurricane Michael was forecast to slam ashore with life-threatening waves, winds and rains. Michael was packing sustained winds of up to 85 miles per hour (140 kph) and gaining strength as it skirted past Cuba’s western tip en route to a likely Wednesday landfall as the most powerful storm to strike the Florida Panhandle in at least a decade. Currently ranked as a Category 1 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson wind scale, Michael could grow into a Category 3, becoming the second major hurricane in the Atlantic basin this year following Florence last month, forecasters said. The storm is expected to unleash coastal storm surges of up to 12 feet (3.7 meters) along Florida’s Panhandle and dump as much as a foot (30 cm) of rain across Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported. The NHC warned that both could trigger deadly flooding, and that residents within the hurricane warning zone should likewise “prepare for life-threatening winds.” Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in 35 counties along Florida’s Panhandle and Big Bend regions. Mandatory evacuations were under way in coastal areas, with 1,250 National Guard soldiers aiding the process and more than 4,000 troops placed on standby, Scott tweeted. “The FL panhandle needs to be prepared for a direct hit with sustained hurricane force winds,” Scott wrote on Twitter on Monday. In Gulf County alone, the first to begin ordering residents of low-lying areas to higher ground, mandatory evacuation notices encompassed an estimated 3,800 homes, said Jessica Sasich of the county’s emergency operations center. Many are located in the coastal town of Port St. Joe, the county’s largest municipality, lying directly in the hurricane’s projected path, she said. In neighboring Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey declared an emergency for the entire state on Monday in anticipation of wind damage, heavy rains and power outages. MICHAEL KILLS 13 IN CENTRAL AMERICA As the storm moved north it battered Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba with drenching rains and winds of up to 80 mph (130 kph), the Miami-based hurricane center said. Torrential downpours and flash-flooding over the weekend caused 13 deaths in Central America after Michael formed off the coast of northern Honduras. In Florida, state offices, schools and universities were set to close on Tuesday through the end of the week in panhandle counties. Some beach town residents were left to decide on their own for the time being whether to leave their homes. “I haven’t made up my mind yet, but I know some of my staff are going,” said Dave Trepanier, owner of Firefly, a restaurant a block from the beach in Panama City, Bay County, an area where the hurricane is expected to come ashore. Lines at gasoline stations were growing long in Panama City as people prepared to leave areas under mandatory evacuation, Trepanier said. Hurricane Michael would be the first major hurricane to hit the panhandle since Hurricane Dennis in 2005, which made landfall near Pensacola, according to hurricane center data. After striking Florida, Michael is forecast to move up the East Coast on Wednesday and Thursday plowing through the Carolinas, still recovering from Hurricane Florence last month. Energy companies halted nearly a fifth of Gulf of Mexico oil production and evacuated personnel from 10 platforms on Monday. The Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of daily U.S. crude oil output and 5 percent of daily natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Karen Dillon,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (Reuters) - Record flooding along the Missouri River that left death and destruction in three Midwestern states appeared to have crested on Sunday in the Kansas City area without causing major damage and continued to move downstream, local officials said. 
Although the surge had begun to recede in Kansas City, Missouri’s largest city, a number of riverfront roads remained flooded and city residents were urged to conserve water to help utility crews cope with the deluge. 
Officials of two small, Missouri waterfront communities just outside Kansas City, Riverside and Parkville, which had been bracing for flooding, said early on Sunday that the worst appeared to be over. 
“The good news is the river has crested and is now dropping,” the Riverside Fire Department said on Twitter. 
Parkville, where high water was creeping to the edge of the scenic commercial district known for its antique shops, art galleries and restaurants, also said on Sunday that the river waters were starting to back away. 
“All businesses open,” the city declared on Twitter. 
But the flooding still threatened Kansas City’s drinking water. The KC Water utility issued a plea for conservation to its 170,000 customers “to help with ongoing treatment challenges created by current characteristics of the Missouri River.” 
The municipal water service issued an advisory on Saturday warning that the flooding had impaired its treatment of water, which it gets from the river, raising health risks for infants, the elderly and others with compromised immune systems. 
Conserving water will ease pressure on an upriver wastewater treatment plant where crews were struggling to replace broken pumps submerged by floodwater, the utility said. 
Although testing had shown excessive levels of turbidity, fine particles in the water that can carry bacteria, viruses and parasites, KC Water said late on Saturday that it “had not found any harmful bacterial organisms” in the water, which it said was safe for cooking and bathing. 
Floods were unleashed last week after a “bomb cyclone” storm dumped torrential rains on hundreds of square miles of the snow-covered Plains. 
No further precipitation is forecast for the area until midweek, when moderate rainfall is expected, National Weather Service Meteorologist Andrew Orrison said. 
“I think at the worst what it will do is just prolong the gradual receding of the water levels across the various river basins throughout the Midwest,” Orrison said by phone from the service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. 
By next month, however, melting snows further upstream in Minnesota and the Dakotas could trigger more flooding, he said. 
The record flows had cascaded down the Missouri, the country’s longest river, killing at least four people, drowning livestock and closing dozens of roads in Nebraska and Iowa. Property losses were estimated at more than $3 billion in those two states.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","When Marina Zurkow, an environmental artist and professor at New York University, embarked on designing a set of climate change-themed emojis, every little detail was intentional. She didn’t hold back one bit. Released in October, the current Climoji sticker set, available for Apple and Android users, paints a pretty grim picture of what climate change looks like. The set includes emojis of dying, starved animals, pollution, extreme weather, and even drowning people—not exactly a hopeful outlook, but that was kind of the point, said Zurkow. “We felt like one of the big problems is people don’t call climate change what it is,” Zurkow told Earther. “People don’t connect to the outcomes of a lot of anthropogenic destruction that we all participate in a really everyday way. ” Some of these outcomes aren’t far off. Climate change is already threatening more than 700 species of mammals and birds, so the dead penguins and starving polar bears emojis make sense. The world also got a taste last year of what flooding will look like under climate change: in Houston, in Florida, in Puerto Rico, and across South Asia. People are dying due to floods today, and climate change will threaten tens of millions more in the next few decades as river flooding risk and sea level rise worsens. The woke, racially observant eye (like mine) will notice a subtle—but key!—difference among Climoji’s cartoon characters. Four people are included, all of whom are dealing with some sort of flooding scenario. One, however, is sitting on a lifeboat, visibly startled but safe. The other three are either drowning or about to. Guess which one is white? You got it: The lady on the boat, who is most likely to survive. “Sometimes solutions can put us back to sleep.” Zurkow was grateful when I brought this up. No one else had asked her about it yet, and it was no coincidence. “Skin tones were not subconscious,” she said. “It’s not an accident that people who are saved in boats are not brown.” These emojis, a form of climate art, mirror the realities of today. The majority of people who die due to natural disasters live in predominantly non-white, low-income countries, according to a United Nations report from 2015 that looked at 20 years worth of data. Storms were the most deadly killers, claiming 242,000 lives between 1995 and 2015. South Asia accounted for 80 percent of those deaths. The set’s frank (and grim) pictures may seem depressing, but they serve a purpose of helping people “practice being awake to the problems around us.” As Zurkow put it, “sometimes solutions can put us back to sleep.” She and the rest of the team who helped put Climoji together aren’t necessarily trying to solve climate change through these emojis. They’re trying to start a conversation. They want the words “climate change” to become more a part of our everyday language. They do hope to launch a second emoji set once they secure funding—cartoons with a more hopeful tone. That set would include things like solar panels, windmills, reusable bags, electric cars, and recycling bins. Zurkow doesn’t want users—of which there are currently only about 350—to confuse these for solutions, though. “I don’t believe that any of these are solutions,” she told Earther. “They’re responses to produce a more resilient society.” A societal change, a shift in consciousness, is what’s needed to actually solve climate change. But emojis can’t do all that. Can they? Who knows. They certainly don’t hurt, though, especially as people struggle to understand the role they play in climate change. Only 52 percent of Americans believe humans are driving this global crisis.

azfamily.com News Staff,"PHOENIX (3TV/CBS 5)-- Rain and flooding hit the Phoenix area Saturday as the city is experiencing record rainfall. Sky Harbor has so far picked up 1.32 inches of rain so far. We've hit our wettest October on record in Phoenix, per the National Weather Service. A Flash Flood Watch is in effect until 8 p.m. Saturday for Metro Phoenix, Western Arizona and portions of the high country through Central Arizona. Many Valley communities picked up 1/3 to 2/3 of an inch. Some areas have received more than an inch of rain. Sky Harbor has so far picked up about four-tenths. We've hit our second wettest October on record in Phoenix, per NWS Phoenix. Rain and clouds will likely persist through this afternoon, but should ease up this evening. Driving conditions returned to normal after Interstate 10 flooded in both directions near 43rd Avenue, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation. [RELATED: I-10 flooded as rain continues in Phoenix ] Flooding also caused closures in several Phoenix roadways including 16th to 18th avenues and Culver and Willetta streets. The rain and flooding caused roadways to be shut down in some areas. The City of Apache Junction posted these following streets closed due to flooding: 16th Avenue, west of Ironwood Drive Delaware Drive, just south of Superstition Boulevard Delaware Drive at Tepee Street Lost Dutchman Boulevard, east of Ironwood Road Lost Dutchman Boulevard at San Marcos Drive San Marcos Drive, just south of 12th Avenue A low pressure system tracking into Arizona from the west Saturday will also tap into moisture from former hurricane Sergio. Sergio will stay well south of the state, but these dynamics together will produce isolated to scattered showers and storms throughout the day Saturday. Some storms will be capable of producing heavy downpours that may lead to flooding in localized areas. [RADAR: Click here to see if rain is heading to your area ] Rain will taper off from west to east Saturday evening. Another trough will drag a cold front through northern Arizona Sunday through Monday morning. This will produce more showers for the high country and keep a slight chance of showers for the Valley. Snow levels may even drop to about 6000 feet by Monday morning, but significant snow is not expected. An area of low pressure associated with the trough will become cut off and meander across Arizona Tuesday, keeping rain chances in the forecast for the Valley through that period. Rainfall totals for Metro Phoenix may range between a quarter of an inch to some isolated areas with up to an inch through Sunday. In Phoenix, look for a high of 72 Saturday with thunderstorms, a low of 62 Saturday night with storms tapering off, a 20 percent chance of storms with partly cloudy skies and a high of 75 Sunday.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Hurricane Michael may reach category three strength before it arrives in Florida Hurricane Michael has strengthened to a category two storm, with winds reaching in excess of 100mph (155km/h) as it barrels towards the Florida coast. The storm is expected to reach category three strength before it makes landfall on Wednesday. Forecasters say some regions may see 12in (30cm) of rain, and storm surges of up to 12ft (3.6m). Governor Rick Scott warned residents to get out of the way, saying on Tuesday: ""This is a monstrous storm"". Is it expected to crawl up the US East Coast after making landfall in the Gulf Coast, and could bring rains to the Carolinas, which were drenched by Hurricane Florence last month. The US National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, warned on Tuesday that warm waters will probably further strengthen Michael before it makes landfall. Over 300 miles of coastline are currently under threat, the National Weather Service has cautioned. The agency warned residents in Florida and Alabama of the risk of storm surges, damaging winds and flash flooding. Gov Scott warned in a news conference that Hurricane Michael is a ""massive storm that could bring total devastation to parts of our state, especially in the panhandle"". He added that its predicted to be ""the most destructive storm to hit the Florida panhandle in decades"". Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""

DANIEL VICTOR,"Hawaii is bracing for possible landfall from Hurricane Lane, a Category 4 storm that forecasters are warning could bring whipping winds, flooding and high surf. Tropical storm-force winds could arrive on the Big Island by Wednesday afternoon local time, with hurricane-force winds to follow soon afterward, said Gavin Shigesato, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The storm would then continue north toward Maui and Oahu around Thursday morning, he said. As of 5 p.m. Tuesday in Hawaii, the storm, packing 155 mile-per-hour winds, was moving west-northwest toward Hawaii at about 9 m.p.h., he said. Hurricane-force winds were extending about 40 miles from the center. “It’s still a very strong storm,” Mr. Shigesato said. Mountainous areas could be particularly prone to flooding, and the southern shores could experience damaging surf levels, with more than 20 inches of rain possible. There is danger of tornadoes and large waterspouts, and the National Weather Service warned residents to prepare for considerable property damage, saying some locations “may be uninhabitable for weeks.”","Brianna Sugimura loading supplies into her car in Lihue, on the island of Kauai, Hawaii, in preparation for Hurricane Lane, which may hit the archipelago later this week.",2018-08-22T04:06:06Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Hurricane Lane, a Category 4 Storm, Closes In on Hawaii",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/us/hurricane-lane-hawaii.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/us/22hawaii_xp/22hawaii_xp-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,flooding,1
"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Authorities are warning coastal residents in the path of Hurricane Florence to evacuate now or be at the mercy of the Category 3 storm, which is expected to slow upon hitting the coast of the Carolinas on Thursday and ravage the region with storm surge, rainfall, and flooding. According to CNN, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told reporters that emergency personnel will not be able to intervene during the storm due to the high risk it poses. Florence is currently expected to begin delivering tropical storm-force winds in the region by early Thursday, escalating to hurricane-force winds by late Thursday or early Friday. CNN wrote: “You put your life at risk by staying,” North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said. “Don’t plan to leave once the winds and rains start.” Cooper and his South Carolina counterpart, Henry McMaster, told the more than 1 million people who have been told to leave that if they don’t, they are on their own. McMaster told residents in some counties that emergency responders will be pulled from areas expected to be hit hard. “Even the rescuers cannot stay there,” he said. Accuweather reported that its meteorologists “believe that the hurricane will stall and meander near the Carolina coast from Thursday night to Saturday.” That means locals and their property could be punished with severe hurricane conditions for days, not hours. “Total innundation” is expected in eastern and southeastern North Carolina, as well as northern Southern California, and the storm surge could reach in “excess of 10 feet in some areas,” Accuweather added. Isolated tornadoes could also occur along North Carolina’s coast on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service in Wilmington. Only seven major hurricanes have hit on the coast between Savannah, Georgia and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina since 1879, CNN reported, and the last was Hurricane Hugo in 1989. In that time the population has dramatically increased. The Washington Post warned that the heavy rainfall expected is likely to be “catastrophic,” and noted the National Weather Service said Florence will likely be bad even by the standards of prior big storms: “This will likely be the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast,” the National Weather Service in Wilmington, N.C., wrote Tuesday, “and that’s saying a lot given the impacts we’ve seen from hurricanes Diana, Hugo, Fran, Bonnie, Floyd, and Matthew.” As Earther has noted before, the path Florence has taken is incredibly unusual, with none of the 57 named storms that had passed within 200 miles of its position last week coming close to striking the U.S. coast. The expected stalling is equally unusual, according to USA Today : Instead of roaring ashore and quickly heading inland and weakening, as most storms do, Hurricane Florence should instead “stall near the coast and then parallel southwestward toward Georgia,” Weather Channel meteorologist Greg Postel said. “I’ve never seen anything like this.” AccuWeather meteorologist Marshall Moss said Florence’s track is unique. “It was located farther north in the Atlantic than any other storm to ever hit the Carolinas, so what we’re forecasting is unprecedented,” Moss said. In other words, those living in coastal regions subject to evacuation orders in Florence’s path have had their final warning: Please, for your own good, get out of there before it’s too late. That means now.

"RICHARD FAUSSET, CAMPBELL ROBERTSON and DAVID ZUCCHINO","Around lunchtime, Steven Swank, 23, was packing a few cases of water into a little sedan. In 1999, the Grid was inundated by river flooding after Hurricane Floyd, and Mr. Swank wanted none of it. He and his girlfriend were going to his sister’s house for a while. “She lives over behind the Cracker Barrel, not near any water,” he said. “We don’t want to be stuck here.” Worries were running equally high in inland South Carolina. Fifteen miles northwest of the gaudy spectacle of Myrtle Beach sits the quiet county seat of Conway, a nearly 290-year-old town shaded by live oaks and straddling the Waccamaw River. Time and again — in Hurricanes Floyd and Matthew, to name just two occasions — Myrtle Beach has been spared the worst damage, while Conway has taken a heavy hit: flash floods with the storm itself, then river floods in the days that followed. “The water collects really quickly, and people think that’s the flooding, but it’s flash flooding,” said Le Hendricks, the Conway fire chief. “That goes down pretty quick, and then they think they’re free. B ut then what happens is, the Waccamaw River gets backed up.” Chief Hendricks described a kind of hydrological traffic jam: Water trying to leave the Waccamaw meets flooded waterways and a surging ocean at capacity. The river has nowhere to go but over its banks, onto highways and roads and into people’s homes. This kind of flooding might not happen at its worst until two days after the hurricane hits, but when it does, the water can sit for weeks. Meanwhile, places on the coast might have already begun rebuilding from any damage wrought by the winds and the initial surge. “Myrtle Beach, they did fairly will during Matthew,” Chief Hendricks said. “They had damage but were back up and running within a couple of days.” Conway, at first, thought it had dodged a bullet, as well, he said. “But it was the flooding. And it took about 18 days for us to get back out of that.”","The storm surge in the Carolinas could be deadly.

Greta Jochem,"This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. You probably didn’t give much thought to how exactly you loaded this webpage. Maybe you clicked a link from Twitter or Facebook and presto, this article popped up on your screen. The internet seems magical and intangible sometimes. But the reality is, you rely on physical, concrete objects—like giant data centers and miles of underground cables—to stay connected. All that infrastructure is at risk of being submerged. In just 15 years, roughly 4,000 miles of fiber-optic cables in US coastal cities could go underwater, potentially causing internet outages. That’s the big finding from a new, peer-reviewed study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Oregon. To figure out how rising seas could affect the internet’s physical structures, researchers compared a map of internet infrastructure to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s predictions for sea-level rise near US coasts. In New York City, about 20 percent of fibers distributed throughout the city are predicted to flood within 15 years—along with 32 percent of the fibers that connect the metropolis to other cities and 43 data centers. The research suggests that Seattle and Miami are especially vulnerable, along with many coastal areas. A map of New York City shows a network of cables (green lines) and areas estimated to be underwater in 15 years (blue shaded areas) due to sea-level rise. “All of this equipment is meant to be weather-resistant—but it’s not waterproof,” says Paul Barford, UW-Madison professor of computer science and a coauthor of the paper. Much of the system was put into place in the ’90s without much consideration of climate change, he says. On top of that, much of the internet’s physical infrastructure is aging. Paul Barford says a lot of it was designed to last only a few decades and is now nearing the end of its lifespan. That is, if the floods don’t get to it first. While 15 years may seem shockingly soon, we’re already seeing more high tide flooding, points out Carol Barford (married to the aforementioned Paul), a coauthor on the paper and director of UW-Madison’s Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment. We’re seeing outages related to extreme weather, too: Hurricane Irma, for example, left over a million people without internet access. It’s hard to predict exactly what would happen inland when coastal infrastructure floods—but the internet is an interconnected system, so damage in one place could affect others. For those inland, it’s possible that coastal flooding could cause a total internet connection outage, or issues in connecting to particular web pages and services. Still, there’s a lot of research to be done. “We need to better understand the scope of the problem to create good solutions,” says Ramakrishnan Durairajan, a University of Oregon assistant professor of computer and information sciences and the paper’s lead author. Further studies could examine the effects of increased extreme weather on the system, he says, as well as ways to better engineer web traffic in the face of floods or other climate-induced disasters. The takeaway, Carol Barford says: “If we want to be able to function like we expect every day, we’re going to have to spend money and make allowances and plans to accommodate what’s coming.”","In just 15 years, roughly 4,000 miles of fiber-optic cables in US coastal cities could go underwater.",2018-07-18T12:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Rising Seas Could Cause Your Next Internet Outage,https://www.wired.com/story/rising-seas-could-cause-your-next-internet-outage/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b4e9b1d0ea5ef37fa24f88f/191:100/pass/flood-490535694.jpg,wired,Wired,flooding,1

"MITCH SMITH, JOHN SCHWARTZ and TIM GRUBER","Many of the levees, usually earthen and topped with grass, were built by farmers decades ago and are now managed by a patchwork of local government agencies known as levee districts that often do not coordinate or even follow the same rules. With increased flooding in the past few years, the levees are being tested more frequently than ever before, straining the finances and expertise of some of those districts. The levee situation has become so grave that the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the countrys levee system a D grade in 2017, suggesting $80 billion in investment over 10 years.
When the next one comes along bigger, they either fail or are overtopped again, said Nicholas Pinter, an expert on rivers and flooding at the University of California, Davis.
According to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees infrastructure on the Missouri River and some of its tributaries, at least 62 levees had been breached or overtopped in the Midwest in March, and hundreds of miles of levees had sustained damage.
When they run water over the top of them, theres not anything you can do, said Pat Sheldon, the president of a rural levee district in southwest Iowa that was still paying off repairs from the 2011 flood. This time, Mr. Sheldon said, the damage to the levees was much worse, perhaps in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Its terrible, said Mr. Sheldon, whose farm was also cut off by the water.
In Missouri, Mr. Bullock pointed out a levee that last week had been split open and consumed by the river. A large log swirled in the water near where the earthen berm should have been. I dont know what were going to do this time, he said.
The Army Corps of Engineers, which helps determine water levels by operating a series of dams on the Missouri River, tries to balance the needs of many who use the rivers it manages, including farmers, barge shippers, endangered animal species and people who use the water for recreation. Those interests are sometimes at odds, and have been the subject of decades of litigation. Corps officials say they are not allowed to change the congressionally authorized purposes of the reservoirs, though they had been most focused on limiting floods for the past year.
The Corpss No. 1 priority in its operations is life safety, said Maj. Gen. Scott A. Spellmon, the Corpss deputy commanding general for civil and emergency operations, in a statement. Our current focus is to protect life, mitigate risks to flooding events and repair damages due to the recent events in the basin.","Hundreds of miles of levees in the Midwest have been overwhelmed by the floods, leaving “Swiss cheese” infrastructure and reigniting a flood control debate.",2019-03-31T09:00:10Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","‘Breaches Everywhere’: Midwest Levees Burst, and Tough Questions Follow",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/us/midwest-floods-levees.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/29/us/00levees-01/00levees-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,flooding,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Athens just put in a pretty strong bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics. A huge dip in the jet stream has allowed polar air to plunge into the normally temperate Mediterranean, dumping snow in Greeces capital and beach resort towns. 
On Tuesday, otherworldly scenes emerged across the country as snow caked iconic tourist attractions like the Acropolis and bent olive and cypress trees branches. Tourists and locals alike stopped to gawk at the ethereal sites and snap photos. 
Athens was far from the only locale to see snow. That coastal resort town of Thessaloniki in northeast Greece was buffeted by snow. Drone footage shows the incongruous scenes of snow on the Mediterranean beaches that are normally a tourist hot spot (at least a few locals still decided to take a polar bear plunge). 
The snow was more than a photo op, though. It also stranded motorists and led to disrupted rail service. At least one inbound flight was re-routed from Thessaloniki due to poor visibility, according to France24.
And the flakes also came with a blast of polar air, which France24 reports has claimed at least three lives. Reuters reports that the northern Greek city of Florina recorded an all-time low of minus-9 degrees Fahrenheit (minus-23 degrees Celsius). Meanwhile much of the country has seen temperatures dip 20 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) below normal for this time of year.
The pattern befalling Greece has brought wild weather to the rest of Europe as well. Ski resorts in the Alps have seen up to 100 inches of snow fall, creating deadly avalanche conditions. Winter storms have also battered northern Europe with winds and coastal flooding, including some of the worst flooding in decades in Denmark. But its the Greek snow thats been a real show stopper.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","After plowing into the North Carolina coast late last week, Florence lingered over Carolinas all weekend like an unwanted house guest. Though its winds had slackened to a tropical depression by Sunday, the record-setting rains it unleashed have created a flooding catastrophe that is still unfolding. The scale of that catastrophe is now becoming apparent in aerial photographs. The storm has set tropical rainfall records for both South and North Carolina. Multiple locations in North Carolina saw more than 30 inches of rain, making this the wettest tropical system to ever hit the East Coast. The relentless rain also helped Wilmington, North Carolina break its annual rainfall record with three months left to go in the year. As Florence stormed ashore, it backed up rivers with its powerful surge. It also dumped copious rain inland, leaving water with nowhere to go but over the banks of rivers and streams. More than two dozen rivers in the Carolinas are currently in a major stage of flooding, and they could take all week to recede. One of the big concerns with Florence was the storm’s potential to wreak havoc on industrial farms and coal ash sites. At least one coal ash site has started leaking, and more could be in danger as water continues to worm its way into the earthen dams that hold it back. All this is to say Florence was everything forecasters expected and more. And with climate change increasing the odds of extreme precipitation and raising sea levels, we’ll almost certainly see more storms that can cause this kind of destruction.

Eric Niiler,"The record-setting floods deluging the Midwest are about to get a lot worse. Fueled by rapidly melting snowpack and a forecast of more rainstorms in the next few weeks, federal officials warn that 200 million people in 25 states face a risk through May. Floodwaters coursing through Nebraska have already forced tens of thousands of people to flee and have caused $1.3 billion in damage.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its spring flood outlook Thursday, predicting that two-thirds of the country is at risk of ""major to moderate flooding,"" from Fargo, North Dakota on the Red River of the North down to Nashville, Tennessee, on the Cumberland River. The floods from the past two weeks have compromised 200 miles of levees in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers.
The rains and floods are expected to continue through May and become more dire, according to Ed Clark, director of NOAAs National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. This is shaping up to be a potentially unprecedented flood season, Clark said, with more than 200 million people at risk for flooding in their communities.
A combination of heavy snowfall in late February, tropical rains and wet snow from the bomb cyclone that swept across the country a week ago and frozen or saturated ground surfaces have set the stage for the floods. Ice jams on top of frozen waterways are adding to the problem by diverting floodwaters out of river channels and sending them onto land. Its not looking like we are going to see any dry stretches anytime soon, says Thomas Graziano, director of the water prediction center at the National Weather Service.
Officials say the entire Mississippi River basin has received 3 times as much rainfall as in a normal year.
And it's not done falling yet. More rainstorms are expected to hit the Midwest over the next eight to 10 days. That precipitation will be like water running over concrete, Graziano says. Graziano says he expects this years flood levels to top the disastrous floods that hit the Missouri River in May 2011 and the Red River in North Dakota and Minnesota in 2009.
This winters big snowpack is fueling the floods. In the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota, more than 20 inches of snow remains on the ground. The Missouri, Ohio and Mississippi Rivers drain the central United States, but it takes several weeks for the water to travel downstream. In the meantime, emergency officials are warning local residents to make an evacuation plan as well as purchase flood insurance in certain areas.
Climate scientists say it's too early to tell exactly to what degree human-induced climate change has affected this spring flood cycle, but they note that the watery disaster is following a pattern of extreme weather events across the United States. There's about 10 percent more moisture available in the environment as a result of global climate change, says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.
Under the right conditions, that extra moisture can be amplified into 30 percent more rainfall during an extreme weather event such as a hurricane, bomb cyclone or the series of storms that has hit the Midwest, Trenberth explains.
""The extra fuel from global warming is what keeps [a storm] going,"" he says. ""And it's what turns it from a billion-dollar disaster to a $10 to $50 billion disaster.""

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright NASA/NOAA The past year has been a busy one for hurricanes. There were 17 named storms in 2017, 10 hurricanes and six major hurricanes (category 3 or higher) - an above average year in each respect. The 10 hurricanes formed consecutively, without weaker tropical storms interrupting the sequence. The only other time this has been recorded was in 1893. Are these storms getting worse? And does climate change have anything to do with it? A year of records This Atlantic hurricane season has been particularly bad. There was Harvey, which pummelled the United States in August. It brought the largest amount of rain on record from any tropical system - 1,539mm. It caused the sort of flooding you'd expect to see once every 500 years, causing $200bn of damage to Houston, Texas. Ironically, this was the third such ""one every 500 years"" flood Houston had suffered in three years. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Usually hurricanes might last a day or two, but the torrential rain from Harvey lasted a week. September brought Irma, which devastated Caribbean communities. It was the joint second strongest Atlantic hurricane ever, with sustained winds of 185mph. Those winds were sustained for 37 hours - longer than any tropical system on record, anywhere in the world. Next came Hurricane Maria - another category 5 hurricane, with sustained winds of 175mph - which destroyed Puerto Rico's power grid. Finally, Hurricane Ophelia span past Portugal and Spain - the farthest east any major Atlantic hurricane has ever gone. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ophelia carried Saharan dust as far north as London, darkening the sky in the middle of the day Despite this, 2017 wasn't the worst year in some key respects. It didn't produce the strongest storm - that was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with sustained winds of 190mph. Nor did it have the greatest number of storms - that was 2005, which saw an incredible 28 named storms, including seven major hurricanes. One of them was the infamous Hurricane Katrina. But 2017 was probably the costliest. Estimates for the cost of the hurricane season vary and continue to be revised, ranging up to $385bn. By comparison, 2005 racked up $144bn in damage according to the National Hurricane Center - about $180bn today, adjusted for inflation. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey's persistent rain caused catastrophic flooding in parts of Texas It has certainly been a bad year. But over time, are hurricanes getting worse? There have been 33 of the strongest category 5 hurricanes since 1924. Eleven of these have occurred in the past 14 years. We know that hurricanes are powered by warm seas and over the past 100 years global average sea temperatures have risen by about 1C. But when you look at the total strength of storms in each year since records began, some years are more fearsome than others. Meteorologists use something called accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) to calculate the total wind power of all the storms in any given year. As you can see from the following chart, there's no clear upward trend. Why not? Even though seas are getting warmer, other factors can prevent hurricanes forming in particular years. Saharan dust can interfere with hurricane formation as can the close proximity of African storms to the equator. But one of the great weather ironies is that hurricanes hate strong winds. Strong winds in the Atlantic interfere with the circulation of air through a developing storm. This stops the storm growing into a hurricane. During a phenomenon called El Niño, the Pacific Ocean near the equator gets warmer than usual. This affects global wind patterns, leading to stronger winds in the Atlantic. That means El Niño years tend to be quiet years for hurricanes. But when the Pacific is cooler (known as La Niña), the reverse is true - making it easier for hurricanes to form. And 2017 is a La Niña year. In fact, the total storm strength in La Niña years has been rising decade by decade. Land drainage High winds are just part of the story. Climate change affects hurricane seasons in other ways, too. Rainfall during hurricanes can be devastating. Hurricane Harvey would have brought severe flooding to Houston regardless of climate change. But it is reasonable to assume that Harvey brought more rain than it would have done 100 years ago. Global air temperatures have also increased by about 1C in the past 100 years, and warmer air holds more water. That's likely to be behind the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events seen in the US in recent decades. Image copyright EPA Image caption Extreme rainfall events are becoming more common in the US, according to data from the EPA But the location of housing compounded the damage. Houston's population has more than doubled since 1960 to more than two million people. Housing developments are expanding into more marginal, poorly drained land. This puts more people in harm's way. Climate change is also causing seas to rise. Melting glaciers and land-based ice sheets contribute to higher sea levels. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Melting glaciers are causing sea levels to rise Also warmer water occupies a larger volume. So as seas warm up, sea levels rise. In the US, the largest sea-level rise is around the coast of the Gulf of Mexico - about 9.6mm each year at Eugene Island, Louisiana. All of this is increasing vulnerability to flooding when hurricanes and their associated storm surge reach land. A warmer world is bringing us a greater number of hurricanes and a greater risk of a hurricane becoming the most powerful category 5. There's an increased risk of flood damage - whether related to climate change, rising sea levels or more people moving into flood-prone areas. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

MARY WILLIAMS WALSH,"Yet inland flooding is in some ways more perilous. A study by the National Hurricane Center found that more than half the Americans killed by flooding during hurricanes and tropical storms over a 30-year period had died after the storms moved inland, presenting hazards like flash floods and mudslides and sweeping motorists off flooded roads. And it’s many of the people affected by those hazards who don’t have flood insurance. People near the coasts tend to know their risks. Owners of expensive beach houses often buy even more flood insurance than they have to, because the government’s mandatory coverage is capped at $250,000 per house plus $100,000 for the contents. On top of that, additional “layers” of coverage can be purchased from private insurers. In the Carolinas, a quarter to half of the households near the coast are insured, said Ray Lehmann, a member of SmarterSafer, a coalition of taxpayer groups, environmental organizations, insurers and others that has pushed for flood-insurance reform. Further inland, it’s another story. “We’re talking about places in North Carolina where the coverage is less than 1 percent,” said Mr. Lehmann, also the director of finance, insurance and trade policy at the R Street Institute, a think tank that promotes free-market policies.","Flood waters inundated Lumberton, N.C., on Tuesday following Hurricane Florence.

Penny Green,"Opinions expressed by Green Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
The cannabis industry has historically been applauded for its relatively high participation of women, and while it can boast a higher number of female executives than the average for all U.S. businesses, the number of female leaders fell by 9 percent from 2015 to 2017. That means in 2018, just 27 percent of cannabis business leaders were female.
To understand why, we need to look at the entire industry and what’s changed about it over those two years. Recreational legalization has obviously been the most drastic change. The majority of businesses prior to recreational legalization were focused solely on the medical use of the substance -- and women tend to dominate the emerging wellness space.

Where are the women?
This decline of women leaders may be explained by the influx of capital entering the market, particularly via the public markets. Medical cannabis and its subculture have been growing for several years, largely led by women. However, following the legalization of cannabis in Canada in October of 2018, revisions to the U.S. Farm Bill in December 2018 and the evolving regulation around cannabis in various states, more and more mainstream investment has entered, bringing much larger, multi-million-dollar opportunities.
Turning over a new leaf.
Because of this influx of investment, the culture of the cannabis industry has abruptly become heavily influenced by the culture of the capital markets, which are dominated by men. According to a 2018 study by Harvard Business School, women held just 9 percent of senior roles in venture capital and 6 percent of roles in private equity. I’ve seen this disparity first hand during my more-than two decades as an entrepreneur. I have always made an effort to recognize and promote talented and capable women in my companies, but the truth is that the gap is still there. Fewer than 10 publicly-traded cannabis companies are led by women CEOs -- you can see that we have a long way to go.
Further, when you look at the largest cannabis companies with the highest valuations, such as The Cronus Group, Aurora and Aphria, you see very few women at the helm, with from none to perhaps two women on each board of directors or executive team.

Why it matters.
As clinical trials continue to demonstrate the health benefits of cannabis, the next wave of companies will do much more than just cultivate. They will also produce creams, drinks, supplements and other value-added products that produce much higher margins for companies. Women make 90 percent of household healthcare decisions in the $4.2 trillion wellness market -- it will be crucial to have women at the helm of these companies.  
Cannabis aside, it has long been well documented that women in leadership improves company performance. Companies with strong female leadership at the board level generate a return on equity 36.4 percent higher than companies without.
Clearly, there is an economic incentive to get women to the top of these organizations. I’ve spent the last two decades building companies and have been involved in more than 100 going-public transactions. Throughout my tenure, I have seen a few specific corporate decisions move the needle on this.
You can’t be what you can’t see.
Studies have shown that companies with a woman chair had nearly twice the number of women on boards. Putting women in the very top positions of an organization can encourage increased diversity throughout.

Vote with your wallet.
Institutional investors are starting to vote against all-male boards, and everyone can vote with their wallet by purchasing from women-led companies and investing in women-led public companies. You don’t need a lot of money to start investing. It takes just a few dollars to begin building a stock portfolio of companies you believe in.
Go for it.
Don’t wait for someone to hand you power or opportunity -- you don’t need permission to be successful. Creating your own destiny begins with believing that you can do whatever it is you dream of doing. I incorporated The Yield Growth Corp. myself, built the team, raised the capital, took the company public and here we are today, selling our products internationally and attracting top-tier talent.
It is a rare opportunity to truly be at the forefront of an industry. This new industry will undoubtedly evolve into a major force economically and culturally. It is important to recognize our opportunity to lay its foundations now and to build in equality from the ground up.",Big money flooding into the cannabis industry brings with it the male dominated culture of the capital markets.,2019-03-08T19:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Greenentrepreneur.com'}",We Have a Problem: The Cannabis Industry Is Losing Women Leaders,https://www.greenentrepreneur.com/article/329826,https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/20190308160537-GettyImages-8694206281.jpeg,,Greenentrepreneur.com,flooding,1
"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Hurricane Florence, which was briefly downgraded to a tropical storm last week, was re-upgraded to hurricane status on Sunday and looks like it is destined to barrel straight at the U.S.’ East Coast. According to CNN, odds are good that it will have strengthened to Category 4 status—meaning sustained winds in the range of 130-156 miles per hour—before the time it makes landfall later this week, likely on Thursday or Friday. CNN wrote: “Maximum sustained winds are now 75 mph, and further strengthening is forecast over the coming days,” said CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen. “Florence continues on a track to impact the US mainland by Thursday or Friday.” The hurricane center said, “All indications are that Florence will be an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane while it moves over the western Atlantic toward the southeastern United States.” Florence was some 1,500 miles away from the East Coast and moving west at roughly six miles per hour on Sunday morning, according to CNN. It’s projected to pass between the Bahamas and Bermuda on its way to land. According to CNN, weather experts say the storm is most likely to hit in the Carolinas. However, the Washington Post noted that the hurricane’s exact placement is “within a large cone of uncertainty” and residents anywhere “Florida to southern New England” should be aware of the storm’s progression. The Post’s weather team noted that Florence will pass over oceans that are warmer than normal, which will provide fuel and “favors at least a Category 3 hurricane landfall on the Southeast coast by week’s end” (emphasis theirs). It’s possible it could become a Category 5 storm. The National Hurricane Center warned on Twitter that there may be a high risk of “storm surge at the coast and freshwater flooding from a prolonged heavy rainfall event inland.” Accuweather added that storm swells are expected to stretch for hundreds of miles around Florence and impact, and there’s a possibility that the storm could stall right as hits land, resulting in sustained battering of the coast and flooding. The Post wrote: In these coastal areas, heavy surf and elevated water levels arrive by Wednesday morning, and rainfall could begin by Thursday morning. Tropical-storm-force winds could reach the coastline as early as Wednesday night, at which point all outdoor preparations should be completed. Extremely dangerous hurricane-force winds could batter coastal locations Thursday into Friday. Hurricane to tropical-storm-force winds could extend inland depending on the storm’s exact track. Two tropical storms are following behind it: Isaac and Helene. Helene is expected to veer north well before coming close to the coast, though Isaac is expected to turn into a hurricane as it continues heading west towards the Windward Islands, the Miami Herald wrote. In preparation for the storm, the governments of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia have all declared states of emergency and are mobilizing resources. As Axios noted, many areas in the path of the storm have not seen hurricanes of this strength for decades—like Charleston, South Carolina, where the last Category 4 storm was Hugo in 1989. Thanks to rising ocean waters from climate change, the area is already prone to the phenomenon of “sunny day flooding” in good conditions. As Earther noted on Friday, this course is unprecedented. Almost all of the 57 named storms that have passed within 200 miles of Florence’s position at that time have curved out to sea, other than a handful which slammed into the Dominican Republic.

BRAD PLUMER,"The Battery area of Charleston, S.C., after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. Companies are seeking better climate forecasts to assess the risks of operating in the area. Credit Sean Rayford for The New York Times In Charleston, S.C., where the ports have been expanding to accommodate larger ships sailing through the newly widened Panama Canal, a real-estate developer named Xebec Realty recently went looking for land to build new warehouses and logistics centers. But first, Xebec had a question: What were the odds that the sites it was considering might be underwater in 10 or 20 years? After all, Charleston has repeatedly suffered major floods that can paralyze cargo operations. And scientists warn that flooding will worsen as sea levels rise and storms strengthen with climate change. Yet detailed information about the city’s climate risks proved surprisingly hard to find. Federal flood maps are based on historical data, and won’t tell you how sea-level rise could exacerbate flooding in the years ahead. Scientific reports on global warming, such as the National Climate Assessment, can tell you that heavy rainstorms are expected to increase in the Southeast, but they won’t tell you whether specific roads leading to a given warehouse might be unusable during those storms. So Xebec turned to a Silicon Valley start-up called Jupiter, which offered to analyze local weather and hydrological data and combine it with climate model projections to assess the potential climate risks Xebec might face in Charleston over the next few decades from things like heavier rainfall, sea level rise or increased storm surge. Although Jupiter’s forecasting skill remains unproven, Xebec was eager to participate in a pilot project. “If we could have reliable predictive analytics in this area, that’s a huge impact for our business,” said Scott Hodgkins, an executive vice president at Xebec. As companies around the world grow concerned about the risks of climate change, they have started looking for clarity on how warming might disrupt their operations in the future. But governments in the United States and Europe have been slow to translate academic research on global warming into practical, timely advice for businesses or local city planners. Now some private companies, like Jupiter, are trying to fill the gap. This remains a young and untested field, and it’s unclear whether Jupiter or others can succeed as profitable enterprises. Scientists caution that predicting short-term climate effects in specific locations remains rife with uncertainty. Jupiter will have to persuade potential customers that its forecasts are reliable enough to give companies a competitive edge. “In economics, information has value if you would make a different decision based on that information,” said Matthew E. Kahn, an economist who studies climate adaptation at the University of Southern California. “Is that the case here?” Some insurance companies, such as FM Global, already study climate risks and consult with clients on how to make their buildings more resilient to hurricanes that may get stronger in the future. In 2014, a start-up called Coastal Risk Consulting opened in South Florida to offer flood assessments to homeowners nervous about rising seas. Jupiter, founded in 2017 by Rich Sorkin, a longtime tech entrepreneur, wants to go a step further. The start-up has received $10 million in venture capital so far and has been hiring climate scientists, weather modelers and data experts from places like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Its co-founders include Todd D. Stern, the lead climate envoy in the Obama administration, and Jeff Wecker, the chief data officer for Goldman Sachs. The company is developing a variety of predictive tools, some of which look much like Google Maps, that it hopes will allow paying customers to zoom down to the city block level to get a better sense of the potential risks they face from storms, heat waves, wildfires or other climate-change effects in the coming decades. A map of Charleston generated by Jupiter that forecasts flooding from storm surges that have a 1 percent probability of occurring annually by 2030 under a high-end emissions scenario. Credit Jupiter Intel “We know the planet’s getting warmer and sea levels are rising, but on a hyperlocal basis, the quality of those predictions can be much better than it is,” Mr. Sorkin said. To create its flood maps, for instance, Jupiter looks not just at public data like satellite-based observations of rainfall and ocean currents, but also how changes in the urban landscape affect how water flows through cities. It then aims to harness recent advances in cloud-based supercomputing to combine that data with the latest climate model projections. The company’s scientists plan to continually test their forecasts against observations — to see, for instance, how well they predict flooding from major storms — and publish their research in scientific journals. In theory, the United States government could cobble much of this information together and present it in a usable way. But federal agencies tend to focus their resources on shorter-term weather predictions, and Congress has generally underfunded initiatives such as those at the Federal Emergency Management Agency to incorporate climate change into its federal flood maps. “If you want a full picture of flooding risk, you need expertise in weather, but also climate and hydrology and engineering and running complex models on the latest computer hardware,” Mr. Sorkin said. “All of those specialized disciplines are usually heavily siloed within the public sector or the scientific community.” Jupiter’s scientists will have to grapple with a number of technical challenges. While current climate models can provide broad statistical projections of how average temperatures and rainfall patterns are likely to shift across large regions over the coming century, it remains difficult to predict such shifts precisely over shorter time scales — which is what companies are often most concerned about. “Forecasting at 10-20 year time periods is perhaps the most difficult period to forecast,” Simon Mason, a climate scientist at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society who is not involved with Jupiter, wrote in an email. “If that is not enough, trying to predict severe weather events rather than long-term averages is even harder still!” Past efforts to provide what are known as “climate services” have struggled with this issue. In 2009, the German government established the Climate Service Center to provide information about global warming risks to cities and businesses. But Guy P. Brasseur, a climate scientist who helped start the center, said potential clients were often disappointed with the uncertainty in the resulting forecasts. “One airline wanted to know how often the airport in Frankfurt would be closed because of snowstorms next year,” Dr. Brasseur said. “We were unable to answer a question like that.” Jupiter, which acknowledges the uncertainties in climate forecasting, will have to prove that a market exists. But at least one firm in the insurance industry sees potential value in the company’s approach, particularly after flooding and other disasters caused $306 billion in damages last year in the United States and record losses by insurers. “That certainly raised the stakes in terms of trying to get the best possible science on your side when you’re pricing risk,” said John Drzik, president of global risk at Marsh, one of the world’s largest commercial insurance brokers, which is currently in talks with Jupiter to explore what types of data and risk analyses might be most useful to its clients. Mr. Drzik noted that many of the traditional catastrophic risk models used by the insurance industry are rooted largely in historical data and don’t always grapple fully with how climate change could shift those risks in the future. While his company is still evaluating whether Jupiter’s climate-oriented models are useful enough to be worth paying for, “it grabbed us as something that had a lot of promise.” As global warming advances, experts say that governments will ultimately have to invest more in their own local climate prediction tools to help cities and industries adapt. But they also see a role for private climate forecasters, much as weather companies have sprung up to supplement the work the National Weather Service does. “The federal government could be doing a lot more,” said James L. Buizer, who studies climate adaptation at the University of Arizona. “But there’s still an important role for the private sector. If companies are going to benefit from this information, they ought to be paying for it. After all, it’s their infrastructure that’s going to get trashed.”","The Battery area of Charleston, S.C., after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016.

Lucia Mutikani,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding jumped to a one-year high in October likely as disruptions caused by recent hurricanes in the South faded and communities in the region started replacing houses damaged by flooding. Construction workers build a single family home in San Diego, California, U.S. February 15, 2017. Picture taken February 15, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake The sharp rebound in home construction reported by the Commerce Department on Friday could ease concerns about the housing market, which has been a drag on the economy since the second quarter. Housing starts surged 13.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29 million units. That was the highest level since October 2016. September’s sales pace was revised up to 1.135 million units from the previously reported 1.127 million units. Groundbreaking activity in the South, which accounts for almost half of U.S. residential construction, plummeted in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The storms slammed Texas and Florida in late August and early September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts rising to a pace of 1.185 million units last month. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were lower in early morning trading, while stock index futures were mixed. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. HOMEBUILDER CONFIDENCE HIGH Housing starts in the South soared 17.2 percent in October to 621,000 units, with single-family construction vaulting 16.6 percent to its highest level since 2007. There were also increases in homebuilding in the Midwest and Northeast. October’s increase in starts ended three straight months of declines. Homebuilding has struggled this year, hamstrung by shortages of land and labor as well as expensive lumber. Investment in homebuilding has contracted for two consecutive quarters. That has contributed to a worsening housing shortage, which has held back home sales. A survey on Thursday showed confidence among homebuilders in November at the second-highest level since July 2005 amid optimism about current sales conditions and buyer traffic. Builders, however, continued to complain about the lack of buildable lots, land and pricey materials. Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 5.3 percent to a rate of 877,000 units in October, the highest level in eight months. Single-family starts fell 22.4 percent in the Northeast and slipped 7.7 percent in the West. They rose 7.8 percent in the Midwest. Groundbreaking on single-family housing projects has slowed since racing to near a 9-1/2-year high in February. Last month, starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment surged 36.8 percent to a rate of 413,000 units. Building permits increased 5.9 percent to a rate of 1.297 million units in October, the highest level since January. Single-family home permits rose 1.9 percent to their highest level since September 2007, while permits for the construction of multi-family homes jumped 13.9 percent. Housing completions increased 12.6 percent to a rate of 1.232 million units last month, the highest level since February 2008. The rise in completions was, however, driven by the multi-family housing segment, which will probably do little to eliminate the acute shortage of properties available for sale. Home completions for buildings with five units or more surged 37.9 percent to their highest level since April 1988. Single-family home completions increased only 2.6 percent last month.

Reuters,"(Reuters) ― The U.S. Southern Plains and Midwest braced for more flooding on Thursday as snow-melting temperatures and heavy rains swelled waterways after claiming the lives of at least two people, including a child, and forcing hundreds of people to evacuate. Flood advisories were in effect until at least Sunday for low-lying parts of eastern Texas northeast across the region into southern Ohio and in Michigan, Indiana and Illinois, the National Weather Service said. The flooding forced hundreds of people to place sandbags around their property and flee their homes in small communities like Niles, Indiana and Marseilles, Illinois that sit on rivers, already beyond their flood stages, that were not expected to crest for days. “We just got to wait for it to go down,” Terry Teeter said to WOOD-TV after installing pumps around his house in Mattawan, Michigan. “It’s going to be a couple of days like this.” A one-year-old girl died when she wandered into standing water in a backyard in Central Michigan and a 52-year-old woman was found dead in her car that was submerged in a ditch in Illinois, local media reported. Rising waters also forced some 19 people to evacuate their homes in Elkhart, Indiana, a community about 110 miles (175 km) southeast of Chicago, the local newspaper reported. “This city has not seen flooding like this in the last 45 years,” Elkhart Mayor Tim Neese said during a news conference, the Elkhart Truth reported. More rain was expected to fall on Thursday in the Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas where as much as 8 inches (20 cm) fell on Tuesday and Wednesday, closing roadways and schools. “We are still expecting heavy rain and flash flooding at least through the end of the week,” the National Weather Service said in a Tweet regarding the region.

WCPO Staff,"CINCINNATI -- Officials are urging drivers to plan their Monday morning commutes accordingly. The Ohio River crested at 60.5 feet Sunday evening, and flooding closed many Tri-State roads. Hamilton County Commission President Todd Portune said Mehring Way will remain closed for Monday’s commute. Additionally, riverfront garages at The Banks are closed due to flooding. Columbia Parkway reopened as of 1 p.m. Sunday. It had been closed Saturday near Delta Avenue. Any parking south of Third Street is underwater, Cincinnati police said. Police said commuters from eastern suburbs should be aware that the Salem, Apple Hill, Kellogg route is partially flooded. Wooster Road is also closed from Beechmont Circle north to Redbank Road. ATTN EASTSIDERS- Wooster is closed from Beechmont Circle to Red Bank Road - Use Columbia Parkway and Eastern Avenue as a bypass — Cincinnati Police (@CincyPD) February 26, 2018 In a statement, City Manager Harry Black said officials will reopen roads as soon as it is safe to do so. “Given the amount of significant road closures the morning commute will be difficult for many. We encourage travelers to check for the latest closures, plan for extra travel time and consider altering travel schedules, if possible,” Black said. Police have strongly advised residents to not drive through floodwaters. Driving on a flooded roadway is exceptionally dangerous, and driving on a closed roadway is illegal. Motorists can be ticketed up to $2,000 for driving through barricades. The National Weather Service says a mere 6 inches of fast-moving flood water is enough to knock over a full-grown adult, and that just a foot of rushing water can carry away a small car. Two feet of rushing water is forceful enough to float away almost any SUV or pickup truck. Standing water over roadways can also harbor hidden dangers such as sharp objects, live electrical wires or chemicals. Portune also mentioned drivers should use caution when driving in the coming week, as many roads will likely be covered in debris.","WCPO Ohio River Flooding: What you need to know before your Monday commute WCPO The Ohio River crested at 60.5 feet Sunday evening, and flooding closed many Tri-State roads.

"Holly Yan, CNN","(CNN) Deserts aren't supposed to get much rain, but Tropical Storm Rosa is flipping the script. Rosa is forecast to make landfall early Tuesday with more than 11 million people under a flash flood watch in the Southwest, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said. It'll drench Baja California with 3 to 6 inches of rain, with some spots getting up to 10 inches, the National Hurricane Center said. As it moves northeast, Rosa will also dump 2 to 4 inches of rain on much of Arizona, with up to 6 inches in the mountains. A flash flood watch is in effect for parts of Arizona until Wednesday as the storm's remnants move across the state, the National Weather Service said. ""These rainfall amounts may produce life-threatening flash flooding,"" the National Hurricane Center said. ""Dangerous debris flows and landslides are also possible in mountainous terrain."" Historically, it's unusual for the US Southwest to get pummeled by a hurricane or tropical storm. But ""these events have begun to increase in recent years,"" CNN meteorologist Gene Norman said. Research indicates that global warming contributes to tropical storms getting ""more intense, bigger and longer-lasting, thereby increasing their potential for damage,"" said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. While there might not be a direct link between global warming and the recent increase of severe storms in the US Southwest, ""it is possible that this could be a side effect of climate change,"" Norman said. ""Warmer oceans are allowing eastern Pacific storms to reach higher latitudes,"" he said. ""This was not the case earlier. It was quite rare for an eastern Pacific storm to even reach Baja California, and this is now becoming more common."" Rosa was about 75 miles (125 kilometers) North of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, late Monday night, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). CNN's Brandon Miller and Judson Jones contributed to this report.","Deserts aren't supposed to get much rain, but Tropical Storm Rosa is flipping the script.

Joe Martucci,"Pleasant weather will take us through the last day of February. However, all attention then turns to Thursday night thru Saturday, with coastal flooding and strong winds threatening. High pressure will remain in control for Wednesday morning, slipping offshore during the afternoon. As a result, morning sun will give way to afternoon clouds. Southwest winds will pump in milder air and we should manage to get into the upper 50s. Clouds will then continue to thicken overnight, ahead of our storm system. Thursday morning will be dry, but bring the umbrella. Rain showers will develop between 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., from the shores of the Delaware Bay for Long Beach Island. The worst of the rain will be from the afternoon commute Thursday until early Friday morning. We should then see more dry time than not on Friday morning. As low pressure stalls off the Jersey Shore, scattered areas of rain will fall Friday afternoon into Saturday morning. Even Saturday afternoon can see a shower. However, I do not believe Saturday is a washout. By Sunday, the sun will be shining. To learn how this storm is forming, we must look west. A piece of potent upper level energy in California, one which brought snow to the mountains around San Diego and hail in Sacramento, will merge with another piece of energy on Thursday in the Midwest. As surface low pressure treks into the Midwest, a secondary low will form off the Jersey Shore. This two will then combine off the Jersey Shore and strengthen rapidly, much like our January bomb blizzard, though not to that extent. +3 This map shows the vorticity, or spin in the atmosphere at the 500 millibar level (~18,000 feet) Wedneday morning. The darker the colors, the more spin and energy there is to the system. These two pieces will meet up when they enter the Midwest on Thursday. Then, they will create a massive low pressure system off the mid-Atlantic Coastal on Friday. Martucci, Joseph Coastal flooding will be a threat from the Friday morning to Sunday afternoon high tides, centering on Saturday. The Atlantic Ocean shores will have it worse than the Delaware Bay. Additionally, isolated roadway and creek flooding is expected, with a half to one inch of rain anticipated. Winds will also be an issue. Gusts will be in the 30s on the Mainland and 40s at the Jersey Shore on Friday and Saturday. This will not be horrible, but your garbage cans could tip over and even isolated power outages are in the realm of possibility.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Forecasters say the hurricane will certainly hit the US coastline Evacuations have been ordered as the US East Coast braces for Hurricane Florence - in what may be the strongest storm to hit the region in two decades. South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia have declared states of emergency, and residents are stocking up on essential supplies. Officials say Florence is now a category three storm with 115mph (183km/h) winds, and gaining strength. It is expected to strike the Carolinas by Thursday. Florence - which was 1,200 miles (2,000km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina, on Monday morning - could reach category four as its draws strength from the warm Atlantic waters, say forecasters. It would be the first category three storm to hit the region since Fran ravaged North Carolina 1996. It would be the first East Coast hurricane since Jeanne struck Florida in 2004. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) says Florence may bring catastrophic levels of rain and flooding to coastal and inland regions. The National Weather Service warned it may be ""an extremely dangerous major hurricane"" by the time it made landfall. Image copyright Reuters Image caption International Space Station by astronaut Ricky Arnold took this photo of Florence on 6 September The Miami-based NHC said: ""There is an increasing risk of life-threatening impacts from Florence: storm surge at the coast, freshwater flooding from a prolonged and exceptionally heavy rainfall event inland, and damaging hurricane-force winds."" The agency called Florence an ""extremely dangerous"" weather event. ""Somebody is going to suffer devastating damage if this storm continues as it is currently forecast,"" National Weather Service meteorologist Dan Miller told The State newspape r in South Carolina. States of emergency North Carolina officials on Monday ordered residents to evacuate the state's Outer Banks barrier islands. There have been long queues in supermarkets around communities near waterways and coastlines as residents clear shelves of water, batteries and plywood.

Image copyright NOAA Image caption A government satellite image shows the storm's location on Sunday ""Pretend, assume, presume that a major hurricane is going to hit right smack dab in the middle of South Carolina and is going to go way inshore,"" said South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. In North Carolina, Governor Roy Cooper waived agricultural transportation restrictions in order to allow farmers to move goods more quickly. ""During harvest, time is of the essence.

The company announced a slew of the devices back in January at CES — no doubt as a way of sticking it to Amazon. After all, the Echo Show was a novel enough device in the smart speaker world, but the hardware was always a little lacking. Google, on the other hand, let hardware partners do the heavy lifting here, and at CES, the company announced devices from Lenovo, JBL and LG. The former was far and away the nicest looking of the bunch — and it’s the first to hit the market, running $200 for the eight-inch version and $250 for the 10-inch (including three months of YouTube Premium). The others are simply listed as “coming soon.” Google took things a step further at I/O, handing out hardware development kits, so interested manufacturers could build their own. Expect those to start flooding the market in the not-so-distant future, if the Assistant smart speaker market is any indicator. If you’ve spent any time with the Echo Show or Spot, you pretty much know the deal here: news, music, podcasts, recipes and the like, all with a visual element.

Haley Samsel,"It's no secret that we've had a rough fall and winter with natural disasters. Even as we write this, fires burn in Southern California, adding to the previous wildfires in the northern part of the state that burned over 245,000 acres in October. Hurricanes Irma and Harvey devastated communities across Florida and Texas, while touching communities in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, the Carolinas and Louisiana. The U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were devastated by back-to-back hurricanes Irma and Maria. Amidst the trauma and destruction, school districts across the U.S. have shouldered a heavy burden: trying to help their students catch up after missing days, weeks and even months of class time. Across nine states, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, at least 9 million students missed some amount of school this fall due to a natural disaster, according to an NPR Ed analysis. The analysis compiled missed days from individual public school districts affected by natural disasters as well as estimates given by state education departments. In Florida, 2.6 million kids missed at least one full week of school, according to our analysis. Overall, the state's students missed an average of 5.78 days. About 2 million students in Texas also missed at least one school day. The hardest hit? School districts near Corpus Christi, a coastal city on the Gulf of Mexico. Some students there were out for several weeks. Elsewhere: Aransas Pass, a Texas district serving about 1,800 students, didn't re-open until Oct. 16; that's 34 days after schools were originally closed. Compare that with Houston, where schools reopened 10 days after Harvey. In Southern California, many schools near Santa Barbara have been closed for the last two weeks, with plans to reopen after the new year. And those numbers pale in comparison to Puerto Rico. An estimated 345,000 students on the island were affected by the disaster, missing several weeks of school. Many students have left to live with relatives and attend school in the states, particularly Florida and New York. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, where roughly 13,000 students missed weeks of classes, most schools are now open, with the exception of a few that have been ""condemned"" by the islands' education department. All this lost time, of course, is likely to have an impact on student achievement. A fairly new metric in education, chronic absence, is defined as missing more than 10 percent of the school year — just two days a month. Lots of research has shown that such students are way more likely to fall behind and, eventually, drop out. Especially for those in early grades, where the emphasis in school is placed on learning to read. After third grade, students are expected to read to learn, but if the foundations aren't there, they can struggle. Under the new federal education law, 36 states plan to use some measure of chronic absence to measure school success. And while missing school from a disaster is not the same as chronic absence — after all, all the students are absent from school, the hit on learning time is vast. In the aftermath of these disruptions, some districts are taking creative measures to make up for missed class time. The Manatee County schools in Florida, with almost 49,000 students, added 10 minutes to every school day from Oct. 2 to Dec. 20, along with a shortened Thanksgiving break. Many districts say they have enough class time built into their calendar that the missed days won't keep them from meeting requirements. In other places, though, the time lost is just too much to make up. In Texas and Florida, state education commissioners have waived several required days due to the extreme nature of the disasters. In Texas, those lost days — or weeks — have worried educators in several districts, who are asking the state to delay testing dates or suspend testing requirements altogether. As it stands, Texas' fifth- and eighth-graders, as well as high school students, must pass state tests to advance to the next grade or graduate. Most superintendents of districts affected by Harvey say they do not want to delay state tests in the spring, but they're worried that the state will evaluate their districts harshly due to low test scores. ""We don't mind taking the exams, but we don't want to be... publicly humiliated over something we had no control over,"" Joseph Patek III, superintendent of the hard-hit Aransas County school district, said during a state legislature meeting on Nov. 14. Districts across the country could be grappling with this same spring testing issue, when missed class time catches up with students and teachers still dealing with the trauma wrought by natural disasters. For now, in Texas, the state education agency says it will take into account how many students and staff were displaced and how classrooms were disrupted when deciding on accountability.","Wildfires, hurricanes, flooding — this fall has brought a wave of natural disasters to the U.S. With that comes many days where schools are closed — and those absences add up.",2017-12-15T10:49:06Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Natural Disasters And The Implications Of Missing So Much School,https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2017/12/15/564058043/natural-disasters-and-the-implications-of-missing-so-much-school,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/12/01/disasters_wide-cdff79d31e52349d887e4b3c8e8ccd21be949179.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,flooding,1
Mark Kaufman,"While flying a drone over the completely flooded four-lane Interstate 40 on Monday, the North Carolina Highway Patrol spotted an unusual sight: A motorized boat leaving a large wake over the highway. The storm formerly known as Florence — which hit North Carolina as a Hurricane last Friday and then proceeded to drop historic rainfall over much of the state — has brought catastrophic and deadly flooding to inland cities and coastal communities alike. SEE ALSO: How flocks of birds got trapped inside the eye of Hurricane Florence Florence has demolished rainfall records. Previously, North Carolina's rainfall record from a storm was 24 inches, set by Hurricane Floyd nearly twenty years ago. On Monday, the National Weather Service reported that nearly 36 inches fell on Elizabethtown, North Carolina. At least 11 other areas also broke the old record. State Highway Patrol Sgt. Michael Baker said via phone that the drone operations will continue over the highway as the agency works to identify flooded and troubled areas. Baker was unsure, however, whether this particular boat was part of state reconnaissance efforts, or simply someone taking a bizarre boating trip down a U.S. highway. Aside from the boat on the freeway, the Highway Patrol drone also spotted completely submerged vehicles and vast swathes of brown water inundating land well beyond the highway. In cities well inland, like Fayetteville, North Carolina, the floodwaters are continuing to rise, even as the main remnants of the storm moved over the Mid-Atlantic states and into New England on Tuesday. A hurricane that makes landfall is never good, but even worse is a slow-moving storm. Atmospheric scientists found these tropical storms have slowed considerably since the 1950s, which gives the tempests ample time to flood major U.S. transportation arteries — and transform them into brown rivers.","While flying a drone over the completely flooded four-lane Interstate 40 on Monday, the North Carolina Highway Patrol spotted an unusual sight: A motorized boat leaving a large wake over the highway.

JACEY FORTIN,"Hurricanes in Categories 3, 4 and 5 are considered “major.” Hurricane Maria was a Category 4 storm when it hit Puerto Rico last year, ultimately killing thousands and causing months of power failures. If a hurricane’s winds reach Category 5 speeds, “a high percentage of framed homes will be destroyed,” according to the National Hurricane Center, and “power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.” Only a few hurricanes have ever made landfall in the United States as a Category 5 storm. The last was Andrew, in 1992. Meteorologists caution that a hurricane can be very dangerous no matter what its category, especially since the Saffir-Simpson scale doesn’t tell the whole story. It does not, for example, account for rainfall levels or storm surges — not directly, anyway — and those factors have a lot to do with flood risk. Take Hurricane Sandy. In 2012, it never made landfall as anything stronger than a Category 2 storm. But it led to flooding, mudslides, power failures and dozens of fatalities in the Caribbean and the United States. Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas as a Category 4 storm last year and was soon downgraded to a Category 3. That rating did not account for the days of heavy rain that would follow, which led to fatal, catastrophic flooding.","On the morning of a mandatory evacuation in North Carolina, clouds dotted the skies over Nags Head on Tuesday.",2018-09-11T22:12:23Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",What Is a Category 5 Hurricane?

Ethel Jiang,"Home sales in the Hamptons slumped for the entire year of 2018 as inventories swelled to their highest level in more than a decade, indicating the US housing market is falling deeper into a weak stretch. 
 According to a new report published by the real-estate company Douglas Elliman, home sales in the Hamptons plunged 34.8% year-over-year in the fourth quarter to 360 units, booking the fourth consecutive quarterly decline. As a result, inventories swelled by 81.9% to 2,197 units, the highest level since the firm began tracking the data in 2006. 
 ""Like the city, Hamptons sales fell year over year each quarter in 2018 as the market reset,"" Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel, a New York-based real estate consulting company, told Markets Insider. 
 A mismatch between residential-real-estate activity and the rest of the economy may be worsening the slowdown, according to Miller. The US economy is humming, with unemployment at multi-decade lows and average hourly earnings gaining at an unprecedented speed. Despite strong economic metrics, US home inventories are sitting at their highest level since 2011. 
 ""Sellers remained anchored to the stronger market conditions of the past few years and their confusion over the disconnect between the housing market and the US economy,"" Miller said. 
 He added that volatile mortgage rates are causing home buyers to have a wait-and-see attitude. In November, the average rate on a 30-year, fixed rate mortgage rose to 4.94%, the highest level in seven years. While the rate has declined a bit to 4.45% now, it's still above the 3.9% from a year ago. 
 And the new federal tax law that capped housing-related deductions is also pulling down sales, according to Miller. In December 2017, President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which curbed mortgage-interest deductions and placed a $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions. It essentially wiped out some provisions that were designed to encourage Americans to own homes. 
 It's not all bad, however, as the unfavorable market conditions haven't discouraged the super wealthy from buying homes in the Hamptons. According to the Douglas Elliman report, luxury Hamptons sales at or over $5 million reached their highest market share in three years as the average price jumped 14.6% YoY to $8,588,288.

,"At a Glance Residents within a quarter mile of the Llano River in the city of Llano were urged to evacuate. Water rescues were reported Tuesday morning in Segovia, Texas. A bridge has collapsed after heavy rain in parts of south-central Texas triggered major flooding along several rivers and creeks, where evacuations and water rescues are underway. A section of the FM 2900 bridge collapsed in Kingsland on Tuesday morning, sending chunks of the bridge down the Llano River, according to a tweet. Residents within a quarter mile of the river in the city of Llano were urged to evacuate on Tuesday, according to a Civil Emergency Message. Authorities in Marble Falls told residents in several neighborhoods along the river to evacuate. The city is also asking residents to limit activities including laundry, washing dishes, using the toilet and taking showers because flooding was putting the city's wastewater plant under stress. The river rose to its second highest crest on record Tuesday morning in the city about 75 miles northwest of Austin and home to more than 3,000. According to the National Weather Service, many homes from Castell to below Llano are typically damaged by floodwaters when the river rises to that level. As much as 10 inches of rain had fallen in western Llano County in the 30 hours ending Tuesday morning, weather.com meteorologist Chris Dolce says. Farther west, water rescues were reported Tuesday morning in Segovia, prompting a flash flood emergency to be issued. The emergency will expire at 11 a.m. CDT. Eight rescues because of high water were completed in Gillespie County on Monday night, John Culpepper of the county's Office of Emergency Management told KXAN.

Sasha Ingber,"A Rohingya woman walks past a flooded farm near the Kutupalong Refugee Camp in Bangladesh, where the monsoon season started in June and has caused casualties and landslides. Jana Cavojska / SOPA/LightRocket via Getty Images Monsoon rains set in over the weekend in Bangladesh, flooding refugee camps and leading to the death of a Rohingya boy, who died when a mud wall of his shelter fell on top of him, according to media reports. His mother also was injured in the collapse. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya — a persecuted Muslim minority — have been living in makeshift shelters of earth, bamboo and plastic. Their homes are huddled on steep hillsides in southeastern Bangladesh that have been cleared of vegetation. Some 700,000 Rohingya abandoned their homes in neighboring Myanmar after the Buddhist military began a campaign of rape, torture, murder and arson in August 2017. The United Nations has called it "" a textbook example of ethnic cleansing."" As they fled into neighboring Bangladesh, one of the largest and fastest displacement crises in modern times developed. The monsoon season started last weekend with about 15 inches of rain and winds of up to 43 miles per hour. According to the United Nations, 37 landslides occurred and more than 1,000 shelters were damaged, in addition to infrastructure — a health facility, a food distribution site, water points and hundreds of latrines. The UN estimates that 11,000 people have been affected so far. ""We all knew the monsoon was coming, but the last three days are the most intense storms I've seen,"" Daphnee Cook, spokesperson for Save the Children's Rohingya response, told NPR from the Cox's Bazar district. ""It's astounding how quickly the clay ground has turned into thick mud."" Cook said she has passed by crying children and people traveling in boats. A key access point into the Kutupalong refugee camp was blocked off, so Save the Children teams had to enter the camp on foot. Some of the organization's learning centers, where children are taught math, Rohingya language and life skills, temporarily have been shut down. Rick Brennan, director of emergency operations for the World Health Organization, told NPR that preparatory measures have been taken. Containers filled with essential health care supplies and medicine have been scattered throughout the camps, for instance, in case flooding prevents vehicles from replenishing clinics' stocks. Punishing rains in the Rohingya refugee sites today. @UNHCR_BGD, with partners, working in support of Bangladesh Govt, helped to move more than 20 families at high risk of landslides to safer areas; but thousands more still at risk and need to be relocated. #WithRefugees pic.twitter.com/TOLVVqh97a — UNHCR in Bangladesh (@UNHCR_BGD) June 12, 2018 In the weeks leading up to monsoon season, engineers were flattening out hills to prevent landslides and limit flooding. Aid organizations helped people fortify their homes, and hundreds of emergency shelters were built in one week alone. Some Rohingya refugees volunteers have been trained to assist disaster responders in storms, according to the UN. But the rains continue to fall. It is only the start to the monsoon season, which lasts until October. ""The situation in the camps is growing more desperate with every drop of rain that falls,"" said Manuel Pereira, the emergency coordinator for the International Organization for Migration said in a statement. Because people built their shelters on land that lacks vegetation to hold the ground firm, ""people and their makeshift shelters are being washed away in the rains."" A Rohingya child carries water through a rainstorm at a refugee camp in October 2017. Munir Uz Zaman/AFP/Getty Images With flooding comes the risk not just of landslides but infectious diseases, especially ones that cause potentially fatal diarrhea. Brennan said that some 985,000 people — mostly Rohingya refugees but also some local Bangladeshis — have been vaccinated against cholera. Rotavirus, dysentery, typhoid and E. coli remain a concern. ""The good news is there has been no significant increase in disease, but we're watching it,"" Brennan said, adding that poor water quality and sanitation — shallow wells, dugout latrines — make refugees more vulnerable to water-born diseases. In March, the UN's Joint Response Plan for the Rohingya humanitarian crisis requested $951 million to help 1.3 million people (more than 880,000 refugees and 330,000 Bangladeshis). Just 21 percent, about $200 million, has been provided, according to the UN. That has left aid organizations and international agencies with an even more daunting task. ""The international community in my view has really let the Rohingya and the Bangladesh people down,"" said Brennan. ""The Rohingya are among the most vulnerable people on the planet.""","Members of the Muslim minority group who fled rape, murder and brutality in Myanmar now face different threats in southeastern Bangladesh: flooding, landslides and disease.",2018-06-12T23:15:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Boy Dies, Thousands At Risk As Monsoon Rains Lash Rohingya Refugee Camps",https://www.npr.org/2018/06/12/619206519/boy-dies-thousands-at-risk-as-monsoon-rains-lash-rohingya-refugee-camps,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/06/12/gettyimages-912791312_wide-1e549484ce121a773130656fb8b32afd59c69f5a.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,flooding,1

Florence, although now downgraded to a category one storm, is slow-moving and could linger for days, bringing ""copious amounts of rain"". Image copyright NASA Earth Observatory Florence is expected to make landfall at noon local time on Friday and is moving towards land with wind speeds of 90mph (150 km/h). The National Hurricane Center says that despite the gradual lowering in wind strength, the storm remains extremely dangerous because of the high volume of rainfall and storm surges predicted. Some 10 million people are now under some form of storm watch. Storm will hit east coast Georgia, North and South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland have declared a state of emergency as forecasts showed Florence dumping historic amounts of rain on the area. Tens of thousands of homes are already without power and sea water is washing through coastal streets. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) said people living near rivers, streams and lowland areas in the region were most at risk. ""Inland flooding kills a lot of people unfortunately and that's what we're about to see,"" Fema spokesman Jeff Byard said. Evacuation orders are in place for more than a million people. More than 1,400 flights have been cancelled, according to FlightAware.com, with most of the coastal region's airports closed. Storm surges could be devastating The biggest danger to life could be from storm surges, which are still predicted to be as high as 13ft (4m) between Cape Fear and Cape Lookout in North Carolina. Meteorologists have warned some rivers may see their flows ""reversed"". Storm surges are caused when huge volumes of water are pushed by hurricane-force winds. When they meet land, the water surges inshore at levels far exceeding normal tides. Storm could dump record rainfall Florence is forecast to dump up to one metre (40 ins) of rain in some areas after it makes landfall. The torrential rainfall could last for significant periods and cause catastrophic flooding, including in inland areas such as Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia. National Weather Service forecaster Brandon Locklear said North Carolina is likely to see eight months' worth of rain in two to three days. Florence's winds are still strong The hurricane's wind speeds have fallen from a category two level of 96-110mph to a category one level of 119-153mph. There will be hurricane-force winds up to 80 miles from the centre of the storm, meteorologists say. Florence was being followed in the Atlantic by two other storms - Hurricane Helene and Tropical Storm Isaac. But Helene is now moving north east towards the UK and Isaac is moving west across the Caribbean. How hurricanes happen Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged.

Coastal Flood Warnings have been issued through noon as tides could go three feet above astronomical during Saturday mornings high tide. This will lead to widespread moderate flooding, and in some cases major flooding for the most vulnerable spots like the back bays of Nassau. The shore surrounding Long Island Sound wont escape the flooding either. Expect additional moderate flooding during the midday high tide cycle affecting vulnerable coastal locations. Those areas could see road closures and flooding of low-lying properties. [8:15am Saturday] - Rain will continue through much of the day. However, we no longer anticipate any flash flooding so the flash flood watch has been cancelled. Strong winds are still expected this morning and afternoon. pic.twitter.com/hrEJDKJzEr — NWS New York NY (@NWSNewYorkNY) October 27, 2018 Though rain continues through the day, flash flooding is no longer anticipated, the flash flood watch has been cancelled, according to the National Weather Center. In addition to coastal flooding, the beaches will get a beating. An intense storm like this will kick up the surf allowing waves of 8 to 12 feet high to pound the shore. That will create a good deal of beach erosion along the Jersey Shore and South Shore of Long Island. Closer to the city, conditions are not expected to be as bad, however over 1 inch of total rain will occur with wind gusts to 50 mph during the morning. A storm watch also remains in effect until 6 p.m. Saturday, evening with wind gusts up between 25 and 35 mph along Long Island and coastal Connecticut. Winds offshore on the ocean and across the Long Island Sound have reached up to 50 mph. Regardless of whoever gets to torrential downpours or worst winds, this storm will produce scattered power outages especially through Saturday morning. The heavy rain will weaken the ground and strong winds could toppled down trees onto power lines and area roadways. Conditions improve further Sunday salvaging the back half of the weekend, but the day will still have a good deal of clouds.","WPIX 11 New York Nor'easter slams New York area with drenching rain, winds, coastal flooding WPIX 11 New York NEW YORK — An early season Nor'easter will make a mess across the Tri-state region this weekend.

"Doug Criss, CNN","(CNN) The worst flooding in a century has ravaged India's southwestern state of Kerala, killing hundreds and forcing thousands to take shelter in relief camps. Here's how you can help. And here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Michael Cohen &amp; Paul Manafort If this were an episode of ""House of Cards"" or ""The West Wing,"" we would all yell that the writers had jumped the shark. But this is real. Two men close to President Trump became convicted felons yesterday at almost the same time. Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was convicted on eight counts of financial crimes (the jury deadlocked on 10 other counts), while ex-Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts, including tax fraud and campaign finance violations. And, oh yeah, he dropped a bombshell: He admitted in court that he committed some of these crimes ""in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office."" That would be one Donald J. Trump. CNN's Stephen Collinson said the whiplash events of the day had the feel of a TV season finale. And like all good finales, it presented new questions as it answered old ones: How much legal jeopardy is the President in? Will these convictions embolden special counsel Robert Mueller to turn up the heat on Cohen and Manafort in the Russia probe (which you can track here )? Are Democrats guaranteed to impeach Trump if they win the House in November? And what will Trump's Twitter feed look like today? The President said almost nothing about Cohen or Manafort during his rally last night in West Virginia (though the crowd did do -- we kid you not -- a ""lock her up"" chant at the mention of Hillary Clinton's name). Collinson also wrote that the day's events prove that, even in the Trump era, ""truth and facts still matter in America."" Facebook's not playing around in its quest to rid itself of troublesome pages. The social media giant took down another 652 pages that it said were part of coordinated disinformation campaigns in the US, the UK, Latin America and the Middle East. The pages were linked to Iran and Russia. Twitter's doing it, too, getting rid of 284 Iranian-linked accounts that it said were being used for ""coordinated manipulation."" Social media companies are scrambling to protect their platforms ahead of November's midterms to stop a repeat of online meddling that occurred during the 2016 presidential election. An autopsy is planned today on the body found in an Iowa cornfield that's believed to be Mollie Tibbetts. The 20-year-old disappeared a month ago while out for an evening jog. Cristhian Bahena Rivera, an undocumented immigrant, confessed to killing her, police said. He told police he was driving around and saw her, then got out of his car and ran beside her, even after she told him she'd call police. Rivera then claims he blacked out, police said. He led police to her body yesterday. This tragic case is sure to get swamped in politics, as President Trump and other GOP officials railed on the fact that Rivera is in the US illegally. Pope Francis will meet with sex abuse victims during his visit to Ireland this weekend. The Pope's under immense pressure to say and do more about the clergy sex abuse scandal that's rocking the Catholic Church, so it's also ""very possible"" Francis will address the controversy publicly while on the Emerald Isle. Ireland suffered through its own abuse scandal almost a decade ago. This announcement from the Vatican comes days after Francis put out a letter acknowledging the church's failure to act on the abuse in the wake of revelations of decades of abuse by priests in Pennsylvania. Hawaii's prepping for Hurricane Lane, which could make a direct hit on the island chain later this week. Lane's now a Category 5 storm, and meteorologists think it will weaken to a Category 3 before it plows through some Hawaiian Islands from Thursday through Saturday ( you can track the path here ). It's also possible Lane could pass just south of Hawaii, like Hurricane Hector did two weeks ago. This is the latest threat in what's turned into a challenging year for Hawaii, which has suffered through a false missile alarm alert and damage from the Kilauea volcano eruptions.

Sasha Ingber,"Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in all 67 counties on Saturday in preparation for Subtropical Storm Alberto. ""As we continue to monitor Subtropical Storm Alberto's northward path toward Florida, it is critically important that all Florida counties have every available resource to keep families safe and prepare for the torrential rain and severe flooding this storm will bring,"" Scott said in a written statement. He added, ""If any Florida family doesn't have an emergency preparedness plan, now is the time to act."" Alberto is expected to travel across the eastern Gulf of Mexico Saturday night through Monday and approach the northern part of the Gulf where it could make landfall Monday night. Regardless of its path and intensity, Alberto expected to bring heavy rains of more than 10 inches and flash flooding to western Cuba and southern Florida, the National Hurricane Center said. A storm surge watch is in effect along the U.S. gulf coast, from Crystal River to the mouth of the Mississippi River. Water could reach up to 4 feet above ground in some areas if the peak surge occurs during high tide, the agency said on Facebook. A tornado ""or two"" may occur over the Florida Keys and parts of southwestern Florida later Saturday afternoon or evening. On Thursday, the National Hurricane Center caused eyebrows to raise when it estimated a 90 percent chance that a subtropical or tropical cyclone would form in the central or eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico over the weekend. On Friday morning, the agency announced that an area of low pressure in the Caribbean had developed into Subtropical Storm Alberto with maximum sustained winds of 40 miles per hour. By Saturday morning, the storm was gathering strength as it moved north. Between Hurricane Harvey in Texas, Irma in the Caribbean and southeastern U.S. and Maria in Puerto Rico, last year was one of the most active hurricane seasons on record, said The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA does not expect 2018 to be quite as busy, but it could still wreak havoc on human life and infrastructure. One of the most deadly natural disasters in U.S. history occurred in Florida 90 years ago. In 1928, the Okeechobee Hurricane caused the death of at least 2,500 people. ""Nobody seemed to be too much alarmed,"" a survivor told the Sun Sentinel, ""until the water started coming in."" According to the paper, politicians at the time downplayed the storm's severity to keep tourists flocking to Florida as a vacation spot. In a visit to Panama City Beach yesterday, Scott said, ""We have already moved some high water vehicles up to the panhandle from Fish and Wildlife."" Alberto is the first named storm of 2018, and it comes days before the Atlantic hurricane season officially starts on June 1.",The first named storm of the season is expected to bring heavy rains and flash flooding.

It threatens to bring torrential rains and major flooding, the NHC added. Earlier this month areas of the US were devastated by Hurricane Michael, which left at least 27 people dead. Willa is expected to deliver rainfall of up to 46cm (18in) along parts of south-west Mexico, the NHC said on Monday, as it reported that the storm was carrying winds of 256km/h (160mph).

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","A pair of fierce tropical cyclonesCyclone Trevor and Cyclone Veronicaare poised to strike Australia on two coasts within a day of each other, prompting mass evacuations as well as official warnings of severe and dangerous weather.
A state of emergency was declared in Australias Northern Territory this week ahead of Trevors second landfall early Saturday. As the cyclone moved through the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Northern Territory saw its largest evacuation since 1974 during Cyclone Tracy, according to ABC News Australia.
Thousands of people were reportedly evacuated from areas that lay in Trevors path. ABC News reported that some residents of the region, including those on the island Groote Eylandt and the coastal town of Borroloola, had to be airlifted to safety.
Trevor made landfall on the Northern Territory on Saturday at around 11 a.m. local time as a Category 4 cyclone, delivering dangerous winds that were felt more than 200 kilometers from the storms center. ABC News reporter Kristy OBrien was situated in Borroloola when the storm struck the Northern Territory and described the system to the BBC as delivering a guttural howling roar.
The cyclone first made landfall on the Cape York Peninsula earlier this week, which according to the Washington Post resulted in flooding and other destruction in the area. The force of the cyclones first landfall was reportedly equivalent to that of a Category 3 hurricane.
The Bureau of Meteorology Northern Territory said Saturday that Cyclone Trevor had been downgraded to a tropical low system, but added that it would be delivering dangerous conditions and severe weather as it moved further inland.
Tropical Cyclone Veronica, meanwhile, was nearing Western Australias Pilbara coast as of Sunday morning local time, bringing with it powerful and destructive winds and prompting safety warnings from the Bureau of Meteorology.
While the destructive wind and heavy rain are the obvious impacts, this system also has the potential to bring significant storm surge and flooding to the region, the Bureau of Meteorology Western Australia tweeted Saturday evening eastern time. Its worth thinking about what you would do if those threats occur.
The government agency said its been more than four years since twin cyclones have pummeled Australia at once, with the last event occurring in 2015 with Cyclones Marcia and Lam.
As the Washington Post noted, the pair of cyclones arrives as Australia recently experienced its hottest summer on record with a mean national temperature average of 30.8 degrees Celcius in January. As the paper noted, surrounding sea waters saw above normal surface temperatures, a recipe for brewing tropical storms.

Gabriella Borter,"(Reuters) - Large parts of Nebraska and the U.S. Central Plains were underwater on Saturday after a late-winter “bomb cyclone” storm triggered historic flooding along the Missouri and Platte rivers, causing two deaths, tearing apart homes and swallowing roadways. 
The National Weather Service predicted dangerous flooding would continue through the weekend in Nebraska and in south and west central Iowa, particularly along the Missouri River. 
“We’re still in a very widely dispersed and intense flooding situation in the eastern third of Nebraska,” said Mike Wight, a spokesman for the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, in a phone interview. 
Nebraska has had two flood-related fatalities this week, Wight said. One person died at home after failing to evacuate, although the exact cause of death was unclear, authorities said, and the other was swept away while trying to tow a trapped car with his tractor. 
The Missouri River was still rising on Saturday evening, local TV station KMTV reported, with a record crest of more than 47 feet expected early on Tuesday in Brownville, Nebraska, about 70 miles south of Omaha in the eastern corner of the state. 
“We’re looking at 4, 5, 6, 7 feet above the highest it’s ever been,” Wight said. 
The flooding came in the wake of what meteorologists call a “bomb cyclone,” a winter hurricane that forms when the barometric pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. The storm blew from the western Rockies to the Central Plains last week. 
The rising water has reduced stores and homes to rubble and ripped off a long chunk of a highway bridge, according to photos posted on Twitter by Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts. Ranchers posted images on social media of their cattle being dug out of snowdrifts or stranded in fields. 
The flooding has all but blocked access to some small communities along the river, where potable drinking water has become scarce as the flood has contaminated wells, Wight said. 
Ricketts visited several flooded communities on Saturday and wrote on Twitter that he witnessed “unbelievable devastation.” 
“The whole state is pulling together as we respond to and recover from the ongoing #NebraskaFlood! #NebraskaStrong,” the governor tweeted.

Reuters Editorial,"GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions have prevented the Iranian Red Crescent from obtaining any foreign financial aid to assist victims of flooding that has killed at least 70 people and inundated some 1,900 communities, the group said on Sunday. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that Washington was ready to help via the Red Cross and Red Crescent, but accused Iran’s clerical establishment of “mismanagement in urban planning and in emergency preparedness”. 
“No foreign cash help has been given to the Iranian Red Crescent society. With attention to the inhuman American sanctions, there is no way to send this cash assistance,” the Red Crescent said in a statement. 
It said the group had received some non-financial help from abroad which had been distributed to flood victims. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said last week that U.S. sanctions - reimposed after Washington quit a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers - were impeding aid efforts to flood-stricken towns and villages. 
“Blocked equipment includes relief choppers: This isn’t just economic warfare; it’s economic TERRORISM,” he said on Twitter. 
The flood disaster, arising from exceptionally heavy rainfall since March 19, has left aid agencies struggling to cope and seen 86,000 people moved to emergency shelters. 
The government has told citizens, and especially flood-affected farmers, that all losses will be compensated. 
Iran’s state budget is already stretched under U.S. sanctions on energy and banking sectors that have halved its oil exports and restricted access to some revenues abroad. 
Iran acted on Saturday to evacuate more towns and villages threatened by floods after continued rain in the southwest.

Devika  Krishna Kumar,"PORT ST. JOE, Fla. (Reuters) - Rescuers searched for survivors in the rubble of ravaged beach communities on Thursday after Michael, one of the most powerful hurricanes in U.S. history, slammed into the Florida Panhandle, causing widespread flooding and killing at least seven people. Michael struck Florida’s northwest coast near the small town of Mexico Beach on Wednesday afternoon with top sustained winds of 155 miles per hour (250 kph), pushing a wall of seawater inland. The storm tore entire neighborhoods apart, reducing homes and businesses to piles of wood and siding, damaging roads and leaving scenes of devastation that resembled the aftermath of a carpet-bombing operation. U.S. Army personnel used heavy equipment to push a path through debris in Mexico Beach to allow rescuers through to search for trapped residents, survivors or casualties, as Blackhawk helicopters circled overhead. Rescuers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency used dogs, drones and GPS in the search.[L2N1WR22R] “We prepare for the worst and hope for the best. This is obviously the worst,” said Stephanie Palmer, a FEMA firefighter and rescuer from Coral Springs, Florida. Much of downtown Port St. Joe, 12 miles (19 km) east of Mexico Beach, was flooded after Michael snapped boats in two and hurled a large ship onto the shore, residents said. “We had houses that were on one side of the street and now they’re on the other,” said Mayor Bo Patterson, who watched trees fly by his window as he rode out the storm in his home seven blocks from the beach. Patterson estimated 1,000 homes were completely or partially destroyed in his town of 3,500 people. “There were mandatory evacuation orders, but only idiots like us stuck around,” said Jordon Tood, 31, a charter boat captain in Port St. Joe. “This was my sixth (hurricane), so I thought I was prepared.” CHECKING DOOR TO DOOR At Jinks Middle School in Panama City, the storm peeled back part of the gym roof and tore off a wall. A year ago, the school welcomed students and families displaced by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. “I have had employees going to the communities where our kids live, going door to door and checking,” said Principal Britt Smith by phone. “I have been up since 3:30 or 4 a.m. emailing and checking on staff to see if they are safe. So far, everybody seems to be very safe.” With a low barometric pressure recorded at 919 millibars, a measure of a hurricane’s force, Michael was the third strongest storm on record to hit the continental United States, behind only Hurricane Camille on the Mississippi Gulf Coast in 1969 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935 in the Florida Keys. It weakened overnight to a tropical storm. Fast-moving Michael, a Category 4 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale when it came ashore, was about 5 miles (8 km) northwest of Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, at 8 p.m. (0000 GMT), with top sustained winds of 50 miles (80 kph) as it headed for the Atlantic coast, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. It was still toppling trees with 50-mph (80-kph) winds and bringing life-threatening flash flooding to areas of Georgia and Virginia, still recovering from Hurricane Florence as it marched northeast. Parts of Virginia were struck with heavy rains and flash flooding, said Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman for the state Department of Emergency Management. Early on Friday, the center of the storm was set to drift past Virginia Beach back into the Atlantic Ocean, he said. At least seven people were killed in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina from falling trees and other hurricane-related incidents, according to state officials. Emergency services carried out dozens of rescues of people caught in swiftly moving floodwaters in North Carolina. Many of the injured in Florida were taken to hard-hit Panama City, 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Mexico Beach. Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center was treating some, but the hospital evacuated 130 patients as it faced challenges running on generators after the storm knocked out power, ripped off part of its roof and smashed windows, according to a spokesman for the hospital’s owner, HCA Healthcare Inc ( HCA.N ). DAMAGE TO CROPS Almost 1.2 million homes and businesses were without power from Florida to Virginia on Thursday because of the storm. The number of people in emergency shelters was expected to swell to 20,000 across five states by Friday, said Brad Kieserman of the American Red Cross. Brad Rippey, a meteorologist for the U.S. Agriculture Department, said Michael severely damaged cotton, timber, pecans and peanuts, causing estimated liabilities as high as $1.9 billion and affecting up to 3.7 million crop acres (1.5 million hectares). Michael also disrupted energy operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as it approached land, cutting crude oil production by more than 40 percent and natural gas output by nearly one-third as offshore platforms were evacuated.

Rod Nickel,"PANAMA CITY, Fla. (Reuters) - Extremely powerful Hurricane Michael crashed into Florida’s northwestern Panhandle coast on Wednesday, flooding towns and ripping up trees with 155 mile per hour (249 kph) winds and the potential for a devastating storm surge. Michael, which had caught many by surprise with its rapid intensification as it churned north over the Gulf of Mexico, was the most powerful storm ever recorded to hit the Panhandle. It gathered still more strength just before making landfall northwest of the town of Mexico Beach on Wednesday afternoon as a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. Its sustained winds were just 2 mph (3.2 kph) shy of being an extremely rare Category 5. The storm, which caused a major disruption for oil and gas production in the gulf, had the potential to drive sea water levels as high as 14 feet (4.3 meters) above normal in some areas, the National Hurricane Center said. “My God, it’s scary. I didn’t expect all this,” said Bill Manning, 63, a grocery clerk who left his camper van in Panama City to move into a hotel where the power eventually went out. “Panama City, I don’t know if there will be much left.” Only a couple of hours after Michael came ashore, floodwaters already were more than 7-1/2 feet (2.3 meters) deep near Apalachicola, said Ken Graham, director of the National Hurricane Center. In a Facebook Live post, Graham said Michael would sustain hurricane-strength winds as it pushed inland to the Alabama-Georgia border. People in coastal parts of 20 Florida counties had been told to head to safer locations but by Wednesday morning were told it was too late to flee. Much of the affected area is rural and known for small tourist cities, beaches and wildlife reserves, as well as the state capital, Tallahassee, home to about 190,000 people. Even before Michael made full landfall, it was whipping trees with its winds and flooding the town of Port St. Joe. “It feels like you don’t know when the next tree is going to fall on top of you because its blowing so ferociously,” said Port St. Joe Mayor Bo Patterson. “You just don’t know when the next one is going down. It’s very, very scary. We have trees being uprooted, heavy, heavy rain.” Patterson said about 2,500 of the town’s 3,500 people were still there, including about 100 in a beachside area who ignored a mandatory evacuation order. “This happened so quickly, we weren’t exactly prepared,” he said. Brock Long, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), said early evacuation efforts in the area were slow. Michael grew from a tropical storm to a Category 4 hurricane in about 40 hours. “Satellite images of Michael’s evolution on Tuesday night were, in a word, jaw-dropping,” wrote Bob Henson, a meteorologist with weather site Weather Underground. Graham said on Facebook that Michael would be the worst storm in recorded history to hit the Panhandle. “Going back through records to 1851 we can’t find another Cat 4 in this area, so this is unfortunately a historical and incredibly dangerous and life-threatening situation,” he said. GULF OIL DISRUPTED At 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT), the center of the storm was a few miles northwest of Mexico Beach and about 20 miles (30 km) southeast of Panama City. It was heading north-northeast at 14 mph (22 kph) with maximum sustained winds down to 150 mph, the hurricane center said. More than 40 percent of daily crude oil production and nearly a third of natural gas output was lost from offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico wells on Wednesday as platforms were evacuated ahead of Michael. President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for the entire state of Florida, freeing up federal assistance to supplement state and local disaster responses. He was briefed by FEMA’s Long in the Oval Office on preparations. About 162,000 homes and business customers were already without power around mid-afternoon in Florida, Georgia and Alabama, utility companies said. Some 17,000 utility restoration workers were also on call. The region should brace for “major infrastructure damage,” specifically to electricity distribution, wastewater treatment systems and transportation networks, Jeff Byard, associate administrator for FEMA, told reporters on a conference call. The hurricane was expected to gradually weaken as it passed over the southeastern United States, the hurricane center said. Michael was forecast to move inland over the Panhandle on Wednesday afternoon, and across southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia on Wednesday night. Helen Neal, 88, and her husband, J.W. Neal, 87, preferred to take their chances in a hotel rather than stay in their two-story Panama City Beach beachfront house about a mile away. “We just finished renovating and updating,” she said. “We’re kind of nervous. God willing we’ll still have some place.” About 2,500 National Guard troops were deployed to assist with evacuations and storm preparations, and more than 4,000 others were on standby. Graham said Michael represented a “textbook case” of a hurricane system growing stronger as it drew near shore, in contrast to Hurricane Florence, which struck North Carolina last month after weakening in a slow, halting approach. He said the storm would still have hurricane-force winds as it pushed through Florida into Georgia, and tropical storm-force winds when it reaches the Carolinas, which are still reeling from post-Florence flooding. Up to a foot (30 cm) of rainfall was forecast for some areas. Florida Governor Rick Scott, a Republican running for the U.S. Senate in November’s congressional elections, declared a state of emergency in 35 Florida counties. Georgia Governor Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency on Tuesday for 92 counties in his state, and a state of emergency also was announced in North Carolina.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON/WILSON, N.C. (Reuters) - Deadly storm Florence moved across western North Carolina early on Monday and continued to dump rain that has nowhere to go except to swell rivers, flood highways and homes, and threaten more lives as it heads towards Virginia and New England. For the water-logged Carolinas, “the worst is yet to come” as river levels rise to historic levels, said Zach Taylor, a meteorologist with the U.S. National Weather Service. “The soil is soaked and can’t absorb any more rain, so that water has to go somewhere, unfortunately,” he said. “Those rivers are going to start to crest later today and Tuesday and maybe longer.” Flash floods, landslide warnings and “prolonged significant river flooding” throughout the region will continue for the next few days, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. The coastal city of Wilmington remained cut off by high flood waters early on Monday, tens of thousands of homes were damaged and at least 17 deaths were reported in North and South Carolina. Florence, a onetime hurricane that weakened to a tropical depression by Sunday, is expected to decline in force again on Monday before re-intensifying on Tuesday and Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. It has dumped up to 40 inches (100 cm) of rain on North Carolina since Thursday and continued to produce heavy rain over much of North Carolina and eastern South Carolina, the NWS said. An additional 2 to 5 inches of rain is expected with isolated areas of 8 inches possible through Tuesday in the Carolinas and Virginia. “The storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference. More than 900 people were rescued from rising floodwaters and 15,000 remained in shelters in the state, Cooper said. Many rescues took place on swift boats in Wilmington, a coastal city of about 117,000 people on a peninsula between the Cape Fear River and the Atlantic Ocean. Rescue crews negotiated downed trees and power lines to reach stranded residents, Mayor Bill Saffo told WHQR radio. “There are no roads... that are leading into Wilmington that are passable because of the flooding that is taking place now inland,” Saffo said. Officials urged people who had been evacuated to stay away. “Our roads are flooded, there is no access into Wilmington,” New Hanover County Commission Chairman Woody White told a news conference. “We want you home, but you can’t come yet.” UNPRECEDENTED FLOODING In Leland, a low-lying city north of Wilmington, homes and businesses were engulfed by water that rose up to 10 feet (3 meters) over Highway 17 in what local people called unprecedented flooding. The sheriff’s department and volunteers rescued stranded residents by boat, extracting families, infants, the elderly and pets. Gas stations were abandoned and fallen trees made many roads impassable. More than 641,000 homes and businesses were without electricity in North and South Carolina and surrounding states, down from a peak of nearly 1 million. Florence set a state record for rain from a hurricane, surpassing the previous high of 24 inches (61 cm) from Hurricane Floyd which killed 56 people in 1999, said Bryce Link, a meteorologist with private forecasting service DTN Marine Weather. The storm killed at least 11 people in North Carolina, including a mother and child hit by a falling tree, state officials said. Six people died in South Carolina, including four in car accidents and two from carbon monoxide from a portable generator. South Carolina’s governor urged anyone in a flood-prone area to evacuate. “Those rivers in North Carolina that have received heavy rainfall are coming our way,” Governor Henry McMaster told a news conference. “They have not even begun (to crest). But they will. And the question is how high will the water be, and we do not know.” By 5 a.m. on Monday, Florence’s winds had dropped to about 30 miles per hour (45 kph), the NWS said, with weakening forecast over the next 24 hours before intensifying again as an extratropical low-pressure center.The center of the storm was about 125 miles (200 km) west southwest of Roanoke, Virginia and moving northeast at 13 mph (20 kph), the weather service said.

Ernest Scheyder,"CONWAY, S.C. (Reuters) - Flooding across the Carolinas in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which has killed 36 people, was expected to worsen over the next couple of days, forecasters said. Twenty-one flood gauges showed major or moderate flooding early on Thursday in southeast North Carolina and northeast South Carolina, where major waterways, well above their flood stages, were forecast to rise through the weekend before they crest, the National Weather Service said. “People in flood prone areas or near waterways need to remain alert as rivers crest and stay above their banks in coming days,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said in a written statement. “Stay alert, and stay safe.” Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina, and many areas remained cut off by floodwaters and inundated roads. The slow-moving storm, which made landfall on Friday as a Category 1 hurricane, has since been downgraded to a tropical depression and moved into the U.S. northeast. The deaths of at least 36 people have been attributed to the storm, including 27 in North Carolina, eight in South Carolina and one in Virginia. The latest victims were two women in South Carolina who drowned on Tuesday when a sheriff’s department van in which they were riding was swept away by flooding. Some 2,600 people had been rescued by boat or helicopter in North Carolina alone since the storm hit land, according to the state Department of Public Safety. About 10,000 remained in shelters and over 160,000 customers were without power across North Carolina, the department said. As floodwaters continue to rise concerns are growing over the environmental and health dangers lurking in the water. The flooding has caused 21 hog “lagoons,” which store manure from pig farms, to overflow, creating a risk the standing water will be contaminated with bacteria like salmonella, according to the state’s Department of Environmental Quality. North Carolina is one of the leading hog-producing states in the country. Several sewer systems in the region have also released untreated or partly treated sewage and storm water into waterways over the last week, local media reported. U.S. President Donald Trump warned South Carolina that “water is coming your way” as he toured the area on Wednesday. “Now it looks nice, but it’s really the calm before the storm,” Trump said. Experts have said that climate change has increased the likelihood of more massive, sluggish storms like Florence, capable of dropping record amounts of rain and touching off catastrophic flooding.

Harriet McLeod,"CHARLESTON, S.C./RALEIGH, N.C. (Reuters) - Emergency management officials in Georgetown, South Carolina, were optimistic on Thursday that their port community would see less flooding than previously expected in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence. Florence, which crashed ashore two weeks ago as a Category 1 hurricane and killed 46 people in three states, has since dissipated, but the storm’s torrential rainfall threatens to swamp Georgetown as it drains toward the ocean. Forecasts now show floodwaters rising two to four feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters) in Georgetown, which sits at the confluence of the Waccamaw, Great Pee Dee and Sampit rivers about 30 miles (50 km) south of Myrtle Beach, considerably lower than initially feared. “While we’re optimistic that things are looking better to some degree... there will be increased levels of water in some areas,” Georgetown County Administrator Sel Hemingway said on Wednesday. “The awareness level needs to be elevated.” Officials were still urging 6,000 to 8,000 residents to leave their homes, with rivers expected to crest in Georgetown on Friday and remain above flood stage for four or five days. The North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies said preliminary research suggests that Florence was among the rainiest storms in the United States in some 70 years. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said the river flooding caused by Florence, which dropped nearly 20 inches (50 cm) of rain in some places in the state, is something his state has not had to cope with before. ‘FULL BATTLE MODE’ “This is unprecedented and we are still in full battle mode,” McMaster said at a press briefing on Wednesday at Emergency Management Division headquarters in Columbia, the state capital. Flooding has destroyed 46 homes in the state, significantly damaged more than 1,000 and forced 11,000 people to flee their homes, including 3,000 in Georgetown, EMD Director Kim Stenson said Wednesday. In Conway County, where the Waccamaw was already well above flood stage, Santee Cooper, South Carolina’s state-owned electric and water utility, said floodwaters stopped rising before inundating a pond that holds more than 200,000 tons of toxic coal ash. “The river’s rise has slowed and we think it’s cresting today,” utility spokeswoman Mollie Gore said from the site, where 115 workers had shored up the dam around the pond. “We still have a foot between the top of the river and the top of the dam.” Santee Cooper said it has removed more than 1 million tons of coal ash, which can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife, from the site in the past few years. Some one to two inches of rain moving into the central and western parts of the state in a next day or two will prolong the flooding, said meteorologist Rich Otto of the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. Crews worked to erect temporary dams on either side of U.S. Highway 17, the main coastal route through the area, and National Guard engineers were installing a floating bridge at Georgetown in case the highway is washed out at the river.

Michael Page,"Saturday will be a very stormy day across New England, with numerous angles to focus on. TIMING The storm will arrive first in Southern New England before dawn, before spreading into Northern New England over the course of the morning. The storm will continue through the day, pulling away late Saturday night and early Sunday morning. RAINFALL Saturday is basically a washout, aside from a few dry hours during the morning in Northern New England. Rainfall will be heaviest in parts of Eastern New England, from Rhode Island into parts of Southeastern Massachusetts. Expect a widespread 1- to 2-inches. FLOODING Street flooding will be a problem during the day with so many leaves and pine needles blocking storm drains. If possible, clear the drains in front of your house. STRONG WINDS Many of those leaves will be blown down by powerful winds blowing in off of the water. Through the interior, expect gusts 30 to 40 mph. Of course, in hilly towns, there will be some gusts closer to 50 mph. Along the coast, from Maine to the Seacoast of New Hampshire, and into Eastern Massachusetts, expect gusts around 50 mph. Gusts will be closer to 60 mph for parts of Cape Cod, the Islands, and the South Coast. Isolated power outages are likely. COASTAL FLOODING The strong onshore winds, combined with astronomically high tides following this week’s full moon and offshore waves 10 to 20 feet, will result in areas of minor coastal flooding during the Saturday afternoon high tide. That happens around 1:40 p.m. in many towns. Extreme Weather Photos: Flash Flooding in France MOUNTAIN SNOW As the storm arrives in Northern New England, the precipitation will start as a wintry mix and snow. In the high terrain of Western New England, including parts of the Berkshires, expect a dusting of one inch before a switch to rain. Along the Greens and in the Northeast Kingdom, as well as in the Whites, Central New Hampshire, and the mountains of Northern and Western Maine, expect a widespread 1-to-3-inches of snow. The highest peaks in those areas, like Mount Washington, will get six inches or more in some cases. SUNDAY AND BEYOND While the storm pulls away on Sunday, we’ll still be left with mostly cloudy skies and a few spotty showers, especially during the morning. Temperatures will be in the 50s. A separate storm will clip New England with some showers on Monday, but it still looks like we can dry out closer to Halloween as temperatures get closer to, and even a bit above, average.","NECN Weekend Nor'easter's Impact: Heavy Rain, Strong Winds, Flooding, Snow NECN Saturday will be a very stormy day across New England, with numerous angles to focus on.

OLGA R. RODRIGUEZ / AP,"SAN FRANCISCO — Flash flooding hit a wildfire-scarred area of Northern California on Thursday, forcing officials to quickly deploy swift water rescue teams to save people stranded in vehicles after a downpour near the Paradise area, officials said. It was not clear how many people were trapped, but authorities received reports of flooding on roads and of downed trees and utility poles. “The roots and the bottoms of the utility poles are just kind of swimming,” said Rick Carhart, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “It rained really hard in a short amount of time and this whole thing came up really quickly.” The storm brought 1½ inches of rain in an hour, toppling trees and trapping motorists in flooded roads downstream, said National Weather Service meteorologist Craig Shoemaker. “This is heavy rain in a short period of time and that’s the worst thing that can happen in the burn scar,” he said. The Butte County Sheriff’s Department ordered evacuations but could not say how many people were affected. The water rescues were in an area of Chico, which is downhill from Paradise, and a city where many of the wildfire evacuees have been staying since the town of 27,000 was destroyed just three weeks ago by a deadly wildfire. Butte County Sheriff’s Sgt. Brad Meyer told television stations KHSL/KNVN in Chico that about a dozen homes were affected and rafts were being used to rescue people from water that was a couple of feet deep. “It is serious. The water is coming up so we want to make sure we get everybody out that we can,” Meyer told the station. Emergency response crews earlier cleared a tree that toppled in the town of Magalia, but no other reports of damage had been received after an inch of rain fell overnight in the burn zone about 140 miles (225 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco. Paradise has been under mandatory evacuation orders for nearly three weeks since a wildfire killed at least 88 people and destroyed nearly 14,000 homes. Residents could begin returning early next week, but only if the storm doesn’t hinder efforts to clear roads and restore power, said Sheriff Kory Honea. No major problems were reported in burn zones in Southern California early Thursday, but numerous traffic accidents occurred on slick Los Angeles-area freeways and most vehicles traveling in the mountains were ordered to put chains on their tires. On the coast near Big Sur, the California Department of Transportation closed a 12-mile (19-kilometer) stretch of Highway 1 because of potential instability. The scenic route perched between towering mountainsides and the ocean has been dogged by slides since 2016. But the one that hit in May 2017 was monumental, requiring extensive work to rebuild the highway. In Southern California, residents were urged to voluntarily evacuate a string of neighborhoods about 45 miles (70 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles along a flank of the Santa Ana Mountains where a fire burned thousands of acres last summer. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for a small section of the city of Lake Elsinore beneath a burn zone. West of Los Angeles, rain fell heavily at times in vast areas burned by fires this month and last December — an area where there are strong memories of a January downpour that unleashed devastating debris flows through the community of Montecito that killed 21 people and left two missing. In the zone that burned this month, the city of Malibu warned of rocks falling on canyon roads and Pepperdine University closed its campus. The weather service also issued a backcountry avalanche warning for most of the central Sierra, including the Lake Tahoe area. ___ Associated Press writers Janie Har in San Francisco, Christopher Weber and John Antczak in Los Angeles, and Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada contributed to this report.

"Claire Lower on Skillet, shared by Claire Lower to Lifehacker","When planning your Thanksgiving turkey situation, you most likely focus on the recipe, and dont give a ton of thought to what happens after you remove the glorious, perfectly-roasted bird from the oven. Obviously you are going to eat it, but a turkey must be carved before it can be consumed, and for that, you need a big ol cutting board. In a perfect world, wed all own beautiful, huge, cutting boards carved from free-range trees, Read more Read Since most people do not routinely make and consume 20-pound birds on the reg, most kitchens do not contain cutting boards that are equipped for such a task. Theres no need to overthink it, but there are a few features you should look for when choosing a turkey-carving board: Get a big one: Most common kitchen cutting boards are simply not big enough for a turkey, which can make carving awkward and unsafe. Your turkey should be able to fully fit on the board, with a few inches of work room on each side. Around 20 inches long and 15 inches wide should be large enough to accommodate pretty much any large piece of meat. Get a wood one: Glass cutting boards are knife-dulling garbage and should never be used for anything, especially not your turkey. Nice, hard woodslike maple or teakare not only nice to your knives, theyre naturally anti-microbial. Unlike plastic, which gets dinged up pretty quickly by slicing and dicinga wood cutting board is made to last, and can be sanded down if it gets too scratched up for your liking. Make some mods: Slippage and spillage are two things you have to worry about when carving a giant bird, so if you see a board that comes with grip pads on the bottom and juice troughs around the edge, go ahead and grab it. If yours doesnt, dont freak out, you can keep your board steady with a damp kitchen towel or piece of shelf liner underneath, and catch any runaway juice by placing the board in a rimmed baking sheet. Also of great importance: make sure you let that turkey rest before carving (at least half an hour, maybe 45 minutes for truly big boys) so the juices can redistribute and dont come flooding out the moment you slice into it. (A juicy turkey is a happy turkey, and the prettiest carving job in the world wont matter if you lose the juice.)","Photo: Alison Marras ( Unsplash ) When planning your Thanksgiving turkey situation, you most likely focus on the recipe, and don’t give a ton of thought to what happens after you remove the glorious, perfectly-roasted bird from the oven.

Russell Brandom,"With great automation comes great responsibility. You may love your smart thermostat and door lock, but as long as they’re on the open network, they’re targets for all manner of digital attacks. And because the devices are smaller and simpler, they don’t have nearly the protection of your laptop or phone. The result is an unsettling thought: as you add more gadgetry, you’re also adding more ways for hackers to break in. It’s a persistent vulnerability, and it’s common knowledge in the digital security world. For years, the Defcon conference has hosted an IoT Village entirely devoted to cracking internet of things devices. The 2014 event featured a router-hacking contest that turned up 15 major vulnerabilities in a matter of hours. For researchers, finding these flaws is so easy, it’s a sport. It’s not all bad news. Your thermostat doesn’t make a very attractive target to most hackers. (Unlike your phone or computer, there isn’t much monetizable information on it.) The most likely threat is someone trying to enlist it in a Mirai-style botnet — which would be bad, but only cost you whatever extra power the device ended up burning. Still, the net effect of tens of thousands of vulnerable IoT gadgets flooding on the market can be significant, and it’s worth it to make sure you’re not part of the problem. The best thing you can do is pay for it: higher-end devices almost always have better security protocols, even if there’s no clear certification to look for just yet. Beyond that, make sure everything you own is getting regular patches — and that you’re installing them. If you want to get really serious, you can get a smart router to isolate all your IoT devices on a separate network, and monitor everything for signs of a compromise. That will put you ahead of 99 percent of consumers, and give you a fighting chance if anyone decides they want to take over your fancy new thermostat.","You may love your smart thermostat and door lock, but as long as they’re on an open network, they’re targets for all manner of digital attacks.",2018-08-27T13:01:32Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",The Home of the Future is a security challenge,https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17779082/home-future-grant-imahara-security-internet-of-things,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X5YctCFqbX_8bJmC-ENCHwf0tQw=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12551405/jbareham_180627_2645_0039_crop.jpg,the-verge,The Verge,flooding,1
"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","For the third time in two weeks, a powerful nor’easter is bearing down on the the Boston area. For the third time this winter, we’re using the term bomb cyclone to describe the storm. But neither of those facts are what’s got meteorologists glued to their radar maps today. They’re watching the snow. There’s going to be a lot of it. “This one’s main impact is going to be snow,” NWS meteorologist Kim Buttrick told the Associated Press of the storm. A blizzard warning is in effect for coastal Massachusetts, where total snowfall accumulations of up to nearly two feet are expected. The snow is is falling fast, at rates of up to 1-3 inches per hour, which, combined with wind gusts veering well into tropical storm-force territory, sets the stage or whiteout conditions that could make travel “very dangerous,” the National Weather Service warns. In Boston proper, more modest snowfall totals of 17 to 18 inches are expected. That’s still no fun to dig your car out of, mind you. Boston is no stranger to snowy winters. ““We don’t see snowfall rates of 1-3 inches per hour every day in New England, but neither are they unheard of,” Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson told Earther via email. “Likewise, the expected accumulations are impressive but not necessarily record-smashing.” But combined with the fact that this is the third nor’easter the region has seen in the past few weeks, and combined with the fact that meteorologists are already talking about a potential fourth, March 2018 is almost certainly going down as one of the snowiest in Boston’s history. “We’re definitely seeing an anomalous event for this time of the year with respect to snowfall,” meteorologist Ed Vallee told Earther, noting that Boston’s number one snowstorm for March and April, on April Fool’s Day ‘97, saw about 22 inches of snow. Vallee told Earther that the city has already seen seven inches of snow this month and that he’d add “at least another foot” after today’s storm. “Especially late in the winter, it often takes a highly dynamic system to chill the atmosphere to snow-producing temperatures, and those strong dynamics can also lead to very heavy snowfall rates,” Henson said. So let’s talk about those dynamics a bit. Henson told Earther the volley of storms we’ve seen in recent weeks is likely connected to a record strong phase of the Madden-Julien Oscillation, which NOAA describes as “a major fluctuation in tropical circulation and rainfall that moves eastward along the equator and circles the entire globe in a span of 30–60 days on average.” This atmospheric disturbance is distinct from the El Nino Southern Oscillation, which is stationary in the tropical Pacific. As Henson explained, a strongly active MJO “fed into a split of the stratospheric polar vortex in February” that’s still having atmospheric reverberations, including the recent “ Beast from the East ” cold outbreak over Europe and record cold in Siberia. The MJO is also a strong contributor to Arctic air outbreaks across the central and eastern U.S., according to NOAA. In addition to the legacy of the MJO, another atmospheric pattern called the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) veered into record low territory earlier this month. A negative NAO is characterized by a ridge of high pressure air over Greenland, something meteorologists call the Greenland block. Vallee explained that the Greenland block leads to a trough of low pressure further south and west. “That’s a very conducive pattern for nor’easters to form,” he said, noting that the Greenland block not only enhances the pressure gradient fueling these storms, but can slow their progress out to sea. The nor’easter that drove massive coastal flooding in Boston at the beginning of the month was slow to get out of the city’s way thanks to the Greenland block, Weather Underground reported at the time. This time around, at least, the coastal flooding risk for Massachusetts is much fairly low. Weather Underground reports that the strongest winds from today’s nor’easter will be further offshore, with peak land gusts of about 60 miles per hour forecast to blow across Cape Cod and Nantucket. This storm, unlike its predecessors, also happens to coincide with some of the lowest astronomical tides of the month. So, while Massachusetts will wind up buried in snow today, at least folks’ basements won’t be flooding, too? Small miracles, I guess.","For the third time in two weeks, a powerful nor’easter is bearing down on the the Boston area.

Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON/FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (Reuters) - Residents of the Carolinas struggled to return to normalcy on Tuesday after taking a beating from Hurricane Florence, but their efforts were hindered by standing water and additional flooding expected from already swollen rivers. At least 32 people have been killed since Florence came ashore as a hurricane on Friday, including 25 in North Carolina and six in South Carolina. One person was killed when Florence spawned at least 16 tornadoes on Monday in Virginia, where dozens of buildings were destroyed, the National Weather Service reported. Waterways were expected to keep rising on Tuesday in places like Fayetteville, North Carolina, a city of 200,000 in the southern part of the state, according to the weather service, hampering efforts to restore power, clear roads and return to homes. More than 1,100 roads were still closed across North Carolina, Governor Roy Cooper said on Tuesday, including portions of Interstates 40 and 95. Sixteen rivers in the state have reached major flood stages, with three more expected to peak in the next two days, he said. “Road conditions are starting to improve in some parts of our state, but rising creeks, streams and rivers continue to make travel unsafe,” he said in a news conference. Officials said residents should not attempt to return to the counties along the state’s coast around Wilmington yet due to ongoing risk of flooding. The storm dumped more than 8 trillion gallons (30 trillion liters) of rain on North Carolina, the weather service said. On Tuesday, the storm’s remnants were continuing to soak the mid-Atlantic region and southern New England with heavy rain. Property damage from the storm is expected to come to $17 billion to $22 billion, the risk management firm Moody’s Analytics said. Further flooding could push up that figure. The risk modeling agency Air Worldwide on Tuesday said insured losses from Florence’s winds and storm surge will range from $1.7 billion to $4.6 billion. Those figures do not include losses from continuing flooding. President Donald Trump is expected to travel to the region on Wednesday, CNN and local news media reported. ROAD CONDITIONS ‘STILL CHANGING’ Fire and rescue crews were waiting to go into many areas to assist with structural damage after Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain on the state since Thursday. “Road conditions are still changing,” the North Carolina Department of Transportation wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. “What’s open now may become impassable.” Thousands of rescues have taken place in the Carolinas, and more than 650 people were taken to safety in and around Wilmington, North Carolina, said Barbi Baker, a spokeswoman for New Hanover County. The coastal city took a direct hit when Hurricane Florence came ashore and has been largely cut off since then due to storm surges and flooding from the Cape Fear River. A portion of a motel collapsed from the weight of water, which made only the roof of the Starlite Motel visible in Spring Lake in Cumberland County, said Sherita Brooks of the county’s Division of Social Services. More than 347,000 customers, mostly in the Carolinas, were without power on Tuesday morning, according to power companies, down from a peak of nearly 1 million outages. North Carolina’s Emergency Management department has opened four mass feeding kitchens and has plans to open four more shortly. Gasoline shortages were a problem. In Wilmington, dozens of cars lined up for fuel at a Kangaroo Express service station. “It is ridiculous that we don’t have enough fuel supplies back in this area,” Stephanie Schauer, 39, a contractor, said as she waited her turn at the gas pump. “It’s been days since the storm.” Additional reporting by Bernie Woodall in Miami; Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee: Jessica Resnick-Ault and Barbara Goldberg in New York; Anna Mehler Paperny in North Carolina; and Rich McKay in Atlanta; Writing by Brendan O'Brien and Bill Trott; Editing by Janet Lawrence and Jonathan Oatis","Residents of the Carolinas struggled to return to normalcy on Tuesday after taking a beating from Hurricane Florence, but their efforts were hindered by standing water and additional flooding expected from already swollen rivers.",2018-09-18T16:44:03Z,"{'id': 'reuters', 'name': 'Reuters'}",Travel snarled by flooding as Carolinas size up Florence's damage,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-florence/travel-snarled-by-flooding-as-carolinas-size-up-florences-damage-idUSKCN1LX126,https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180918&t=2&i=1305636267&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEE8H1DJ,reuters,Reuters,flooding,1
Ernest Scheyder,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Florence trudged inland on Saturday, flooding rivers and towns, toppling trees and cutting power to nearly a million homes and businesses as it dumped huge amounts of rain on North and South Carolina, where five people have died. Florence diminished from hurricane strength as it came ashore on Friday, but forecasters said the 350-mile-wide storm’s (560 km) slow progress across the two states could leave much of the region under water in the coming days. The National Hurricane Center said the storm would dump as much as 30 to 40 inches (76-102 cm) of rain on the southeastern coast of North Carolina and part of northeastern South Carolina, as well as up to 10 inches (25 cm) in southwestern Virginia. “This storm is relentless and excruciating,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told CNN late on Friday. “There is probably not a county or a person that will not be affected in some way by this very massive and violent storm.” At 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT), the hurricane center said Florence had maximum sustained winds near 50 miles per hour (80 km per hour) and continued to produce catastrophic flooding in the Carolinas. It said it was located about 35 miles (55 km) west of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and forecasters predicted a slow westward march. “Gradual weakening is forecast while Florence moves farther inland during the next couple of days, and it is expected to weaken to a tropical depression” by Saturday night, the center said in a bulletin. GRAPHIC-Hurricane Florence to pummel U.S. Southeast for days - tmsnrt.rs/2oZFKSb On Thursday, Florence was a Category 3 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale with 120-mph winds (193 km). It was downgraded to Category 1 before coming ashore on Friday near Wrightsville Beach close to Wilmington, North Carolina. The hurricane center downgraded Florence to a tropical storm later in the day. About 10 million people could be affected by the storm. A mother and baby were killed when a tree fell on their home in Wilmington. The child’s injured father was hospitalized. In Pender County, a woman died of a heart attack. Paramedics trying to reach her were blocked by debris. Two people died in Lenoir County. A 78-year-old man was electrocuted attempting to connect extension cords while another man died when he was blown down by high winds while checking on his hunting dogs, a county spokesman said. In New Bern, at the confluence of the Neuse and Trent rivers in North Carolina, the storm surge overwhelmed the town of 30,000. Officials in New Bern, which dates to the early 18th century, said more than 100 people were rescued from floods and the downtown are was under water by Friday afternoon. A spokesman for the town said between 60 and 75 people were awaiting rescue on Saturday morning. New Bern’s mayor told CNN that 4,200 homes were damaged in the city. Resident Jay Manning said he and his wife watched with alarm as water filled the street. “We moved all the furniture up in case the water comes in but the water seems to be staying at the edge of the driveway,” he said, adding that if the wind picks up and the rain keeps coming, that could change. “My wife’s in a panic right now.” Dan Eudy said he and his brother were awakened on Thursday night by the sound of a boat ramming against his front porch. Eudy said his family stayed in their home partly to protect their house. “And we had no belief it would be as significant an event as it was,” he said. “This is a 500- or 1,000-year event.” Authorities in North Carolina said nearly 814,000 customers were without power. The figure for South Carolina was 170,000 customers. More than 22,600 people in North Carolina were housed in 150 shelters statewide, including schools, churches and Wake Forest University’s basketball arena. In South Carolina there were 7,000 people staying in shelters, according to the state’s emergency management office. Atlantic Beach on North Carolina’s Outer Banks islands had already received 30 inches (72 cm) of rain, the U.S. Geological Survey said, while more than 25 inches (63 cm) have fallen in the Newport, Morehead City area since Thursday. The White House on Saturday said President Donald Trump had approved making federal funding available in some counties. Trump, who spoke with state and local officials on Friday, plans a visit to the region next week. Florence is expected to turn west and then north moving through the Carolinas and the Ohio Valley by Monday, the hurricane center said.

Hilary Hanson,"City officials in Framingham, Massachusetts, are under fire from animal lovers after killing beavers they say were causing a public safety hazard. The beavers crime? Building dams, which had combined with excessive rainfall to create hazardous flooding conditions. The City of Framingham regrets that it was placed into a set of circumstances that resulted in the demise of the beavers, the city said in a statement posted on Facebook. The statement elaborated on the flood conditions that had occurred over the past few weeks, noting that officials had been scrambling to keep a 100-year-old bridge from washing out and taking gas, water and sewer lines with it. Additionally, rising water had started making local roadways dangerous to traverse, Framingham spokeswoman Kelly McFalls told HuffPost in an email. Because of the excessive rain and dams, water rose more than four feet above its normal elevation and was washing over the roadway and beginning to undermine the retaining walls, she said. This flooding created dangerous driving conditions for anyone traveling that route, specifically the 15 school buses that traverse that route twice daily. At this same time, residents yards and basements also were becoming flooded. The city characterized itself as having no choice but to trap and remove the beavers, saying that efforts to pump water out of flooded areas had become too costly and that conditions were too severe to use a deterrent device known as a Beaver Deceiver. Since trappers are prohibited by Massachusetts law from relocating beavers, trapped animals are most often euthanized, according to the statement. The citys explanation, however, did not satisfy critics who accused officials of needlessly killing the animals. The statement garnered a slew of negative comments on social media, and local Conservation Commission administrator Robert McArthur told Boston.com earlier this week that he had received numerous calls and emails from residents who didnt want to see the beavers dead. The plan also received sharp criticism from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, both of which had urged officials to not go through with the cull. We have urged the City to use humane, cost-effective, and long-term solutions such as waterflow devices instead. Trapping is a not an effective strategy to reduce conflicts. https://t.co/gqUYtxEzOw — MSPCA Advocacy (@MSPCAAdvocacy) December 12, 2018 The MSPCA had slammed the plan as cruel and potentially ineffective, telling Boston.com that destroying beavers just creates vacant territory for new beavers to move in.

Andrew Freedman,"From late 1861 through early 1862, a megaflood of historic proportions put large parts of the state of California underwater. The state's Central Valley, which is now one of the most productive agricultural ares in the country, became a vast inland lake. The city of Sacramento, which sits at the intersection of the American and Sacramento rivers, flooded, and remained under water for months. According to one account, one-quarter of the state's 800,000 cattle drowned in the flooding, and one-third of the state's property was destroyed. SEE ALSO: Parade of storms threatens to prolong California dam crisis The "" Great Flood"" of 1861 to 1862 is becoming more likely to reoccur as the climate warms, a new study finds. A study published Monday in Nature Climate Change found that despite an overall small change in the state's average yearly precipitation throughout the 20th century and in projections for the future, there may be huge and highly consequential changes in precipitation extremes within seasons, some of which have already begun to buffet the state. ""In practical terms, this means that what is today considered to be the '200-year flood '—an event that would overwhelm the vast majority of California’s flood defenses and water infrastructure —will become the '40-50 year flood' in the coming decades,"" lead author Daniel Swain, a climate researcher at the University of California at Los Angeles wrote in a blog post on Monday. Relative change (in percent) in extremely wet seasons (top), extremely dry seasons (middle), and year-to-year “whiplash” (bottom) by 2070-2100 in Southern California. Image: Swain et al. 2018. In an interview, Swain said he was surprised how sharply the risk of another ""Great Flood"" event increased just over the next 40 years, according to the numerous computer model simulations used in the study. The study found that between 2018 and 2060, California's major urban areas, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, ""are more likely than not"" to experience at least one extremely severe storm sequence that is similar in magnitude to the Great Flood. This is a three-fold increase in the risk of such a devastating event. Swain said this result “is pretty eyebrow-raising, certainly to me, it and may raise some eyebrows in the emergency planning community as well.” That flood was the result of an unrelenting series of storms that channeled a firehose of moisture off the Pacific Ocean, known as ""atmospheric river"" weather systems. The study makes for sobering reading, because it shows how sharply the risk of both extremely wet and dry seasons is increasing, along with what the authors term ""precipitation whiplash"" as the climate oscillates between these two extremes. Previous studies, Swain said, had focused on how annual average precipitation may change as the climate warms, but the relatively small amount of change at this timescale is effectively masking far more consequential trends at shorter timescales. “That seems to be masking very significant changes in the character of precipitation” and precipitation extremes, Swain said. The researchers utilized computer models to simulate precipitation trends in California during the remainder of the 21st century, studying results from simulations including the ""business as usual"" course of greenhouse gas emissions as well as control runs that did not include an increase in global warming pollutants. Increasing frequency of precipitation extremes in California. Image: Ucla/daniel swain. One of the more unique insights the study provides is the likelihood that there will be more frequent and drastic year-to-year precipitation shifts, much like the one that occurred between a record drought that lasted from about 2012 to 2016, and was followed by a record wet winter in parts of California during the winter of 2016 to 2017. The wet winter peaked with the failure of a spillway at the Oroville Dam in 2017, which forced about 250,000 people to evacuate. The study projects a 25 to 100 percent increase in such precipitation whiplash events during the coming years. As the study notes, California's water infrastructure is simply not prepared for such an escalation in extreme events. The study states: Few of the dams, levees and canals that currently protect millions living in California’s flood plains and facilitate the movement of water from Sierra Nevada watersheds to coastal cities have been tested by a deluge as severe as the extraordinary 1861–1862 storm sequence —a repeat of which would probably lead to considerable loss of life and economic damages approaching a trillion dollars. The study is consistent with other findings on how precipitation extremes are already changing as the climate warms, but it may actually underestimate the severity of these changes for California, said Kevin Trenberth, a senior researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. Trenberth was not involved in the new study. In general, a warmer world will provide storms with more moisture to work with, as the air's capacity to hold water vapor and the evaporation rates from the land and sea all increase. There's already observational evidence showing this is taking place. But this new study serves as a warning that coming decades will bring a wild ride from one extreme to the next, challenging even our sturdiest, most modern infrastructure.

Jolyn Rosa,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Lane threatened to drench Hawaii’s most populated island of Oahu on Saturday, after lingering just south of the U.S. state and unleashing torrential rains and flooding on the Big Island, weather and civil defense officials said. Hawaii was spared a direct hit by a major hurricane as Lane, once a monster tempest, weakened on Friday into a tropical storm with sustained winds of 65 miles per hour (100 kph). Early on Saturday it remained south of Hawaii and was moving slowly north-northwest through the Pacific Ocean, its outer rain bands producing severe flooding across parts of the islands. “Regardless of the storm’s track, life threatening flash flooding, along with locally strong winds and possible isolated tornadoes, will continue to extend far beyond the center’s location,” the National Weather Service’s Honolulu office said. “Do not focus on the exact forecast track or intensity of Lane.” Hawaii’s Big Island, properly called the island of Hawaii, was hard hit on Friday and much of it remained vulnerable to flash floods, the weather service said. Hilo, the Big Island’s largest community, received more than 31 inches (79 cm) of rain from Wednesday through Friday, its largest three-day total since records began in 1949. Some areas received more than 45 inches, the weather service said. Police and emergency crews conducted numerous rescues of people stranded in vehicles and homes by high water on Friday. On Saturday, Lane was creeping north-northwest at 3 mph (5 km/h), NWS meteorologist Chevy Chevalier said by phone. It was expected to turn to the west, away from Hawaii, later on Saturday, he said. “We have to get this thing out of here, and the biggest reason is the Big Island doesn’t need any more rain,” he said. NO INJURIES REPORTED No injuries were reported, but several structures were destroyed on the Big Island, said Melissa Dye, an NWS spokeswoman in Honolulu. She said two Hilo-area neighborhoods were evacuated. “I’ve never seen this, so much devastation of the river flowing down off of Komohana,” said one long-time Hilo resident, Tracy Pacheco. “I just came from Pahale Park, and there’s no park.” Oahu, home to the state capital of Honolulu and to 70 percent of Hawaii’s 1.4 million residents, could receive heavy rain later on Saturday if the storm lingers south of the state, forecasters said. More than 1,100 people stayed in emergency shelters in the city on Friday, according to its mayor, Kirk Caldwell. He told the Weather Channel that Honolulu is vulnerable to floods and mudslides because it is partly ringed by mountains. “We have asked our residents in these areas where they know it floods to be ready to leave,” Caldwell said on Friday. Forecasts predicted that Lane, which peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with top sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph) earlier in the week while far from Hawaii, will diminish into a tropical depression by early on Sunday. New Yorker Rigo Pagoada, 43, who was on vacation on Oahu with his family, said he felt lucky it had been largely spared, but that it was sad to see what had happened on the Big Island. “We’ve been very fortunate,” Pagoada said. Hawaii’s major airports stayed open during the storm, though some flights were canceled at Honolulu’s main airport and at Kahului Airport on Maui. Travelers should expect congestion at the airports through the weekend as a result, Hawaii Governor David Ige said.

Harriet McLeod,"CHARLESTON, S.C./RALEIGH, N.C. (Reuters) - The port city of Georgetown, South Carolina braced on Wednesday for flooding touched off by Hurricane Florence, as emergency management officials urged residents to evacuate despite forecasts that scaled back the threat of 10-foot high water. Florence, which crashed ashore two weeks ago as a Category 1 hurricane and killed 46 people in three states, has since dissipated, but the storm’s torrential rainfall threatens to swamp the Georgetown as it drains toward the ocean. Forecasts now show floodwaters rising 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters) in Georgetown, which sits at the confluence of the Waccamaw, Great Pee Dee and Sampit rivers about 30 miles (50 km) south of Myrtle Beach, considerably lower than initially feared. “We’re encouraging people not to let their guard down though, because just as quickly as forecasts change in our favor, they can change against us,” said Jackie Broach-Akers, a spokeswoman for the Georgetown County Emergency Management Operations Center. Despite bright sun on Wednesday, Broach-Akers said officials were urging 6,000 to 8,000 residents to leave their homes, with rivers expected to crest in Georgetown on Friday morning and remain above flood stage for four or five days. “(The sunshine) makes it harder to believe that something bad is right around the corner,” she said. The North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies said preliminary research suggests that Florence was among the rainiest storms to hit the United States in some 70 years. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said the river flooding caused by Florence, which dropped nearly 20 inches (50 cm) of rain in some places in the state, is something his state has not had to cope with before. ‘FULL BATTLE MODE’ “This is unprecedented and we are still in full battle mode,” McMaster said at a press briefing on Wednesday at Emergency Management Division headquarters in Columbia, the state capital. Flooding has already destroyed 46 homes in the state, significantly damaged more than 1,000 and forced 11,000 people to flee their homes, including 3,000 in Georgetown, EMD Director Kim Stenson told reporters. In Conway County, where the Waccamaw was already well above flood stage, South Carolina’s state-owned electric and water utility, said floodwaters stopped rising before inundating a pond that holds more than 200,000 tons of toxic coal ash. “The river’s rise has slowed and we think it’s cresting today,” utility spokeswoman Mollie Gore said from the site, where 115 workers had shored up the dam around the pond. “We still have a foot between the top of the river and the top of the dam.” Santee Cooper said it has removed more than 1 million tons of coal ash, which can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife, from the site in the past few years. The Waccamaw was expected to crest by late Thursday at 21.2 to 26.4. feet in the upriver communities of Conway and Bucksport, the National Weather Service Southeast River Forecast Center in Atlanta said. “This is going to be a very long flooding event,” said John Atwell, a weather service hydrologist. Some 1 to 2 inches of rain moving into the central and western parts of the state in a next day or two will prolong the flooding, said meteorologist Rich Otto of the weather service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. “Any additional rainfall is just going to filter into those rivers,” Otto said. Crews worked to erect temporary dams on either side of U.S. Highway 17, the main coastal route through the area, and National Guard engineers were installing a floating bridge at Georgetown in case the highway is washed out at the river.

Anna Mehler Paperny,"KINSTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Flooding from rain-swollen rivers was expected to worsen across the Carolinas on Thursday and the next couple of days in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which killed 36 people in three states, forecasters said. Twenty flood gauges showed some level of flooding in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, where some major waterways, well above their flood stages, were expected to rise through the weekend before they crest, the National Weather Service said. “People in flood prone areas or near waterways need to remain alert as rivers crest and stay above their banks in coming days,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said in a written statement. “Stay alert and stay safe.” Touring the area on Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump warned South Carolina that “water is coming your way.” “Now it looks nice but it’s really the calm before the storm,” he said. Florence dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain on parts of North Carolina and many areas remained cut off by floodwaters and inundated roads. The slow-moving storm made landfall on Friday as a Category 1 hurricane. In Lenoir County, North Carolina, where the rising Neuse River has flooded some roads, emergency medical workers have been running a “mobile disaster hospital,” which provides urgent care to residents cut off from the nearest hospital. Tripp Winslow, medical director of North Carolina Emergency Medical Services, helped set up the mobile emergency room during a downpour on Saturday night. They have received 20 to 30 patients a day so far, he said, but expect to be busier as the river crests. “Once we get isolated we expect to see more,” he said. “No pun intended, it’s a fluid situation.” MANY STILL WITHOUT POWER At least 36 deaths have been attributed to the storm, including 27 in North Carolina, eight in South Carolina and one in Virginia. Some 2,600 people had been rescued by boat or helicopter in North Carolina alone since the storm made landfall, and about 10,000 people remain in shelters, according to state officials. More than 121,000 customers were without power across North Carolina, and more than 2.1 million customers across the southeast United States were affected by the storm, according to utilities. Duke Energy Corp ( DUK.N ) started to return its Brunswick nuclear power plant in North Carolina to service on Thursday. The company shut both reactors at the 1,870-megawatt facility before Florence hit the coast near the plant in Southport, about 30 miles (48 km) south of Wilmington. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes. As floodwaters continue to rise, concerns are growing about the environmental and health dangers lurking in the water. The flooding has caused 21 hog “lagoons,” which store manure from pig farms, to overflow, creating a risk that standing water will be contaminated, according to the state’s Department of Environmental Quality. North Carolina is one of the leading hog-producing states in the country. Several sewer systems in the region also have released untreated or partly treated sewage and storm water into waterways over the last week, local media reported. Experts have said that climate change has increased the likelihood of more massive, sluggish storms like Florence, capable of dropping record amounts of rain and touching off catastrophic flooding.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder An intense nor'easter storm is expected to form between Thursday night and Friday. Heavy winds and coastal flooding are expected in New York and Massachusetts, with potentially record-setting flooding possible in Boston and Nantucket. Some coastal regions have already issued evacuation orders. It might feel spring-like in much of the US (and the Arctic Circle ) right now. But blustery winds, rain, and snow are building up as the winter storm that's been given the name ""Riley"" heads for the Northeast and New England. Coastal flooding and wind gusts of up to 75 mph are expected, and some Massachusetts residents have already been asked to evacuate before Friday morning. Right now, the storm system is making its way over the Ohio Valley and is expected to head off the East Coast, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). It's expected to undergo ""bombogenesis,"" the term meteorologists use to describe storms that undergo a particularly quick drop in pressure, which makes them more intense. As that happens sometime in between Thursday night and Friday, Riley is expected to become an intense nor'easter storm. National Weather Service - Boston Wind and flooding are the biggest threats from the upcoming storm. High wind watches are in place along most of the mid-Atlantic and New England, as well for the Appalachian and Piedmont regions. Winds make downed trees and power lines likely, which could disrupt travel and lead to power outages. Heavy rain is expected along with some snow on the New York coast between late Thursday and Friday, with minor to moderate flooding possible on Queens and Long Island Friday morning, according to NWS New York. The worst of the storm is expected to hit Massachusetts — potentially record-setting moderate to major coastal flooding is anticipated for Boston and Nantucket. (That's good reason to follow evacuation advice.) There could be 40-foot-waves in the Atlantic as well, with intense seas stretching down to Bermuda. A number of airlines including American, Delta, JetBlue, United, and Southwest have waived change fees for affected passengers. Western and Central New York could get a foot of wet snow dropped by the storm. Southern New England may get a good amount of snow as well. Most of the I-95 corridor between Boston and Washington D.C., however, should prepare for rain.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Tokyo's recent baking temperatures may give way to major downpours, forecasters say Hundreds of flights have been cancelled in Japan as the country braces for a powerful typhoon, bringing winds of up to 180km/h (110mph). Typhoon Jongdari (or ""skylark"" in Korean), is expected to make landfall on the country's main island, Honshu, late on Saturday or early on Sunday. The storm comes less than a month after floods killed more than 200 people, and then a heatwave left dozens dead. Japan's Meteorological Agency has told locals to be ready for evacuation. At 18:05 local time (09:05 GMT) Jongdari was situated about 200km south of Tokyo and forecast to make landfall close to the city of Nagoya. More than eight million people were ordered to leave their homes earlier in July when torrential rain saw rivers burst their banks, but some became trapped after failing to heed the order. Critics said the official warning came too late, and officials are urging those in disaster-struck areas to stay vigilant. ""We are afraid that people may not be able to evacuate due to strong wind or floods blocking evacuation routes,"" said Hiroshima's governor, Hidehiko Yuzaki. ""I would like people to evacuate in advance so that they can save their lives."" The prefectures worst hit by flooding were Okayama, Hiroshima and Yamaguchi, in the Chugoku region, and more than 4,000 survivors are still living in temporary shelters there.

The typhoon symbol marks where tracking data from tropicalstormrisk.com suggest the storm will make landfall ""We are fully ready 24 hours a day to evacuate residents,"" Tadahiko Mizushima, an official in Okayama, told the AFP news agency. ""We are paying special attention to the areas where restoration of river banks is under way as it would be the first heavy rain since the disaster."" ""It's going to deal a double punch,"" one Okayama man told Japan's public broadcaster NHK. ""We are seriously worried."" Sandbags are being rapidly deployed as barriers against the feared flooding. Images already show sizeable waves off the coast south-west of Tokyo, and ferry services are suspended. Forecasters say the area around the capital could see 40cm (15in) of rain in 24 hours from noon on Saturday. The floods earlier in July were Japan's worst weather disaster in decades, and were swiftly followed by an unprecedented heatwave which has been declared a natural disaster.

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - Tropical Depression Gordon continues to weaken over central Mississippi, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Wednesday, adding that the threat of heavy rains and flooding will continue for several days. Gordon is about 45 miles (75 kilometers) northwest of Jackson, Mississippi with maximum sustained winds of 30 miles per hour (45 kph), the Miami-based weather forecaster said. “Gordon will eventually merge with a front across the Midwest and become extratropical,” the NHC said.

Kathy Finn,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Tropical Depression Gordon was expected on Thursday to dump more heavy rains that could cause flooding in central U.S. states as Hurricane Florence, a monster Category 3 storm, churned toward Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Downpours have flooded streets in Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi as the storm headed north and threatened to bring heavy rains to the Mississippi Valley and the Midwest over the next few days, the NHC said. Some areas could get up to 5 inches (13 cm) of rain on Thursday and cause flash flooding, the center said. The storm, which made landfall late on Tuesday, has caused minimal property damage so far, the NHC said, but a 2-year-old girl died when a tree fell on a mobile home in Pensacola, Florida, authorities said. As of Wednesday night, more than 2,000 homes and businesses remained without power as utility companies restored service for tens of thousands of customers across the region. Energy companies and port operators along the Gulf Coast took steps to resume normal operations after Gordon shut 9 percent of the region’s oil and natural gas production. Oil prices fell about 1 percent on Wednesday, after fears about the storm eased. TRACKING TOWARD BERMUDA In the Atlantic Ocean, Hurricane Florence, a Category 3 storm on a five-step scale, barreled toward Bermuda on Wednesday, packing maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 kph). The first major hurricane of the Atlantic season will affect Bermuda’s surf by Friday, but it was too early to say whether it would hit land. “Swells from Florence could also reach the U.S. East Coast by early next week,” the NHC said. Florence was 1,235 miles (1,990 km) east-southeast of Bermuda on Wednesday night. Some weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, “but Florence is expected to remain a powerful hurricane through early next week,” the NHC said.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Customers at a hardware store in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which may be in the path US President Donald Trump has issued a series of warnings to prepare for Hurricane Florence, which is gathering power as it approaches the Carolinas. Mr Trump tweeted that this was ""one of the worst storms to hit the East Coast in many years"". Florence is at present a Category Four storm, with sustained winds of about 140mph (220km/h). On its current track it is predicted to make landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, late on Thursday. A number of mandatory evacuations have been ordered in South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia, affecting more than a million people. South Carolina's Governor Henry McMaster has given the entire coastline until noon on Tuesday to leave. The University of North Carolina at Wilmington has also ordered a mandatory evacuation of students. In its latest advisory at 23:00 eastern time (0300 GMT). the National Hurricane Center said of Florence: ""Some strengthening is expected during the next 36 hours, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday."" It said hurricane-force winds would ""extend outward up to 40 miles (65km) from the centre and tropical-storm-force winds [would] extend outward up to 150 miles (240km)"". The 23:00 report placed Florence about 465 miles south-east of Bermuda, moving west-north-west at about 13mph. This would see it pass between Bermuda and the Bahamas on Tuesday and Wednesday and make landfall on the North Carolina coast at about 22:00 local time on Thursday. The chief meteorologist for WCBD-TV in South Carolina, Rob Fowler, told the BBC that Florence was a large storm and getting bigger, and those even 100 miles away would feel the impact. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boarding up under way in Holden Beach, North Carolina He said the predicted heavy rain and storm surges could threaten areas such as Charleston, which is only a few metres above sea level, and that Florence could rival the impact of Hurricane Hugo, which wreaked $7bn (£5.3bn) in damage and claimed 49 lives in 1989. Schools in affected areas will begin to close on Tuesday and lanes on some highways will be reversed to aid evacuations. Media caption Will hurricanes like those in 2017 wreak havoc yet again? ""We are not going to gamble with the lives of the people of South Carolina,"" Mr McMaster said. The office of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam predicted ""catastrophic inland flooding, high winds and possible widespread power outages"". Rainfall could be up to 20in (50cm) in some areas. This could worsen if, as some meteorologists predict, Florence stalls after it makes landfall. Image copyright Reuters Image caption South Carolina airmen are deployed for the expected rescue efforts National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham told the Associated Press news agency: ""It's not just the coast. When you stall a system like this and it moves real slow, some of that rainfall can extend well away from the centre."" A similar event caused devastation in Texas last year when Hurricane Harvey hit. 'We were nonstop' President Trump has signed approvals for the declarations of emergency in the Carolinas and said he had spoken to the governors of the affected states. He sent out five tweets over four hours warning people to heed advice and stay safe: The US Navy is sending 30 ships stationed in Virginia out to sea. Residents of affected areas have been flocking to stores to stock up on essentials. Hardware store manager John Johnson told Agence France-Presse news agency there had been a rush on batteries, flashlights, plastic tarpaulins and sandbags at his Charleston shop. ""From eight o'clock 'til two we were slammed. We were nonstop,"" he said.

This one is different."" Some petrol stations were running dry as customers filled up. Curtis Oil, a fuel distributor in Chesterfield, South Carolina, said it had been ""overwhelmed with requests by state agencies and everybody else"". Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged. Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h Houses suffer damage, severe flooding Storm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h Some roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses. Storm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+ Serious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland. Storm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless ""For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.""

ALEXANDRA S. LEVINE,"When: Officials will send high-priority warnings during tsunamis, blizzards, tornadoes, hurricanes, extreme wind conditions, storm surges, snow squalls and flash floods. In New York, flash flood warnings are the most common, said Nelson Vaz, a warning coordination meteorologist for the Weather Service. On days like today, the Weather Service’s forecasters are constantly monitoring rainfall rates and the affected environments. “If they feel the rainfall rates are going to exceed the ability of the ground to absorb that rainfall, and you’re going to see a threat to life and property from flooding, that’s when the forecaster will issue a flash flood warning,” Mr. Vaz explained. How: The warnings are issued from the National Weather Service’s offices in Upton, N.Y., using computer software called WarnGen, which allows the forecasters to create the text of the message — describing the location and hazards, for example — and to target the geographic area where the flooding is expected to happen. The technology, called Wireless Emergency Alerts, is the same tool that can push out Amber Alerts or emergency warnings from the president. (At 2:18 p.m. on Oct. 3, the Trump administration is planning to send a test presidential alert.)","Tuesday: Food for thought during today’s heavy rain, and Open House New York.",2018-09-18T10:00:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Flash Flood Warnings,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/nyregion/new-york-today-flash-flood-warnings.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/18/nyregion/18nytoday/18nytoday-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,flooding,1
"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Coastal communities in Massachusetts are still cleaning up from last week’s potent nor’easter. They may want to put those efforts on hold, though. Another storm is set to impact the region by midweek. The coastal flooding won’t be nearly as bad, but colder air means snow is expected to pile up across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. The active weather pattern is courtesy of a climate oscillation known as the North Atlantic Oscillation, which has been in record territory to start the month. We all know last week was a nor’easter of epic proportion in terms of wind, waves and planes covered in vomit. The next storm to hit the region is currently creating blizzard conditions in the northern half of the Midwest and gusty, dry fire weather in the southern half. It will skirt the Ohio River Valley on Tuesday before curling up the coast on Wednesday and Thursday. Because astronomical tides will be lower and the storm will move faster than last week’s behemoth, coastal flooding is unlikely to be as bad as it was in New England on Friday and Saturday. Areas that were hit hard, however, will be in a more vulnerable state and this could add insult to injury. Ditto for the winds, which won’t be hurricane force like they were last week, but could still cause damage to branches and power lines already weakened. One area where this storm will outperform last week’s nor’easter is snow. Coastal areas are still looking at a rain-snow mix, but some inland locations could get a foot or more of snow. Bands of snow that train north to south could create relentless snow and even offer a chance of thundersnow in parts of New Jersey and inland areas further north. Somewhere, meteorologist and noted thundersnow enthusiast Jim Cantore is surely getting stoked. So while not historic, we’re still looking at high impact winter weather. The string of storms is coming courtesy of a climate pattern called the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Right now, it’s in a negative phase, which usually translates to snowy U.S. and cold Europe. And this recent negative NAO is no exception with back-to-back nor’easters on tap in the U.S. and frigid air in Europe that allowed it to snow in Rome last week. A negative NAO is also generally characterized by a big ridge of high pressure over Greenland, something meteorologists refer to as a Greenland Block. That in turn causes the jet stream—a river of fast flowing air that storms ride—to dip a bit over the eastern U.S., increasing the odds of wild weather in the region. “While the NAO is not the only factor at play, I believe it is definitely a driving force behind this pattern,” Ed Vallee, a meteorologist and owner of Vallee Weather Consulting LLC, told Earther. “Blocking high pressure in southeastern Canada has amplified the pattern as a whole and has allowed disturbances originating from the Pacific Ocean to glide across the U.S. while tapping into available moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.” The current negative NAO bottomed in historic territory just as the last week’s nor’easter was tearing up the East Coast. It’s since slowly started marching toward a more neutral state, which is good news if you’re not fan of this recent spate of turn-umbrellas-inside-out weather. “It appears the blocking pattern causing this increase in storminess will begin to break down toward the middle of the month,” Valle said. “In return, the pattern will likely shift back warmer and perhaps drier as we head into the back half of March.”","Coastal communities in Massachusetts are still cleaning up from last week’s potent nor’easter.
