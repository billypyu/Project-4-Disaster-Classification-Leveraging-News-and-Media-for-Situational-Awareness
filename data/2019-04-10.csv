Patrick Allan,"Every year, around 1,200 tornadoes hit the United States, destroying everything in their path. They can form almost anywhere, in any season, and bring with them 300 mph winds and funnels that can be more than a mile wide. This is what you need to know to survive one of Mother Nature’s most brutal offspring. You see those green, billowing storm clouds over there? Those are bad. Not because you’ll get… Read more Read Where and When They Occur Most tornadoes in the U.S. occur east of the Rocky Mountains. They are especially concentrated in the central and southern plains (what’s commonly known as “ Tornado Alley ”), as well as the Gulf Coast and parts of Florida. That said, tornadoes can occur just about anywhere, so it’s good to be prepared for them wherever you live. Once they form, tornadoes tend to move southwest to northeast, but they have been known to change direction. While tornadoes can occur any time during the year, they’re most likely to strike in the spring and summer months. More often than not, they happen in the late afternoon and early evening when the pressure is rapidly changing, usually between 3 and 9 p.m. Know the Warning Signs Tornadoes can strike quickly and seemingly out of nowhere, but there are usually warning signs of some kind. Make sure you know what different weather warnings mean : Severe thunderstorm watch : Weather conditions suggest severe thunderstorms may develop in your area. Severe thunderstorms are an early warning sign of a potential tornado. Severe thunderstorm warning : A severe thunderstorm has been observed by spotters or indicated on radar, and is occuring in your area. These storms can produce rain, lightning, hail, and wind of at least 58 mph. These warnings last for around an hour, or until the storm passes or upgrades to something more severe. Tornado watch : Weather conditions suggest severe thunderstorms are likely and may develop into tornadoes in your area. If you see this warning, review your emergency plans and start preparing for the worst. Tornado warning : It’s happening right now! A tornado has been spotted or indicated on radar in your area, so engage in your emergency plan or take cover immediately. It’s National Preparedness Month, which means it’s time to make sure you’re ready for whatever life … Read more Read If you’re not near your phone, or in an area with poor coverage, there are other tornado signs. Look and listen for : Dark, greenish thunderstorm clouds Dark, low-lying clouds (especially if rotating) Large hail or heavy rain Whirling dust or debris on the ground (tornadoes don’t always have a funnel) Loud, continuous roar that sounds like thunder or a freight train (but never fades away) Knowing these warning signs can save you a ton of time, and time is of the essence in emergency situations. When the Tornado Strikes Once a warning has been issued, or you can see the storm approaching yourself, it’s time to seek shelter immediately. Do not hesitate! Keep in mind, wherever you end up, be sure to protect your head. Most tornado injuries involve flying debris. And never leave a building in an attempt to escape a tornado. You can’t outrun it. If you’re at home Go inside and move to a small interior, windowless room. The lower the room, the better. If you have a basement or cellar, go there. Stay away from corners, windows, doors, and outside walls. The idea is to put as many walls between you and the outside as possible. Once you’re in a safe room, get under a sturdy table or desk, cover your head and neck with your arms, a heavy coat, a thick blanket, or pillows to protect from debris. If you live in a manufactured or mobile home, leave immediately and head to the closest sturdy building. Mobile homes offer very little protection. Keep pets on a leash or in a crate or carrier. If you’re at work or school Head to a pre-designated safe area, like a safe room, storm cellar, or a windowless interior room. If you are in a high-rise building, head to a small interior room on the lowest floor possible. If possible, avoid any buildings with long-spanning roof areas, like gymnasiums, arenas, or shopping malls. These buildings have a high chance of collapsing from pressure during tornadoes. Follow the instructions of your office safety officer or teacher. Remember when you bought a new can opener because you thought you lost your old one? What do you… Read more Read If you’re in a hotel or airport Hotels may have a basement or other designated safe area. Follow the instructions of hotel staff. Otherwise, seek shelter in interior bathrooms or closets near the center of the building. Protect yourself with pillows, blankets, and mattresses. Be sure to inform management of any injuries or damaged property when it’s all over. If you’re in a concourse or terminal of an airport during a tornado warning, airport staff should guide you to a safe area (often designated tornado shelters). You may be advised to leave your luggage behind, so do as instructed. If you’re in your car or truck Do not try to outrun a tornado—it’s faster than you and doesn’t have to stick to roads. Instead, safely drive to the nearest sturdy-looking building. Once there, park your car outside of any traffic lanes and get inside. If you’re caught inside your vehicle : park, make sure your seat belt is on, put your head down below the windows, and cover your head and neck with a coat, blanket, seat cushion, or your hands. The vehicle’s airbags and frame will offer some protection. Never seek shelter under a bridge or overpass. You’re safer in a low, flat, open location. If you’re outside If reaching shelter in time is not possible, you have a couple of options. If you can get next to a building, do so and crouch next to a strong wall. If you’re totally out in the open, get away from trees, cars, and other potentially deadly debris, then lie face down, flat in a ditch or other low-lying area. Cover your head and neck with whatever you have. After the Tornado If you’re trapped by debris, FEMA recommends you don’t try to move, kick up dust, or push your way out. You may be injured and could make things worse for yourself. Instead, tap on a pipe, wall, or other material that makes a sound. Whistle or yell if you can so rescuers can locate you. When the storm has passed, check in with your family and friends to make sure nobody is hurt. Keep them together during the aftermath. Switch on your radio and listen for instructions from local officials and emergency personnel. Use extreme caution as you begin to clean up. Stay away from debris, damaged buildings, and downed power lines, and watch for broken glass and other sharp objects on the ground. Be sure to wear protective clothing while you handle debris, and don’t try to lift heavy debris by yourself. If your power is out, use flashlights and lamps—not matches, lighters, or candles. You don’t want to have to add a fire onto your insurance claim.","Every year, around 1,200 tornadoes hit the United States, destroying everything in their path.

Do you know how to actually protect yourself during an earthquake or hurricane? What about a… Read more Read Green clouds have long been considered a signal of a coming tornado or hail storm by the people living in Tornado Alley, a large are of the U.S. that spans northern Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and beyond. Traditional folk wisdom says that the ominous color of the clouds comes from all the frogs and grasshoppers the tornadoes sucked up into the sky. How ribbiting! ( Crickets chirp.) But don’t worry, frog and grasshopper lovers, that’s obviously not what’s going on with these scary water vapor behemoths. So why the green? Youtuber and stormchaser Pecos Hank explains that it all comes down to the color spectrum, and the way objects absorb and reflect sunlight: Some of the biggest thunderstorms can generate areas of concentrated heavy rain and hail that look like waterfalls. Storm chasers call this the “core.” Sometimes storm clouds part giving you a glimpse into the core aloft. If you’re underneath the storm base, around midday, the core is often blueish or a gorgeous turquoise. But in the late afternoon and evening when most storm activity occurs, angled golden and reddish sunset light might mix with the blue precipitation core and the net effect is a greenish color. Yellow and blue makes green! William Beasley, professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, agrees. He explains to Scientific American that it all comes down to the moisture particles found in these afternoon thunderstorm clouds. They absorb red light and make the scattered light appear blue. When they’re set against an environment heavy red light, like a low sun during “golden hour” or a sunset, the net effect is a sort of greenish color. Here’s the thing, though: according to physicist Craig Bohre n at Pennsylvania State University, green storm clouds don’t necessarily mean a tornado or hail storm is coming. Basically, a hail storm or tornado can happen with or without green clouds. That’s why it’s important to be prepared for such events and not only rely on what you can see. It’s National Preparedness Month, which means it’s time to make sure you’re ready for whatever life … Read more Read That said, green clouds are a fairly decent predictor of severe thunderstorms in general. Green clouds are often tall clouds, says Scott Bachmeier, a meteorologist at the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies at UW–Madison, and tall clouds are a major ingredient for potential hail storms and tornados. So, while seeing green doesn’t mean a tornado is coming, it does mean that a tornado could be coming. No matter what, you’re in for some severe weather, friend. If you’d like to avoid heavy rain, high winds, and lightning, green skies are still a good warning sign to pack it up and get out of dodge. If you see some green clouds coming your way in the afternoon, it’s time to leave the area, or at least go inside where you can easily follow your emergency plan if need be. And if you don’t have an emergency plan yet, you should make one.","You see those green, billowing storm clouds over there? Those are bad.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Weather geeks went wild last week when the National Weather Service announced that the Carr Fire near Redding, California had spawned the equivalent of an EF-3 tornado on July 26. And for good reason: Fire tornados are among the rarest weather phenomena on Earth, and this vortex had the added distinction of possibly being the strongest tornado-like thing in California’s history. But more interesting than what we know about the wild-sounding event is what we don’t. Arizona State University fire historian Stephen Pyne told Earther there have been references to fire tornados since the 19th century, but only one other such event has been well-documented to date. Consequently, we have only a basic understanding of how and why fire tornadoes form. We know a lot more about their garden-variety cousins, fire whirls, which form by the dozens on wildfire fronts. (A rather spectacular one was captured by firefighters battling a blaze near Derbyshire, England on Tuesday.) Similar to dust devils, these whirls develop when turbulent, rotating air gets stretched vertically by an updraft. They only last a few minutes, and top out at about 150 feet in height, according to Weather Underground meteorologist and blogger Bob Henson, who penned a detailed explainer about the recent fire vortex. “They’re basically wind shear that gets tilted up,” Craig Clements, director of the Fire Weather Research Laboratory at San José State University, told Earther. A fire tornado shares some features with a fire whirl but quite literally takes things to new heights. These rotating columns of air are, by definition, connected both to a cloud system above and the ground below. So-called pyrocumulous clouds (and pyrocumulonimbus thunderclouds) form as hot air rises above a wildfire’s smoke plume, cools, and condenses, creating the potential for a tornado to form. But these clouds typically only emerge at high altitudes due to the intense heat of the flames. What that means is that any vortex connected to both a fire-generated cloud system and the ground is going to be big. According to Clements, the one that formed inside the Carr Fire on the evening of July 26 was associated with a pyrocumulonimbus system that extended tens of thousands of feet up into the stratosphere. Exactly how the tornado-like vortex spun up is still being worked out, and we may never be totally sure. University of Nevada Reno atmospheric scientist Neil Lareau put together an analysis based on Doppler radar data that suggests it formed like a landspout tornado, with an area of horizontal wind shear near the ground getting stretched vertically by a powerful updraft, and eventually connecting with the cloud system above. Others have described the firenado’s formation as similar to that of a more powerful supercell tornado, which are generated by rotating updrafts within thunderstorms. Henson told Earther he thought the vortex could have had elements of both supercell and landspout tornado. “This is definitely about as strong as you’d expect a landspout-type tornado to get,” Henson said. “That’s why it feels like a hybrid to me.” Either way, the vortex was a beast. A preliminary analysis by National Weather Service and CalFire estimated maximum wind-speeds in excess of 143 mph, making it the equivalent of an EF-3 on an intensity scale of 0-5. The twister lasted over an hour, toppling power lines and uprooting trees. To some, the freak event felt like an harbinger of a hotter, more dangerous future. But while climate change is having a clear impact on fire season, connections to rare fire tornado events are more tenuous. As Clements put it, “if it was just climate and fuel driving tornados, every fire would have a tornado.” He suspects that fire tornados come from some combination of loads of vegetation fuel—which generates the intense heat needed to create powerful updrafts—and the right topography. In the case of the very large, very intense Carr Fire (which is still only about 50 percent contained ), air flows racing through gaps in the mountains near Redding in the late afternoon on July 26 might have provided the necessary wind shear to set things off. Clearly, there are a lot of unanswered questions. But future research could help fill in the gaps. Clements’ group uses a mobile weather lab —a 4x4 pickup truck outfitted with a scanning Doppler LIDAR instrument, weather balloon sounding system, and a portable meteorological station—to study fire weather up close. The system has revealed never-before-seen structures inside wildfire plumes and offered insight how pyrocumulous clouds form. And it’s getting an upgrade this fall, with the addition of a Doppler radar-equipped pickup truck that will allow them to detect plumes from farther away and at a higher resolution. But what exactly spawned the Carr Fire’s epic display last month could be an enduring mystery. Clements lamented that by the time his team got to the scene several days later, they were only able to snap photographs. “If we were there [during the tornado], wow,” he said. “That would be a dataset for a lifetime.”","Weather geeks went wild last week when the National Weather Service announced that the Carr Fire near Redding, California had spawned the equivalent of an EF-3 tornado on July 26.

Laura Vitto,"Harrowing new footage released by California's firefighting agency Cal Fire reveals the massive fire tornado that led to the death of a firefighter on July 26. The fire tornado was part of the Carr Fire that's engulfed 223,610 acres of land in Northern California so far. A report from Cal Fire breaks down the details surrounding the fiery phenomenon. SEE ALSO: A fire tornado hit California. Here's how it happened. Per the report, the tornado ""was a large rotating fire plume that was roughly 1,000 feet in diameter at its base"" and managed to reach a height of 40,000 feet. In late July, we covered news of a fire tornado in the area on the evening of July 26. It's unclear whether the fire tornado in the report is the same as the one that garnered media attention at the time, according to Cal Fire. ""Observations from witnesses and other evidence suggest that either several fire tornados occurred at different locations and times, or one fire tornado formed and then periodically weakened and strengthened causing several separate damage areas,"" the report says. Fire tornados can happen when extreme heat spins up from the ground. As Mashable's Mark Kaufman explained at the time: ""The fire tornados could be kicked off by whipping winds interacting with unique terrain and topography, or a spin enabled by the heat itself."" ""Either way, if a small whirl is stoked into a towering firenado, it promptly becomes unpredictable. It's a spinning storm."" Firefighters captured the disturbing video above from a helicopter, as well as footage taken from a fire engine, and from the Keswick Dam on the Sacramento River. The Carr Fire continues to ravage parts of Shasta County and Trinity County. It is 77 percent contained, and other fires continue to rage in Northern California and other areas These fires are spurred on by extreme heat and dryness in the region. While human-caused climate change isn't necessarily the direct cause of any single weather event, like these fires, it can make extreme weather more likely now and in the future.","Harrowing new footage released by California's firefighting agency Cal Fire reveals the massive fire tornado that led to the death of a firefighter on July 26.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The Carr Fire is in the record books as one of California’s largest and most destructive fires. But it will also forever live in nightmares for unleashing one of the most terrifying spectacles on Earth in the form of a firenado. On Wednesday, CAL FIRE released three new videos that show the firenado ripping through the Northern California countryside on July 26. The state fire agency also announced that a local fire inspector was killed by the fiery winds. The videos were captured on the ground and from the air by CAL FIRE and local fire departments. They reveal vegetation burning red hot and a tight column of smoke, fire and ash spiraling higher into the sky in what looks like a scene straight out of a horror movie right before a portal to hell opens. But no, this is life on Earth, a reminder that our planet is capable of spinning up terrifying meteorological events all on its own. We know that vegetation burned at incredibly high temperatures, causing air to rise and rotate. And scientists estimate that those firenado winds reached 143 mph, the equivalent of an EF-3 tornado, and spanned an area as wide as three football fields on the ground. But while we know the outlines of what caused it and how serious the damage was, there’s also a ton of open questions about the firenado. That’s because we have precious few examples to compare it to and glean data from. With a paucity of examples and research to draw on, scientists are going to be studying the conditions and aftermath of the Carr Fire firenado for a long time in an attempt to better understand just what happened. The Carr Fire continues to burn, though firefighters have gotten a much better grip on it since the fateful night it tore into the small city of Redding in late July. As of Thursday, the fire was 71 percent contained after charring 214,527 acres, which puts it at the eighth-largest wildfire in state history. But the toll it’s taken has been steep. At least eight have perished, including three firefighters battling the blaze. It has also destroyed 1,599 structures, making it the sixth-most destructive fire in California history.",The Carr Fire is in the record books as one of California’s largest and most destructive fires.

Nick Douglas,"I love overly dramatic cover songs, the kind you hear in movie trailers where some lady is stage-whispering He did the mash, he did the Monster Mash while the Inception sound blasts over shots of a robot wizard tornado. I play them in two moods: feeling extremely dramatic and pumped up, or feeling goofy. So I took a few dozen of these songs and I made a dramatic, embarrassing Spotify playlist. Some of these are from trailers, some are featured in actual movies, and some only wish they were. Some are kind of thoughtful, and some might even not sound silly to you. Some dont even sound silly to me, but they sound very silly to my wife. But my wife listens to Hamilton so shes living in a glass house. Some (Beat It) are parodies, and some (Hit the Road Jack) are actually good, and some are bothlike the Auralnauts stupid and beautiful cover of You Spin Me Round, from their YouTube parody of dramatic movie trailers: Some are only half-ironic: the artist Hidden Citizens has made an entire album of cookie-cutter epic trailer versions of pop songs, and I cant tell how much theyre joking. Kytes Sigur-Rós-style Solsbury Hill manages to make the worlds most famous movie trailer song and make it sound even more like a movie trailer song, while still being actually good. Some are better than the original, like Gary Juless Mad World (from Donnie Darko ) or Johnny Cashs Hurt, and ten others that you will defend in the comments. All of these songs are extra, because they use goofy source material, or because they hit every cliché of a dramatic cover, or because they are any non-jazz version of Nature Boy, or because playing a dark version of a happy song is inherently melodramatic. If you watched The Leftovers, you remember cracking up in the middle of a tragic scene as you heard Ive got chills...theyre multiplying... and realized that Damon Lindelof had chosen to soundtrack a divorce with a cover of Youre the One That I Want. From Grease. But these songs can still move you, raise goosebumps and tug at your throat, because the human brain is easily manipulated by certain sounds and keys and vocal styles. Give in. Cry to the silly music. Not every dramatic cover makes it to Spotify. So below are some that only live on YouTube, but which still deserve your attention. This last version is edited from a trailer for Netflixs Death Note. A commenter claims its E^STs cover from Like a Version, but it sounds much more trailer-ized. You can see more YouTube covers at the blog ScreenCrush and their multiple collections of dramatic trailer music, and Entertainment Weeklys collection of the same. Thanks to members of our parent companys music Slack channel, to Deadspins Tom Ley who shares my love for these cheesefests, and to every movie studio that needed to simultaneously trigger tension and nostalgia.","I love overly dramatic cover songs, the kind you hear in movie trailers where some lady is stage-whispering “He did the mash, he did the Monster Mash” while the Inception sound blasts over shots of a robot wizard tornado.

MICHAEL WILSON,"Tornado sightings in New York are rare. From 1950, when the Weather Service began tracking tornadoes in the territory from Long Island to Orange and Putnam Counties, until 1974, not a single confirmed tornado hit the city. Since then, a few have come into the city, including one that hit Brooklyn with winds of up to 135 miles an hour in 2007. The last tornado to hit New York City was in 2012, said Jay Engle, a meteorologist with the Weather Service. On Sept. 8, 2012, tornadoes touched down in Breezy Point, Queens, and Canarsie, Brooklyn, knocking down power lines and sending beachside barbecues and chairs flying.","A tornado touched down in Queens on Thursday, tearing down trees. There were no reported injuries. The warning, however, inspired jokes on social media.",2018-08-03T16:01:14Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",A Tornado Warning in New York Is Met With Ambivalence and Oz Jokes,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/nyregion/tornado-warning-nyc-twitter-response.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png,the-new-york-times,The New York Times
ALAN BLINDER and MATT STEVENS,"In Beauregard, a few miles to the south, bundled-up state troopers and sheriffs deputies manned blockades as more blue lights flashed in the distance. The temperature stood not much higher than freezing.
Sheriff Jay Jones of Lee County, speaking to CNN on Monday morning, said,We have not had anything quite like this in our area ever, that I know of.
Alex Miller, 27, was driving with two passengers from Savannah, Ga., to his home in Birmingham, Ala., on Sunday evening when they were alerted on their cellphones that tornadoes might be approaching. They stopped at a gas station in Columbus, Ga., to let one wave of the storm system pass, and continued to head north, hoping to break through the worst of the weather during the lull.
As they neared Smiths Station, Ala., they passed a gas station with a billboard toppled over. They then passed a police blockade diverting southbound traffic off the main roads. The skies darkened, the rain grew stronger all the ominous signs, Mr. Miller said.
The plan quickly pivoted from We need to drive north to We need to pull over and seek shelter immediately, he said.
Mr. Miller pulled into a gas station in Smiths Station and sheltered in a hallway in the back with about 10 other people, including children, and a dog. The power was out inside and the light outside continued to dim. It was post-sunset dark, Mr. Miller said. The wind whipped outside, in what appeared to be one of the tornadoes to hit the Lee County area.",Search-and-rescue workers rushed on Monday to help communities that were pummeled by multiple tornadoes.

"ALAN BLINDER, JULIA JACOBS and CHRISTINA CARON","Emergency officials said that they were still searching for victims and survivors of the storm. But their list of missing people had been winnowed to seven or eight, they said, down from dozens on Monday. 
We havent given up hope, said Byron Prather, the fire chief in Opelika, Ala. Were still searching.
The tornado, which left a 70-mile path of destruction on Sunday through Alabama and Georgia, was the deadliest to hit the United States in six years.
When you see the devastation, its just hard to fathom that something can be this powerful, Brian Hastings, the director of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency, said at a news conference at the local high school in Beauregard, Ala.
Among the victims were Henry Stenson, 65, his wife, Florel, 63 and their son, Eric, 38, who all died while sheltering in their double-wide mobile home, said Katrena Coleman, a niece of Henry Stenson.","A sign on the high school grounds in Beauregard, Ala., on Tuesday.
