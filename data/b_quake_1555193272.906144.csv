Jon Fingas,"The Battle Pass will cost 1,000 Platinum (about $10, if you're paying outright). You can also pay to advance levels for 200 Platinum (about $2) if you're just that impatient. You can also expect significant changes to the existing progression system. You'll no longer earn new Backpacks or Chests, for instance, and id is adjusting free-to-earn Shards so that they'll unlock items and new characters. The update won't just revolve around economics.

Megan Molteni,"You heard it here first, folks; Stephen Quake is coming for the colonoscopy. The scientist has made a career of replacing invasive, painful, and dangerous procedures with simple, cheap tests that can be performed almost anywhere. Just this year, a blood panel he developed to detect genetic birth defects has been taken by more than three million women, replacing the need for amniocentesis and giant, uterus-puncturing needles. At the WIRED25 Summit Monday morning, Quake pronounced, perhaps jokingly, that colonoscopies were next. Vigorous applause ensued. He was referring to the burgeoning field of liquid biopsies cheap, noninvasive cancer screening that could become a part of routine care. Blood can be drawn anywhere and sent to a lab to be tested, points out Quake. If we can return that kind of information to anyone, it will be a big step forward toward creating more equity in health care. Its a technique enabled by massive data collection, and using big data to cure disease is at the heart of Quakes work. As a professor of bioengineering and applied physics and Stanford University and copresident of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, hes one of the people the Facebook founder ( and Bill Gates ) hope will cure everything that ails humanity before the end of the century. Stephen Quake wants to replace invasive, painful, and dangerous procedures with simple, cheap tests that can be performed almost anywhere. Doing so will require a much deeper understanding of how genetics influence disease on a cellular level, and for decades, Quake has been developing technologies to single out individual cells, crack them open, and peer inside. One of the Biohubs biggest projects is supporting the Human Cell Atlas, an ambitious international effort to catalog all 37 trillion cells in the human body. Just last week, Quakes group published its first big contribution to the projecta collection of data from nearly 100,000 mouse cells from 20 organs and tissues. Mice are the most important model organism scientists use to understand human disease, and this whole-organism map will help elucidate how cells talk to each other, and what happens when things go wrong. I really look at 23andMe as a data company, says 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki. WIRED founder Jane Metcalfe led the onstage conversation with Quake and 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki, who emphasized the role of data in consumer-facing DNA technology as well. I really look at 23andMe as a data company, said Wojcicki. But its taken the genetic testing provider more than a decade to get there. After an initial round of positive press and a spate of spit parties back in 2006, sales of 23andMe kits dropped precipitously, down to 20 a day. We realized we were going to have to prove out what you could do with this information, said Wojcicki. 23andMe began providing risk reports for diseases like Parkinsons and Alzheimers. Then the US Food and Drug Administration slammed the door. It wasnt until last year that 23andMe regained the right to provide people with health predictions. Since then, it has garnered additional approvals, and shows no signs of slowing down. The company has now amassed genetic, health, and behavioral data on more than five million people, a data trove that helped it net a $300 million investment from one of the worlds biggest drugmakers, GlaxoSmithKline, earlier this year. The pharma company also inked a five year exclusive data-sharing agreement to discover new targeted treatments. While some customers were dismayed by the move, Wojcicki defended it on Monday, saying that 23andMes mission has always been about deriving benefits from the human genome.Finding a cure or a treatment for you, is one of the clearest ways to show a benefit.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Landslides have cut off some of the worst-affected areas Tens of thousands of people in Papua New Guinea are in urgent need of supplies after last Monday's powerful earthquake, aid agencies say. Landslides and damaged roads have made it impossible to reach the worst-affected communities in isolated areas. Many people are thought to be living under canvas roofs in the rubble of damaged buildings. The 7.5-magnitude quake rattled villages and a large gold mine in the country's Enga province. US seismologists said it struck 90km (56 miles) south of Porgera at 03:45 local time on Monday (17:45 GMT on Sunday). There have been dozens of aftershocks, including a 5.7 quake on Tuesday afternoon. Local reports say dozens of people have been killed but there has been no official confirmation. ""The challenge is road access; it's still not accessible to trucks and four-wheel drives,"" Udaya Regmi, of the International Red Cross, told Reuters news agency. ""Big trucks cannot go there. It's one of the reasons the food is becoming less and less. There are no fears of starvation yet but we've not got the full picture."" Mr Regmi - who is based in the country - said that 147,000 people were in severe need of food, water and sanitation. A state of emergency has been declared but the full scale of the damage will not be clear until relief workers can complete a full assessment. In a statement, Darian Clark, of the Australian High Commission in Papua New Guinea, described the extent of the damage. ""This was the biggest earthquake in 100 years and it spread 150km across the fault line,"" he said. ""A number of urban settlements, as well as villages, have been affected, many in the form of landslides and landslips, which means that roads have been cut off, water contaminated and power knocked out.""

James Vincent,"AI agents continue to rack up wins in the video game world. Last week, OpenAI’s bots were playing Dota 2 ; this week, it’s Quake III, with a team of researchers from Google’s DeepMind subsidiary successfully training agents that can beat humans at a game of capture the flag. As we’ve seen with previous examples of AI playing video games, the challenge here is training an agent that can navigate a complex 3D environment with imperfect information. DeepMind’s researchers used a method of AI training that’s also becoming standard: reinforcement learning, which is basically training by trial and error at a huge scale. DeepMind’s bots learned by playing 450,000 games against themselves Agents are given no instructions on how to play the game, but simply compete against themselves until they work out the strategies needed to win. Usually this means one version of the AI agent playing against an identical clone. DeepMind gave extra depth to this formula by training a whole cohort of 30 agents to introduce a “diversity” of play styles. How many games does it take to train an AI this way? Nearly half a million, each lasting five minutes. As ever, it’s impressive how such a conceptually simple technique can generate complex behavior on behalf of the bots. DeepMind’s agents not only learned the basic rules of capture the flag (grab your opponents’ flag from their base and return it to your own before they do the same to you), but strategies like guarding your own flag, camping at your opponent’s base, and following teammates around so you can gang up on the enemy. To make the challenge harder for the agents, each game was played on a completely new, procedurally generated map. This ensured the bots weren’t learning strategies that only worked on a single map. Unlike OpenAI’s Dota 2 bots, DeepMind’s agents also didn’t have access to raw numerical data about the game — feeds of numbers that represents information like the distance between opponents and health bars. Instead, they learned to play just by looking at the visual input from the screen, the same as a human. However, this does not necessarily mean that DeepMind’s bots faced a greater challenge; Dota 2 is overall a much more complex game than the stripped-down version of Quake III that was used in this research. To test the AI agents’ abilities, DeepMind held a tournament, with two-player teams of only bots, only humans, and a mixture of bots and humans squaring off against one another. The bot-only teams were most successful, with a 74 percent win probability. This compared to 43 precent probability for average human players, and 52 percent probability for strong human players. So: clearly the AI agents are the better players. Credit: DeepMind A graph showing the Elo (skill) rating of various players. The “FTW” agents are DeepMind’s, which played against themselves in a team of 30. However, it’s worth noting that the greater the number of DeepMind bots on a team, the worse they did. A team of four DeepMind bots had a win probability of 65 percent, suggesting that while the researchers’ AI agents did learn some elements of cooperative play, these don’t necessarily scale up to more complex team dynamics. As ever with research like this, the aim is not to actually beat humans at video games, but to find new ways of teaching agents to navigate complex environments while pursuing a shared goal. In other words, it’s about teaching collective intelligence — something that has (despite abundant evidence to the contrary) been integral to humanity’s success as a species. Capture the flag is just a proxy for bigger games to come.","Playing video games is a big challenge for AI agents, and now bots from the Google-owned DeepMind lab have conquered a stripped-down version of capture the flag in Quake III.

Mark Kaufman,"At 3:00 a.m., when everyone was sleeping, a violent earthquake struck 65 miles from Turkey's capital in August 1999. The 7.6-magnitude quake collapsed entire apartment buildings on top of unsuspecting people, killing at least 20,000. Known as the Izmit quake, in 2011 scientists said they found convincing evidence of a precursor to the tragic temblor: A series of often small, unnoticeable quakes — known as foreshocks — occurred in the same area for around 44 minutes before the major quake struck. This, the scientists argued, was evidence of something unique happening before the massive earthquake. And if this foreshock activity could somehow be reliably detected, perhaps we could predict future earthquakes with plenty of notice for people in any given area — an ability that has completely eluded scientists. SEE ALSO: Can Your iPhone Double as a Cutting-Edge Earthquake Detector? But seven years later, earthquake researchers have put a damper on this optimism. In a study published Monday in Nature Geoscience, scientists found that these series of small quakes were not a unique sign of a looming earthquake, but instead a domino-effect of tremors that happened to have ultimately triggered a far bigger one. ""They’re knocking down the idea that something happens before earthquakes,"" Duncan Agnew, a geophysicist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, said in an interview. Foreshocks are earthquakes, emphasizes Angew, but they only earn the title “foreshock” when they happen before a big one. A leveled apartment building in Istanbul in November 1999. Image: Anja Niedringhaus/EPA/REX/Shutterstock “They are something you can only see in retrospect,” Angew, who had no role in the study, said. “There’s absolutely no way to tell them apart otherwise. That’s like trying to predict the weather, except you can’t see anything.” ""For decades, people have been thinking about how we can distinguish foreshocks from ordinary earthquakes,"" William Ellsworth, a Stanford University geologist and lead author of the study, said in an interview. ""They [2011 researchers] made this rather bold suggestion that the foreshocks were different — we just came up with the opposite result."" By analyzing additional measurements from the 1999 quake, Ellsworth and coauthor Fatih Bulut, a geologist at Turkey's Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute, found that a series of foreshocks before the quake did not all happen in one place, as previously suggested. Instead, “we found that none of them were at the same spot,” said Ellsworth, adding that more than two dozen imperceptible quakes “popped off all over the place.” From this, the study's authors conclude that nothing special was happening, but a “cascade-like” effect of small earthquakes rippled around the area, until one happened to have triggered massive underground movement — and, ultimately, a tragedy. The fault comparison between the infamous San Andreas fault in California, and the fault in Turkey. Image: USGS However, perhaps there's something else still happening before earthquakes that geologists haven’t yet discovered, or been able to measure. “It’s possible there are clues out there that we don’t know yet,” John Vidale, Director of the Southern California Earthquake Center who had no role in the study,” said in an interview. “We don’t know what we don’t know.” Or, there could be no clues at all — no true, precursor of a coming quake. “It may not be there — that’s the thing we don’t know,” said Ellsworth. But even so, we do have a solid grasp of areas that are earthquake prone, and when a region is overdue for a large quake. Digging into the ground along fault lines — cracks in the Earths’ crust where pressure builds and eventually slips — gives scientists a good understanding of how often big quakes have happened in the past, and whether or not we’re due for another one. “If it’s been a long time since the last one, the odds are somewhat higher now,” said Vidale. Though, “somewhat” is the key word here. Geologists know we can’t predict quakes, but are well aware they can hit at any time — sometimes with small foreshocks, and sometimes without. “If it happens in the next 20 minutes I won’t be surprised,” said Angew, of the next big rupture of the San Andreas fault in California. “If it doesn’t happen in my lifetime, I won’t be surprised.” A boy stands in front of his destroyed home in Adapazari, Turkey, in 1999. Image: Kerim Oekten/EPA/REX/Shutterstock In the end, while earthquake prediction is a much-desired ability, perhaps it doesn’t matter as much as we think it does. “It really doesn’t matter when they happen if we’re prepared,” said Ellsworth. “We’ll get through them.” For those that live in quake country, this means heeding the advice of the U.S. Geologic Survey. And on a larger scale, it also means building structures that are safe during earthquakes. In the case of Turkey two decades ago, many buildings simply weren’t built to withstand a big quake. “Turkey has very good building codes,” said Ellsworth. “The problem is buildings were not being built to the code.” “Earthquakes don’t kill people, buildings kill people,” he added. Scientists will still keep searching for the elusive clues that might foreshadow a looming quake, perhaps giving people 10 or 20 minutes to prepare. Today, the best we have are early warning systems, like that being tested in California and in use in Mexico City. These don’t predict earthquakes, but can give people perhaps 30 seconds notice that a big quake has happened, and that seismic waves will soon hit their area. For now, preparation isn’t just the smart option — it remains the only option. There’s much that isn’t known about what happens before earthquakes, and that isn’t likely to change soon. “What we want to know about is buried under miles of solid rock,” said Ellsworth.","At 3:00 a.m., when everyone was sleeping, a violent earthquake struck 65 miles from Turkey's capital in August 1999.

Thanks to a recent update, you can run Windows 7 apps on Android using a program called Wine 3.0. Wine has actually been around since 1993, making it possible to run Windows software on Apple hardware and Linux-powered computers. With its latest update, that same feature is expanding to Android, though there are some limitations to what it can do. Android Police notes that Wine 3.0 is a little unstable. It seems to run best on newer devices, but it may crash older phones or tablets. It also runs everything in full screen, so don’t think you’ll be running two programs side-by-side like you would on an actual PC. Additionally, Wine 3.0 runs better on x86 Android devices (meaning the processor is based on Intel technology). That means if you have an ARM-based device you’ll be limited to using programs that work with Windows RT. Even with those limitations, Wine 3.0 still opens up some interesting possibilities. If you’re into gaming, you can use Wine 3.0 to get classic first-person-shooter Quake and its sequel, Quake II, running on any Android device. If you’re running an x86 chip, you could also try launching the full version of Steam (instead of the limited mobile app) for even more video games. Not a gamer? Try Greenshot, an advanced screenshotting program for Windows that let’s you instantly annotate your images, print them, or share them in an email.

Dawn Wilcox, who teaches second grade, said the quake and its many aftershocks were an essential topic for a conversation on the first day back about science and personal memory. Ms. Wilcox, who grew up in Anchorage, survived a 9.2-magnitude earthquake that shattered southern Alaska in 1964, when she was in third grade. It has been described as the second biggest earthquake in modern world history. I know their anxiety, and how it feels to be a child, and really not knowing when the next earthquake is going to hit, Ms. Wilcox said. The earth is a restless place, she told the children, and earthquakes, especially here in Alaska, are part of that story. This is what planet earth does, she said later. This kind of relieves some anxiety. Before the reopening of schools, officials had raced to be sure that the buildings were not only structurally sound, but also secure in other ways. Emergency radios had to be checked for damage and battery power. Video cameras were recalibrated and realigned. One step will be skipped. The monthly fire drill testing the evacuation of classrooms will not take place in December.

The 6.4 magnitude quake hit the central Indonesian island of Lombok just before 07:00 local time (00:00 GMT) on Sunday. The island attracts tourists from around the world and is located about 40km (25 miles) east of Bali. Many buildings have been damaged and some of the injured are being treated in hospital, officials say. The US Geological Survey said the epicentre of the earthquake was 50km (31 miles) northeast of the city of Mataram, in northern Lombok. ""People are gathering on the streets and empty fields to avoid collapsing buildings,"" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the country's disaster agency, posted on Twitter [in Indonesian]. ""The main focus now is evacuation and rescue. Some of the injured are still being treated at clinics."" He posted images showing collapsed buildings and streets littered with rubble. One witness told AFP news agency about the chaos that followed the earthquake. ""The earthquake was very strong... and everybody in my house panicked, we all ran outside,"" he said.

HENRY FOUNTAIN,"With the tsunami generated so close to Palu, there was little time for people to escape. A tsunami warning was issued by the government and was lifted about half an hour after the quake, apparently after the tsunami hit Palu. Indonesia currently uses only seismographs, global positioning system devices and tide gauges to detect tsunamis, which are of limited effectiveness, said Louise Comfort, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh graduate school. She has been involved in a project to bring new tsunami sensors to Indonesia. In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has a sophisticated network of 39 sensors on the ocean bottom that can detect extremely small pressure changes indicating the passage of a tsunami. The data are then relayed via satellite and analyzed, and an alert is issued if required. Dr. Comfort said that Indonesia had a similar network of 22 sensors but they are no longer in use because they were not being maintained or had been vandalized. The project she is working on would bring a new system to Indonesia that would use undersea communication to avoid the use of surface buoys that could be vandalized or hit by ships.","Catastrophic tsunamis often result from earthquakes that move vertically along a fault.

HENRY FOUNTAIN,"By contrast, the fault that ruptured on Friday was a so-called strike-slip fault, in which the earth movement is largely horizontal. That kind of movement would not ordinarily create a tsunami. But under certain circumstances it can, Dr. Patton said. A strike-slip fault might have some amount of vertical motion that could displace seawater. Or the faults rupture zone, which in this case was estimated to be about 70 miles long, may pass through an area where the seafloor rises or drops off, so that when the fault moves during the quake, it pushes seawater in front of it. Another possibility is that the tsunami was created indirectly. The violent shaking during the quake may have caused an undersea landslide that would have displaced water and created waves. Such events are not uncommon; several occurred during the 1964 9.2-magnitude Alaska earthquake, for example. Dr. Patton said a combination of factors may have contributed to the tsunami. Studies of the seafloor will be crucial to understanding the event. We wont know what caused it until thats done, he said.","Catastrophic tsunamis often result from earthquakes that move vertically along a fault.

Alessandra Potenza,"Last night, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck southeast of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska, prompting a tsunami warning that forced people to flee to higher grounds in the middle of the night. Fortunately, the tsunami waves were less than a foot high, and the advisories were canceled a little after 4AM local time. So why was Alaska so lucky? Powerful quakes that happen out at sea are known to cause destructive tsunamis. In 2011, a magnitude 9 earthquake in northeastern Japan triggered waves as high as 126 feet, killing nearly 20,000 people. In 2004, a similarly strong quake off the coast of Indonesia caused a tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people. Alaska also has a history of strong earthquakes: in 1964, the state experienced the most powerful quake ever recorded in the US, a 9.2 magnitude tremor followed by a tsunami that killed over 100 people. “Alaska is no stranger to these kinds of quakes,” says Don Blakeman, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey (USGS). “Alaska is no stranger to these kinds of quakes.” Earthquakes occur because the Earth’s crust is divided into plates. These plates can move smoothly against each other or become stuck. When they become stuck, they build up strain over time, until one day, the plates unstick, releasing energy that causes an earthquake. Just south of Alaska, the Pacific plate is sliding underneath the North American plate, an area called the subduction zone. That’s why the state is highly seismic, Blakeman tells The Verge. Last night’s earthquake generated because of all the strain building up on the subduction zone, but it did not occur exactly on a fault where the Pacific Ocean seafloor is sliding under the North American plate, Blakeman says. Instead, the quake occurred a little farther out, in a place where the fault is moving horizontally. This type of quake, called a strike-slip earthquake, is less likely to trigger large tsunamis, and this is probably why Alaska only saw waves of less than a foot, according to Blakeman. When earthquakes happen on the subduction zone itself, where one plate is pushing down while the other is going up, then high waves form. “To get a tsunami, you have to have substantial vertical movement on the seabed,” Blakeman says. Those types of earthquakes were responsible for the massive tsunamis in Japan and Indonesia. Aftershocks in Alaska could continue for weeks or months, Blakeman says. If the quakes generate from the same zone as last night, then large tsunamis should not be expected. But because the state sits by the Pacific-North America plate boundary, it’s normal that new earthquakes will happen in the future. When and where, exactly? That’s impossible to say. Earthquakes are so complicated that scientists aren’t able to predict them — at least not yet. “Since we can’t predict them, all we can do is be prepared,” Blakeman says.","Last night, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck southeast of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska.",2018-01-23T16:15:13Z,"{'id': 'the-verge', 'name': 'The Verge'}",A powerful earthquake in Alaska didn’t trigger a big tsunami — here’s why,https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16922914/alaska-earthquake-tsunami-pacific-north-america-plate-boundary,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQqh3BMKCmEiuTLq3ign4Cnb9ag=/0x97:704x466/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10082687/earthquake.png,the-verge,The Verge,quake,1
https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption The quake was large - but not of the type normally associated with a big tsunami event Friday's catastrophic tsunami event on Sulawesi Island is a puzzle. As the emergency response gathers pace, scientists are scratching their heads to understand why it generated such big waves. The magnitude 7.5 quake was certainly large - one of the biggest recorded anywhere on the globe this year. But it was what geophysicists call a strike-slip event, where the ground breaks horizontally. In this instance, the rock to the east of the fault running up through the island moved northwards relative to the rock to the west. Strike-slip quakes can cause tsunami events but the 6m-tall waves that crashed ashore at Palu city surprised everyone. Remember that to make the series of waves you need a big displacement of the sea-floor - a vertical movement that disturbs the entire water column, which then moves away in all directions. Some early calculations suggest a floor displacement of perhaps half a metre. Significant but generally insufficient to produce the waves that were recorded. So what happened? Two factors are emerging as possible culprits. They may even have worked hand in hand. The first is the suspicion that the quake triggered some sort of underwater landslide. These are an ever-present danger. A quake can destabilise large collections of sediment and cause them to break free of their footing and tumble downslope. In mountainous areas on land, rock and sediment avalanches are major earthquake hazards that rival the destruction from collapsed buildings. But underwater, these movements of sediment have the potential to also generate tsunami events. When this happens, the waves that hit shorelines can be large, even if the effects are fairly localised. This may have been what happened on Friday, and perhaps the waves were then exacerbated by the shape of Palu bay itself. It has an elongated geometry, which could have focused and amplified the tsunamis as they approached the city's Talise beach. Image copyright AFP This is all conjecture, of course. The science community, as we speak, will be modelling Friday's event to try to tie down the details of the generation and propagation processes involved. ""My first calculations of the seafloor deformation in the earthquake are 49cm,"" said Dr Mohammad Heidarzadeh, an assistant professor of civil engineering specialising in coastal engineering at Brunel University in the UK. ""From that you might expect a tsunami of less than one metre, not six metres. So something else is happening. So the two speculations are legitimate - the submarine landslide and the funnelling caused by the bay."" A straightforward way to assess any changes on the seafloor is to carry out a bathymetric survey. This would ascertain pretty quickly whether there has been significant movements of sediment. As to onshore landslides, these will be mapped from satellite. Image copyright PLANET Image caption Satellite imagery shows districts swept away in lateral movements of sediment You may have seen some remarkable videos at the weekend of whole swathes of ground moving laterally in front of the camera. Image copyright YouTube Image caption In one video, an antenna is seen to slide in front of someone's mobile phone In one, a tall antenna eerily marches across the landscape ; in others, buildings drift sideways as if suddenly caught afloat on a river. The locations of many of these videos have now been identified, and from the earliest space imagery it is possible to discern places where whole districts of Palu have been picked up and dumped into vast piles. ""If you look at the satellite imagery, you can see that there are masses of houses compressed into a small zone, leaving behind a bare area of ground behind where the houses once were,"" explained Prof Dave Petley, a landslides expert at Sheffield University. ""This looks like classic 'liquefaction', where the structure of soil has collapsed; it's fluidised and you get these very active landslides on a low gradient,"" he told BBC News. Everything should become clearer in the coming days and weeks as researchers get on the ground to assess the nature of the damage. The world's fleet of satellites have also been tasked to get as much imagery of the region as possible. Being equatorial, this can be complicated by there being a lot of cloud in the sky which optical satellites cannot penetrate. But there will be overpasses by radar spacecraft as well, and these see the ground in all weather, day and night.

Ms. Schutz, 42, established her reputation with expressionistic compositions featuring figures that seemed to be pushing at the edges of the picture planes with their limbs akimbo, barely skirting or is it courting? disaster.
Either way, emotion and empathy seem to drive her work. Im interested how something feels, rather than how it looks, she said at her studio, explaining her approach.
But the debate over Open Casket and a subsequent controversy over the Walker Art Centers handling of Scaffold, by the artist Sam Durant, which evoked in part the hanging of 38 Dakota Indian men in Minnesota in 1862 raised challenging questions for the exhibition of art in museums and elsewhere: Who has the right to tell certain stories, empathetically or not?

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Researchers used a grainy photograph of a toppled train combined with an eyewitness account to analyze the deadly earthquake that struck San Francisco over 110 years ago.
In 1906, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck San Francisco, destroying much of the city and killing as many as 3,000 people, making it one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. But it also gave birth to modern American earthquake science. Now, researchers are trying to understand the quake using cutting-edge techniquesand some old documents.
Its important to understand how these larger quakes occurred so we can build safer buildings, explained Swetha Veeraraghavan, postdoctoral research associate in structural computational science at Idaho National Laboratory. I think these types of eyewitness accounts really help with this. Thats why I found the problem really cool.
Scientists have tried analyzing old images and eyewitness data before in order to better understand the 1906 quake. Newer earthquake simulations based on more data and better computational power inspired the researchers to take another look at this famous image of a steam locomotive sitting on its side, taken shortly after the quake. They also examined a conductors description of the incident. The 1907 account reads:
At Point Reyes Station at the head of Tomales Bay the 5:15 train for San Francisco was just ready. The conductor had just swung himself on when the train gave a great lurch to the east, followed by another to the west, which threw the whole train on its side. The astonished conductor dropped off as it went over, and at the sight of the falling chimneys and breaking windows of the station, he understood that it was the Temblor. The fireman turned to jump from the engine to the west when the return shock came. He then leaped to the east and borrowing a Kodak he took a picture of the train here presented.
This might sound like meager information with which to reconstruct an earthquake, but it provides more data than you might think. The quake must have been powerful enough to cause the rocking and the tipping of the train. The team simplified the trains measurements into a long rectangular prism, and simplified the quake to an up-and-down wave motion of the ground. They then used equations devised to describe a rocking rectangular block in response to ground motion to calculate how big the wave must have been in order to tip the train.
Their analysis revealed that the minimum acceleration of the ground required to overturn the train would have been 4 meters per second squared (a little less than half the acceleration of something falling to the Earth in a vacuum), while the minimum velocity would have been 0.5 meters per second, or around 1.6 feet per second.
On top of their analysis of the train tipping, the researchers were able to estimate the location of the earthquakes hypocenterthe area where it actually occurred in the Earth below the epicenter on the surfacebased on the trains location and behavior. While previous models have suggested three locations for a hypocenter, this result reveals that only a hypocenter to the south of Point Reyes, California, would recreate the eastward, then westward tipping of the train, according to the paper published in Seismological Research Letters. This leaves a hypocenter offshore from San Francisco or near the California city of San Juan Bautista, confirming previous estimates.
The paper comes with uncertaintiesfor example, the researchers didnt know how much the train weighed, and are using a simplified model to understand what went on. 
Still, it confirms a body of research recreating this important quake. And it shows more generally that even in the absence of data, context clues, eyewitness accounts, and photographs can prove important for understanding earthquakes. Veeraraghavan said: People have even used tombstones or statues that toppled over to estimate the ground motion.",Researchers used a grainy photograph of a toppled train combined with an eyewitness account to analyze the deadly earthquake that struck San Francisco over 110 years ago.

Adam Rosenberg,"Right on the heels of Thursday's volcano eruption in Hawaii, a pair of earthquakes struck the state as residents contended with ongoing evacuations and noxious gas in the air. The first, a 5.4-magnitude quake according to the United States Geological Survey, occurred at around 11:30 a.m. local time near the southern coast of Hawaii's Big Island, just south of Kilauea volcano. A second, 6.9-magnitude quake followed roughly an hour later. SEE ALSO: 3D Image of Sierra Negra Could Help Us Understand Volcanoes According to the USGS, the latter one was the state's strongest since a 7.1-magnitude quake that hit in ""almost exactly the same location"" in 1975. Lighter earthquakes continued into Saturday morning as a result of ongoing volcanic activity. You can keep track of them yourself right here. In a notice posted on Friday afternoon, the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency had little to say about the tremors. The biggest threat continues to be the high levels of sulfur dioxide found in the evacuation area, released as volcanic activity causes fissures to open in the ground. That could change, however. ""The [evacuated areas around Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens Subdivision] continues to be unstable with multiple volcanic eruptions happening,"" the notice reads. ""No one is allowed into the area. Do not attempt to return to your home at this time."" Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard discussed the dangers of the noxious gas in a CNN appearance on Friday. ""Sulfur dioxide gas can be so toxic and thick in some areas that it can be fatal, especially to those who have respiratory illnesses,” she said. ""The wind can push [the gas] in different directions, so that’s a very serious concern given the high levels.... [People] don’t necessarily have the kinds of protective gas masks that they would need if they were right in the thick of this gas."" WOW...just look at this footage.

George Dvorsky,"On September 19, 2017, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico, killing nearly 370 people. But something good has come from this tragic event: The quake damaged an ancient pyramid, revealing a previously unknown Aztec temple underneath. While checking for structural damage inflicted by the 2017 earthquake, archaeologists with Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) made a remarkable discovery: a temple located about six feet (two meters) below the top of the Teopanzolco pyramid, a structure the Aztecs dedicated to Tláloc, the Aztec rain god. It was not uncommon for ancient cultures to build upon older structures, but in this case, the archaeologists had no idea a temple was located within. While performing their survey, the INAH archaeologists noticed that some stones on the top of the pyramid were loose. The hidden temple revealed itself as the scientists were searching for firmer terrain. The newly discovered temple measures about 20 feet by 13 feet (6m x 4m), and it dates back to the Middle Postclassic period, sometime between 1150 to 1200 AD. The temple was built by the Tlahuica culture, one of several Aztec peoples living in central Mexico shortly before and during the time of the Spanish conquest, which started in 1521. The temple and the Teopanzolco pyramid built upon it, which dates back to about 1300 AD, are located in Morelos state, about 43 miles (70 km) south of Mexico City. The newly discovered temple is quite possibly the oldest evidence of human occupation at the Morelos site—an important finding that represents a very early stage of the Aztec period. “Despite what the earthquake meant, we have to be grateful that this natural phenomenon revealed this important structure, which changes the dating of this archaeological site,” said Isabel Campos Goenaga, director of the INAH Morelos Center, at a press conference held earlier this week. The walls of the temple were found next to the remains of a stuccoed column that once supported a roof. Intense humidity has obliterated most of the stucco walls, but the archaeologists managed to salvage some fragments for study. The INAH archaeologists say it likely represents the first constructive phase of the Teopanzolco pyramid, predating the famous Templo Mayor, which dates back to the Late Postclassic period (1200 to 1521 AD). “The internal temple that we found in that sense is the oldest at the pyramid of Teopanzolco,” explained INAH archaeologist Barbara Koniecza. “We have already detected two construction stages, and where we stand is considered to be built in the oldest phase before the second phase of the Templo Mayor.” Sadly, the 7.1 magnitude quake damaged the Teopanzolco pyramid, along with two temples. The floor of both shrines have sunk, and are now deformed, making the structures potentially unstable. More work is needed to assess the damage and to devise potential restoration strategies. Until then, the site, which has been closed to the public since last September, will remain off limits to tourists.

Beth Skwarecki,"A crisis is, often, an impossible situation. You have to make immediate decisions without enough information. You need to keep people safe, but you don’t have the time or resources for the usual safety measures. The Guardian recently asked people who’ve handled extreme situations how they knew what to do. Here are their tips. Drop Unnecessary Decisions Multitasking is a myth. If you want to do a job well, you can’t also be doing a bunch of other things at the same time. Pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger says that he was trained to drop non-essential decisions in a crisis, so that you don’t clutter up your brain while you’re trying to think clearly. You’ll also have to drop some of your usual actions. As he explains: We have a three-page checklist designed to be used when landing from 35,000ft and it usually takes half an hour. But I broke protocol and took only the actions we had time for: from the time we hit the birds until the time we landed was under three-and-a-half minutes. Expect Uncertainty When a crisis is developing, you don’t know what’s going to happen next. Karim Brohi, a surgeon who was on duty during the London Bridge attacks, led the emergency department in evaluating and treating the patients that were rushed to his hospital. But the hospital’s work load depended on factors that weren’t under control of anyone there. He says: We received around 30 patients and were expecting a second wave who had been trapped in Borough Market, but that didn’t happen. It’s important for us to not be flustered by information when it’s wrong because we have to be able to respond no matter what. Prepare for the Next Phase of the Crisis Julia Brothwell, a British Red Cross team leader, flew to the 2015 earthquake in Nepal, but she didn’t wait to be called; her policy is to call the office and start packing when she knows there’s a crisis that could need her help. She also paid attention to the aftershocks, wondering if the next one could be a real quake. And she was prepared with a go-bag for when that quake came: Two weeks after the first quake, I was working in our office on the sixth floor of a building when a second quake happened. It was like being on a fairground ride where the floor moves under you. I got everyone out of the office, but we had to get down five flights of stairs. Most people ran without their belongings, but I always have my grab bag with my extra phones, water and spare clothes by the doorway of whatever room I’m in and I grabbed it as we exited. Examine Your Biases In a crisis, you might need to make split-second decisions on tiny scraps of information. Brett Lovegrove, London’s former head of counter-terrorism, explained how he dedicated time to understanding how his brain filled in the gaps: When I was a young firearms officer in the Met police, I had a number of situations where I didn’t shoot but could have done and it was important to me to understand why. The only way I could do that was to take myself into a dark room and look at what I had relied on. I found it was a mixture of my role models and how I’d been brought up. I learned a lot from my father and, although we sometimes have different views, I have an appreciation of diversity and making decisions for the right reasons by seeing the person and not their background. I strongly believe crisis leaders need to make fast and difficult decisions based on what’s right and not let their own prejudices come to the fore in their response. Consider How Your Reactions Affect Other People When people are depending on you, you don’t have the luxury of freaking out. Several of the crisis responders that the Guardian spoke to mentioned the importance of not just staying calm, but appearing calm to the people around you, especially when you’re the acknowledged leader in the situation. Sullenberger chose his words carefully (“This is the captain. Brace for impact.”) because, he explains, courage can be contagious. Keeley Foster, deputy assistant commissioner of the London Fire Brigade, points out that not everybody will respond the same way. To keep your team effective, you have to consider each person’s reaction: I’m naturally calm but the way you lead the people around you is important, too, and you have to change your leadership style to handle different people in different ways. Because you’re being directive you can so easily alienate people and once they feel out of the loop, they might not feed you the information you need.","A crisis is, often, an impossible situation.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"There were no reports of earthquake-related damage, injuries, or other issues in New York City, according to Nancy Silvestri, press secretary for the city’s Emergency Management Department. Small earthquakes are felt in New York City every few years, said Jana Pursley, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, though more damaging earthquakes only strike the Northeast’s urban corridor, which includes New York City, about twice a century. The last two severe earthquakes in New York City, she added, took place in 1737 and 1884, before the magnitudes of earthquakes were even measured. The last time an earthquake of any note shook the city was in 2011, when a quake centered in Virginia sent thousands of New Yorkers in Midtown Manhattan scrambling into the streets. Evan Jackson, 30, remembers panicking during the 2011 quake, when he evacuated his office building in Downtown Brooklyn and looked up at the tall buildings. “I thought, ‘I should probably get back into the building’” to avoid any falling debris, he said. Mr. Jackson said he was “loafing” in bed yesterday when he felt it shake and saw his blinds and mirror move. “It was pretty light,” he said, unfazed. “This time, I didn’t even get off the bed.” Did you feel yesterday’s earthquake? What did it feel like? Let us know in the comments. Here’s what else is happening: Weather You won’t be shaking or trembling too much today, if you wear a warm coat.

"Ray Sanchez, Madeline Holcombe and Eliott C. McLaughlin, CNN","(CNN) More than 1,000 aftershocks of magnitude 1.5 or greater have shaken Alaska since Friday's big quak e knocked out power, ripped open roads and splintered buildings in Anchorage, US Geological Survey geophysicist Randy Baldwin said Sunday. The majority were of a magnitude of 2.5 or weaker, meaning they weren't likely felt. But more than 350 of the aftershocks were higher than 2.5, according to USGS data. Still, local officials said life was returning to normal after Friday's magnitude 7 earthquake, even as 4 to 8 inches of snow was expected Sunday. ""This is the second-largest earthquake we've had since 1964, which was a very significant earthquake,"" Anchorage Mayor Ethan Berkowitz told reporters Saturday, referring to the 9.2 quake that was the most powerful recorded in US history. ""In terms of a disaster, I think it says more about who we are than what we suffered,"" Berkowitz said. ""I would characterize this as a demonstration that Anchorage is prepared for these kind of emergencies."" Alaskans resilient to damage No fatalities or serious injuries were reported, officials said. In Alaska's largest city -- with a population of about 300,000 -- airports, hospitals, emergency services and most businesses were operating. ""The power is up. The heat is on. The communication lines are opening,"" said Anchorage Municipal Manager Bill Falsey. Most of the aftershocks have not rattled Alaskans. But 12 as of Sunday morning more powerful than 4.5 struck near Anchorage and Big Lake, the USGS says. A 5.2 aftershock about 11 p.m. Friday was the second-biggest since a 5.7 temblor hit minutes after the main quake, said Gavin Hayes, a research geophysicist with the USGS. ""That would have given people a shake and probably a bit of a scare given what they went through yesterday,"" he told CNN. The 7.0 earthquake sent residents scurrying for cover when it hit about 8:30 a.m. Friday. The quake was centered 10 miles northeast of Anchorage. ""The most striking thing about this event was that it was so close to Anchorage,"" Hayes said. ""That's why it has caused the damage that we're seeing."" The earthquake was not unusual for the region and probably wouldn't have received much attention had it not struck so close to town, he said. Roads buckled under passing cars and products tumbled from shelves. In court, panicked attorneys scurried under tables as a room rocked from side to side. ""It was very loud when it came,"" Berkowitz said Friday. ""It was very clear that this was something bigger than what we normally experience. We live in earthquake country... but this was a big one."" Palmer resident Kristin Dossett described the initial jolt as ""absolutely terrifying."" It was the biggest quake she has felt in her 37 years in a region where temblors are common, Dossett said. One aftershock moved her piano a foot and half from the wall. ""It just didn't stop. It kept going and got louder and louder, and things just fell everywhere everything off my dressers, off my bookcases, my kitchen cupboard. Just broken glass everywhere."" Philip Peterson was in a multistory building in downtown Anchorage as the structure swayed and coffee mugs fell from tables and tiles from the ceiling. ""I just jumped under my desk and had to ride it out,"" Peterson said. Authorities don't have firm figures on damage yet, though the Anchorage Police Department reported ""major infrastructure damage"" around the city. Helicopters and drones were assessing infrastructure across the region. There were no reports of missing people, authorities saidala. Alaska Regional Hospital and Providence Alaska Medical Center suffered damage but were able to keep emergency rooms open.

Aimée Lutkin,"California began using an earthquake warning system this summer that notifies citizens of seismic shifts coming to their area. In theory, that should give you a little time to prepare for the earth moving. Heres what to do with those extra seconds. And it may be only a matter of seconds, according to the L.A. Times. The speed with which people receive that phone buzz relates to how close they are to the quakes epicenter. However, that could make all the difference, since you have a little time to get out of the way of potential falling objects, for instance. This is what you should do: While Driving Pull over! That might be easy, but its also advised that you avoid bridges, overpasses, signs, and power lines. Thats a taller order out on the highway, and maybe something to think about on your daily commute. Where would you pull over? Once youve stopped, set your parking brake and wait until the shaking stops. While Walking Around This is also an issue of finding a spot to stand away from things like power lines, walls, buildings, or other things that could drop on top of you. Remember, falling debris could also come from the side. The more open space there is around you, the better. Drop to the ground, cover your head, and hold on. While In Bed Unless youre under a skylight or something else likely to break on top of you, stay in your bed. Turn on your stomach and cover your head and neck with a pillow for protection from falling ceiling pieces. While At The Beach The danger on a beach is a possible tsunami. Dont take a chance just because theres been no warningget out of there. After the quake ends, walk inland or to high ground immediately. California offers tsunami maps to show which beaches are vulnerable to the big waves. If you cant get away, go into a concrete or steel-frame building. A tsunami can easily wipe out a wood-frame house. While At The Theater If youre at The Greek, for instance, you will want to get down in front of your seat and cover your head and neck. Be careful while exiting after the quake, as debris could still fall from above. While Out With Kids If youre holding an infant, press them against your chest, drop to the ground and cover them with your body like a cage. With mobile kids, the best position to take is on the ground on all fours, because that protects most of your vital organs. instruct them to drop down and take cover, if its available. If not, and youre inside, a corner of the room away from exterior walls and windows is the best place to hunker down. Do Not Run, Do Not Stand In A Doorway A lot of people get hurt while running during an earthquake. The warning system will hopefully give people a moment to do their running, but once the shaking starts, you should stop. Even if you make it to an exit, theres often a lot of debris around doorways. Old adobe houses that are unreinforced are safest in the doorway, but thats about it for most structures. In fact, standing in a doorway can be more dangerous, because that door will slam right on you during the quake. Its time to put that common misconception about earthquake safety to bed.","California began using an earthquake warning system this summer that notifies citizens of seismic shifts coming to their area.

Mark Kaufman,"What's up in earthquake country?
A compelling new report authored by two U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) researchers found that three powerful California faults have been strangely almost impossibly quiet for the last 100 years. Digging into the soil around these faults, Glenn Biasi and Kate Scharer found that big, earth-rupturing earthquakes have been a regular occurrence in the temblor-prone land over the last 1000 years.  
That's what makes the last 100 years so unusual.
""We should not see gaps of 100 years,"" Biasi said.
This study, published in Seismological Research Letters, is valuable to consider, not just for what it says about the region's past, but what it could mean for California's shaky future. Here are the big takeaways.
1. Expect the next century to be...busier 
While scientists cannot predict earthquakes, records of past temblors (preserved by transformation and changes in the ground) give researchers like Biasi a coherent understanding of how faults generally behave. Three of California's most important faults the San Andreas, San Jacinto, and Hayward carry most of the Golden State's load as they separate the massive Pacific plate from the great North American plate. These colossal slabs of Earth's crust are incessantly pushing and sliding against one another. 
At some point, something has to give. 
""The next century has to be busier than the last one.""
In the years between 1800 and 1918, there was a lot of give, with eight big, ground-rupturing quakes preserved in the geologic record. The most famous of these temblors, the infamous 1906 San Francisco quake, dramatically thrust the ground forward some 20 feet.
Now, after years of quietude, the pressure is building along these faults.
""It's reasonable that if theres a long quiescence we would expect a higher rate for the next 100 years,"" said John Vidale, a seismologist and director of the Southern California Earthquake Center.

It's unknown just how many more big quakes (of magnitude 6.5 or higher) might occur this century. But it's unwise to ignore the averages of past quaking activity. There's been three or four per century. So after the recent century of quiet, there may be a bit more action.
""The next century has to be busier than the last one,"" said Biasi. ""Our studies suggest that those probabilities are somewhat higher."" 
2. But we're not on the verge of an earthquake storm
Although it only takes one terrible quake to traumatize a region, the lack of big quakes over the last 100 years doesn't mean there's a looming flurry of violent temblors. 
""Were not on the verge of some earthquake storm in the next couple years,"" said Vidale. When faults have been quiet for some time, the risk for movement on a fault or section of a fault might double, at most, he explained. But it's not as if everything is now ready to blow.

""It's not that [the odds of a quake] skyrocket,"" said Vidale. ""The danger might be doubled but not everything is overdue. It's not 10-months pregnant.""
SEE ALSO: The West accepts its drought-ridden future, slashes water use
A still unknown circumstance hiding beneath the ground may be responsible for quiet along California's weighty faults, noted Biasi. The exceptional odds of such a quiet 100-year-period happening which came out to the extremely low odds of just 0.3 percent according to their models isn't some rare, statistical accident, emphasized Biasi. There may be some geologic events, or organization, transpiring below ground and slowing or suspending California's big faults. ""It's more likely there's some organizing influence at work,"" he said, noting that the busy quake activity in the preceding century may have changed or trigged something, like a freeway accident causing a pileup, but the road ahead is unusually (and temporarily) empty. 
""It may be that the organization [NR: what does he mean by organization?] is due to a flurry of activity from 1800 to 1918,"" Biasi said. 
3. The critical message
It's likely that Californians will see more quakes in the next century. To David Jackson, a California seismologist who has researched earthquake rates, that means that Californians need to remain prepared regardless of projected earthquake rates.
""We always need to be concerned about earthquakes,"" said Jackson.
He has some advice.
""Every time you hear the word 'earthquake' take a step to improve your resiliency,"" Jackson said. ""Do something.""
""Do something.""
Jackson himself, a renowned geologist, admits he still hasn't done all he can do to prepare for a quake. He recommends hopping online to the USGS, Southern California Earthquake Center, or The Great California ShakeOut, and learn how to prepare.
A major quake can rupture the pipes carrying water to your community. Do you have enough water a gallon a day per person to survive? Should you run outside during a quake (NO!)? Do you have a radio should cell towers go down? How do you shut off your leaking gas line? The violent shaking stopped now what do you do?

It's going to happen. ""A nice sharp jolt under the city could wreak havoc,"" said Vidale. 
But this inevitability might be easy to forget, after it's been relatively quiet. 
""People forget how expensive and disruptive an earthquake would be,"" said Vidale. This includes, critically, the government, who maintains or oversees roads, infrastructure, and building standards. ""The implication is were probably a bit complacent. The next 100 years might be a bit more exciting than average.""
4. The earthquake case is still open
This latest study underscores the point that it's been quiet in quake country and that's likely to change. But both Jackson and Vidale emphasize that the past century might not be as quiet as it appears. 
For one, there have been dramatic quakes along lesser faults, like the deadly 1994 Northridge, 1989 Loma Prieta (which stopped a World Series game), and 1971 Sylmar quakes. ""If you look at all the quakes that have happened, there's not a hiatus, said Vidale. The USGS's Biasi certainly isn't saying there's been a total quake drought just a drought of big quakes along the major faults. 
But Jackson, who five years ago posed a question about California's temblor hiatus in the talk ""Did Someone Forget to Pay the Earthquake Bill?,"" is skeptical that all the past quakes identified in this study by observing notable displacements in the ground were actually caused by earthquakes. His implication is if there were less quakes in past, perhaps the recent dearth of quakes wouldn't be so exceptional.

Until around 1900, humanity didn't have a means of scientifically measuring earthquakes, so our quake record is based upon observing clues of movement in the ground, a science called paleoseismology. Many of these fissures and breaks in the earth are almost certainly evidence of quakes. But other ground alterations might have come from other natural events, said Jackson. (These include things like major debris flows and erosion.)  
""Theyre pretty confident that every one of those displacements they see are the result of an earthquake,"" said Jackson. ""I dont quite accept that."" (Though, it should be noted that Biasi and Scharer addressed this in their paper: The deformation of the land around faults is often different than land alterations elsewhere.)
""It sheared my grandfather's house off the ground.""
But the past earthquake rates, said Jackson, still aren't the critical point. 
""Whether or not the story is true isn't as important as a reminder that earthquakes are happening,"" he said. 
Indeed, they are even if it's been temporarily calm along the big geologic players. But they'll hit again. Sometimes at 6:01 a.m., when you're tucked in bed, in calm, idyllic, California.  
The early morning 1971 Sylmar quake hit Biasi hard. ""It dumped all the dishes out of our house. It sheared my grandfather's house off the ground,"" he said. 
""That was my gentle introduction to earthquakes.""",What's up in earthquake country?

"Catie Keck on Earther, shared by Catie Keck to Gizmodo","Alaska is now beginning to survey the damage of powerful back-to-back earthquakes that struck the area around Anchorage on Friday, an event that resulted in significant damage to buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. Speaking with reporters following the quake, Alaska Governor Bill Walker said that resulting disruption and needed repairs could last quite some time. A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck around 8:29 a.m. local time followed by ensuing, smaller earthquakes. Citing United States Geological Survey research geophysicist Gavin Hayes, CNN reported Saturday that a magnitude-5.2 aftershock about 11 p.m. Friday was the second-biggest event since a magnitude-5.7 temblor hit minutes after the main quake. Despite earthquakes being common in the area, Fridays event was still significant. Videos shared on social media captured widespread damage across Anchorage and the surrounding area. One video shared by climatologist Brian Brettschneider on Twitter captured drone footage of cracks in ice at Anchorages Waldron Lake. According to Brettschneider, the ice was 8 inches thick. Nat Herz, a reporter for Alaska Public Media, told NPR that he was sitting at a coffee shop in Anchorage when he just felt like sort of a rumble or a buzz. But then things kind of got louder, and things started really shaking and shaking hard. And people were kind of looking around, he told NPR. And then I think, you know, someone went for the door, and everyone else went for the door. And, you know, everyone kind of hurried outside. And kind of once things settled down, everyone went back in. At least two highways were closed down following the earthquake, with local CBS affiliate KTVA reporting that areas Glenn Highway endured significant damage that included a massive sinkhole. Power losses also reportedly affected tens of thousands of people following the initial earthquake. Governor Walker said in a phone interview Friday that theres a possibility that some infrastructure damage could take weeks or months to repair, especially given the winter season. Walker also said he spoke with President Donald Trump, after which call KTVA reported the Federal Emergency Management Agency approved assistance for the area. Its going to be a disruption for quite some time, Walker said. Weve been on the phone with the White House a number of times today [and] took a call from President Trump. They talked about their desire to help us, and we appreciate that very much. According to Alaska Public Media, schools in the area are expected to be closed until at least Wednesday of next week.","Alaska is now beginning to survey the damage of powerful back-to-back earthquakes that struck the area around Anchorage on Friday, an event that resulted in significant damage to buildings, roads, and other infrastructure.

THOMAS FULLER and INYOUNG KANG,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Heres the sign-up.) The turnout was thin in Berkeley on Thursday for ShakeOut, an earthquake drill that has expanded to seismic-prone areas across the globe. Its the 10th anniversary of the drill, which was conceived as a way to remind California residents of the dangers of earthquakes and to remind them to drop to the floor, cover their head and neck, and crawl under a desk when they feel the shaking start. Forrest Lanning, the earthquake program manager in California for FEMA, warned the handful of reporters in attendance at the Berkeley event that many Californians will be on their own after an earthquake hits. FEMA is not going to be able to come in and save everybody, he said. Mr. Lanning, an engineer who lived for four years in New Zealand when that country was rebuilding after the series of earthquakes in Christchurch, said one of the biggest problems California will face after an earthquake is housing. In a state already suffering a homeless and housing crisis, a large earthquake could force hundreds of thousands of people out of their dwellings. Mr. Lanning said there were no good answers about how California will handle earthquake homelessness.","Inside an earthquake simulator trailer in Berkeley, municipal employees and others experienced the shaking of a magnitude 7.0 quake that pushed some of them off the seats they’d been sitting on.",2018-10-19T12:57:55Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",California Today: California Today: What an Earthquake Could Do to the State’s Housing Crisis,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/us/california-today-earthquake-drill.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/19/us/19californiatoday-1/19californiatoday-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,quake,1

Then, a large wave can be seen rolling toward the shore. As the wave struck, people on top of the building shouted and scrambled to get away. The water surged around a mosque, whose large green dome had collapsed, probably from the quake. Mr. Mangantis aunt and cousin, who lived by the coast, are among the many missing. His sister, who lives in Jakarta, has been frantically trying to reach her relatives over phone lines that are working only sporadically. Im so worried that I could not sleep the whole night, she said.

CARLOTTA GALL,"Ms. Kocoglu said she and her colleagues understood within an hour of the closing of polls Sunday night that they were watching Turkeys most momentous change since Mr. Erdogan took power. Even the most remote areas of the Istanbul metropolitan area showed a defeat for Mr. Erdogans mayoral candidate.
As of Monday night, results from the High Election Council had still not been fully released and Mr. Erdogans party had not conceded defeat in Istanbul. But the tally showed the opposition candidate, Ekrem Imamoglu, ahead with 99 percent of the votes counted.
The Republican Peoples Party, long criticized for a lack of organization, for once was well prepared. Mr. Imamoglu, 49, a former district mayor, mobilized thousands of volunteers to observe the election at every ballot box in the greater metropolitan area and record the count on a specially designed application, giving the party its own independent tabulation.
We were able to compare our numbers with theirs, Ms. Kocoglu said.
A decisive moment came at 9 p.m. Sunday when Mr. Erdogan gave his first speech of the evening, claiming victory for the AKP overall in the municipal district elections. The election commission suddenly stopped releasing election results for Istanbul, as did the semiofficial Anadolu news agency, which is widely followed on election nights as the source favored by the government for results.
The presidents camp had already seen which way the vote was going and had stopped the count, said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research institute. They stopped it to think what they could do, he said. There was even discussion of some kind of intervention, he said.
We were very afraid, Ms. Kocoglu said. She recalled several elections when the election commission had stopped releasing details in the count, only to resume later and show an unlikely jump in favor of the ruling party.","The feeble economy and a disciplined opposition showed that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has dominated for nearly two decades, has weaknesses.",2019-04-01T21:53:44Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",A Political Quake in Turkey as Erdogan’s Party Loses in His Home Base of Support,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/world/europe/turkey-erdogan-election-loss.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/01/world/01turkey2/01turkey2-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,quake,1
Mary Beth Griggs,"Shaking from the large earthquake that shuddered through Anchorage, Alaska last week was strong enough to turn smooth asphalt roads into broken, jagged depressions of rubble. But within just a few days, crews managed to repair the worst of the damage, unsnarling traffic in Alaska’s largest city. Anchorage has a population of nearly 300,000 people spread across more than 1,900 square miles — an area larger than the state of Rhode Island. That space is threaded by roads, asphalt lifelines of the population. When the magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck last week, some of the most visceral images showed roads that had broken apart. But within days, many of these same cracked highways had been smoothed back into ribbons of pavement by crews working around the clock. “We have more quakes than any other state in the Union.” The rapid response to damage in Anchorage shows how investing time and money into preparations for these kinds of large, infrastructure-hobbling events can pay off in the long-run, even when there’s no way to tell when or where disaster may strike. “We have more quakes than any other state in the Union,” says Shannon McCarthy, a spokesperson with the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities. As a result, Alaska takes its earthquake preparation very seriously. The largest earthquake ever recorded in the country shook Anchorage to its core in 1964, causing a deadly tsunami and leaving in its wake damaged buildings, buckled roads, and a legacy that inspired years of earthquake preparation and policies. Strong building codes put in place post-1964 helped make the area more secure than other earthquake-prone areas, like Seattle. Extraordinary that we had 0 casualties in this earthquake & only a few injuries. The resilience of Alaskans & our buildings is a testament to lessons learned from the '64 quake & speaks to our level of preparedness. Repair crews are hard at work but we still have a ways to go. pic.twitter.com/i5PvvkAtYT — Sen. Lisa Murkowski (@lisamurkowski) December 5, 2018 The 50th anniversary of the 1964 quake took place just four years ago, and officials took the opportunity to update their earthquake plans, hold drills, and generally prepare for when a quake would hit in the future. “I think that really helped,” McCarthy said. Over the past six months, a less ground-shaking development also helped prepare the teams on the ground for that moment. In March, a truck slammed into a bridge on the only major road connecting Anchorage to one of its suburbs, shutting down the throughway for days. In the months after the collision, the Department of Transportation went through and updated its recovery plans in the event of another damaging incident. All that preparation readied Alaska residents to spring into action as soon as the shaking from the initial quake subsided. Bridge inspectors based in Alaska’s capital, Juneau, packed and got on a plane that night. Arriving before midnight, they immediately started checking on the 243 bridges that had been impacted by the shaking. After checking in on damaged homes and offices, government employees and contractors within the quake zone also got to work, readying themselves to do a job that wouldn’t be easy during this time of year. Working 24/7, they cleared away the broken asphalt, saving it to be melted down at a later date. Then, crews with heavy equipment began digging out water-saturated sediments that slipped or sunk during the quake. They trucked in or gathered fresh material and compacted it, creating a sturdy earthwork base. Atop that, they placed large rocks, finer gravel, and finally, asphalt. “Our asphalt plants were all shut down for the winter,” McCarthy says. Thick and tarry, asphalt needs to be heated up from a solid form before it can be spread out in a thick layer to make a road. But Alaska in late fall is bitterly cold, and frozen asphalt can take a week or longer to melt into a sticky, pliable material. Soon after the earthquake struck, owners of asphalt plants switched on their heaters. “We were fortunate that they did that.” McCarthy says. “By the time we’d finished the earthworks, the asphalt plants were ready to go.” Frozen asphalt can take a week or longer to melt into a sticky, pliable material According to McCarthy, it was one of the first times that paving had ever occurred in winter. Snow was moving in to the area quickly, but the still-warm asphalt stayed clear just long enough for the crews to paint temporary lines on the roads. They couldn’t use the paint typically used on Alaska roads, an epoxy filled with glass beads and grit that prevents cars from skidding. It’s made to withstand the brutal wear and tear Alaskans put on their roads during the colder months, when layers of sand and tires wrapped in chains keep cars on the road, but would swiftly wear other paints down into oblivion. Unlike the asphalt, applying this paint has to wait for summer, when the weather is more amenable than it is now. The crews worked through some days of heavy, wet snow, high winds of 65 miles per hour. And the weather wasn’t the only natural element being a pain — the ground shook with near constant aftershocks. In addition to inducing seasickness in several Alaskans, the shaking also carved crescent-shaped bites out of some of the roadways, or shook the ground so hard that the soil under the freshly paved roads settled, forcing a do-over. Alaska DOT &PF Repaired road near Mirror Lake. The earthquake hit on Friday morning at 8:29AM local time. By the next Wednesday at 4AM, all eight major transportation corridors that had been severely damaged by the quake had re-opened. Dozens of others are still awaiting repair, and officials are asking selfie-takers to stay away from their still-cracked surfaces, no matter how visually appealing they might be. Similar situations play out in other places of the world, especially at bottlenecks where a web of roads narrows down to a precious few lanes. Japan can fix an intersection-eating sinkhole in less than a week. California, which has seen far more dramatic earthquake-induced road damage, has comparable plans in place. As impressive as the completed sections are, this is still just a temporary fix. While most roads in Alaska have to be built to last for 20 years, these are only meant to carry people through the summer. When warmer weather returns, the asphalt plants will spark to burbling life again, and the crews will return to the same once-shattered spots to build more permanent roads. “we’re particularly vulnerable if there is a break in the line” Roads are important threads of human civilization around the world, but they are especially entwined in Alaskan life, where wilderness is only sparsely dotted with towns, and there are fewer detours available to re-direct traffic. “Alaska is different from many states in that in many cases we usually only have one road in and one road out. That’s true with Anchorage. We have one road to the north and one road to the south, so we’re particularly vulnerable if there is a break in the line,” McCarthy says. In this case, breaks in the line were swiftly repaired, mirroring quake recovery in other areas of the city. Supply lines stayed intact, utilities were swiftly restored, damage was minimal, and, most importantly, there were no fatalities. In some ways, the minimal damage and recovery offer a beacon of hope to communities facing down other natural hazards, whether that’s hurricanes, fires, floods, rising sea levels, or more earthquakes. Preparation makes a difference. “In terms of a disaster, I think it says more about who we are than what we suffered,” Anchorage Mayor Ethan Berkowitz said Saturday at a press briefing, according to the AP. “People pulled together. We followed the plans that were in place. We looked after one another. And when people around the country and around the world look at this, they’re going to say, ‘We want to do things in the Anchorage way because Anchorage did this right,’” Berkowitz said.","Shaking from the large earthquake that shuddered through Anchorage, Alaska last week was strong enough to turn smooth asphalt roads into broken, jagged depressions of rubble.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Moment the quake struck caught on camera Some 10,000 people have been evacuated on the Indonesian island of Lombok after a powerful 6.9 magnitude quake on Sunday left more than 90 people dead. Witnesses spoke of chaos and terror as buildings collapsed and power and communication lines were cut. Boats have been sent to evacuate more than 1,000 tourists from the nearby Gili islands. Aid agencies said the priority was to provide shelter for residents too scared to return to their homes. The agencies said the impact was far bigger than another quake that hit Lombok last week, killing 16 people. What's the latest on Lombok? Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, said that the northern area of Lombok had suffered massive damage. Three C-130 Hercules aircraft and two helicopters have been deployed to deliver tents and medical aid, but the earthquake has brought down roads and bridges, making areas difficult to reach. Electricity supply in the worst-affected areas has been cut off and telecommunication networks are not working. Image copyright AFP Image caption Staff take patients outside as a safety measure at a hospital in Mataram The death toll stands at 91, all Indonesians, but Mr Sutopo said that number would ""definitely increase"". At least another 200 people have been injured. He pointed to the situation at a collapsed mosque in the village of Lading-Lading in north Lombok, where a lack of heavy lifting equipment had made it difficult to locate victims. One official said 80% of north Lombok had suffered damage. The main city of Mataram was also badly affected, with medical staff struggling to cope with the injured at the damaged hospitals. What about the Gili islands? Situated off the north-west of Lombok and popular with backpackers and divers, they were badly hit, with a number of hotels damaged. Video and still images showed hundreds of tourists flocking to the beach to be evacuated. There have been reports of deaths on the islands but these have not been confirmed. Hundreds of tourists have been taken off by boat, but hundreds still remain. Image copyright Laura Milne Image caption Tourists await evacuation on Gili Trawangan ""We cannot evacuate all of them all at once because we don't have enough capacity on the boats,"" Muhammad Faozal, of West Nusa Tenggara's tourism agency, told AFP. ""It's understandable they want to leave the Gilis, they are panicking."" What have victims and witnesses been saying? Helen Milne told the BBC that her daughter, Laura, from Oxfordshire in the UK, is on the island of Gili Trawangan. She said: ""They are stuck on the island and are reporting rioting, fighting, and people can't get on boats. There's no water, no food, the shops have been ransacked. It's a rapidly deteriorating situation out there for them."" Another Briton on Gili Trawangan, James Kelsall, told the Press Association the subsequent tsunami warning was the most terrifying part. ""All the locals were frantically running and screaming, putting on life jackets. We followed them up to higher ground, which was a steep, uneven climb to the top of a hill in darkness."" The tsunami warning was lifted after a few hours. Margret Helgadottir, from Iceland, told Agence France-Presse people screamed as the roof of her hotel on Gili Air collapsed. ""We just froze, thankfully we were outside. Everything went black, it was terrible."" Singapore's Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, on the 10th floor of a hotel room in Mataram, said on Facebook: ""Walls cracked, it was quite impossible to stand up."" And the aid agencies? Dini Widiastuti, executive director of Plan International Indonesia, told the BBC that the top priority was to provide shelter. ""Thousands of people, including children, are still just out in the fields, not properly protected. The impact is very widespread in Lombok and actually this is bigger than the first earthquake last week, so it is difficult."" Meili Narti, from Oxfam, said the government was trying to set up centres to which people could safely evacuate, but colleagues were saying some people did not have sufficient food, water or shelter. What about Bali? At least one death has been reported unofficially but it has not been confirmed. The airport has suffered some damage but is operating. The quake was felt for several seconds. One worker in Denpasar described the scene to the BBC. ""They were initially just little shocks but then they started to get bigger and bigger and people started to shout 'earthquake', then all the staff panicked and rushed out of the building,"" he said. Model and presenter Chrissy Teigen, who is on holiday in Bali, described 15 seconds of a tremor, followed by ""so many aftershocks"". Skip Twitter post by @chrissyteigen another aftershock just now. probably the 8th one we have felt since the big one last night. we are safe, up high and nothing around us. thinking about everyone around us and in Lombok especially. — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) August 6, 2018 End of Twitter post by @chrissyteigen What are the quake details? The earthquake was of magnitude 6.9, according to the US Geological Survey. It struck at 19:46 local time (11:46 GMT) on Sunday at a fairly shallow depth of 31km (19 miles). There have been more than 130 aftershocks since the quake hit. Lombok is a roughly 4,500 sq km (1,700 sq miles) island east of the slightly larger island of Bali. The two islands are home to about three and four million people respectively. Both are popular with tourists who visit beaches and hiking trails. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim. More than half of the world's active volcanoes above sea level are part of the ring. Have you been affected by the earthquake?

The government is scrambling to get aid to the worst-hit area in the mountainous province of Kermanshah, where hundreds of homes were destroyed. More than 400 people were killed and about 7,000 injured when the quake hit near the Iran-Iraq border on Sunday. Iran has declared Tuesday a national day of mourning. President Hassan Rouhani is due to visit the region. Iranian officials said 413 people had died in the country. In the more sparsely populated areas across the border in Iraq, officials said nine people had died and several hundred were injured. Iranian state TV said thousands of survivors were spending another night in makeshift camps or in the open. Many whose homes were still intact were frightened of returning because of dozens of aftershocks. ""It is a very cold night... we need help. We need everything. The authorities should speed up their help,"" said one homeless young woman in Sarpol-e-Zahab, where most of the victims died. One aid agency said 70,000 people needed shelter and the UN said it was ""ready to assist if required"".

""Newly constructed buildings... held up well, but the old houses built with earth were totally destroyed,"" he told state TV while visiting the affected region. The Iranian Red Crescent said many areas lacked water and electricity and that aid supplies were being hampered by blocked roads. Iranian army helicopters were taking part in the relief effort. About 30 Red Crescent teams are working in the earthquake zone, the official Irna news agency reported. Media caption The moment the Iran-Iraq quake hits Darbandikhan Dam control room Authorities said that more than 30,000 houses had been damaged and at least two villages completely destroyed. The 7.3-magnitude quake - the deadliest in the world this year - struck at 21:18 local time (18:18 GMT) about 30km (19 miles) south of Darbandikhan, near the north-eastern border with Iran, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said. Tremors were felt as far away as Turkey, Israel and Kuwait. In Sarpol-e-Zahab on Monday a woman and her baby were pulled alive from rubble, Iranian media said.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"A powerful earthquake struck Taiwan today, causing damage and a partially collapsed hotel building, sources report. The USGS reports that the magnitude 6.4 quake struck 21 kilometers (13 miles) north of the city of Hualien at 10:50 U.S. Eastern Time, at a shallow 9.5 kilometers (6 miles) below the surface. No tsunami warnings have been issued. The English-language Taiwan News and the BBC report that a number of buildings have collapsed in Hualien City, including a roof of a hotel. There are no reports of injuries yet. Residents as far away as Taipei (around 120 kilometers (75 miles) north) could feel tremors. This is the second powerful earthquake in the area in just a few days. A magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck in nearly the same spot on Sunday (Monday Taiwan time). Taiwan’s location on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire means they’re no stranger to tremors. Many of the country’s buildings are built to withstand some shaking. With a quake of this size there’s always the potential for aftershocks. “We haven’t seen any large enough here to record yet,” John Bellini from the USGS told Gizmodo. “But don’t have the local instrumentation they would have. I wouldn’t be surprised for there to be a number of aftershocks in the next couple of days.” This story is developing. We will update the post when we know more.

THOMAS ERDBRINK,"Iranian officials put the epicenter of the quake inside Iran, near the border town of Ezgeleh. The region is a patchwork of farms and is home to many Kurds, a large ethnic minority in Iran. Initial reports from the Kurdish region of Iraq indicated less damage and fewer deaths on that side of the border. In Sulaimaniya, the second-largest city in Iraq’s Kurdish region, residents described feeling heavy tremors but said there was no notable building damage. Residents in the oil-rich town of Kirkuk, some 50 miles to the west, reported similar damage. The earthquake was felt as far as the Mediterranean coast of Israel. Shiite pilgrims in the Iraqi city of Kerbala, for the annual religious commemoration of Arba’een, posted videos of people gathering on the streets after the earthquake occurred. Iran lies on dozens of fault lines and is prone to quakes. In 2012, a double earthquake in the north of the country killed 300 people. When ordinary Iranians learned of the government’s lackluster relief efforts, some started organizing aid groups themselves. In 2003, more than 20,000 people were killed and an ancient citadel was destroyed in the southern city of Bam. After that quake, the United States, which does not maintain normal diplomatic relations with Iran, sent several planeloads of aid.

He grew up in San Jose, Calif., and moved to Homer 18 years ago to be closer to his wifes family (they have since divorced). His hometown was suburbia at its finest, or worst, depending on your take, he said. Its a great place for me to visit and to vacation for a week.

THOMAS FULLER,"With the median price of a home in California now above $500,000, estimates of the potential uncovered losses in an earthquake run into the hundreds of billions of dollars. Economists say a large earthquake could have serious repercussions for local California banks. And with one-fifth of America’s $10 trillion in mortgage debt held in California, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the government mortgage finance giants that guarantee much of America’s mortgage debt, are also exposed to the risk, economists say. Those who have lived through major earthquakes recount how damaging they can be, even to ordinary wood-structure homes, which are considered among the safest. Art Polan and his wife were still sleeping when the Northridge earthquake struck their two-story home in 1994. Bookshelves crashed to the floor, and the china in the kitchen spilled out of closets. “The house was totaled,” Mr. Polan said. The insurance payout he received was not enough to rebuild the house, so with the help of a federal loan, he moved and built elsewhere. Cindy Watter remembers the Napa earthquake of 2014 sounding like “a runaway train full of howling beasts was outside my back door.” Her two-story Victorian home, built in 1895, had relatively light damage, but her neighbors were not as lucky. One house burned to the ground because of a gas fire. “Lots of people around here took a real financial hit and couldn’t afford to fix up their houses, so they sold them and moved away,” Ms. Watter said. “I still have earthquake insurance because, well, you never know.” Insurance is not a panacea, experts say. Even if every building in California were insured, a large earthquake could nonetheless have a devastating impact on the economy.","Experts warn that California property, both commercial and residential, is vastly underinsured. “What are we going to do when no one has insurance and everyone has damage?”",2018-08-31T18:40:07Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","In Quake-Prone California, Alarm at Scant Insurance Coverage",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/us/california-earthquake-insurance.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/30/us/00quakeinsurance-01/00quakeinsurance-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,quake,1
"Matt Rivers, Jo Shelley and Ben Westcott, CNN","(CNN) Desperation is growing in the stricken Indonesian city of Palu, as residents faced a fifth day without adequate supplies of food and clean drinking water, amid a sharp rise in the official death toll following Friday's devastating earthquake and tsunami. Indonesia's national disaster agency said the number of people killed in the disaster had risen to 1,234 on Tuesday. The toll is expected to continue to climb in the coming days as bodies continue to be retrieved from under the rubble. The situation for those left alive has grown increasingly dire, as families scramble to get even the most basic of goods. On Tuesday, motorists lined up for hours around the block in the blazing sun, standing among the ruins and debris, in the hope of obtaining a small amount of gas. At the last available gas pump in town, large group of men crowd around a single overworked attendant. In his hand is a wad of cash nearly too big to grip. Money though is of little use when their is nothing left to buy. Roads to Palu -- a city of 350,000 people -- remain blocked and aid has been slow to trickle in. Indonesian vessels carrying food and water has still yet to arrive. Indonesian military have been patrolling the streets in Palu over the past 24 hours to crack down looting by desperate survivors, searching for limited supplies and goods. An official from the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent described the situation on the ground as ""nightmarish."" Bodies of victims remain unburied on the side of the roads. In a public cemetery on the outskirts of the city, workers are digging a mass grave the size of a football pitch to try to bury as many bodies as quickly as possible before disease begins to spread. Almost 200 bodies are in this pit alone, with more still being added every hour. A few ID cards lie on the ground next to the pit, but not all bodies have been identified before they were laid to rest. Amid the long wait for supplies and aid, the desperate search continues for survivors with reports of more than 700 houses buried under a mudslide in a nearby town, which still remain unexplored. 'I need to get the kids out of here' An estimated 2.4 million people have been affected by the disaster, according to Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. He said Tuesday that 799 were injured, and more than 61,000 people have been displaced. In total, Sutopo said 66,000 homes had been destroyed so far. Desperate to leave the scene of the disaster and escape the treat of looting, thousands of locals were queuing at Palu airport with children and belongings in the hope of a way out. ""People are trying to get stuff from my house so I needed to get the kids out of here... they're trying to rob us,"" one local woman told CNN Monday as she waited in line at the airport. While some residents are battling to escape the surrounding area, international aid organizations and Indonesian military are trying their hardest to reach as much of the region as possible. Palates of supplies are en route to the affected area courtesy of the organization like the Red Cross, who sent seven tons of logistical supplies from Jakarta on Tuesday. Countries from around the world have begun to announce aid packages for Indonesia as well. Australia, one of the country's closest neighbors, said it had already provided $500,000 of support immediately through the Indonesian Red Cross.

Andrew Freedman,"A magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck about 170 miles southeast of Kodiak, Alaska early Tuesday morning, sending residents of the picturesque island fleeing to higher ground to avoid tsunami waves. The quake also prompted tsunami alerts along the West Coast of the U.S. and Hawaii, but those were canceled after data showed damaging waves were not expected. Since the first quake hit there have been several aftershocks, some of which have been strong earthquakes themselves, with a magnitude of up to 5.3 on the Richter Scale. Reports indicated water fluctuating by up to 1 foot in a channel that feeds into Kodiak Harbor, but no large, damaging waves.

Tom McKay,"A Japanese nuclear power station in Hokkaido is operating on emergency power after the region was hit by a 6.7-magnitude quake in the early hours of Thursday morning, Reuters reported. However, though the event carries unsettling overtones of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, authorities say there is currently no danger of any similar radioactive release occurring. 100 people are injured and 19 missing following the quake on Thursday, Reuters reported, citing Japanese broadcaster NHK. The seismic event knocked out local power, forcing Hokkaido Electric Power’s Tomari nuclear plant to switch to emergency generators to keep its three reactors from overloading. Reuters wrote: The station’s fuel rods are being cooled with emergency power supplied by diesel generators, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Thursday. There were no radiation irregularities at the plant, Suga said, citing the operator. The atomic regulator said the diesel generators have enough fuel to last seven days. The Fukushima incident occurred after an earthquake off the coast of Tōhoku prefecture on Honshu, Japan’s largest island, caused a tsunami. The disaster killed some 19,000 people, as well as knocked out power to and swamped backup generators at the Fukushima facility. The result was three nuclear meltdowns and hydrogen-air explosions that spread a radioactive plume up to 25 miles away, as well as resulted in authorities dumping massive amounts of contaminated material into the oceans. Scientists say most of that radiation quickly faded or was otherwise diluted. Most, but not all, also agree that there is likely a low risk to public health outside of the immediate region of the plant. The primary danger is to the thousands of workers involved in its cleanup. On Wednesday, the New York Times reported, the Japanese government acknowledged the first death of a worker from radiation exposure at the plant, a subcontractor for its operator Tokyo Electric Power Company that developed lung cancer in 2016. Japan idled all of its 54 nuclear power facilities after the incident, but seven have since been reactivated “after a protracted relicensing process,” Reuters wrote. The Conversation wrote last year that the Japanese government estimated the total cost of the Fukushima at around $188 billion, while polls indicated the Japanese public had lost faith in the safety of nuclear power. The cleanup effort at the facility still generates huge amounts of nuclear waste, and Tokyo Electric doesn’t expect to begin clearing fuel debris from the destroyed reactor cores until into the next decade. According to Reuters, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters that he is coordinating emergency response for the earthquake on Thursday. A government spokesman added that a Mitsubishi Steel Manufacturing plant in the city of Muroran also caught fire, but is being brought under control.

Tom McKay,"A “strong magnitude 7.1 earthquake” struck the southern coast of Peru on Sunday morning, leaving at least one dead, several missing, and dozens injured, CNBC reported. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake struck roughly 22.4 miles (36 kilometers) offshore centered about 25 miles (40 km) into the Pacific Ocean from the town of Acari. CNBC reported that local officials said one man was killed by a rock in Yauca. Beyond that, there were some indications that the damage may not be as grim as originally reported. Per the BBC, Health Minister Abel Salinas disputed reports that 17 miners had gone missing inside a collapsed shaft. Reports of another death in Bella Union were also disputed by local officials. Per CNN, the National Civil Defense Institute reported at least 65 additional injuries “in the cities of Arequipa, Ica and Ayacucho.” The casualty count is likely to rise as emergency personnel continue to look through rubble. Though the U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center warned that a wall of water could come crashing onto the shoreline, fortunately no such tsunami actually occurred and the center later advised that the threat had passed. Earthquakes of magnitude 7 and higher are considered major events with the possibility of serious damage or casualties; only an estimated 20 or so occur each year. A magnitude 8.0 quake in 2007 off the central coast of Peru was estimated to have killed well over 500 people and destroyed tens of thousands of buildings. Earthquakes are fairly common in Peru due to its proximity to massive fault lines, as the Christian Science Monitor noted in 2013: Peru is located on the “Ring of Fire,” the belt of earthquakes and volcanoes surrounding the Pacific Ocean. All along its western coast, the South American plate is colliding with the Nazca plate, forcing the heavier ocean crust down into the Earth’s mantle. The collision of the plates is like a slow-motion car wreck. They’re colliding at only 3 inches per year, but that’s enough to cause frequent earthquakes—and build the Andes Mountains. The tectonically active region along the coast of South America, known to geologists as the South American arc, is more than 4,000 miles long, from just below the southern tip of Chile to just off the coast of Panama. Despite the high risk throughout Peru, though, the situation with regards to preparation for seismic events (particularly in construction and building standards) is not so good. A 2012 review found the capital city of Lima, with a population of over nine million, could suffer tens of thousands dead and hundreds of thousands injured if an 8.0 magnitude earthquake hits there.

Steve Dent,"The image above depicts a LiDAR relative elevation model (REM), showing current and previous channels carved out by the Sauk River in Washington State's Skagit and Snohomish counties. In the regular satellite image below, however, only the active, vegetation-free channels are clearly visible -- a striking display of what the technique can reveal. ""REMs are extremely useful in discerning where river channels have migrated in the past by vividly displaying fluvial features such as meander scars, terraces, and oxbow lakes,"" explains Washington State geologist Daniel E. Coe in a PDF. ""This type of information is very informative in channel migration and flood studies, as well as a host of other engineering and habitat assessments."" Carried on special aircraft, LiDAR produces visible-light laser beams. While much of it bounces off of trees and vegetation, enough make it through to the ground. By examining the raw data to see which beams travel the farthest, scientists can ""edit out"" trees, vegetation and man-made structures. That reveals hidden seismic faults, glacial landforms, landslides, lava flows and other features that are invisible on a regular satellite photo. Used in this way, the images also become a fantastic educational tool. Understanding things like drumlins, moraines and kettles can be pretty tough, but seeing a landform stripped to the bare ground brings the concepts to life. Suddenly, it becomes much easier to visualize how glaciers, lava flow (above), tsunamis and other natural phenomena have scarred (and will scar) our planet's surface over time. Considering that they're made by scientific instruments, the LiDAR images also happen to be beautiful (seriously, check them out ). You could even say that like other types of art, they strip away the surface to show things we may not want to see. A great example is the Toe Jam Hill fault scarp (part of the Seattle fault zone), first revealed by a LiDAR scan in the '90s. Subsequent trenching showed that it was the site of a single large earthquake 1,100 years ago, part of the great Seattle subduction quake at around 900 AD. That seismic event has become a part of the oral history and legend of Coast Salish Native Americans in the region, and is an ongoing concern to folks in Washington's Puget Sound area. LiDAR has become an important tool in confirming ancient stories, while helping us learn about future ones -- hopefully before they happen.","LiDAR is having a moment right now helping self-driving cars and robots not hit things, but don't forget about what else it can do.

Reuters Editorial,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - A tsunami killed at least 62 people on the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra and injured hundreds following an underwater landslide caused by a volcanic eruption on Saturday, the disaster mitigation agency said. 
Indonesia sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. Here are some of the major quakes and tsunamis in recent years: 
- 2004: A massive 9.1 magnitude quake on the western coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh. 
- 2005: A series of strong quakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April. Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra. 
- 2006: A 6.8 magnitude quake hit south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, triggering a tsunami that smashed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people. 
- 2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province. More than 1,100 people were killed. 
- 2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake hit one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.

,"At a Glance A powerful 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck Indonesia Sunday evening local time. At least 82 people have been killed, the Associated Press reported. The earthquake was centered in a similar spot as a deadly quake one week ago. A powerful earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok on Sunday, killing at least 82 people and shaking neighboring Bali, one week after another quake on Lombok killed more than a dozen. The latest quake, which triggered a brief tsunami warning, damaged buildings as far away as Denpasar on Bali, including a department store and the airport terminal, where ceiling panels were shaken loose, authorities said. Video showed screaming people running in panic from houses in a Bali neighborhood and vehicles rocking. On Lombok, soldiers and other rescuers carried injured people on stretchers and carpets to an evacuation center. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said the death toll had risen 82 with hundreds others were injured. Earlier officials said at least 39 people had died. A total of 65 of the deaths were in North Lombok district, nine in West Lombok district, four in the provincial capital Mataram and two each in Central Lombok and East Lombok districts, Nugroho said. Thousands of houses were damaged, and most of the dead victims were hit by collapsed houses, Nugroho said. The quake, recorded at magnitude 6.9 by the U.S. Geological Survey, struck at 6:46 p.m. Sunday evening local time in the northern part of Lombok. Strong aftershocks ranging from 5.4- to 4.3-magnitude followed the main quake, the USGS said. ""I was watching TV when I felt a big shake,"" said Harian, a Lombok woman who uses one name. ""The lamp was shaking, and people were shouting 'Get out.' I ran out into the dark because the power cut off."" A tsunami warning was lifted after waves just 6 inches high were recorded in three villages, said Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency. The quake was felt strongly across Lombok and Bali and had damaged houses on both islands, Nugroho said. Frightened people poured out of their homes to move to higher ground, particularly in North Lombok and Mataram, the capital of West Nusa Tenggara province, said Iwan Asmara, a Lombok disaster official.

(AP Photo) The Bali and Lombok airports continued operating Sunday night, according to the director general of civil aviation. There had been a half-hour evacuation at the Lombok airport following the quake because the electricity went off. TV showed crying women consoling each other outside Lombok's airport. The island was already reeling from a magnitude 6.4 quake on July 29, which killed 16 people. Like Bali, Lombok is known for pristine beaches and mountains. Hotels and other buildings in both locations are not allowed to exceed the height of coconut trees. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. In December 2004, a massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries.

Kevin Loria,"USGS expects this sort of damage to occur when the Hayward Fault earthquake hits. USGS/Public Domain On this day 112 years ago, the San Andreas Fault under San Francisco rumbled apart, causing the devastating 1906 earthquake that swallowed city blocks, broke water mains, and triggered massive fires that burned for days. The threat of another major quake for the Bay Area is ""real and could happen at any time,"" according to researchers for the US Geological Survey. But the scariest scenario for the next major earthquake may not be from the San Andreas Fault (though that one still threatens ), but from the Hayward Fault that runs along the east side of the San Francisco Bay. The Hayward Fault is a ""tectonic time bomb, due anytime for another magnitude 6.8 to 7.0 earthquake,"" according to a 2008 USGS report. Since then, research has indicated that the likelihood of a Hayward quake is greater and more threatening to the 7 million Bay Area residents than a San Andreas quake would be. ""It's just waiting to go off,"" USGS earthquake geologist emeritus David Schwartz told the Los Angeles Times. The Hayward Fault USGS/Public Domain The HayWired Earthquake Scenario To better understand what might happen in the case of a quake on the Hayward Fault, researchers from the USGS partnered with a group called the HayWired Coalition. They modeled a hypothetical 7.0 magnitude quake with an epicenter beneath Oakland — a hypothetical event they call the HayWired Scenario. The projections are sobering. According to that model, the violent shaking from the earthquake could cause the two sides of the fault to split six feet apart in some places. Some aftershocks could continue for several months. Cities in the East Bay would be hit hard, including Berkeley, Oakland, San Leandro, and Hayward. More than 300 buildings sit atop the Hayward Fault, including the stadium at the University of California Berkeley. Property damage in the HayWired Scenario is estimated by USGS to be more than $82 billion. The human toll from such an event could be greater. The quake would displace 77,000 households, a number that could rise to 152,000 if fires and utility outages were counted. That means nearly half a million people would be forced from their homes. A major earthquake in 1989 rocked the San Francisco Bay area and damaged parts of the Bay Bridge. AP Photo The scientists think such an event would kill around 800 people and cause 18,000 nonfatal injuries. More than 2,500 people might need to be pulled from collapsed buildings, and around 22,000 could be trapped in elevators. Most counties in the area would have full water service restored within 30 days, the researchers estimate, but it might take up to 210 days before the hardest hit counties would see full service restored. More than 400 gas- and electric-related fires would likely ignite because of the main shock of the quake, and experts think those blazes could burn an area big enough to consume 52,000 homes, kill hundreds, and do another $30 billion in damage. The 72 percent probability of a magnitude (M) 6.7 or greater earthquake in the region includes well-known major plate-boundary faults, lesser-known faults, and unknown faults. The percentage shown within each colored circle is the probability that a M 6.7 or greater earthquake will occur somewhere on that fault system by the year 2043. The dark, thick lines outlined in various colors represent major plate boundary faults; the thinner, yellow lines mark lesser-know, smaller faults. USGS/Public Domain Another quake is coming The last time a major quake hit the Hayward Fault was in 1868, when a 6.8-magnitude tremor raced through the region and leveled several towns. The region was sparsely populated then, but 30 people died and the impact was powerful enough that the 1868 quake is considered one of the most destructive in California history. People felt the shakes as far north as Nevada. The devastation from the next quake will be worse given the current density of the East Bay. The idea behind the HayWired Scenario is to present a realistic model of something experts think is likely to happen — and inspire more investment in earthquake safety. There are steps that experts think could improve the situation. An early warning system could prevent at least 1,500 injuries if people followed alerts. If water utilities replace brittle pipes, acquire emergency generators, and create a fuel-management plan, water service could be restored more quickly. Retrofitting buildings could also reduce the number of fires. But the researchers behind the analysis want people to understand that this scenario is just one of many possibilities. There are seven significant fault lines running through the Bay Area. The risk from a Hayward quake might be highest, but there are worse scenarios that would involve multiple faults rupturing simultaneously. Overall, researchers think there's about a 76% chance the region could get hit by a 7.2 magnitude quake within the next 30 years. As Schwartz told the LA Times, ""You can't hide — there's really going to be very little places in the greater Bay Area that won't be affected.""","There's about a 76% chance that the San Francisco Bay Area could experience a 7.2 magnitude earthquake within the next 30 years, according to some recent reports.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"MATARAM, Indonesia (Reuters) - Daybreak revealed chaos and destruction across the Indonesian resort island of Lombok on Monday after a magnitude 6.9 earthquake killed at least 83 people and prompted an exodus of tourists rattled by the second powerful quake in a week. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) said the death toll was expected to rise with initial reports of hundreds injured and thousands of buildings collapsed or badly damaged. Power and communications were cut in some areas of Lombok, and the military said it was sending in a vessel with medical aid, supplies and logistical support for the island. Lombok was hit a week earlier, on July 29, by a 6.4 magnitude quake that killed 17 people, injured hundreds and briefly stranded several trekkers on the slopes of a volcano. The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) said that more than 120 aftershocks were recorded after Sunday evening’s quake, whose magnitude the U.S. Geological Survey revised down to 6.9 from an original 7.0. The tremor was so powerful it was felt on the neighboring island of Bali where, according to BNPB, two people died. “I was at the rooftop of my hotel and the building started swaying very hard. It felt like two meters to the left, then two meters to the right, I could not stand up,” said Gino Poggiali, a 43-year-old Frenchman, who was with his wife and two children. His wife Maude, 44, said the family were on Bali for the first quake and Lombok for the second. “This is it for me in Indonesia,” she said. “Next time we will stay in France or somewhere close.” Long lines formed at the airport of Lombok’s main town, Mataram, as foreign visitors cut their holidays short. The Garuda Indonesia airline said it was adding extra flights from Lombok to help tourists leave, and AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes tweeted that the budget airline would try to lay on extra flights. SCREAMS, SHAKING BUILDINGS Carlos Romartinez, a 24-year-old Spaniard who was also waiting for a flight out of Lombok, said he had decided to head instead to the island of Flores to the east. “All the activities are shut down. We can’t dive, we can’t do anything so we will go to another island,” he said. Dutch tourist Marc Ganbuwalba injured his knee as a stampede of diners rushed from a restaurant after the quake. “We are cutting short our holiday because I can’t walk and we’re just not in the mood anymore, more in the mood to see our loved ones,” said the 26-year-old, sitting on a trolley with his leg bandaged. “We are just thankful to god and also to the hotel staff who really helped us. Some of them said their own houses had been destroyed but they were still helping us.” About 1,000 foreign and domestic tourists were evacuated in boats from the three Gili islands off the northwest coast of Lombok, BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said via Twitter. No tourists died on the Gilis, he said. Singapore Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, who was on the 10th floor of a hotel in Mataram when the quake struck, said that his room shook violently and walls cracked. “It was quite impossible to stand up. Heard screams. Came out, and made my way down a staircase, while building was still shaking. Power went out for a while. Lots of cracks, fallen doors,” he wrote on Facebook. His government issued a travel notice on Monday, advising citizens to defer travel to Lombok and urging those currently there to leave. “We were knocked certainly to the floor. We were pretty lucky to get out. Everyone’s a bit shaken but all well,” Australia’s Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton, who was on the 12th floor of a Lombok hotel, told Australian radio.

Scott Neuman,"A woman mourns at an earthquake site in Sarpol-e Zahab in western Iran, on Tuesday. Vahid Salemi/AP Iran says it has ended the search for survivors from a strong earthquake that struck near its border with Iraq over the weekend, killing more than 430 people across the region and injured 7,000. The magnitude 7.3 quake hit late Sunday, with its epicenter located about 19 miles south of Halabjah, Iraq, It was felt as far away as Baghdad and Tehran. ""The rescue operations in the (western) Kermanshah province have ended,"" Pir-Hossein Kolivand, head of Iran's Emergency Medical Services, said on state TV. The Associated Press says that the worst damage from the quake appeared to be in the Kurdish town of Sarpol-e Zahab in the western Iranian province of Kermanshah, near the border with Iraq. At least 14 provinces in Iran were affected by the temblor. Al Jazeera reports that the Red Crescent Society of Iran deployed staff and volunteers to assist in rescue-and-relief operations but officials acknowledged that finding survivors buried in the rubble was unlikely. ""It is total chaos here, most homes are destroyed in Kermanshah and people are stuck under bricks and debris after the earthquake,"" Ali Sadeghi, a volunteer from the Red Crescent Society, told Al Jazeera, adding that ""families of those trapped are also pulling people hoping to find them alive."" NPR's Jane Arraf, reporting from the Kurdistan region of Iraq, says the Red Crescent there is trying to ensure that those who lost their homes in the temblor won't freeze to death from lack of shelter. She says Turkey, despite its troubled relations with Kurds, has sent blankets to the region. Reuters, quoting Iran state television, said thousands of people were huddled in makeshift camps and that many people spent a second night in the open, fearing aftershocks.","The quake, with its epicenter in neighboring Iraq, has killed at least 430 people in both countries, according to official figures.",2017-11-14T08:56:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",Iran Calls Off Search For Survivors In Quake-Struck Region,https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/11/14/564003430/iran-calls-off-search-for-survivors-in-quake-struck-region,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/11/14/ap_17318297619079_wide-1d5b3981df25ec8ea554184cfaf1a5762d828494.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,quake,1

Kanupriya Kapoor,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Electricity was restored and some shops reopened in Indonesia’s quake and tsunami stricken city of Palu on Thursday, but the fate of many thousands of people in outlying districts was unknown nearly a week after the disaster struck. The small city of 370,000 people has been the focus of the aid effort launched after last Friday’s 7.5 magnitude earthquake and tsunami on the west coast of Sulawesi island. (GRAPHIC: Catastrophe in Sulawesi - tmsnrt.rs/2OqQlUo ) International help in searching for survivors has gathered pace, but communities in more remote areas have been cut off by broken roads, landslides and crippled communications, leaving people increasingly desperate for basic needs as aid has only just begun to trickle through. By Thursday, the official death toll stood at 1,424, but it will certainly rise as bodies were still being recovered in Palu, where most of the dead have been counted. Figures for more remote areas were only trickling in, if at all. “There are so many challenges with this disaster, it’s never been so bad,” said Frida Sinta, an aid volunteer trying to get basic food and other supplies out to fellow residents of Palu. The city, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, has teetered close to chaos this week, with outbreaks of looting, but a recovery was evident as some shops and banks reopened and a major mobile phone network was back up. Orderly queues formed at petrol stations after the arrival of fuel shipments and late in the day, traffic lights and televisions flickered back to life as the power came back on. The improvements are helping with the aid effort. “We carry whatever we can by car or motorbike within the city wherever we can. But not yet to the most inaccessible places,” Sinta said. Altogether, the badly affected areas in the disaster zone include some 1.4 million people. Rescue workers are pushing into outlying districts, where residents say they have been scavenging for coconuts, bananas and cassava. Villagers rushed a Red Cross helicopter that landed near the town of Donggala, northwest of Palu, to distribute bread and other food, a Reuters photographer said. National disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a briefing the main roads to the south, west and east of Palu had been opened. But there has been scant information about conditions on the road to the north, along the coast toward the epicenter of the quake, 78 km (50 miles) from Palu. “There’s no data,” said Abdul Haris of the national search and rescue agency, when asked about the string of small settlements that line the road, which passes some sandy beaches that attract a trickle of tourists. “GOD DOES NOT STRIKE TWICE” While the power is back in Palu, it will take much longer for people to pick up the pieces of their lives. “We will start again here ourselves because God does not strike twice,” said Eko Joko who was building a new house, a wooden A-frame home, in the midst of a wasteland of concrete, mangled sheets of iron and uprooted trees near Palu’s beach.. In Palu’s Balaroa district, badly hit by deadly soil liquefaction, Asril Abdul Hamid, 35, was poking through the wreckage of his home. He salvaged a few mementoes including a family portrait. “My immediate family is safe, thank God, but my cousin was killed,” he told Reuters, adding that his family had got food and water in the past few days. Not far away, rescuers were using small flags to mark the location of bodies found in the debris. “We discovered eight bodies with the rescue team but we haven’t been able to bring them out because we don’t have the right equipment,” said district police chief Andi Samsudin Effendy. The body of a South Korean man, who had been in Palu for a sports event, was also found in the ruins of a hotel where dozens of people were killed. Just to the east of Palu, the 500-tonne KM Sabuk Nusantara 39, lies, high and dry in a dock-side settlement, where the tsunami picked it up and dumped it. No one on board was hurt. Engineer Charles Marlan, waiting with fellow crewmen on board the marooned ship for its owners to decide what to do, said he was thankful his ship had not killed anyone on land, as far as they knew. “What is important is we are alive and for that we should be grateful,” he said. Straddling the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia has long been vulnerable to quakes and tsunamis. In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

Athit  Perawongmetha,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities scrambled on Monday to get help into quake-hit Sulawesi island as survivors streamed away from their ruined homes and accounts of devastation filtered out of remote areas, including the death of 34 children at a Christian camp. The confirmed death toll of 844 was certain to rise as rescuers reached devastated outlying communities hit on Friday by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet). Dozens of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of several hotels and a mall in the small city of Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. Hundreds more were feared buried in landslides that engulfed villages. President Joko Widodo told reporters getting those people out was a priority. “The evacuation is not finished yet, there are many places where the evacuation couldn’t be done because of the absence of heavy equipment, but last night equipment started to arrive,” Widodo said. “We’ll send as much food supplies as possible today with Hercules planes, directly from Jakarta,” he said, referring to C-130 military transport aircraft. The disaster agency said later more heavy equipment and personnel were needed to recover bodies. One woman was recovered alive from ruins overnight in the Palu neighborhood of Balaroa, where about 1,700 houses were swallowed up when the earthquake caused soil to liquefy, the national rescue agency said. “We don’t know how many victims could be buried there, it’s estimated hundreds,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. All but 23 of the confirmed deaths were in Palu, a city of about 380,000 people, where authorities were preparing a mass grave to bury the dead as soon as they were identified. However, nearly three days after the quake, the extent of the disaster was not known with authorities bracing for the toll to climb - perhaps into the thousands - as connections with remote areas up and down the coast are restored. Of particular concern is Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the quake, and two other districts, where communication had been cut off. The four districts have a combined population of about 1.4 million. Aid worker Lian Gogali, who had reached Donggala district by motorcycle, said hundreds of people facing a lack of food and medicine were trying to get out, but evacuation teams had yet to arrive and roads were blocked. “It’s devastating,” she told Reuters by text. Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani said the situation in another of the affected districts, Sigi, was dire. “My volunteers found 34 bodies buried under tsunami debris... missing children who had been doing a bible camp,” she said. Sulawesi is one of the earthquake-prone archipelago nation’s five main islands and sits astride fault lines. Numerous aftershocks have rattled the region. Graphic: Sulawesi map - tmsnrt.rs/2OYa4YD FUEL AND RICE Pictures showed expanses of splintered wood, washed-up cars and trees mashed together, with rooftops and roads split asunder. Access to many areas is being hampered by damaged roads, landslides and collapsed bridges. A Reuters witness said queues at petrol stations on the approaches to Palu stretched for kilometers. Convoys carrying food, water and fuel awaited police escorts to prevent pilfering before heading towards the city while a stream of residents headed out. One aid worker spoke of growing lawlessness and threats of violence among survivors seeking fuel. The state energy company said it was airlifting in 4,000 liters of fuel, while Indonesia’s logistics agency said it would send hundreds of tonnes of rice. The government has allocated 560 billion rupiah ($37.58 million) for the recovery. Military aircraft were bringing people out of Palu, where crowds were waiting at the airport. One official told Metro TV it was hoped up to 1,500 people could be taken out every day, with children, women and the injured the priority. Media footage showed chaotic scenes with officers struggling to keep order. Indonesia, which is on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, is all too familiar with earthquakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Questions are sure to be asked why warning systems set up after that disaster appear to have failed on Friday, and why more people in coastal areas had not moved to higher ground after a big quake, even in the absence of an official warning. Disaster agency spokesman Nugroho told reporters on Sunday none of Indonesia’s tsunami buoys, one device used to detect waves, had been operating since 2012. He blamed a lack of funds. The meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake but lifted it 34 minutes later, drawing criticism it had been too hasty. However, officials estimated the waves had hit while the warning was in force. The head of Indonesia’s investment board said Widodo had agreed to accept international help and he would coordinate private-sector assistance from around the world.

Vanessa Romo,"Ground shaking from a preliminary 5.0 magnitude earthquake south of Pu'u 'Ō'ō caused rockfalls and possibly additional collapse into the crater on Kīlauea Volcano's East Rift Zone. U. S. Geological Survey A 5.0 magnitude earthquake on Thursday rocked several communities on the Big Island that are already bracing for a possible volcanic eruption after hundreds of small earthquakes jolted the region. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said the quake, which struck at 10:30 a.m., ""caused rockfalls and possibly an additional collapse"" into the Pu'u 'Ō'ō, a crater on the Kilauea Volcano that has been slowly crumbling. A pink plume of ash could be seen briefly wafting over the crater but no other significant changes had been observed, HVO said on its website. Telephoto view of a small lava flow (lighter in color) and spatter (blue-gray) that were erupted from a section of the crack on the west flank of Pu'u 'Ō'ō on May 1. U.S. Geological Survey Geologists say the ongoing temblors — more than 600 in the last three days — are an indication that lava could break through the surface at any time. Most of the quakes have been in the magnitude-2.0 range and until Thursday morning, the largest recorded was a 4.2 magnitude. The agency that operates the county's emergency preparedness and response program has warned residents to prepare for evacuation in case of an eruption. ""A lava breakout remains a possibility and it could happen quickly,"" Janet Babb, an HVO geologist told NPR, adding that these types of events are nearly impossible to predict. Babb explained that the rumbling in the region goes back to mid-March when the cone of the Pu'u 'Ō'ō crater began to swell and the pressure trapped inside caused the crater floor to collapse on April 30. That forced an intrusion of the magma, which means that rather than gushing upward through the crater of the volcano, it starting seeping underground. As it moves beneath the surface, the molten lava is breaking up rock and causing the ground to shift. That process results in earthquakes. And the fear is that lava will spew out of cracks created by those earthquakes and destroy nearby homes. The collapse of the Pu'u 'Å'Å crater floor April 30 produced a large amount of red ash that was deposited around the crater and blown farther downwind. U.S. Geological Survey Since Monday the magma has moved under major highways and also to a neighborhood called Leilani Estates, nearly 25 miles from the Kilauea Volcano. Hawaii News Now reported several quakes Wednesday ""created cracks in the roadway,"" measuring up to 18 inches long and 2 inches wide in some places. National Park Service officials have shut down 16,000 acres of the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park as a precaution. And a local charter school was also closed on Thursday. Babb compared this week's volcanic activity to an eruption of Kilauea in 1955 that lasted 88 days and covered about 3,900 acres in lava destroying nearby communities.",The quake Thursday is one of 600 that have been shaking the area near the Big Island's Mount Kilauea since Monday. Geologists fear magma will break though the surface causing widespread destruction.,2018-05-04T00:18:34Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}",5.0 Magnitude Earthquake Rattles Hawaii As Residents Ready For Possible Lava Eruption,https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/03/608136978/5-0-magnitude-earthquake-rattles-hawaii-as-residents-ready-for-possible-lava-eru,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/05/03/multimediafile-1931_wide-f919be618bb4e8db8708ad0330674d012eded79c.jpeg?s=1400,,Npr.org,quake,1
Fathin Ungku,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities scrambled on Monday to get help into quake-hit Sulawesi island as survivors streamed away from their ruined homes and accounts of devastation filtered out of remote areas, including the death of 34 children at a Christian camp. The confirmed death toll of 844 was certain to rise as rescuers reached devastated outlying communities hit on Friday by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet). Dozens of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of several hotels and a mall in the small city of Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. Hundreds more were feared buried in landslides that engulfed villages. Of particular concern is Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the quake, and two other districts, where communication had been cut off. The four districts have a combined population of about 1.4 million. President Joko Widodo told reporters getting those people out was a priority. “The evacuation is not finished yet. There are many places where the evacuation couldn’t be done because of the absence of heavy equipment, but last night equipment started to arrive,” Widodo said. “We’ll send as much food supplies as possible today with Hercules planes, directly from Jakarta,” he said, referring to C-130 military transport aircraft. The disaster agency said later more heavy equipment and personnel were needed to recover bodies. MASS GRAVE One woman was recovered alive from ruins overnight in the Palu neighborhood of Balaroa, where about 1,700 houses were swallowed up when the earthquake caused soil to liquefy, the national rescue agency said. “We don’t know how many victims could be buried there, it’s estimated hundreds,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. All but 23 of the confirmed deaths were in Palu, a city of about 380,000 people, where workers were preparing a mass grave to bury the dead as soon as they were identified. However, nearly three days after the quake, the extent of the disaster was not known with authorities bracing for the toll to climb - perhaps into the thousands - as connections with remote areas up and down the coast are restored. Aid worker Lian Gogali, who had reached Donggala district by motorcycle, said hundreds of people facing a lack of food and medicine were trying to get out, but evacuation teams had yet to arrive and roads were blocked. “It’s devastating,” she told Reuters by text. Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani said a church in an area of Sigi district, south of Palu, had been engulfed in mud and debris. Officials said the area suffered liquefaction, when the shock of the quake temporarily destabilizes the soil. “My volunteers found 34 bodies... children who had been doing a bible camp,” Arriani said. Sulawesi is one of the earthquake-prone archipelago nation’s five main islands and sits astride fault lines. Numerous aftershocks have rattled the region. Pictures showed expanses of splintered wood, washed-up cars and trees mashed together, with rooftops and roads split asunder. Access to many areas is being hampered by damaged roads, landslides and collapsed bridges. THREATS OF VIOLENCE A Reuters witness said queues at petrol stations on the approaches to Palu stretched for kilometers. Convoys carrying food, water and fuel awaited police escorts to prevent pilfering before heading towards the city while residents streamed out. One aid worker spoke of threats of violence among survivors seeking fuel. The state energy company said it was airlifting in 4,000 liters of fuel, while Indonesia’s logistics agency said it would send hundreds of tonnes of rice. The government has allocated 560 billion rupiah ($37.58 million) for the recovery. Military aircraft were taking people out of Palu and hundreds of people thronged its small airport as officers struggled to keep order. “I’d get a plane anywhere. I’ve been waiting for two days. Haven’t eaten, barely had a drink of water,” said 44-year-old food vendor Wiwid. Indonesia, which is on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, is all too familiar with earthquakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

Tampa Bay Times,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP)  An earthquake of at least magnitude 5.5 struck in southern Iran near the country's sole nuclear power plant on Thursday morning, shaking countries across the Persian Gulf. There was no immediate report of damage or injuries. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake struck at 0634 GMT some 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Bushehr. That's home to the Bushehr Nuclear Power, the only operating nuclear power plant in the Islamic Republic. The USGS put the earthquake's magnitude at 5.5 while Iranian state television, citing officials, described the quake as a magnitude 5.9. Varying magnitudes are common immediately after a temblor. Iranian state TV, which put the earthquake's epicenter near the town of Kaki, did not report any damage at Bushehr plant, which has seen other earthquakes in the past and is built to resist damage from a temblor. Authorities later said the quake did not affect routine operations at the plant, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. The Iran Red Crescent described the epicenter as being in a sparsely populated area. In Bahrain, an island kingdom off the coast of Saudi Arabia, people said they felt the quake and evacuated from high-rise buildings. Some in Qatar also felt the quake and evacuated tall buildings in Doha's West Bay area. People in Kuwait City also felt the temblor. The USGS put the earthquake's depth at 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) below the surface. Shallow earthquakes often have broader damage. A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage. Iran sits on major fault lines and is prone to near-daily earthquakes. In 2003, a 6.6-magnitude quake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. Bam is near the Bushehr nuclear plant, which wasn't damaged at that time. In November, a major 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck a mountainous region of Iran near the Iraqi border, killing over 530 people and injuring thousands in Iran alone. In Iraq, nine people were killed and 550 were injured, all in the country's northern Kurdish region. ___ Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Hussain al-Qatari in Kuwait City contributed to this report.","Magnitude 5.5 quake strikes southern Iran; felt in Bahrain Tampabay.com DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The U.S. Geological Survey says a magnitude 5.5 earthquake has struck in southern Iran near a nuclear plant, shaking Bahrain and other areas around the …",2018-04-19T07:23:37Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Tampabay.com'}",Magnitude 5.5 quake strikes southern Iran; felt in Bahrain - Tampabay.com,http://www.tampabay.com/magnitude--quake-strikes-southern-iran-felt-in-bahrain-ap_world776eeab078ea43389d8563dd2acc31f8,http://www.tampabay.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/facebook_icon.png,,Tampabay.com,quake,1
,"At a Glance A powerful earthquake has left three dead in Osaka, Japan, on Monday. The quake knocked over concrete walls and ignited scattered building fires. Dozens of domestic flights in and out of Osaka were grounded, while train and subway services were suspended. At least three people are dead and more than 300 have been injured after a strong earthquake knocked over walls and ignited scattered fires around metropolitan Osaka in Western Japan on Monday. A falling concrete wall at a school killed a 9-year-old girl during the 5.3 magnitude quake. The other two fatalities were both men in their 80s. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said 214 people were treated for injuries at hospitals. Most of the injured were in Osaka – Japan’s No. 2 city bustling with businesses. Osaka officials did not give details, but the injuries reported in Kyoto and three other neighboring prefectures were all minor. The Osaka prefectural government’s disaster management department confirmed the girl’s death and the death of an older man. The third victim died in the nearby city of Ibaraki. (MORE: Major Flash Flooding in Upper Michigan, Northern Wisconsin, Northern Minnesota ) A falling concrete wall knocked down Rina Miyake as she walked by at her elementary school in Takatsuki. NHK public television aired footage showing the collapsed upper half of the high wall, which was cheerfully painted with trees, flowers and blue sky and surrounded the school swimming pool. Takatsuki Mayor Takeshi Hamada apologized over her death because of the wall’s collapse. The structure was old and made of concrete blocks – a known risk in earthquakes. A man in his 80s died in the collapse of a concrete wall in Osaka city. An 84-year-old man in nearby Ibaraki died after a bookshelf fell on top of him at home, according to city officials. Many homes and buildings, including a major hospital, were temporarily without power, though electricity was restored at most places by midafternoon. The earthquake struck around 8 a.m. north of Osaka at a depth of about 9 miles, the United States Geological Survey said. The strongest shaking was north of Osaka, but the quake rattled large parts of western Japan, including Kyoto. The quake knocked over walls, broke windows and set off scattered building fires. It toppled bookshelves in homes and scattered goods on shop floors. It also cracked roads and broke water pipes, leaving homes without water. The morning commute was disrupted, as dozens of domestic flights in and out of Osaka were grounded, while train and subway service in the Osaka area including the bullet train were suspended to check for damage. Passengers were seen exiting trains on the tracks between stations. Some subway services started to resume in the afternoon. The earthquake reminded many in Japan of the magnitude 7.3 Hanshin-Kobe quake in 1995 that killed more than 6,000 in the region. Monday’s quake also followed a series of smaller quakes near Tokyo in recent weeks. A 30-year-old lawyer Jun Kawasaki said the quake reminded him of the Kobe quake 23 years ago, and started packing up immediately to run away. “It was not as bad as the Kobe quake,” he told the Associated Press from Osaka. His girlfriend ducked down under the table. Elevators in his office building were out of operation. “I used the stairs but I was out of breath by the time I arrived at my office on the 20th floor.”","The Weather Channel Japan Earthquake Kills 3, Injures More Than 300 The Weather Channel Dozens of domestic flights in and out of Osaka were grounded, while train and subway services were suspended.

The two morning earthquakes struck two days after a magnitude 7.9 quake in the Gulf of Alaska, which resulted in a tsunami watch that was later canceled. The 5.8 earthquake struck at 8:39 a.m. about 115 miles west of Eureka, Calif., at a depth of 5 kilometers.

""Historically this is a very active area, "" said Keith Knudsen, deputy director of the Earthquake Science Center at the USGS. He said the quakes occurred at ""the boundary between two plates that are moving relatively fast, past each other and we call this area the Mendocino Triple Junction, which implies there are three plates, and there are, but these particular quakes occurred in a boundary between two plates."" The USGS initially reported a third quake during the same hour with a 5.1 magnitude, but that turned out to be a duplicate report of the second, Knudsen said. He added that almost 150 people in the area reported light shaking. The operators of the Victorian Inn in Ferndale said nobody on staff felt the shaking, but there was some talk around town about it.

Agustinus Beo Da Costa,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi jumped to 384 on Saturday, authorities said, with many of those killed swept away by giant waves as they played on the beach. Strong aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday morning after waves up to six meters (18 feet) high swept through the scenic tourist town on Friday, triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on land. “When the (tsunami) threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB said in news briefing in Jakarta. Hundreds of people were preparing for a beach festival to celebrate Palu’s anniversary. The festival was due to start Friday night. Some people climbed six meter (18 feet) trees to escape the tsunami and survived, Nugroho said. Photos confirmed by authorities showed bodies being lined up along the street on Saturday, some in bags and some with their faces covered with clothes. Amateur footage shown by local TV stations, which could not immediately be authenticated by Reuters, showed waters crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city. Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” with thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed, a bridge washed away and the main highway to Palu cut due to a landslide. Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured. Dozens of injured people were being treated in makeshift medical tents set up outdoors, TV images showed. Indonesia’s meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake, but lifted it 34 minutes later. The agency has been widely criticized for not informing a tsunami had hit Palu on Saturday, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued. The quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu and on Saturday authorities were still having difficulties coordinating rescue efforts. The disaster mitigation agency has not been able to get any information from the fishing town of Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the quake 27 km (16 miles) away. More than 600,000 people live in Donggala and Palu. Chief security minister Wiranto told TVOne the military had started sending in cargo planes from the capital Jakarta carrying relief aid. The city’s airport remained closed after its runway and air traffic control tower was damaged in the quake but officials said they were preparing to reopen to allow aid to come in. Nugroho, spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency, said no command center for disaster recovery has been created yet. The Palu area was hit by a less powerful quake earlier on Friday, which destroyed some houses, killed one person and injured at least 10 in Donggala, authorities said. The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the second quake at a strong 7.5, after first saying it was 7.7. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In August, a series of major quakes killed over 500 people in the tourist island of Lombok and destroyed dozens of villages along its northern coast. Palu was hit by tsunami in 1927 and 1968, according to BNPB.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"LENDE TOVEA, Indonesia (Reuters) - The lives of many villagers living at the epicenter of a devastating earthquake that struck Indonesia’s Sulawesi island and killed more than 1,600 people were spared because they had been terrified by a smaller one that hit three hours earlier. A coastal strip dotted with villages north of the devastated city of Palu was cut off for nearly a week by landslides blocking its single road link after the major 7.5 magnitude quake struck late in the afternoon on Sept. 28. But the way is now open and aid is starting to trickle in to the area that rescue workers feared had been obliterated. While destruction is extensive, with many houses destroyed, villagers said on Saturday countless lives were saved by a 6.1 magnitude quake that struck about 20 km (12 miles) to the south about three hours earlier. “Luckily most people were already outside,” said Rahman Lakuaci, chief of Lende Tovea village in Sirenja district. “Everyone ran outside when the first quake happened and few people were brave enough to go back in.” Authorities have yet to conduct a tally of casualties in Sirenja and the other districts near the epicenter north of Palu, but Lakuaci estimated dozens of people had been killed in the area. The city of Palu, on the other hand, 78 km (48 miles) away, suffered heavy casualties, with hotels, shopping malls and countless houses destroyed in the quake and by a tsunami that scoured the city’s oceanfront shortly after. Soil liquefaction, a phenomenon that turns the ground into a roiling quagmire, also killed many hundreds of people in and around Palu. But that did not happen near the epicenter of the quake and, even though many villagers ran up into the hills rising to the east of the coastline, tsunami waves did not crash into the small fishing communities and pretty beaches. The quake brought down power lines and communications networks and more than half the houses in Sirenja district were destroyed. Those left standing were so battered they were “not fit for use”, Lakuaci said. Most would have to torn down and rebuilt, he said. People have survived the past week by searching for food in fields and orchards and scavenging in the forested hills. Thousands of people are living in tents and crude shelters and some supplies have been flow in by helicopter. “What we need most now are tents and medicine,” Lakuaci said. Children and the elderly were starting to get sick and fuel was also in very short supply, he said. The area saw no looting after the quake, unlike in Palu, largely because there are no big warehouses and village leaders mobilized their volunteers to maintain order, villagers said.

,"At a Glance The 7.3 quake was the largest to strike Venezuela since 1900. Buildings were evacuated Caracas, the capital city, The earthquake, felt throughout the Caribbean, happened at a considerable depth, which limited damage. A powerful earthquake shook eastern Venezuela on Tuesday afternoon, forcing residents in the captial city of Caracas to evacuate buildings to flee homes. The 7.3 quake – the largest to strike Venezuela since 1900, according to the U.S. Geological Survey – was felt throughout the Caribbean. But at a depth of some 76 miles (123 kilometers) it appeared to have caused only limited damage even near its epicenter a few miles off the sparsely populated Cariaco peninsula stretching into the eastern Caribbean. A similar-sized quake in the same area left dozens dead in 1997. Seismologist Lucy Jones, a research associate with the California Institute of Technology, said the earthquake’s considerable depth likely prevented a tragedy. “Shaking does die off at a distance,” she said, adding that the depth of the quake means there are likely to be fewer aftershocks. The quake was felt as far away as Colombia’s capital of Bogata. In Cumana, the biggest city near the quake’s center, supermarket shelves came crashing down. At a shopping center, a woman caught in the panic of people rushing out of the building fell on an escalator and injured herself. In Caracas, concrete fell from an unfinished office building. The quake also caused damage in Trinidad, which reported strong shaking. Power outages were reported across Trinidad, too. People ran into the street and gasped as large glass panes at one supermarket shattered and falling concrete smashed several cars. The quake also cracked walls and thousands of goods fell off supermarket shelves. No injuries or deaths were immediately reported. The earthquake also was felt in Guyana, Barbados and Grenada.","The Weather Channel Strong Quake Rocks Venezuela But Causes Little Damage. Why?

Communication blackouts and blocked roads are hampering rescue efforts as Papua New Guinea works to get a better grasp of the damage wrought by a massive earthquake amid fears of its economic impact. Melvin Levongo/AFP/Getty Images Days after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the interior of Papua New Guinea, the death toll is continuing to rise as rescue workers strive to reach isolated communities despite blocked and damaged roads. Officials said that at least 31 people were killed by the quake and subsequent landslides, more than double the initial reports, and that the toll is expected to rise further, Reuters reported on Thursday. The wire service continued: ""Remote hamlets closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake in the Southern Highlands were buried, killing 13 people, said James Justin, a research officer at the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy in Port Moresby in an email, citing a two-way radio call from a mission station in the region. ""Most of the other confirmed fatalities were in or around the provincial capital of Mendi and the town of Tari 40 km (25 miles) from the epicenter, where aftershocks continue to be felt and people afraid their homes may yet collapse have been sleeping in their yards. "" 'Tari is completely shut down,' Mark Mendai, head of the district's Development Authority told Reuters by phone."" As NPR previously reported, the quake was followed by a number of aftershocks and landslides, and damage to phone lines made it difficult to immediately assess the scale of the disaster. Now blocked roads and cracked runways are continuing to hamper efforts to bring aid to affected communities. Damage to a road near Mendi in Papua New Guinea's highlands region, is shown on Feb. 27. Melvin Levongo/AFP/Getty Images ""Rescuers are still trying to reach some of the hardest-hit areas in the rugged and mountainous highland region of the Pacific nation,"" Michael Sullivan reported for NPR on Wednesday. There are concerns about the earthquake's economic impact as well as the human toll. Oil and gas production has been halted at several facilities, and work at coffee plantations and a gold mine has also been interrupted, The Associated Press reports. On Wednesday, the AP spoke to Southern Highlands Governor William Powi, who described the situation in dire terms: "" 'We are looking at massive, catastrophic havoc and destruction,' Powi said.... "" 'There are people who are traumatized, people in terrible devastation who have never felt this kind of destruction before,' Powi said. 'It has really brought a lot of fear into people's lives.... "" 'We need massive assistance... We need food, infrastructure maintenance, and to bring comfort to our people who are homeless and displaced.'

Reuters Editorial,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - More than 400 people were confirmed killed, many swept away as tsunami waves triggered by a massive earthquake crashed into the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, and authorities expected the toll to rise sharply on Sunday as news arrives from remote areas. Dozens of people were reported to be still trapped in the rubble of a hotel and a mall in the city of Palu, which was hit by waves as high as six meters (20 feet) following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake. Graphic: Sulawesi map - tmsnrt.rs/2OYa4YD With the death toll so far from Palu alone and reports only slowly filtering in from Donggal, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and closer to the epicenter, authorities are bracing for worse to come. Indonesia’s Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the toll could rise to thousands. Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the Palu’s beach when the wall of water smashed onshore at dusk on Friday, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying anything in its path. Indonesian President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in the city on Sunday. The Head of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), Willem Rampangilei, told reporters in Sulawesi late on Saturday the death toll from Palu had reached 420 people, according to news website Kompas. “It’s estimated that 10,000 refugees are scattered in 50 points in Palu city,” he was quoted by Kompas as saying. “We are having difficulty deploying heavy equipment to find victims under the rubble of buildings because many of the roads leading to Palu city are damaged.” Amateur footage shown by local TV stations showed waves crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city. Dozens of injured people were being treated in makeshift medical tents set up outdoors. Photos confirmed by authorities showed bodies being lined up along the street on Saturday, some in bags and some with their faces covered with clothes. TOLL SEEN RISING BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a briefing in Jakarta the damage was “extensive” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed. A bridge was washed away and the main highway to Palu was cut off due to a landslide. “The tsunami didn’t come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (500 mph) before striking the shoreline. Metro TV reported hundreds of people had gathered outside a collapsed mall on Sunday, looking for relatives feared trapped under rubble. Nugroho said casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline for 300 km (200 miles) north and south of Palu, including the region of Donggala. The Red Cross said staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas. “We’re now getting limited communications about the destruction in Palu city, but we have heard nothing from Donggala and this is extremely worrying. There are more than 300,000 people living there,” Red Cross said in a statement. “This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.” Donggala’s waterfront and port was extensively damaged, with houses swept into the sea and bodies trapped in the rubble, according to a Metro TV reporter on the scene. Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Indonesia had not yet asked for help but he contacted President Joko Widodo overnight to offer support and deep sympathies. “It is horrifying,” he told ABC TV’s Insiders program on Sunday. “To secure the scene and make sure that issues do not deteriorate further, I think, will be a big challenge,” he said. “But I know that President Widodo will be taking a very direct and close interest in how these issues are managed and if he needs our help, he’ll have it.” PRISON BREAK More than half of the 560 inmates in Palu’s prison escaped after its walls collapsed during Friday’s quake, according to state news agency Antara. “It was very hard for the guards to stop the inmates from running away as they were so panicked and had to save themselves too,” Antara quoted warden Adhi Yan Ricoh as saying. Over a hundred inmates staged a separate escape from a prison in Donggala. Prison warden Saifuddin told Kompas inmates had started a fire in the detention center after authorities refused their demands to be released to check on their families. In Palu’s Roa-Roa Hotel, which was completely flattened by the quake, many people were still missing. “Communication is cut off. All we knew is that 24 guests were successfully evacuated and one has died,” hotel owner Ko Jefry told Metro TV on Saturday night. “It is estimated that 50 to 60 people remain trapped.” Amateur video footage showed trees, buildings and a communications tower being swept through a rural landscape. The landslide was caused by liquification of the soil, according BNPB’s Nugroho. In other footage shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below. Within minutes a wall of water crashes onto the shore, carrying away buildings and cars. Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage. Indonesia’s meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after Friday’s quake, but lifted it 34 minutes later. The agency was widely criticized for withdrawing the warning too quickly, though officials said they estimated the waves had come within the time the warning was in force. The military has started sending in cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still badly needed food and other basic necessities. Palu’s airport was damaged in the quake, but was reopened for limited commercial flights on Sunday, authorities said. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes, including the devastating Boxing Day 2004 earthquake and tsunami that killed more than 120,000 in northern Aceh province alone. In August, a series of major quakes killed more than 500 people in the tourist island of Lombok and destroyed dozens of villages along its northern coast. Palu was hit by tsunami in 1927 and 1968, according to BNPB.

Reuters Editorial,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Rescue teams in Indonesia struggled on Sunday to reach communities feared devastated by a major earthquake and tsunami on Sulawesi island, with a toll of more than 400 killed expected to rise sharply as contact is restored with remote areas. Dozens of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of two hotels and a mall in the city of Palu, which was hit by waves as high as six meters (20 feet) following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday. A young woman was pulled alive from the rubble of the Roa Roa Hotel, the news website Detik.com reported. Hotel owner Ko Jefry told Metro TV on Saturday that up to 60 people were believed trapped. Hundreds of people gathered at the mall searching for loved ones. “We’ve got information from people that their relatives are still inside, so we’re focusing on that, especially to find survivors,” a rescuer identified as Yusuf, working at the ruins of the mall, told Metro TV. Graphic: Sulawesi map - tmsnrt.rs/2OYa4YD With confirmed deaths only from Palu, authorities are bracing for much worse as reports filter in from outlying areas, in particular, Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and closer to the epicenter of the quake. Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the toll could rise into the thousands. A disaster official said the tsunami traveled across the sea at speeds of 800 kph (500 mph) before striking the shore and casualties could have been caused along a 300 km (200 miles) stretch of coast, north and south of Palu.

QUESTIONS ABOUT WARNINGS Indonesia is all too familiar with deadly earthquakes and tsunamis. In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean, killing 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Questions are sure to be asked why warning systems set up around the country after that disaster appear to have failed on Friday. The meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the Friday quake but lifted it 34 minutes later, drawing criticism it had withdrawn it too quickly. But officials said they estimated the waves had hit while the warning was in force. Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on Palu’s beach when the water smashed onshore at dusk. Palu is at the head of a narrow bay, about 10 km long and 2 km wide, which had “amplified” the force of the wave as it was funneled toward the city, a geophysics agency official said. Questions have been raised about what caused the tsunami, with speculation an underwater landslide was to blame. The BMKG said its closest sensor, about 200 km (125 miles) from Palu, had only recorded an “insignificant”, six-cm (2.5 inches) wave, while researchers said it was surprising the quake, which was recorded as a “strike-slip” event, when tectonic plates move horizontally against each other rather than vertically, had generated a tsunami. “It may be that the shock of the quake triggered a landslide underwater, but we don’t have any proof yet,” Abdul Muhari, who heads a tsunami research team that advises the government, told Reuters. Video footage on social media showed a man on the upper floor of a building shouting warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below moments before the wave crashed ashore. Reuters was not able to authenticate the footage. The Head of the National Disaster Management Agency, Willem Rampangilei, told reporters in Sulawesi late on Saturday rescuers were struggling in their hunt for more victims. “We are having difficulty deploying heavy equipment... because many of the roads leading to Palu city are damaged,” he was quoted by the Kompas newspaper as saying. About 10,000 displaced people were scattered at 50 different places in Palu, he said. Dozens of injured people were being treated in tents set up in the open. ‘HORRIFYING’ Photos confirmed by authorities showed bodies lined up on a street on Saturday, some in bags and some with their faces covered by clothes. President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers on Sunday. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Indonesia had not asked for help but he had contacted President Widodo overnight to offer support and deep sympathies. “It is horrifying...

Reuters Editorial,"(Reuters) - A magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck near the northernmost tip of Haiti late on Saturday, injuring a number of people and causing some damage to buildings including an auditorium that collapsed, authorities and media reported. The quake struck about 12.3 miles (20 kms), west-northwest of the port of Port-de-Paix, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said. Local media reported at least one death. The quake was one of the strongest to hit Haiti since a 7.0 magnitude quake struck near the capital Port-au-Prince in 2010, killing thousands of people in the impoverished Caribbean country. In a post on Twitter, Haiti’s President Jovenel Moise urged people to remain calm after the civil protection agency said the quake caused injuries and panic in northern towns. Le Nouvelliste newspaper said one person died when an auditorium collapsed in the town of Gros Morne, and that detainees were released from a police holding cell that was damaged. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.

BRIAN SEIBERT,"What much of the dance looks like is African-American history as a nightmare from which he is trying to awake. Images of terrible beauty coalesce and disperse. He and others are dragged, as if from a riot. Their hands, clasped in prayer, quake. Dancers around Mr. Harder tilt their heads, as if lynched. Across the stage they run, in slow-motion escape or crawl, in mass migration one or another rising in a spurt of anguish. Lying on their backs, they undulate their arms, suggesting a field where black people harvested some bitter crop. They might be holding Mr. Harper up or sucking him down. That last image comes at the end of the first act. After an intermission that isnt really necessary, the image repeats, arranged at a different angle. The first time, its accompanied by the searing voice of Terence Trent DArby in his track As Yet Untitled about bloodstained soil and rage, asserting, This land is still my home.

Rosie Perper,"A major 6.3 magnitude earthquake hit western Iran on Sunday night, injuring hundreds of people and sending panicked residents running into the street. According to USGS, the earthquake originated 20 km (12.5 miles) southwest of Sarpol-e Zahab, in the Kermanshah Province of Iran close to the Iraq border. Sunday's earthquake struck near Sarpol-e Zahab in Irans Kermanshah province, located close to the Iran-Iraq border. Business Insider/Google Maps The quake struck at a shallow depth of 10 km (6.2 miles) at around 8:00 p.m. local time. Shallow earthquakes can often cause more broad damage. Tremors were felt as far away as the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. Hundreds of people have been reported injured in the quake. According to the Associated Press, over 500 people were injured. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported 387 injured, most of them minor. All schools and universities in the region were closed on Monday, IRNA said. Roads were temporarily closed and electricity was affected by the quake but they appeared to be back in order by Sunday evening. Dozens of rescue teams were dispatched to the area, authorities said. Several army units were also called in to assist in rescue efforts. Iran sits along major fault lines and experiences earthquakes on a near daily basis. The location of Sunday's quake, Sarpol-e Zahab, was hit with a major 7.3 earthquake last year that killed more than 600 people and left thousands injured and homeless. It was the deadliest earthquake of 2017.","A major 6.3 magnitude earthquake hit western Iran on Sunday night, injuring hundreds of people and sending panicked residents running.

Reuters Editorial,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - At least 30 people were killed when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the city of Palu on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island on Friday, a hospital official told Metro TV in a report broadcast on Saturday. A tsunami up to two meters (six feet) high swept through Palu at dusk after the sleepy but growing tourist resort was rocked by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake. Amateur footage shown by local TV stations, which could not immediately be authenticated by Reuters, showed waters crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city. “Bodies of victims were found in several places, because they were hit by the rubble of collapsing buildings or swept by tsunami... but we are still collecting data,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman said on Saturday. Doctor Komang Adi Sujendra told Metro TV that 30 people were killed and their bodies taken to his hospital, adding another 12 injured needed orthopaedic surgery. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Nugroho declined to give an official death toll. The Palu area was hit by a lighter quake earlier on Friday, which destroyed some houses, killed one person and injured at least 10 in the fishing town of Donggala, closest to the epicenter, authorities said. The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the second quake at a strong 7.5, after first saying it was 7.7. The quake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut communications around Palu. On Saturday, authorities were still having difficulties coordinating rescue efforts without power and communications as the area was rocked by aftershocks. Metro TV played an amateur footage which showed water remaining from the tsunami, a collapsed bridge, large cracks in roads and buildings badly damaged. Tezar Kodongan, a resident of Palu who took one of the videos, told the TV station some of the city landmarks were broken. “There is no evacuation yet in the disaster area,” Kodongan added. More than 600,000 people live in Donggala and Palu.

Reuters Editorial,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - At least 384 people were killed, many swept away as giant waves crashed onto beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday. Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) smashed onshore at dusk, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying anything in their path. The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake. “When the (tsunami) threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency BNPB said in a briefing in Jakarta. “The tsunami didn’t come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before striking the shoreline. Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said. Amateur footage shown by local TV stations showed waves crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city. Photos confirmed by authorities showed bodies being lined up along the street on Saturday, some in bags and some with their faces covered with clothes. Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu. Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water. Graphic: Sulawesi map - tmsnrt.rs/2OYa4YD DEATH TOLL SEEN RISING Aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday. The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people. Indonesia’s Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in statement the energy released by Friday’s massive quake was around 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War Two. The geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami, it said. Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed. A bridge was washed away and the main highway to Palu was cut off due to a landslide. Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured and 29 were missing. Dozens of injured people were being treated in makeshift medical tents set up outdoors, TV images showed. Nugroho said the casualties and the damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake. Communications “were totally crippled with no information” from Donggala, Nugroho said. More than 600,000 people live in Donggala and Palu. “We’re now getting limited communications about the destruction in Palu city, but we have heard nothing from Donggala and this is extremely worrying. There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas. “This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” it said. Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the death toll could rise to thousands. PRESIDENT TO VISIT DISASTER AREA Indonesia’s meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake, but lifted it 34 minutes later. The agency on Saturday was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued. In amateur footage shared on social media a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting frantic warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below. Within minutes a wall of water crashes onto the shore, carrying away buildings and cars. Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage. The quake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts. The military has started sending in cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still badly need food and other basic necessities. The city’s airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until Oct. 4 for commercial flights, Nugroho said. The airport’s runway and air traffic control tower were damaged in the quake, authorities said. President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In August, a series of major quakes killed more than 500 people in the tourist island of Lombok and destroyed dozens of villages along its northern coast. Palu was hit by tsunami in 1927 and 1968, according to BNPB.

Alexandra Ulmer,"CARACAS (Reuters) - A major earthquake of magnitude 7.3 struck Venezuela’s eastern coast, home to largely poor fishing communities, on Tuesday afternoon, shaking buildings as far away as Colombian capital Bogota and knocking power out in parts of Trinidad. But the quake’s depth - 76.5 miles (123 km) below the surface - appeared to have mitigated the damage. Venezuelan officials said there were no immediate reports of injuries and two sources at state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] told Reuters the OPEC member’s refineries and oil fields were operating normally. PDVSA did not immediately comment. Venezuela is not in a good shape to deal with a natural disaster. It is already wrestling with a crippling economic crisis with medicine running short, hospitals barely able to function and some severe shortages of basics such as chicken and milk. The tremor - one of the country’s strongest ever - hit at 5.31 p.m. (2131 GMT). Along Venezuela’s picturesque palm tree-dotted northern coast, residents said the long quake was terrifying and frightened people into dashing into the streets. “I had gotten into bed to watch the news on TV and my bed started to move as if it was made of water,” said Elia Sanchez, a doctor in Cumana, the capital of the eastern state of Sucre that was the closest to the coastal epicenter. “We had to go down nine floors, it felt like it would never end.” Rosymer Rodriguez, also in Cumana, said she could not see any significant damage but that people were still fearful. “There are still people in the street. There are people packing bags in case there are aftershocks,” said Rodriguez. Damage in Caracas was limited, but the quake did tilt the top five floors of an abandoned 45-story skyscraper known as the ‘Tower of David’, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said. The tower, originally intended to be a bank center but abandoned since 1994 and later occupied by squatters for years, dominates Caracas’ skyline. It features in the U.S. television spy drama “Homeland”. Pictures after the quake showed the building’s top floors, which are unfinished, leaning sideways. Out east, the governor of Sucre called for calm. “Do not fall victim to psychological terror, messages about a tsunami and all that,” said governor Edwin Rojas, who belongs to President Nicolas Maduro’s Socialist Party. The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment for additional information. ANDES, CARIBBEAN HIT The quake was felt in capital Caracas, neighboring Colombia and nearby island nations like Trinidad and Tobago, and St. Lucia, to the west and north. In Trinidad and Tobago, there were initial reports of some cracks to buildings, cars damaged when concrete debris fell on them, and loss of electricity. Traffic jams formed on highways in Port of Spain, but there were no immediate reports of casualties there either. Colombia’s government said the country was unharmed too, although workers dashed out of high-rise blocks in the mountainous capital Bogota. “It was a moment of panic, we thought the worst,” said Jimena Valencia, a 29-year-old administrator in the north of Bogota. The U.S. Pacific Tsunami Center canceled an earlier warning of a possible tsunami along the coast near the epicenter, some 190 kilometers (118 miles) from Cumana. United States Geological Survey geophysicist Jessica Turner said the quake’s depth would have dampened some of the shaking. “A 7.3 magnitude quake is going to cause some damage, particularly as in this area, structures are vulnerable. The Earth is able to absorb some of the energy, but a 7.3 quake produces a lot of energy,” she said by telephone.

Owen S. Good,"Quake Champions ’ latest update in early access is gonna kick it old-school: Custom games will now have a “No Abilities” mode that throws it back to the days of vanilla Quake, for all the get-off-my-lawn types who want to brag about their true skills in arena shooters. The March update, live right now, also returns the one-shot kill Instagib mode, as well as two-on-two ranked play. There are also some Easter-themed cosmetics as we move into springtime for Quakeguy. The updates coincide with the release of the Scalebearer Pack beginning tomorrow. For $4.99, it gives players early access to the game (through Steam and Bethesda.net), Scalebearer and Ranger (Quakeguy) as permanently unlocked playable champions, and three days to play as anyone else in the cast of characters. Quake Champions is modeling itself as a free-to-play game, where the roster is “rented” either by earning in-game currency or bought outright for real money. So the No Abilities mode neutralizes any skills special to a champion and reduces everyone to the basic running, gunning and jumping of the original game. As always, the “Champions Pack” is still on sale for $29.99, which gives players access to everything, plus other in-game bonuses. The Quake websie has more information. Quake Champions is available for Windows PC. It was announced at E3 2016 and went into early access in August 2017.","Step right up, ‘Quake dads’ who want to brag about their skills",2018-03-15T17:15:01Z,"{'id': 'polygon', 'name': 'Polygon'}",Quake Champions’ new update turns off hero abilities,https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/15/17125332/quake-champions-march-update,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ohqj9rhcqSzo6qwRXQAWvok0fG0=/0x7:1276x675/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10432501/Screen_Shot_2018_03_15_at_12.59.10_PM.png,polygon,Polygon,quake,1
Don Sweeney,"A light earthquake shook Southern California early Thursday, marking the latest in a burst of seismic and volcanic activity along the Ring of Fire. The 4.0-magnitude quake took place just after 2 a.m. about 31 miles southeast of Anaheim, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It follows a 6.2-magnitude quake in Japan on Wednesday and a 7.9-magnitude quake in Alaska on Tuesday that prompted a quickly canceled tsunami warning for the West Coast. Significant earthquakes in Indonesia and Chile also have been reported this week. In addition, volcanic eruptions in the Philippines, Indonesia, Bali and Japan continue to spew ash and lava, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people. The eruption Tuesday of Mount Kusatsu-Shirane in Japan killed a soldier and injured more than a dozen people, including several at a nearby ski resort. The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction on Tuesday tweeted a warning that the Ring of Fire was “active.” What is the Ring of Fire? The Ring of Fire refers to a sprawling, horseshoe-shaped geological disaster zone in the Pacific, according to ABC News. The ring stretches 25,000 miles from New Zealand through Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan to Alaska, Canada and the West Coast down to South America. It contains 452 volcanoes and several tectonic plates in the earth’s crust. Fitting together like a puzzle, the tectonic plates constantly shift and collide, producing earthquakes. Scientists say the recent series of quakes and volcanic eruptions are merely business as usual for the Ring of Fire. “It just so happens that these events are occurring at the same time in different parts of the region,” Chris Elders, a geology expert from Curtin University in Australia, told the BBC. “There’s not necessarily a relationship between them.” Janine Krippner, a New Zealand volcanologist based in the United States, reminded people that “It’s not referred to as the ‘ring of fire’ because it sits there doing nothing.” Krippner told the BBC that while satellite imagery and the internet have made people around the world more aware of eruptions and seismic activity, that doesn’t mean they’ve actually become more common.","Washington Times Another quake rattles the West Coast.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Deimos Imaging Image caption Thousands of people have left the area around Kadovar Island in Papua New Guinea Tens of thousands of people have had their lives disrupted in the past week by seismic and volcanic activity along the Ring of Fire. An earthquake off Alaska, an avalanche and volcanic eruption in central Japan and a volcano squirting lava in the Philippines all occurred within days of each other. It led the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction to send a tweet on Tuesday warning that the Ring of Fire was ""active"". Many are asking whether there is cause for concern that something more serious might happen. So is there reason to worry? The Ring of Fire refers to a string of volcanoes, earthquake sites and tectonic plates around the Pacific. It spreads across 40,000km (25,000 miles) from the southern tip of South America all the way to New Zealand. Roughly 90% of all earthquakes occur along the area and the ring is dotted with 75% of all active volcanoes on Earth, that's 452 individual active volcanoes. This week alone, a 7.9-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Alaska in the US. The quake briefly triggered a tsunami warning for coastal areas of Alaska and British Columbia in Canada. On the same day, one soldier was killed and at least 11 others injured in central Japan by an avalanche that may have been triggered by a volcanic eruption. The eruption of Mount Moto-Shirane, which is part of Mount Kusastsu-Shirane, also sent rocks raining down a kilometre-wide area near Kusatsu in central Japan, local media reported. Earlier last year, the eruption of Bali's Mount Agung led to the closure of the city's international airport and forced up to 100,000 people to evacuate. Media caption Survivors of the 1963 eruption on the last time Mount Agung erupted Mount Sinabung, more than 3,000km away in Sumatra, Indonesia, had been dormant for 400 years before it began erupting again in 2010. In 2016, at least seven people died after clouds of hot ash and gas consumed the region.. Sinabung began erupting again in 2017 and is still going. And Mount Kadovar, a volcano in Papua New Guinea, has been spewing ash for weeks, causing the evacuation of thousands of people from nearby islands. All are along the Ring of Fire. But Prof Chris Elders, a geology expert from Curtin University in Australia, says the recent activity is entirely normal. ""There's nothing unusual about what we're seeing at the moment,"" he told the BBC. ""It just so happens that these events are occurring at the same time in different parts of the region. There's not necessarily a relationship between them."" He says volcanic and tectonic activity has occurred in the region for ""hundreds and thousands of years"". ""So if you're just looking at one tiny snapshot in such a long period of time it looks like it's something special that things are happening all at once, but if you stand back and look at it in the scale of things, you'll see the action is fairly continuous."" Dr Janine Krippner, a New Zealand volcanologist based in the US, tweeted that the zone was ""not referred to as the Ring of Fire because it sits there doing nothing"". While there are fears that volcanoes are becoming more frequent, she said the rate of eruptions had ""not recently increased"". ""We now have satellites to capture more eruptions, and the internet to talk about more eruptions,"" she said. According to Japan's volcanology division, Mount Moto-Shirane had been quiet for 3,000 years before its sudden eruption. Does it mean anything that it has reawoken? Not really, says Prof Elders. ""To us, 3,000 years is a long period to be inactive but if you look back at the history of the volcano over tens of thousands of years, you might see that that is quite regular for it,"" he said.

Reuters Editorial,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - At least 30 people were killed in the bay city of Palu in Indonesia’s Sulawesi island, a hospital official told Metro TV on Saturday, after the area was hit by strong earthquakes and a tsunami a day earlier. In a video that appeared to be taken at night, doctor Komang Adi Sujendra said 30 people were killed and had been taken to the hospital where he was, adding that another 12 injured needed orthopedic surgery. Authorities were having difficulties coordinating rescue efforts as the 7.5 magnitude quake caused a power outage that cut communications around Palu and the nearby fishing town of Donggala, the closest to the epicentre of the quake 27 km (17 miles) away. Officials had not yet provided any new information on the death toll on Saturday, but on Friday night they said initial reports showed some dead victims in the rubble of collapsing buildings.

Bill Chappell,"A bridge was wrecked at the city of Palu, after an earthquake and tsunami hit the area in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters Emergency crews are still trying to find victims of an earthquake and tsunami that struck Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, killing at least 1,200 people, according to local media citing government officials. The death toll could rise even higher, officials warn, as workers clear debris, rubble and vehicles that were swept away by a massive wave of seawater on Friday. The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck along the coastal district of Donggala on Friday. Most of the dead were found in nearby Palu, a city of nearly 300,000 where an onlooker took a video of the seawater raging ashore just after 5 p.m., local time.

The damage caused landslides and forced Palu's international airport to close for at least one full day. Desperate for food and water, some local residents have taken matters into their own hands. The Jakarta Post says ""many survivors blocked trucks carrying aid to plunder the contents"" in Palu and Donggala. Photos from the region also show people clambering atop a fuel truck, filling up makeshift containers and passing them down to a waiting crowd. Other residents gathered at Palu's port, hoping to get at any supplies arriving by ship. A number of stores were looted, the Post adds. Videos posted to social media also captured the scene as the quake struck, with people scrambling away from large cracks in the ground as buildings either collapsed or simply slid away their foundations overcome by the earth's liquefaction.

He also acknowledged problems with getting aid to the region, and urged people to be patient. Thousands of people began camping at the airport over the weekend, hoping to leave. But the airport has only been operating at partial capacity since it reopened. And as they wait for a chance to fly out, people are also enduring heat of more the 90 degrees, with little to sustain them. Overwhelmed by the sheer number of bodies to deal with, local and military officials arranged for a mass burial site for the victims, according to Indonesian disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, who says officials feared a prolonged delay could create a new health crisis.

Carl Court/Getty Images In addition to travel and communication problems, relief agencies say their response to the latest crisis is somewhat limited by the fact that many staff members remain deployed to Lombok an island hundreds of miles to the south of Sulawesi, where a 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck one month ago. ""Oxfam is provisionally planning a response to reach 100,000 people in Palu city and Donggala district,"" said Ancilla Bere, Oxfam's Humanitarian Manager in Indonesia. ""This is likely to focus on the immediate needs such as ready-to-eat meals, water purification kits and emergency shelters."" Bere added in a statement emailed to NPR that while access ""remains a big concern with a key road cut off by a landslide and other infrastructure badly damaged,"" she's glad to hear the Indonesian Armed Forces is using military aircraft and helicopters to reach survivors. On Monday, Indonesia's energy agency said it hopes to restore the electricity network within three days. In the meantime, portable generators and other supplies are being sent to the area aboard two C-130 Hercules cargo jets, according to Nugroho. The earthquake hit at 5:02 p.m., quickly triggering a tsunami alert. But about 30 minutes later, Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency canceled the warning, saying the quake was ""not capable of generating a tsunami affecting the Indian Ocean region."" Soon afterward, reports of a large tsunami began to emerge, including video showing a large wave ripping through homes and streets near the Palu Grand Mall. The earthquake was caused by ""strike-slip faulting at shallow depths,"" the U.S. Geological Survey says. And while it's common to focus on temblors' epicenters, the agency says, ""earthquakes of this size are more appropriately described as slip over a larger fault area."" It estimates that this quake's size was around 80x30 km or roughly 50 by 20 miles. The U.S.G.S. adds, ""Shallow earthquakes of this size can often have a deadly impact on nearby communities.""","Relief agencies are having trouble reaching stricken areas, setting off looting of stores and aid supplies.

Associated Press,"(ROME) — A quake triggered by Italy’s Mount Etna volcano has jolted eastern Sicily, slightly injuring 10 people and prompting frightened Italian villagers to flee their homes.
Italy’s Civil Protection officials said the quake, at 3:19 a.m. Wednesday, was part of a swarm of some 1,000 tremors, most of them barely perceptible, that are linked to Etna’s ongoing eruption this week.
The 4.8 magnitude earthquake early Wednesday damaged some rural homes, including structures that had been abandoned years ago, toppled a statue in a church in the town of Santa Venerina and opened up cracks on a highway, which was closed for inspection.The Italian news agency ANSA said an 80-year-old man was extracted from the rubble of a house.Government undersecretary Vito Crimi said there were no fatalities and 10 slight injuries.

But the more they insist, the more he resists. The chorus to get Moore to quit grew even louder after a fifth woman came forward to accuse Moore of sexual misconduct. Beverly Young Nelson said Moore sexually assaulted her back in the 1970s, when she just 16 years old. At a news conference, Nelson displayed an inscription in her yearbook that she says Moore wrote, and she said she's willing to testify under oath about her claims. Moore called her allegations ""absolutely false"" and said he doesn't know her. In addition to urging Moore to quit the race, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and others are looking at other options, like drafting a write-in candidate or expelling Moore from the Senate if he were to win. Whatever they decide to do, they don't have a lot time. The Alabama Senate special election is set for December 12. The Department of Justice is considering a special counsel to took look into the Clinton Foundation. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, at the request of House Republicans, has asked senior federal prosecutors to check out alleged ties between the Clinton Foundation and the sale of Uranium One, a uranium mining company, to Russia's Atomic Energy Agency. Republicans have claimed Russian interests sought to donate to the foundation to persuade Clinton to support the deal, which was OK'd in 2010 when Clinton was secretary of state. Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. exchanged private messages with WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential campaign. According to the released messages, first reported by The Atlantic, WikiLeaks reached out to President Donald Trump's adult son just before midnight on September 20, 2016, regarding a PAC-funded, anti-Trump website. This is noteworthy because the intelligence community believes Russia disseminated information from a hack of the Democratic National Committee through WikiLeaks. There are several investigations into possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia. That powerful earthquake that struck along the Iran-Iraq border is the deadliest quake of the year. It's killed at least 452 people so far -- more than September's Mexico City quake -- and injured thousands. About 100 of the dead are from a single town in one Iranian province.

"Michael Snyder, Michael Snyder","Even a month after the initial quake, families continued to pull what remained of their belongings from the rubble. Felipe Luna Each week, Roads &amp; Kingdoms and Slate publish a new dispatch from around the globe. For more foreign correspondence mixed with food, war, travel, and photography, visit its online magazine or follow @roadskingdoms on Twitter. The Istmo de Tehuantepec has always been a fiercely independent place. In the southern part of Oaxaca state, the Istmo is the narrowest point in Mexico, the cinched-in waist of the country’s reclining odalisque, a region known for its raucous parties and dark sense of humor and bold resistance to anything imposed from outside. In 1981, Juchitán de Zaragoza became the first municipality in Mexico to elect an opposition party to power. Nearly a decade earlier, San Mateo del Mar, populated by the twice-conquered Ikoots indigenous community, had developed and implemented an entirely bilingual preschool program, the first of its kind in the state. In the course of the 19 th century, Istmeños resisted interventions and invasions by the British, the French, and the Mexican government itself (in 1850 Mexico’s first indigenous president and national hero, Benito Juárez, responded to a revolt to reclaim use of local salt mines by sending troops to burn Juchitán to the ground). The people are brash and combative, defiant and proud, a little difficult and wickedly funny. Above all, they are self-sufficient. But all of that goes only so far in preparing you for catastrophe. “I jumped up and ran to the window—Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, the ground felt like Jell-O!” At 11:49 p.m. on the night of Sept. 7, an 8.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the southern coast of Mexico, the strongest to hit the country in a century. Felt as far south as El Salvador and as far north as Mexico City, no place suffered greater or more widespread damage than the Istmo, where more than 800,000 people were affected and more than 70,000 homes damaged, nearly 15,000 of them beyond repair. Gloria Nuñez, who lives in the town of Ixtaltepec, 20 miles inland from the Pacific coast, had only just gotten into bed when the ground began to shake. “I jumped up and ran to the window—Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, the ground felt like Jell-O! When my brother came in, we couldn’t even walk to leave. We just stood there in the doorway, holding each other,” she told me one afternoon in early October, almost exactly a month later. We sat under a flimsy blue tarp on the sidewalk, just outside the walls of her half-collapsed home. Her eyes welled with tears. “When it ended, we opened the window, and there was just a white cloud, like a fog. No, I’ve never seen anything like it before, not in my 67 years.” In the town of Union Hidalgo, an hour to the east, Kristal Aquino, a program coordinator for the local branch of a support group for trans women and queer men called Transformandome (literally Transforming Myself), was dozing off in the hammock in her bedroom. “When the ground started to shake, I got up and ran outside—all zigzag of course—out to the patio. I grabbed onto a post there just to stay standing. And I don’t know if it’s because it was dark, but I swear the mango tree was brushing the ground,” she told me, gesturing across the blank concrete slab that used to be her home as though it were a three-dimensional blueprint. “Once I was there outside I suddenly just thought, ‘Shit! My TV!’ and I ran back in to get it!” She laughed uproariously, her whole body shaking. “I must have been delirious! I don’t know how I made it out alive.” When the earth stopped moving, she went back in to see what had become of her belongings (the TV made it out unscathed). Of the 19 statues of the Santa Muerte that she kept in a shrine in her room, just one had fallen. “La Protectora”—the protector—“She was decapitated,” Aquino said. “And I thought, That was for me. Without her I would never have made it out alive.” Twenty miles south in the fishing village of San Mateo del Mar, set on a narrow bar of land between the Pacific and a giant inland lagoon known here as the Mar Muerto (or Dead Sea), loamy soil burst through the floor in the home that Epifania Zaragoza Camacho had spent 20 years building with her husband, Primitivo Olivo Escandón. “I got out of bed and took a step and the ground went out from under me,” she said as she led me into the room where she’d been sleeping that night. The earth rose so fast—or perhaps the house sank, she’s still not sure—that it blocked the door, trapping her inside. Since that night, Epifania and Primitivo have slept near the precariously tilting trunk of a 50-foot fruit tree at the center of their garden. Her saint lost his head, too. Residents of San Mateo del Mar believe their land sank fully 15 cm on the night of Sept. 7. Not long after, heavy rains broke a yearslong dry spell, flooding much of the town with stagnant, diseased water. Felipe Luna Elsewhere in San Mateo, neighbors described their floors splitting, just like Zaragoza’s, and hot water burbling up through the cracks. Others described their wells bursting like fountains. Fishermen who’d gone out that night to gather tortoise eggs, a traditional food in the Istmo, came home to their families with stories of a sea that looked like it was boiling. Others described the water going dead calm and slipping away from the coast, like a sheet pulled off a bed. All of them described the deep cracks that opened in the sand and feeling certain that the earth would swallow them whole. Now, nearly two months after the initial quake struck, the earth is still shaking. There have been more than 8,000 aftershocks so far, many of them strong enough to send loose bits of stone tumbling to the ground. “Our bodies are basically seismographs now,” Aquino told me that day in Union Hidalgo. “The ground moves and we say, 4.8! ” Many families sent grandparents and great-aunts off to recuperate in Puebla or Mexico City, where, less than two weeks later, on Sept. 19, they lived through yet another earthquake, this one with its epicenter in the central state of Puebla. It brought down dozens of buildings in Mexico City, killed more than 300 people (about three times as many as the Sept. 7 quake), and drew what little media attention had once been on the Istmo decisively and permanently north. When another quake hit the Istmo on Sept. 23—this one 6.1 in magnitude but with its epicenter in the Istmo itself—most news outlets reported on Chilangos (as residents of Mexico City, where the quake was also felt, are called) pouring, panicked, from their homes, rather than the fresh round of building collapses and the renewed sense of desperation in the Istmo. Ruben Toledo Santiago, a vegetable vendor in Ixtaltepec, told me that just that morning he’d noticed people returning to the streets, building a new kind of normalcy from the debris. Then the second quake struck. “I know lots of people who left after the 23 rd. There was a mass exit. They said, ‘If god wills it, we’ll see you for the holidays in December,’ ” he told me one afternoon, sitting on the curb across from the ruins of the 100-year-old brick house that used to be his bodega. After that, even those few people whose homes were intact started sleeping outside. The ground kept trembling three, four, five times a day, thunder rolling up from under the streets. Who knew what could come next? The answer was rain, the first real rain the region had seen in over four years. The lagoon invaded Zaragoza’s garden, filling it with tiny, sharp-toothed fish that nibbled at her toes. She and others in San Mateo slept (and are still sleeping) suspended in hammocks over stagnant pools of water; skin and stomach infections are rampant now. In Ixtaltepec, Gloria Nuñez and her family moved rubble farther and farther into the street with each passing night to keep cars—redirected down their formerly quiet street thanks to a bridge that collapsed in the second quake—from splashing silty water on them. By the end of October, the annual north winds, powerful but ordinary, had blown in—gusts up to 180 km/hour rushing out to sea. The winds, Zaragoza told me, might take some of the floodwaters with them, but they would render tarps useless. So where would they sleep then? A blessing became a curse, a marker of the seasons became a brutal enemy—disaster upon disaster, chaos upon chaos. * * * The moment the dust cleared, the rumors started. Nuñez’s friends told her that, on the night of the quake, they’d seen a beam of white light sending sparks into the sky. There were stories of a new hot spring bursting from the hillside at Nizanda, a village known for its thermal springs, and of other villages where tar had bubbled up from the ground. People said a new volcano was forming underfoot. What other explanation, they reasoned, for such an unprecedented seismic event? Other explanations came quickly: mining in the nearby hills; the U.S. government testing missiles in the Pacific for its impending war with North Korea; maybe the Mexican government itself, which, some suspected, had discovered a way to set off earthquakes in an attempt to drive the people from their increasingly valuable land. In San Mateo, people talked of an ancient serpent god who lives below the sand. An evangelical fisherman in Juchitán, the town hardest hit by the quake, blamed the disaster on “Catholics who drink and have parties” and on homosexuals and trans people (in the Istmo, where these communities are more accepted and visible than anyplace in Mexico outside the capital, they’re known collectively as muxes, a term that technically refers only to those who identify as belonging to a third gender but that, particularly in recent years, has come to embrace anyone falling into the general category referred to here as diversidad sexual, or sexual diversity). In Santa María Xadani, a fishing village just outside Juchitán, Josue Lopez, a friend of Aquino’s and a local coordinator for Transformandome, told me that people in his village believed “envy, delinquency, and adultery provoked this.” His friend Antonia, who earns her keep by making paper flowers for the parties that are a constant fixture of Istmeño culture, chimed in. “One lady told us, because there are so many muxes, that that’s why God sent us this punishment.” She laughed. “But if it were because of us, God would have to destroy the whole world.” Faustino Cabrera, who says he foresaw the quake in a vision, has come to the home of his former employer every day since the quake to retrieve what he can from the ruins of her family home. Felipe Luna An old man in Ixtaltepec, 84-year-old Fortino Cabrera Martinez, told me he’d foreseen the disaster in a God-given vision but had kept it to himself because, he explained, the visions “are secrets from God.” A few minutes later, he leaned in conspiratorially and offered another explanation. “The Japanese, they’re fucking clever,” he said. “They swim underground.” There were other rumors, too, uglier ones, that were more closely grounded in truth. While driving us down from Mexico City, Felipe Luna, one of the photographers I was traveling with, received a push notification from Twitter. A news story was making the rounds about a group of people bringing aid from the capital who’d been assaulted and robbed somewhere on the road in Oaxaca. The women had been raped, the car riddled with bullets, the goods stolen. We found out later that this wasn’t exactly true—the assault had actually taken place in the neighboring state of Veracruz (we found this out while stuck on the roadside with a burst tire in Veracruz)—but it was true that cars were being stopped in the outskirts of the city, that aid was being stolen, and that thieves and bandits were pilfering what they could from people’s abandoned homes as they slept. In a week reporting, I didn’t meet anyone who had been robbed personally. But Nuñez’s son slept with a hammer under his pillow, and her brother with a machete. You can’t be too careful. Rumors are both a symptom and a cause of disorder, and in the days and weeks following the quake, information, like everything else in the Istmo, was in short supply. Relief coordinated by Istmeños living in other parts of the Republic arrived almost immediately, but it took three days—and in some cases a full week—for the federal government and military to turn up. There’s now a navy-run hospital in Ixtaltepec and a temporary hospital in Juchitán; there are federally operated albergues serving food in most communities. Military vehicles patrol the streets in Union Hidalgo and Juchitán, and bring aid to San Mateo daily, stopping along the causeway that leads into town to hand out sleeping mats and food to people from outlying neighborhoods who spend their days waiting along the shade-less roadside under a blazing hot sun. James Tucker Loaeza, a teacher from the Catholic Marist Brotherhood who, along with three colleagues, organized a group called Istmo Periferico to distribute aid to the region’s smaller towns, said of the military, “They took too long to come, but once they got here, they did a good job.” Even still, Raúl Herrera, one of Tucker’s partners in the Istmo Periferico project, estimates that the ratio of aid coming from private donors versus the government is likely as high as 7 to 1, though no one knows for sure. Since the Mexico City earthquake on Sept. 19, he says, it has also slowed down considerably. What aid continues to flow in—shipped in from distant corners of the republic, driven in from the state and national capitals, distributed by international charities and private citizens—remains woefully disorganized. Most people I met, particularly in peripheral towns like Union Hidalgo and San Mateo, describe distribution efforts as haphazard, at best, usually given out first come, first serve from fixed points in central locations. One afternoon in San Mateo, I saw a line of women as long as two city blocks. I asked what they were waiting for. They had no idea. It turned out to be three guys from Mexico City who had parked their truck to give out rice, beans, and water. By the time I reached the head of the line, they’d nearly run out. Later that day, I visited Laguna Santa Cruz, the last colonia, or district, in San Mateo. Dragonflies swarmed the scraggly main square, hovering low over the unkempt grass. Felidia Gijon Guajardo, the director of the local community kitchen, worked over a low table slicing onions to throw into a huge, seething pot of mondongo —or tripe soup—that would feed some 200 women and children from the village. Two other volunteers baked totopos —the hard, flat tortillas typical of Oaxaca—in a clay oven called a comezcal. They had eight kilos of masa that day, Gijon told me, and they would almost certainly run out before every mouth had been fed. Military and government help arrived in the colonia of Santa Cruz on the same day that we did, Oct. 5, nearly a month after the earthquake struck. Felipe Luna None of these ingredients had been donated. Gijon and three other local women had opened the kitchen just a few days earlier, traveling back and forth to San Mateo to buy water and vegetables with their own money and going into the underbrush to scavenge for firewood, a difficult task in the rains. Government assistance arrived in Santa Cruz on the same day I did, Oct. 5, in the form of gas canisters, two large trucks of basic foodstuffs delivered by the navy, and a big tankard of drinking water, enough, the men who installed it told me, for about two days. Before that, Gijon said, what little aid had made it to Santa Cruz had come almost entirely from a small handful of private vehicles, from the Catholic parish in San Mateo, and from Caritas, the Catholic charity, which they themselves had petitioned for help. “Most people get to the center of San Mateo and think that’s it, but what about us?” Gijon asked, resigned and exhausted, tossing vegetables into the pot, squinting against banks of smoke and the shattering afternoon sun. She shrugged. “If you want help, you have to go out and find it.” * * * “Sadness here is another thing,” Raúl Herrera told me one quiet afternoon in the patio of his half-broken home, which has become a sort of makeshift conference room for volunteers coming through the region. “It’s not in the church, all somber with candles. Here it’s music and coffee—” “—who has the best joke,” his wife, Lupita, interjected, coming out of the kitchen with a porcelain pitcher of coffee. She laughed. I asked how she remained so upbeat. “I don’t know how other people are doing it, but for us it’s our work that keeps us going. I go to bed so tired and I wake up with so much to do that I don’t have time to be sad. Who knows how I’ll be down the line. But for now, well, things are things. You know, after the earthquake I had to take everything out of the house and I said to myself, ‘I have so much stuff !’ ” She poured me a cup of coffee and nodded to the pitcher in her hand, white and florid with a red rose appliqued onto its body. “Like this pitcher, I got it 13 years ago for my wedding and, you know, I’d used it once—and I thought, well, I’ll use it now, it’s about time, before there’s another earthquake.” She winked. “In times like these, we have to be elegant.” Following the first quake, community organizations sprang up spontaneously in nearly every municipality in the region. In San Mateo, the teachers at the Marist school, who work throughout the year as volunteers, set up their own community kitchen, principally to feed women and children, and have established a radio station to broadcast music and information for the community. Another kitchen came up at the preschool run by the sisters Beatriz and Reyna Gutierrez, both important figures within the community. The school building itself was destroyed in the quake, its top half broken from its foundation and shifted queasily to the west. On my last day in San Mateo, I watched Reyna, who’d founded the school in 1972, prepare a large pot of lentils while Beatriz met with representatives from the state commission on human rights—not an obvious task for a private citizen. The Septima Sección of Juchitán, a principally indigenous neighborhood, was decimated on Sept. 7. Since that night, the neighborhood has been plagued with rumors of looting, roving bandits, and government malfeasance. Felipe Luna Relief is still trickling in, though rarely in the form that’s most needed. There’s food now in most households, but there are few intact homes. In Juchitán, some 75 percent of the city’s 20,000 private homes were damaged on Sept. 7 alone; no one knows how many have fallen since. In Ixtaltepec, Herrera and Tucker estimate, as many as 90 percent of houses were damaged. The night we arrived there, Tucker showed us around what remained of the town. Hundred-year-old houses had collapsed into the street. Newer, two-story structures had fallen like ill-made soufflés. Every street was tented with tarps. Some families had moved their TVs outside. Many streets were impassable: They’d become living rooms, rather than thoroughfares. Most structures were marked with folio numbers issued by government inspectors who had come out shortly after the first quake but had not returned since. Others were marked with big orange X’s to indicate total demolition: “Like the angel of death,” Tucker said. Mexico’s much-loathed president, Enrique Peña Nieto, didn’t arrive in Ixtaltepec to announce a federal aid package until the week I visited. For houses that were completely destroyed, the government would provide 120,000 pesos (about $6,300), split between two cards, one for materials and one for labor, over four months. With the announcement, he indicated a group of preferred distributors (most, though not all, friends of the administration). That sum, people told me, would hardly be enough to build a foundation. Others pointed out that, with the rains still going strong and no indoor spaces intact, buying cement would be useless until the dry season, several months hence. Others who left their homes to recuperate away from the site of their trauma have said that coming back to collect their cards now would be impossible. People are grateful for the help that has come to them from elsewhere in Mexico, grateful, in some cases, that anyone cares at all. But generosity is no substitute for organization and the people should not have to be a replacement for the government. Even now, it remains unclear exactly how much damage has been done, exactly how much aid has come in, exactly who’s received it, and exactly what they’ll need next. Even now, the ground keeps shaking, and no one really knows why. We finished our day with Kristal Aquino in Union Hidalgo over beers at a place called Casona Bar, which she’d described as one of the town’s main queer-friendly places. Before the earthquake, it was housed in a former evangelical prayer house (“the seats had the psalms written on them,” she said), but because of damage in the quake, it had moved to a preschool, shut down, like all schools in the area, until something like order could be restored. People drifted in and out, sipping at cold beers and wiping sweat from their foreheads. Rain was on its way, once again, but hadn’t come just yet. The humidity was almost intolerable. The bartender, a friend of Aquino’s, delivered plates of snacks as we talked over liter after liter of beer: crab legs and dried shrimp and beef fried with chilies. For a moment, we forgot the circumstances that had brought us here. I told Aquino how impressed I was at everyone’s resilience, the standard platitude of the outsider looking for a silver lining to an unspeakable tragedy. People seemed to be coping, I said. They seemed, despite everything, eager to help one another, to get back to normal. Help had been insufficient—it always is— but, as Ruben Toledo Santiago the vegetable vendor had told me that day in Ixtaltepec, “we need to get moving and bring life back to this town. Help,” he’d said, “isn’t going to fall from the sky.” I repeated what Lupita had told me: With so much work to be done, there’s no time to be sad. Aquino shook her head and cocked an eyebrow. “For now people have help. They’re distracted. But after?” She smiled grimly. “It’s going to be chaos.”","Each week, Roads & Kingdoms and Slate publish a new dispatch from around the globe.

Merrit Kennedy,"Rescue workers watch as a heavy machine dig through rubble searching for earthquake victims on Thursday in Palu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Dita Alangkara/AP Indonesia is winding down its search and rescue operations, with thousands of people believed to be still missing after a devastating earthquake and tsunami struck last month on the island of Sulawesi. The official death toll for the disasters stands at 2,073. But the national disaster agency says that the number of those still missing could be as high as 5,000, after the strength of the quake caused the ground to liquefy and swallow up buildings and people. Search efforts had been set to end Thursday, but were extended to Friday. ""Because of the demands of the residents to lengthen the search for victims, we have extended the search and evacuation process for one day,"" said national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, according to The Associated Press. There are prayers set to take place in hard-hit areas, the wire service added, as search efforts continue. The rescue efforts are winding down due to fears about the spread of disease, Reuters reported. ""Heavy equipment hasn't been able to operate in neighborhoods where the earth turned to mud, hampering the search effort, and many bodies have decomposed beyond recognition due to the tropical heat,"" AP reported. The death toll has steadily risen since the double disaster hit on Sept. 28. NPR's Julie McCarthy recently visited the neighborhood of Petobo, where "" the ground has a wobbly consistency not quite jello that is anything but solid,"" and ""in the air, is the pungent scent of dead bodies."" There, she says, major portions of the area have been destroyed. Homes were swept away by liquefaction as McCarthy describes, it's caused by ""soil mixing with water to create a quicksand effect."" In nearby Balaroa on Thursday, relatives of the missing stood waiting for news as rescue crews searched through debris. ""I don't have any tears left, all I want is to find them,"" 43-year-old Ahmad, a farmer, told Reuters. He said his wife and two daughters are missing. Rescue workers are trying to warn families that it's unlikely anyone will be found alive now. ""We hope the families understand that there's very little hope at this point,"" search volunteer Hadrianos Poliamar told Reuters. ""At the same time, if they ask us to help, if they're pointing 'please look here, my family is under here', of course, we can't say 'no', we have to dig. We want to help as many as we can."" Many of the missing are children. And the children that survived are likely to have trouble returning to normalcy according to Save the Children, more than 2,700 schools were ""severely damaged or destroyed in the disaster."" That's going to impact at least 180,000 kids, according to the aid organization. It's likely that many of the dead will never be found, and the true toll of the disasters will never be known. According to The Guardian, Indonesia's disaster agency is planning to clear some of the worst-hit areas and turn them into memorials and parks.","The official death toll for the disasters stands at 2,073.

Associated Press,"By MARI YAMAGUCHI and KEN MORITSUGU TOKYO (AP) — Residents in western Japan were cleaning up debris Monday evening after a powerful earthquake hit the area around Osaka, the country’s second-largest city, killing four people and injuring hundreds while knocking over walls and setting off fires. The magnitude 6.1 earthquake that struck the area early Monday damaged buildings and left many homes without water or gas. The quake also grounded flights in and out of Osaka and paralyzed traffic and commuter trains most of the day. By evening, bullet trains and some local trains had resumed operation, and stations were swollen with commuters trying to get home, many of them waiting in long lines. An exodus of commuters who chose to walk home filled sidewalks and bridges. Some commuters took refuge in nearby shelters instead of going home. NHK public television showed dozens of men wearing ties and carrying briefcases sitting on gym mats at a junior high school gymnasium in Ibaraki city, where some families also gathered. Takatsuki city confirmed another victim late Monday, as the death toll rose to four. City officials didn’t have details of the victim, but NHK and Kyodo News reported that an 81-year-old woman was found dead underneath a wardrobe that fell on her at her home in Takatsuki. Also in Takatsuki, a concrete wall at an elementary school fell onto the street, killing 9-year-old Rina Miyake as she walked to the school. NHK showed the collapsed upper half of the high wall, which was painted cheerfully with flowers, trees and blue sky and surrounded the school swimming pool. Mayor Takeshi Hamada apologized over her death because of the wall’s collapse. The city acknowledged that the wall did not meet building safety codes. The structure was old and made of concrete blocks — a known risk in earthquakes. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga ordered the Education Ministry to conduct nationwide safety checks of concrete block structures at public schools. More than 1,000 schools were closed in Osaka and nearby prefectures, Kyodo News reported. Wall cracks and other minor damage were found at several schools. A man in his 80s died in the collapse of a concrete wall in Osaka city. An 85-year-old man in nearby Ibaraki died after a bookcase fell on top of him at home, according to the disaster management agency. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said 307 people were treated for injuries at hospitals. Most of the injured were in Osaka. Osaka officials did not give details, but the injuries reported in Kyoto and three other neighboring prefectures were all minor. The quake struck shortly before 8 a.m. north of Osaka at a depth of about 13 kilometers (8 miles), the Japan Meteorological Agency said. The strongest shaking was north of Osaka, but the quake rattled large parts of western Japan, including Kyoto, the agency said. Dozens of domestic flights in and out of Osaka were grounded, while train and subway service in the Osaka area, including bullet trains, was suspended to check for damage. Passengers exited trains on the tracks between stations. Some subway service resumed in the afternoon, but stations remained crowded with passengers waiting for trains to restart, many of them sitting on the floor. Long lines of people waited to board bullet trains as they resumed operation. Some manufacturers, including automakers Daihatsu Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co., electronics makers Panasonic and Sharp Corp., and confectioners Ezaki Glico Co. and Meiji Co., temporarily stopped production lines at their factories in the region for safety checks, news reports said. The quake knocked over walls, broke windows and set off scattered building fires. It toppled furniture in homes and goods onto shop floors. It also cracked roads and broke water pipes, leaving homes without water. Many homes and buildings, including a major hospital, were temporarily without power, though electricity was restored at most places by midafternoon. Due to damage to underground gas lines, 110,000 homes in Takatsuki and Ibaraki cities were without gas, and repairs are expected to take as long as two weeks, according to Osaka Gas Co. More building damage was found in the afternoon as disaster and relief workers inspected and cleaned up the affected areas. Roofs and roof tiles at homes and at least one temple fell to the ground in Osaka. At a shrine in Kyoto, stone lanterns broke and collapsed to the ground. Defense troops joined rescue and relief operations in parts of Osaka, along with special vehicles to deliver clean drinking water. Residents cleaned up debris at home and stores throughout the day. Meteorological agency officials warned of strong aftershocks in the area, urging residents to stay away from damaged structures. The earthquake reminded many of the magnitude 7.3 Kobe quake in 1995 that killed more than 6,000 people in the region. Monday’s quake also followed a series of smaller quakes near Tokyo in recent weeks. Japan’s northern prefectures are still recovering from a magnitude 9.0 quake and tsunami in 2011 that killed more than 18,000. “It was not as bad as the Kobe quake,” said Jun Kawanami, a 30-year-old lawyer in Osaka. He said his wife ducked under a table and elevators in his office building were out of operation. “I used the stairs but I was out of breath by the time I arrived at my office on the 22nd floor,” he said. ___ This story has been corrected to say the quake struck shortly before 8 a.m., not after. ___ Hiromi Tanoue in Osaka contributed to this report. ___ Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi Find her work at https://www.apnews.com/search/mari%20yamaguchi","The Mercury News Strong quake near Osaka, Japan, kills 4, knocks over walls The Mercury News By MARI YAMAGUCHI and KEN MORITSUGU.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Indonesia quake looter: ""We need to eat"" Volunteers have begun burying victims of Indonesia's deadly earthquake and tsunami in a mass grave. The disaster devastated swathes of Sulawesi island and has left at least 844 people dead. Four days after the natural disaster hit, some remote areas have yet to be contacted. A lack of heavy lifting equipment is hampering rescuers' attempts to reach people who remain alive in the ruins of collapsed buildings. ""Communication is limited, heavy machinery is limited... it's not enough for the numbers of buildings that collapsed,"" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. Dozens of people are feared to be underneath the rubble of one hotel alone, the Roa-Roa in the devastated coastal resort of Palu. Yenni Suryani, of Catholic Relief Services, said aid agencies were struggling to get staff into affected areas as the main airport at Palu was damaged, landslides had cut road links and ""power is out almost everywhere"". Some survivors have been looting shops for food, water and fuel, telling reporters they have run out of supplies. Reuters news agency reports that police are escorting aid convoys to prevent supplies being stolen. President Joko Widodo has welcomed offers of international help. On a visit to the region, the president urged a ""day and night"" effort to rescue survivors. Meanwhile, government officials say some 1,200 inmates escaped from three prisons in the region as the quake struck. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Military aircraft have been evacuating some of the injured Image copyright EPA Image caption A shattered mosque in Palu Why mass graves? The authorities say they want to prevent an outbreak of disease caused by decomposing bodies. In the hills above Palu, AFP news agency reports, volunteers filling a mass grave were instructed to prepare for a total of 1,300 victims to arrive. Trucks arrived with bodies wrapped in orange, yellow and black bags. They were dragged into the grave and motorised diggers poured earth on top. But many people are still looking for missing loved ones. Adi told AFP he was hugging his wife by the beach in Palu when the tsunami struck, and has not seen her since. ""When the wave came, I lost her,"" he said. ""I was carried about 50 metres. I couldn't hold anything."" Patients and corpses side by side By Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Palu Lying on a stretcher in the dark outside the Mamboro health clinic in Palu is a five-year-old girl with a broken leg. She was found alone, Doctor Sasono tells me. ""We don't know where her family is and she doesn't remember where they live."" His clinic has no power and is running out of medical supplies. A few metres from her stretcher bed are rows of bodies in bags. The smell of decomposition fills the air. Dr Sasono says they will be buried in mass graves to stop the spread of diseases: ""They are starting to smell. We want to wait for relatives to pick them up, but we can't wait any longer."" Rows of rubble lie all along the shoreline where vibrant fishing villages once stood. People's possessions lie smashed together, with cars and boats tossed around by the massive waves. Amid the rubble are tents where families are sleeping out in the open. Why was the tsunami so destructive? The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles) just off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday, setting off a tsunami. The earthquake was powerful but shallow and with more lateral than vertical movement, not typically the kind of tremor that sets off tsunamis. A sophisticated tsunami warning system was put in place across the whole Pacific region after the 2004 disaster, which killed nearly a quarter of a million people. A tsunami warning was issued after the earthquake hit on Friday, but many people in Palu did not receive alerts because of power cuts caused by the tremor. There were also no sirens located along the coast. Videos show people screaming as waves 6m (20ft) high power over the beach - where a festival was being set-up - sweeping up everything in their path. Indonesia, one of the world's most disaster-prone countries, lies on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" where tectonic plates collide and many of the world's volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.

Jesse Ferreras,"Three earthquakes measured at magnitudes of anywhere between 6.5 and 6.8 struck off Vancouver Island on Sunday night. They hit about 200 kilometres west of the island, according to Natural Resources Canada (NRC). A 6.5-magnitude quake hit at 10:39 p.m., a 6.8-magnitude quake at 11:16 p.m. and another 6.5-magnitude quake at 11:22 p.m., it said. Coverage of earthquakes on Globalnews.ca: One of the quakes, which was measured at a magnitude of 6.5, hit approximately 200 kilometres from the Vancouver Island community of Port Alice on Sunday night. The 6.8-magnitude quake is believed to have struck just under 200 kilometres west of Port Alice. There were no reports of damage, and “none would be expected,” according to NRC. The earthquake’s location was pegged at 208 kilometres west-southwest of Port Alice, and 478 kilometres west of Vancouver. The quake happened at a depth of approximately 10 kilometres and no tsunami was expected. Nor were there any reports of the quake having been felt.

Devin Coldewey,"It’s been a while since I defragged — years, probably, because these days for a number of reasons computers don’t really need to. But perhaps it is we who need to defrag. And what better way to defrag your brain after a long week than by watching the strangely satisfying defragmentation process taking place on a simulated DOS machine, complete with fan and HDD noise? That’s what you can do with this Twitch stream, which has defrag.exe running 24/7 for your enjoyment. I didn’t realize how much I missed the sights and sounds of this particular process. I’ve always found ASCII visuals soothing, and there was something satisfying about watching all those little blocks get moved around to form a uniform whole. What were they doing down there on the lower right hand side of the hard drive anyway? That’s what I’d like to know. Afterwards I’d launch a state of the art game like Quake 2 just to convince myself it was loading faster. There’s also that nice purring noise that a hard drive would make (and which is recreated here). At least, I thought of it as purring. For the drive, it’s probably like being waterboarded. But I did always enjoy having the program running while keeping everything else quiet, perhaps as I was going to bed, so I could listen to its little clicks and whirrs. Sometimes it would hit a particularly snarled sector and really go to town, grinding like crazy. That’s how you knew it was working. The typo is, no doubt, deliberate. The whole thing is simulated, of course. There isn’t really just an endless pile of hard drives waiting to be defragged on decades-old hardware for our enjoyment (except in my box of old computer things). But the simulation is wonderfully complete, although if you think about it you probably never used DOS on a 16:9 monitor, and probably not at 1080p. It’s okay. We can sacrifice authenticity so we don’t have to windowbox it. The defragging will never stop at TwitchDefrags, and that’s comforting to me. It means I don’t have to build a 98SE rig and spend forever copying things around so I have a nicely fragmented volume. Honestly they should include this sound on those little white noise machines. For me this is definitely better than whale noises.","It's been a while since I defragged — years, probably, because these days for a number of reasons computers don't really need to.

Associated Press,"(TEHRAN) — Iranian state TV says a 7.2-magnitude earthquake has jolted the region near the border between Iran and Iraq. The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed the quake on its website, placing its epicenter at around 32km (19 miles) outside the Iraqi city of Halabja, and issuing an “orange” alert for “shaking-related fatalities and economic losses.” The semi-official Iranian ILNA news agency reported that at least 14 provinces had been impacted by the earthquake. Iranian social media was abuzz with posts of people evacuating their homes, especially from the cities of Ghasr-e Shirin (near Iraqi border) and Kermanshah. Faramarz Akbari, Ghasr-e Shirin’s governor, said that six people had died and scores more injured, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. Esmail Najar, head of Iran’s National Disaster Management Organization, said “some injured people might be buried under the rubble in Ghasr-e Shirin”. Iran is prone to near daily quakes as it sits on many major fault lines.

Reuters,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - The toll from an earth quake and tsunami in Indonesia soared to 832 confirmed dead on Sunday, with authorities fearing the numbers will climb as rescuers grappled to get aid to outlying communities cut off from communications and help. Dozens of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of several hotels and a mall in the city of Palu, on Sulawesi island, which was hit by waves as high as six meters (20 feet) following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday. A woman was pulled alive from the debris of the city's Roa Roa Hotel, where up to 60 people were believed trapped. Hundreds of people gathered at the wrecked eight-storey Tatura Mall searching for loved ones. ""Grieve for the people of Central Sulawesi, we all grieve together,"" President Joko Widodo tweeted late on Sunday. Most of the confirmed deaths were in Palu itself, and authorities are bracing for the toll to climb as connections with outlying areas are restored. Map locating the city of Palu in Sulawesi island. via Reuters Of particular concern is Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the quake, and two other districts, which has been cut off from communications since Friday. ""We haven't received reports from the three other areas. Communication is still down, power is still out. We don't know for sure what is the impact,"" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, told a news conference. Along with Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta, these districts have a combined population of about 1.4 million. A video of the outskirts of Donggala shot on Sunday afternoon by the Indonesian Red Cross showed scenes of devastation, with houses flattened into piles of rubble and broken furniture. Smaller aftershocks from Friday's quake continued to rumble through the area. Social worker Lian Gogali tweeted from the area that several villages on the west coast of Sulawesi were in desperate need of food, medicine and shelter and that road access was still limited.

Antara Foto/Muhammad Adimaja/via REUTERS Pledge to rebuild Five foreigners - three French, one South Korean and one Malaysian - were among the missing, Nugroho said. The 832 dead included people crushed in the quake and swept away by the tsunami. Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the death toll could rise into the thousands. Earlier President Widodo visited a housing complex flattened when the quake liquefied the soil it stood on, and called for patience. ""I know there are many problems that need to be solved in a short time, including communications,"" he said. The ruins would be rebuilt, he said, as aftershocks rattled the region 48 hours after the quake. Footage of the ruined city show a crumpled mess of houses, cars and trees mashed together by the quake, with rooftops and roads split and left at all angles. ""There are estimated to be many victims in this area. Evacuation is difficult because many collapsed houses are buried in soil,"" the National Disaster Mitigation Agency's Nugroho said on Sunday evening. A woman cries as she waits to be evacuated by military aircraft following an earthquake and tsunami at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Antara Foto/Hafidz Mubarak A/via REUTERS Internal Affairs Minister Tjahjo Kumolo, asked about reports of looting on social media, said he had ordered authorities to help people get food and drink and businesses would be compensated. One video posted on YouTube showed people grabbing boxes of supplies from a truck. Television pictures showed scores of residents shouting ""we're hungry, we need food"" as soldiers distributed rations from a truck in one neighborhood, while footage from elsewhere showed people making off with clothes and other items from a wrecked mall. State logistics agency chief Budi Waseso said it was preparing to send hundreds of tonnes of government rice stocks to Central Sulawesi areas affected by the disaster. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said the government had allocated 560 billion rupiah ($37.58 million) for disaster recovery, media reported. Questions about warnings Indonesia, which sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, is all too familiar with deadly earthquakes and tsunamis. In 2004, aquake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean, killing 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Questions are sure to be asked why warning systems set up after that disaster appear to have failed on Friday. Nugroho, bemoaning a fall in funding, said no tsunami buoys, one type of instrument used to detect the waves, in Indonesia had been operating since 2012. The meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake but lifted it 34 minutes later, drawing criticism it had been too hasty. But officials estimated the waves had hit while the warning was in force. Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on Palu's beach when the water surged. A disaster official said the tsunami traveled across the sea at speeds of 800 kph (500 mph). Video on social media showed water bearing whirls of debris rushing in as people shouted in alarm and scattered. Palu is at the head of a bay, about 10 km long and 2 km wide, which had ""amplified"" the wave as it was funneled toward the city, a geophysics agency official said. The BMKG said its closest tidal gauge sensor, about 200 km (125 miles) from Palu, had only recorded an ""insignificant"" 6 cm (2.5 inches) wave. Palu's airport was damaged in the quake, but had reopened for limited commercial flights, authorities said. Neighbors including Australia, Thailand and China offered help and Pope Francis, speaking to thousands in St. Peter's Square, said he was praying for the victims. The European Union has announced 1.5 million euros ($1.74 million) in immediate aid. Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population but also significant pockets of Christians, including on Sulawesi, which is one of the archipelago nation's five main islands.

Tian Jun-hsiung/AP A series of earthquakes is rocking Taiwan, leaving two dead and more than 100 injured, according to the Associated Press, which cites Taiwan's Premier William Lai. The temblors started late Tuesday night, toppling buildings, destroying one bridge, and buckling paved streets along the island's eastern coast. The quakes continue to jolt the area near Hualien County through early Wednesday morning. The latest AP tally reports 144 people are injured. Four buildings have collapsed and one bridge has been damaged, Taiwan's National Fire Agency told ABC News. The largest quake so far was reported at 11:50 p.m. Tuesday night local time, registering at 6.4 magnitude by the United States Geological Survey. The Central Weather Bureau, which tracks seismic activity in Taiwan, reported the epicenter of the earthquake was at sea about 18.3 kilometers north of Hualien City. The Central News Agency reported that the ground floor of the Marshal Hotel, a building in Hualien district, had caved in and people were believed to be trapped inside. According to ABC, ""there were over 100 guests in the hotel at the time of the quake, and at least three people remain trapped, the department said. Firefighters are continuing to deal with gas leaks and fires as a result of the quake."" And, the AP says, Taiwanese media reported that a separate hotel known as the Beautiful Life Hotel is tilting. Compilation footage posted to Twitter by the China Global Television Network shows a building tilting on its side over a line of cars parked along the street. People can be seen running down the street, carrying ladders to climb over the rubble and reach people still inside the collapsed building. Another clip shows the damage caused inside a store. A handful of employees race out of frame as merchandise is shaken off the shelves and onto the ground. Don Blakeman, a geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information Center, says the temblors have continued into the early morning hours on Wednesday. There have been three aftershock quakes over 5.0 so far. And, he added, these are just the latest in a series of quakes that began last week. The AP reported the 6.4 temblor followed one over the weekend off the coast of Hualien, which lies along the famed ""Pacific Rim of Fire"" known for seismic activity from Alaska to Southeast Asia. This is a developing story. Some facts reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong.

Reuters Editorial,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese nuclear energy station is relying on emergency back up power after a powerful earthquake knocked out electricity on the northern island of Hokkaido on Thursday, a stark reminder of the Fukushima disaster more than seven years ago. The three-reactor Tomari nuclear plant, operated by Hokkaido Electric Power and in shutdown since the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster, lost power after a magnitude 6.7 quake hit the island in the early hours, the government said. The station’s fuel rods are being cooled with emergency power supplied by diesel generators, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Thursday. There were no radiation irregularities at the plant, Suga said, citing the operator. The atomic regulator said the diesel generators have enough fuel to last seven days. More than 100 have been injured and 19 are missing following the quake, according to broadcaster NHK. On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9 earthquake, the most powerful recorded in Japan, struck off the northern Honshu coast. The quake set off a massive tsunami that devastated a wide swathe of the Pacific coastline and left nearly 20,000 dead. The quake knocked out power to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and the tsunami swamped diesel generators placed low in reactor buildings, leading to a series of explosions and meltdowns in the world’s worst nuclear disaster for 25 years. The crisis led to the shutdown of the country’s nuclear industry, once the world’s third-biggest. Seven reactors have come back online after a protracted relicensing process. The majority of Japanese people remain opposed to nuclear power after Fukushima highlighted failings in regulation and operational procedures in the industry. Hokkaido Electric has shut down all fossil fuel plants, cutting power to all its nearly 3 million customers, a spokesman told Reuters by phone. Japan’s industry minister, Hiroshige Seko, has instructed Hokkaido Electric to restart its biggest coal plant after the station was tripped by the earthquake. The blackout shut down Hokkaido’s New Chitose Airport, a popular gateway to the most northern of Japan’s main islands, the second major airport to be knocked out in the country in two days after a typhoon swamped the nation’s third-biggest. Japan is in the midst of a record tourism boom and will host the Olympics in 2020. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, arriving at his office before 6 a.m., told reporters saving lives was the priority as his government set up a command center to coordinate relief and rescue. A fire broke out at a steel plant operated by Mitsubishi Steel Manufacturing in the city of Muroran, but has largely been brought under control, a spokesman told Reuters. Idemitsu Kosan, Japan’s second biggest refiner by sales, stopped all refining and product shipments at its 150,000 barrels per day Hokkaido refinery, an official told Reuters.

CBS/AP,"TAIPEI, Taiwan -- A strong and shallow earthquake struck off Taiwan's east coast on Sunday night, but there were no immediate reports of any injuries. The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude-6.1 quake's epicenter was 14 kilometers, about 9 miles, northeast of the city of Hualien, at a depth of just 7.8 kilometers, about 4.9 miles. Shallow quakes tend to cause more damage than deeper ones. Taiwan's Central News Agency said the island's earthquake monitoring agency registered seven tremors around that time, with the strongest recorded at a magnitude of 5.8 and a depth of 16 kilometers. The quake toppled buildings in Hualien, leaving civilians trapped inside, Reuters news agency reports, citing a Ministry of Interior official. Earthquakes frequently rattle Taiwan, but most are minor and cause little or no damage. However, a magnitude-7.6 quake in central Taiwan in 1999 killed more than 2,300 people.

At least 832 people were killed after an earthquake caused giant waves to smash into the Southeast Asian nation on Friday, and the toll is expected to rise significantly. Heavily populated areas were cut off, and rescuers in the city of Palu, where thousands of buildings collapsed, often used their bare hands to search rubble for survivors. Recriminations begin: Scientists were surprised by the size and power of the tsunami, but critics are starting to question why residents were not given better warning of the coming waves, which reached as high as 18 feet within half an hour of the quake. While 22 monitoring buoys had been spread over Indonesias open water, none had been operational for years, an official said. Hundreds of children per week more than 1,600 so far have been bused to an unregulated camp in the desert, where theres no schooling and limited access to legal aid. To limit escape attempts, the buses leave at night with little warning. Until now, children held by the federal immigration authorities had been housed in private foster homes or shelters, which are regulated and monitored by welfare authorities.

Reuters Editorial,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities scrambled on Monday to get aid and rescue equipment into quake-hit Sulawesi island, and prepared to bury some of the more than 800 dead, while shaken survivors streamed out of the area in search of food and shelter. The confirmed death toll of 832 looked certain to rise as rescuers slowly reached devastated outlying communities hit on Friday by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet). Dozens of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of several hotels and a mall in the small city of Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta, with hundreds more feared buried in landslides that engulfed villages. President Joko Widodo told reporters in Jakarta getting those people out was a priority. “The evacuation is not finished yet, there are many places where the evacuation couldn’t be done because of the absence of heavy equipment, but last night equipment started to arrive in Palu,” Widodo said. “We’ll send as much food supplies as possible today with Hercules planes, directly from Jakarta, there are several,” he said, referring to C-130 military transport aircraft. The national search and rescue agency said one woman was rescued overnight in the Palu neighborhood of Balaroa, where houses were swallowed up when the earthquake caused soil liquefaction. Most of the confirmed deaths were in Palu, a city of about 380,000 people, where authorities were preparing a mass grave to bury some of the dead as soon as they were identified. However, nearly three days after the quake, the extent of the disaster has yet to be made clear with authorities bracing for the death toll to climb sharply - perhaps into the thousands - as connections with remote areas up and down the coast are restored. Of particular concern is Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the quake, and two other districts, which have been cut off from communications since Friday. Along with Palu, these districts have a combined population of about 1.4 million. Five foreigners - three French, one South Korean and one Malaysian - were among the missing. Sulawesi is one of the earthquake-prone archipelago nation’s five main islands and sits astride fault lines. Numerous aftershocks have rattled the region.

Officials say rescuers need heavy equipment to shift slabs of broken concrete but access to many areas has been hampered by damaged roads, landslides and collapsed bridges. A Reuters witness said queues at petrol stations on the approaches to Palu stretched for kilometers. Convoys carrying food, water and fuel headed towards the city while a stream of residents headed out. The state energy company said it was airlifting in 4,000 liters of fuel, while Indonesia’s logistics agency said it would send hundreds of tonnes of rice. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said the government had allocated 560 billion rupiah ($37.58 million) for disaster recovery, media reported. Military aircraft were sent to bring people out of Palu, where crowds were waiting at the airport, military official Bambang Sudewo told Metro TV. “All military planes are deployed to support this,” he said. It was hoped up to 1,500 people could be taken out every day, with children, women and the injured the priority, he said. Indonesia, which sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, is all too familiar with earthquakes and tsunamis. A quake off Sumatra island in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

Fathin Ungku,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Children in the Indonesian city of Palu began returning to school on Monday to tidy up their classrooms and to help gather data on how many of them will be coming back 10 days after a major earthquake and tsunami hit their city. The 7.5 magnitude quake on Sept. 28 brought down many buildings in the small city on Sulawesi island, 1,500 km (30 miles) northeast of Jakarta, while tsunami waves smashed into its beachfront. But the biggest killer was probably soil liquefaction, which happens when a powerful quake turns the ground into a liquid mire and which obliterated several Palu neighborhoods. The official death toll is 1,763 but bodies are still being recovered. No one knows how many people are missing, especially in the areas hit by liquefaction, but it could be as high as 5,000, the national disaster agency said. At one state high school, teenagers dressed in gray and white uniforms swept up broken glass in the classrooms. Trophies had fallen from a broken school showcase and the basketball court was cracked. “It’s sad to see our school like this,” said Dewi Rahmawati, 17, who expects to graduate next year and wants to study economics at university. The students found out that they had to turn up to school through messages on Facebook and WhatsApp. School principal Kasiludin said authorities told all teachers to show up for work from Monday to collect information on student numbers. “We won’t force the students to come back because many are traumatized. But we must start again soon to keep their spirits up and so they don’t fall behind,” he said. The school had lost at least seven students and one teacher, he said. GRAPHIC: Catastrophe in Sulawesi - tmsnrt.rs/2OqQlUo POSITIVE THINKING At the SMP Negeri 15 Palu middle school, fewer than 50 of its 697 students showed up. School principal Abdul Rashid said he was aware of four students killed in the quake. “Classes haven’t started.

For now, I don’t think we’re ready.

I want to think positively; I hope they are OK,” said Muhamad Islam Bintang Lima, dressed in the school uniform of white shirt and navy blue trousers. Most of the dead from the quake and tsunami were in Palu, the region’s main urban center. Figures for more remote areas are trickling in but they seem to have suffered fewer deaths than the city. Sulawesi is one of Indonesia’s five main islands. The archipelago sees frequent earthquakes and occasional tsunamis. In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. A spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency said on Sunday searches for bodies would stop on Thursday. Debris would be cleared and areas hit by liquefaction would be turned into parks, sports venues and other public spaces, the spokesman said. Indonesia is hosting an International Monetary Fund/World Bank meeting on the resort island of Bali this week, which has drawn some criticism from the political opposition. “What is the benefit for us Indonesian people, especially in this time of catastrophe,” Fadli Zon, deputy speaker of parliament from the opposition nationalist Gerindra party, said on Twitter, taking issue with government spending on the meeting. The government has allocated $37 million to help victims of the earthquake.

,"A magnitude 7.5 earthquake rocked Indonesias Sulawesi island, near the city of Palu, on Friday. The quake triggered a 20-foot-tall tsunami that swept across Palu and the surrounding area. The death toll has climbed past 800, but authorities say they fear it could grow, as the desperate search for survivors continues. One survivor told reporters: ""The ground rose up like a spine and suddenly fell."" Officials said hundreds could still be buried in the mud and debris. Several towns remain cut off because roads and bridges were damaged or destroyed, hindering rescue and recovery efforts. (MORE: The Latest from the Aftermath ) Indonesian President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo toured Palu, home to 380,000 people, on Sunday. ""There are many challenges,"" Jokowi said. ""We have to do many things soon, but conditions do not allow us to do so."" Jokowi also said there are also shortages of fuel, electricity and food. The quake and tsunami were the latest natural disasters to hit Indonesia, which is frequently struck by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. In December 2004, a massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra island in western Indonesia triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries.

Fathin Ungku,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia scrambled on Monday to get help into quake-hit Sulawesi island as survivors streamed away from their ruined homes and accounts of devastation filtered out of remote areas, including the death of 34 children at a Christian camp. The confirmed death toll of 844 was certain to rise as rescuers reached devastated outlying communities hit on Friday by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami waves as high as six metres (20 feet). Dozens of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of several hotels and a mall in the small city of Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. Hundreds more were feared buried in landslides that engulfed villages. Of particular concern is Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicentre of the quake, and two other districts, where communication had been cut off. The four districts have a combined population of about 1.4 million. One woman was recovered alive from ruins overnight in the Palu neighbourhood of Balaroa, where about 1,700 houses were swallowed up when the earthquake caused soil to liquefy, the national rescue agency said. “We don’t know how many victims could be buried there, it’s estimated hundreds,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. All but 23 of the confirmed deaths were in Palu, a city of about 380,000 people, where workers were preparing a mass grave to bury the dead as soon as they were identified. Nearly three days after the quake, the extent of the disaster was not known with authorities bracing for the toll to climb - perhaps into the thousands - as connections with remote areas up and down the coast are restored. Aid worker Lian Gogali, who had reached Donggala district by motorcycle, said hundreds of people facing a lack of food and medicine were trying to get out, but evacuation teams had yet to arrive and roads were blocked. “It’s devastating,” she told Reuters by text. Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani said a church in an area of Sigi, south of Palu, had been engulfed in mud and debris. Officials said the area suffered liquefaction, when the shock of the quake temporarily destabilises the soil. “My volunteers found 34 bodies... children who had been doing a bible camp,” Arriani said. Sulawesi is one of the earthquake-prone archipelago nation’s five main islands and sits astride fault lines. Numerous aftershocks have rattled the region. Pictures showed expanses of splintered wood, washed-up cars and trees mashed together, with rooftops and roads split asunder. Access to many areas is being hampered by damaged roads, landslides and collapsed bridges. AIRPORT CHAOS A Reuters witness said queues at petrol stations on the approaches to Palu stretched for miles. Convoys carrying food, water and fuel awaited police escorts to prevent pilfering before heading towards the city while residents streamed out. The state energy company said it was airlifting in 4,000 litres of fuel, while Indonesia’s logistics agency said it would send hundreds of tonnes of rice. The government has allocated 560 billion rupiah ($37.58 million) for the recovery. The government has played down worries about looting though witnesses have seen incidents. Chief security minister Wiranto said more than 2,800 troops had been deployed and plans were in place to send in a further 2,000 police. The government would accept offers of help from 18 countries and it had also commandeered 20 excavators from mines and plantations to help with a shortage of equipment to dig through wreckage and clear blocked roads, he said. Nearly 60,000 people were displaced, many terrified by powerful aftershocks, and they needed tents, water and sanitary facilities, while the power utility was working to restore electricity, he said. Commercial flights have yet to resume but military aircraft were taking people out of Palu. About 3,000 people thronged the small airport hoping to get out and officers struggled to keep order. “I’d get a plane anywhere. I’ve been waiting for two days. Haven’t eaten, barely had a drink,” said 44-year-old food vendor Wiwid. Indonesia is all too familiar with earthquakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Palu sits astride the Palu-Koro fault, which runs north-south along the edge of Palu Bay. Geologists estimate segments of the fault have a slip that is among the highest in Indonesia, at 4 cm (1.6 inches) a year, exposing the area to a higher risk of quakes. Questions are sure to be asked why warning systems set up after the 2004 disaster appear to have failed. Disaster agency spokesman Nugroho told reporters on Sunday none of Indonesia’s tsunami buoys, one device used to detect waves, had been operating since 2012. He blamed a lack of funds. The meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake but lifted it 34 minutes later, drawing criticism it had been too hasty. However, officials estimated the waves had hit while the warning was in force.

Fathin Ungku,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Children in the Indonesian city of Palu began returning to school on Monday to tidy up their classrooms and to help gather data on how many of them will be coming back 10 days after a major earthquake and tsunami hit their city. The 7.5 magnitude quake on Sept. 28 brought down many buildings in the small city on Sulawesi island, 1,500 km (30 miles) northeast of Jakarta, while tsunami waves smashed into its beachfront. But the biggest killer was probably soil liquefaction, which happens when a powerful quake turns the ground into a liquid mire and which obliterated several Palu neighborhoods. The official death toll is 1,763 but bodies are still being recovered. No one knows how many people are missing but it is at least in the hundreds. At one state high school, teenagers dressed in gray and white uniforms swept up broken glass in the classrooms. Trophies had fallen from a broken school showcase and the basketball court was cracked. “It’s sad to see our school like this,” said Dewi Rahmawati, 17, who expects to graduate next year and wants to study economics at university. The students found out that they had to turn up to school through messages on Facebook and WhatsApp. School principal Kasiludin said authorities told all teachers to show up for work from Monday to collect information on student numbers. “We won’t force the students to come back because many are traumatized. But we must start again soon to keep their spirits up and so they don’t fall behind,” he said. The school had lost at least seven students and one teacher, he said. GRAPHIC: Catastrophe in Sulawesi - tmsnrt.rs/2OqQlUo POSITIVE THINKING At the SMP Negeri 15 Palu middle school, fewer than 50 of its 697 students showed up. School principal Abdul Rashid said he was aware of four students killed in the quake. “Classes haven’t started. We’re only collecting data to find out how many students are safe,” he said. “I’m still waiting for the Ministry of Education to give us instructions on when to begin classes. For now, I don’t think we’re ready. Many children are traumatized and frightened.” One boy chatting in the school compound with a few friends said he was disappointed that so few of his class mates had shown up. “I want school to start as soon as possible so I can find out how my friends are doing,” said Muhamad Islam Bintang Lima, dressed in the school uniform of white shirt and navy blue trousers. “I haven’t heard from so many of them. I want to think positively; I hope they are OK.” Most of the dead from the quake and tsunami were in Palu, the region’s main urban center.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Relatives of hundreds of people missing after an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reacted with anger, sadness and resignation on Sunday to a decision by the state disaster agency to end searches for bodies later this week. The 7.5 magnitude quake on Sept. 28 brought down shopping malls, hotels and other buildings in the city of Palu, while tsunami waves smashed into its beachfront. But perhaps more deadly was soil liquefaction which obliterated several Palu neighbourhoods. No one knows how many people are missing but it is at least in the hundreds, rescuers say. The official death toll has risen to 1,763 but bodies are still being recovered, at least 34 in one place alone on Saturday and more on Sunday. “Many of us are angry that we haven’t found our families and friends and they want to give up?” said Hajah Ikaya, 60, who says she lost her sister, brother-in-law and niece in the Balaroa neighbourhood in the south of the city. They are all missing. Balaroa was one of areas particularly hard hit by liquefaction, which turns the ground into a roiling quagmire, destroying houses and dragging people under the mud and debris. The disaster agency said earlier liquefaction destroyed 1,700 houses in one neighbourhood alone with hundreds of people buried in the mud. “We’re Muslim. We need a proper burial, in the Islamic way,” said Ikaya. “We don’t want this.” Disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a briefing in Jakarta some limited searching might continue but large-scale searches with many personnel and heavy equipment would cease on Oct. 11. Debris would be cleared and areas hit by liquefaction would be turned into parks and sports venues. Surveys would be carried out and people living in vulnerable places would be moved. “We don’t want the community to be relocated to such dangerous places,” Nugroho said. Most of the dead from the quake and tsunami were in Palu, the region’s main urban centre. Figures for more remote areas are trickling in but they seem to have suffered fewer deaths than the city. Dede Diman, 25, a resident of Petobo, another neighbourhood in Palu that was laid waste by liquefaction, said rescuers hadn’t even started searching where his sister was lost. “We’re already angry,” said Diman, who is living in a shelter with his brother and another sister. Their mother was killed and her body found. “We don’t agree with giving up. Even if they give up, we won’t. We want to find our sister.” PRAYERS Mohammad Irfan, 25, got home to Palu on Sunday, as air services picked up, from his job on Bali island, to help search for his missing grandfather. “I’d feel very sad if the search mission ends because there are so many still missing and buried,” he said. A grieving father was resigned to the search ending without his two-year-old daughter being found. “What’s the point anyway? At this stage, they’re not even recognisable,” said Ondre, 38, who makes toys for a living. His wife and two daughters were swept away in the tsunami that hit Palu’s seafront after the earthquake. He found the bodies of his wife and older daughter but is still looking for his younger daughter. “I don’t want her to feel like her father never tried to find her. My soul wouldn’t rest,” he said by a mass grave atop a hill overlooking Palu’s bay as the sun set, where he had come to offer prayers. Sulawesi is one of Indonesia’s five main islands. The archipelago sees frequent earthquakes and occasional tsunami. In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Earlier on Sunday, dozens of Christians gathered outside ruined churches for services to give thanks for their survival and to mourn members of their congregation killed in the disaster. Indonesia has the world’s biggest Muslim population but there are Christian communities throughout the archipelago, including in Palu. “We are so relieved to be alive but sad because so many of our congregation died,” said Dewi Febriani, 26, after a service in a tent outside the Toraja Church in Jono Oge village, south of Palu. Jono Oge was hit hard by liquefaction with dozens of teenagers at a nearby church and Bible camp killed. Many of lie buried in the mud.

Tasnim News Agency/Handout via REUTERS BAGHDAD/ANKARA (Reuters) - More than 300 people were killed in Iran when a magnitude 7.3 earthquake jolted the country on Sunday, state media said, and rescuers were searching for dozens trapped under rubble in the mountainous area. At least six have died in Iraq as well. State television said more than 336 people were killed in Iran and at least 3,950 were injured. Local officials said the death toll would rise as search and rescue teams reached remote areas of Iran. The earthquake was felt in several western provinces of Iran, but the hardest hit province was Kermanshah, which announced three days of mourning. More than 236 of the victims were in Sarpol-e Zahab county in Kermanshah province, about 15 km (10 miles) from the Iraq border. Iranian state television said the quake had caused heavy damage in some villages where houses were made of earthen bricks. Rescuers were laboring to find survivors trapped under collapsed buildings. The quake also triggered landslides that hindered rescue efforts, officials told state television. At least 14 provinces in Iran had been affected, Iranian media reported. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his condolences on Monday, urging all government agencies to do all they could to help those affected. Dancing buildings A man walks past a damaged building following an earthquake in Darbandikhan in Sulaimaniya Governorate, Iraq, November 13, 2017. REUTERS/Ako Rasheed The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake measured magnitude 7.3. An Iraqi meteorology official put its magnitude at 6.5 with the epicenter in Penjwin in Sulaimaniyah province in the Kurdistan region, close to the main border crossing with Iran. Kurdish health officials said at least six people were killed in Iraq and at least 68 injured. Iraq's health and local officials said the worst-hit area was Darbandikham district, near the border with Iran, where at least 10 houses had collapsed and the district's only hospital was severely damaged. The quake was felt as far south as Baghdad, where many residents rushed from their houses and tall buildings when tremors shook the Iraqi capital. ""I was sitting with my kids having dinner and suddenly the building was just dancing in the air,"" said Majida Ameer, who ran out of her building in the capital's Salihiya district with her three children. ""I thought at first that it was a huge bomb. But then I heard everyone around me screaming: 'Earthquake!'"" Similar scenes unfolded in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan Region, and across other cities in northern Iraq, close to the quake's epicenter. Cold weather A wounded boy is treated following an earthquake in Sarpol-e Zahab county in Kermanshah, Iran November 13, 2017. REUTERS/Tasnim News Agency Electricity was cut off in several Iranian and Iraqi cities, and fears of aftershocks sent thousands of people in both countries out onto the streets and parks in cold weather. The Iranian seismological center registered around 118 aftershocks and said more were expected. The head of Iranian Red Crescent said more than 70,000 people were in need of emergency shelter. Hojjat Gharibian was one of hundreds of homeless Iranian survivors, who was huddled against the cold with his family in Qasr-e Shirin. ""My two children were sleeping when the house started to collapse because of the quake. I took them and ran to the street. We spent hours in the street until aid workers moved us into a school building,"" Gharibian told Reuters by telephone. Iran's police, the elite Revolutionary Guards and its affiliated Basij militia forces were dispatched to the quake-hit areas overnight, state TV reported. Iranian Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli said some roads were blocked and authorities were worried about casualties in remote villages. An Iranian oil official said pipelines and refineries in the area remained intact. Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. A magnitude 6.6 quake on Dec. 26, 2003, devastated the historic city of Bam, 1,000 km southeast of Tehran, killing about 31,000 people. Hospital severely damaged On the Iraqi side, the most extensive damage was in the town of Darbandikhan, 75 km east of the city of Sulaimaniyah in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region. More than 30 people were injured in the town, according to Kurdish Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed. ""The situation there is very critical,"" Rasheed told Reuters. The district's main hospital was severely damaged and had no power, Rasheed said, so the injured were taken to Sulaimaniyah for treatment. Homes and buildings had extensive structural damage, he said. In Halabja, local officials said a 12-year-old boy died of an electric shock from a falling electric cable. Iraq's meteorology center advised people to stay away from buildings and not to use elevators in case of aftershocks. Turkey and Israel Google Maps Residents of Turkey's southeastern city of Diyarbakir also reported feeling a strong tremor, but there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties there. Turkish Red Crescent Chairman Kerem Kinik told broadcaster NTV that Red Crescent teams in Erbil were preparing to go to the site of the earthquake and that Turkey’s national disaster management agency, AFAD, and National Medical Rescue Teams were also preparing to head into Iraq. AFAD's chairman said the organization was waiting for a reply to its offer for help. In a tweet, Kinik said the Turkish Red Crescent was gathering 3,000 tents and heaters, 10,000 beds and blankets and moving them toward the Iraqi border. ""We are coordinating with Iranian and Iraqi Red Crescent groups. We are also getting prepared to make deliveries from our northern Iraq Erbil depot,"" he said.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","A magnitude 7.0 earthquake shook Anchorage and the surrounding area on Friday morning. The shaking also triggered a wave of tsunami warnings along the Alaska coast with more likely around the Pacific. The strongest of a series of quakes struck just after 8:30 a.m. local time about 8 miles north of Anchorage. Numerous strong aftershocks continue to jolt the region, with Alaskas Earthquake Center tweeting that many more are expected. In the immediate aftermath, reports on social media indicated there are power outages, collapsed overpasses, fires, and sinkholes, though as with all disasters, its worth waiting to hear more official information. The earthquake also triggered a tsunami warning for Cook Inlet and the Southern Kenai Peninsula. For other US and Canadian Pacific coasts in North America, the level of tsunami danger is being evaluated, the U.S. Tsunami Warning System said in a bulletin. The warning has caused widespread gridlock as Alaskans fled the coast while navigating roads that have reportedly been damaged by the shaking. Alaska is no stranger to earthquakes, with its southeastern coastline sitting on the edge of the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. The state recorded the strongest earthquake in North American history in 1964. That magnitude 9.2 earthquake caused widespread damage and unleashed tsunami waves across the Pacific, including one that reached an astounding 200 feet in height as it funneled. This quake wasnt nearly as strong so any tsunami is unlikely to reach that level, but this is still a dangerous situation and should be monitored closely if you live anywhere across the Pacific.

A magnitude 3.6 quake originated near Amherstburg, Ontario, just across the Detroit River, about 15.5 miles south of Detroit, according to the United States Geological Survey, and was felt at least 40 miles away in parts of Downriver and Dearborn. After the rumbles radiated across the region, those who felt it posted reaction on social media and websites, some saying they thought it was lightning, an explosion or a crash on an interstate. “It was so weird &amp; scary!” one user wrote on Twitter. “I heard a boom noise and then 3 seconds later I felt a tremor beneath my feet.” The temblor occurred about 8 p.m., said Ian Lee, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “They’re relatively rare, but it’s not the first time there’s been an earthquake in the area,” Lee said. The last earthquake that struck Michigan — not counting the 2.0 quake that followed a meteor strike in Metro Detroit in January — was a 4.0 in Galesburg, near Kalamazoo on May 2, 2015, he said. The USGS considers 3-3.9 a minor earthquake, “felt quite noticeably by persons indoors, especially on upper floors of buildings,” according to its website. “Many people do not recognize it as an earthquake. Standing motor cars may rock slightly. Vibrations similar to the passing of a truck.” Soon after the first trembling began, comments on CSEM-EMSC, an independent scientific organization and provider of real-time earthquake warnings, flooded the site. “It was loud like thunder that kept rumbling not a lot of shaking just vibrating,” said a post from Amherstburg. “Very loud, dogs freaked. Lasted maybe 30 seconds total,” said another post. Remarks from Woodhaven said residents felt the quake in their homes. Residents from Trenton reported shaking for 30 seconds. “I’ve been in a few Earthquakes from the Michigan fault line,” another post said. “This one felt different. We could hear it coming, before we felt it, which I don’t ever remember hearing before. Wife actually commented: “What’s that noise?”... then we felt the tremor go through the house.” The relative rarity of a quake alarmed many area residents. One user likened the shaking to feeling “like someone hit the store with a truck.” Another wondered if the rumbles came from the Fermi 2 nuclear power plant in southeast Michigan. “The epicenter was a few KM from our house,” the user tweeted. “Very sharp and loud initial Bang. Followed by a minute or two of low booms and rumbles. Thought Fermi 2 blew up.” The Monroe County plant is run by DTE Energy Co. The facility was not affected by the temblor, said Je’well Pearson, a utility spokeswoman. “It’s all quiet over here.” Thursday’s heaving was the second uncommon disturbance to ripple through southeast Michigan in 2018. The meteor hit Earth around 8:10 p.m. Jan. 16, sparking a 2.0 magnitude earthquake in the Detroit area, the USGS reported. Meteorite hunters soon went on a spree to find pieces of the fireball. srahal@detroitnews.com Read or Share this story: https://detne.ws/2vw7OT6","The Detroit News Magnitude 3.6 earthquake hits near Windsor The Detroit News A magnitude 3.6 earthquake rattled parts of Ontario and Downriver in Michigan on Thursday night, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

Mark Kaufman,"A cluster of earthquakes hit Oklahoma over the past few days, unsettling thousands of the state's residents. As of 11 a.m. ET Monday the U.S. Geological Survey says that 2,274 people reported feeling a 4.3 magnitude quake Sunday night. There have been at least 16 noticeable earthquakes (above 2.5 in magnitude) observed by the Geologic Survey since Friday, April 6. While nerve-rattling, the quakes are normal for the area — at least since 2009. That's when the problematic quakes began, Jeremy Boak, Director of the Oklahoma Geological Survey, said in an interview. SEE ALSO: Hey, how about we helicopter grizzly bears into this remote National Park? ""It's not out of the ordinary,"" said Boak. ""In the frame of what’s been going on, it’s normal."" Oklahoma's dramatic rise in quakes has been stoked by oil and gas extraction activity in the region. This quake activity — associated with the ""fracking revolution"" that has also propelled historically high U.S. oil exports — comes in two forms. The first is fracking itself, an oil extraction process more formally known as ""hydraulic fracking."" Broadly, this means injecting millions of gallons of water, sand, and a small percentage of chemicals into a deeply-drilled hole. This breaks apart rocks to release oil deposits, sometimes creating earthquakes. But most Oklahoma quakes aren't caused by fracking itself, but by a secondary process called ""wastewater injection."" After water is used to fracture apart rocks thousands of feet below, it comes back up as ""wastewater,"" and is usually injected back into the ground nearby (the mixture has to go somewhere). Water is extremely heavy, so, this can put pressure on deep-lying faults. And if enough pressure is applied to these cracks in the Earth's crust, they'll rupture and move, causing sizeable quakes. While a U.S. Geologic Survey spokesperson said it's too early to officially confirm the cause of the northwestern Oklahoma earthquake burst, Boak said it's almost certainly due to wastewater injection. That's the common cause of quakes in this part of northwestern Oklahoma, and generally, has been the prevailing story for years. Earthquakes of 3.0 magnitude or higher measured in Oklahoma as of July 2017. Image: U.S. Geologic survey But, overall, earthquakes have been on the decline in Oklahoma since the especially rattling years of 2014, 2015, and 2016. The year 2015 saw nearly 900 quakes of 3.0 or higher in Oklahoma (around 2.5 or above is noticeable to most people). For perspective, before 2009, Oklahoma usually recorded one or two quakes of 3.0 magnitude or higher each year. By 2015, earthquake activity peaked for a time at around 4 and a half quakes each day, Boak previously said. But this year, Boak expects around 200 noticeable quakes to occur in Oklahoma. This recent cluster of quakes, then, is ""part of the continuing pattern which in general is declining,"" he said. There are two major reasons for the decline, said Boak. One is the falling price of oil. This means that oil and gas extraction isn't quite as lucrative as it once was a few years ago (it's a famously boom and bust industry). Accordingly, there's a bit less fracking activity. Oklahoma resident Lisa Griggs believes cracks in her home have been caused by Oklahoma's manmade earthquakes. Image: The Washington Post/Getty Images The second reason is mandatory state requirements that oil and gas companies find ways to reduce quaking. The rattled citizens of Oklahoma made quite clear to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which regulates the gas industry, that the quakes must stop — or at least be limited. ""We needed to shut this down and it actually appears to have worked,"" said Boak. Oil and gas companies accomplish this reduction in a variety of ways, which includes stopping wastewater injections when seismic activity begins. As for Boak, he has still yet to feel one of Oklahoma's big quakes — even though he studies them. He's too far south of most the activity, in the quieter confines of Norman, Oklahoma. ""I’ve never had the privilege of feeling one of the Oklahoma earthquakes,"" he said.","A cluster of earthquakes hit Oklahoma over the past few days, unsettling thousands of the state's residents.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"LENDE TOVEA, Indonesia (Reuters) - The lives of many villagers living at the epicentre of a devastating earthquake that struck Indonesia’s Sulawesi island and killed more than 1,600 people were spared because they had been terrified by a smaller one that hit three hours earlier. A coastal strip dotted with villages north of the devastated city of Palu was cut off for nearly a week by landslides blocking its single road link after the major 7.5 magnitude quake struck late in the afternoon on Sept. 28. But the way is now open and aid is starting to trickle in to the area that rescue workers feared had been obliterated. While destruction is extensive, with many houses destroyed, villagers said on Saturday countless lives were saved by a 6.1 magnitude quake that struck about 20 km (12 miles) to the south about three hours earlier. “Luckily most people were already outside,” said Rahman Lakuaci, chief of Lende Tovea village in Sirenja district. “Everyone ran outside when the first quake happened and few people were brave enough to go back in.” Authorities have yet to conduct a tally of casualties in Sirenja and the other districts near the epicentre north of Palu, but Lakuaci estimated dozens of people had been killed in the area. The city of Palu, on the other hand, 78 km (48 miles) away, suffered heavy casualties, with hotels, shopping malls and countless houses destroyed in the quake and by a tsunami that scoured the city’s oceanfront shortly after. Soil liquefaction, a phenomenon that turns the ground into a roiling quagmire, also killed many hundreds of people in and around Palu. But that did not happen near the epicentre of the quake and, even though many villagers ran up into the hills rising to the east of the coastline, tsunami waves did not crash into the small fishing communities and pretty beaches. The quake brought down power lines and communications networks and more than half the houses in Sirenja district were destroyed. Those left standing were so battered they were “not fit for use”, Lakuaci said. Most would have to torn down and rebuilt, he said. People have survived the past week by searching for food in fields and orchards and scavenging in the forested hills. Thousands of people are living in tents and crude shelters and some supplies have been flow in by helicopter. “What we need most now are tents and medicine,” Lakuaci said. Children and the elderly were starting to get sick and fuel was also in very short supply, he said. The area saw no looting after the quake, unlike in Palu, largely because there are no big warehouses and village leaders mobilised their volunteers to maintain order, villagers said.

Time,"One week after Papua New Guinea was rattled by a powerful earthquake, aftershocks have reportedly caused the death toll to rise to at least 67, while landslides have made the worst-hit highlands nearly unreachable. Dozens of aftershocks have added to the devastation inflicted by the initial 7.5-magnitude quake last Monday. Three particularly strong aftershocks bigger than magnitude 5 hit the Southern Highlands early Monday morning, the Guardian reports. All four regions struck by the quake remain under a state of emergency. Aid workers told the Guardian that the extent of the damage is still unknown due to the remoteness of the villages bearing the brunt of the quake. Thousands are thought to be trapped in isolated areas after landslides blocked roads to the worst-affected communities, making it all but impossible to deliver urgently needed supplies including food, water and healthcare. “Many places that have been struck are still inaccessible, except by walking in, so there is a huge supply issue in delivering aid,” Udaya Regmi, the country head of the Red Cross, told the Guardian. Regmi estimated that at least 500 people are injured and 127,000 are in need of immediate assistance. While earthquakes are a common occurrence in Papua New Guinea, which is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire where most of the world’s earthquake activity occurs, the latest tremors have been particularly catastrophic. Local residents near the epicenter of the quake in Hela Province told Radio New Zealand that relief organizations have not yet reached them. One resident described immense devastation and said he was living on top of the rubble of his home with dwindling food supplies and contaminated water to drink. In a statement, Darian Clark, the humanitarian duty officer at the Australian high commission in Papua New Guinea, said it “was the biggest earthquake in a hundred years and it spread 150 kilometers across the fault line.”",Landslides have blocked aid delivery to some of the hardest-hit areas,2018-03-05T03:48:33Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Death Toll Climbs as Aftershocks Rattle Earthquake-Hit Papua New Guinea,http://time.com/5185057/papua-new-guinea-earthquake-aftermath/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-925161800.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,quake,1
,"At a Glance A 7.5 magnitude earthquake occurred Friday evening local time on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The quake triggered a tsunami, according to Indonesia's geophysics agency. A 6.1 magnitude foreshock struck earlier in the day, killing at least one person. A powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi Friday evening just hours after a powerful, deadly foreshock, apparently triggered a tsunami that hit the coast minutes later. The main tremor struck at 6:02 p.m. local time Friday evening (6:02 a.m. EDT) about 35 miles northeast of Donggala, Indonesia a town of about 300,000 according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Shortly after, a tsunami warning was issued by Indonesia's geophysics agency, then lifted. It's believed the tsunami, confirmed by local agencies to be up to 10 feet tall, struck Donggala and Palu, a coastal town of about 330,000 after the alert was cancelled. Hary Tirto Djatmiko, a spokesman for the agency, confirmed to the Associated Press that a tsunami occurred and more information would be released once it was gathered. ""Based on historical data and tsunami modelling, this earthquake is not capable of generating a tsunami affecting the Indian Ocean region,"" said the Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysical Agency of Indonesia. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency, told a local TV station that houses were carried away by the tsunami and families were missing, but darkness hindered the search Friday night. ""The situation is chaotic, people are running on the streets and buildings collapsed. There is a ship washed ashore,"" Dwikorita Karnawati, head of Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency, told BBC.com. There were at least 10 foreshocks and aftershocks recorded at magnitude 5 or stronger on Friday. The main quake was relatively shallow in preliminary observations just 6.2 miles deep, according to the USGS. Earlier Friday, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake killed one person, injured several others and damaged dozens of homes, according to the AP. ""It happened while we still have difficulties in collecting data from nine villages affected by the first quake,"" an official with Akris, the local disaster agency, told the AP. ""People ran out in panic."" The tremors came a month after a large earthquake killed as many as 500 on the island of Lombok, southwest of Sulawesi.

James M. Patterson,"NASA’s InSight lander has deployed its first instrument onto the surface of Mars, completing a major mission milestone. New images from the lander show the seismometer on the ground, its copper-colored covering faintly illuminated in the Martian dusk. It looks as if all is calm and all is bright for InSight, heading into the end of the year.“InSight’s timetable of activities on Mars has gone better than we hoped,” said InSight Project Manager Tom Hoffman, who is based at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “Getting the seismometer safely on the ground is an awesome Christmas present.”
The InSight team has been working carefully toward deploying its two dedicated science instruments onto Martian soil since landing on Mars on Nov. 26. Meanwhile, the Rotation and Interior Structure Experiment (RISE), which does not have its own separate instrument, has already begun using InSight’s radio connection with Earth to collect preliminary data on the planet’s core. Not enough time has elapsed for scientists to deduce what they want to know — scientists estimate they might have some results starting in about a year.
To deploy the seismometer (also known as the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure, or SEIS) and the heat probe (also known as the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Probe, or HP3), engineers first had to verify the robotic arm that picks up and places InSight’s instruments onto the Martian surface was working properly. Engineers tested the commands for the lander, making sure a model in the test bed at JPL deployed the instruments exactly as intended. Scientists also had to analyze images of the Martian terrain around the lander to figure out the best places to deploy the instruments.
On Tuesday, Dec. 18, InSight engineers sent up the commands to the spacecraft. On Wednesday, Dec. 19, the seismometer was gently placed onto the ground directly in front of the lander, about as far away as the arm can reach — 5.367 feet, or 1.636 meters, away).
“Seismometer deployment is as important as landing InSight on Mars,” said InSight Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt, also based at JPL. “The seismometer is the highest-priority instrument on InSight: We need it in order to complete about three-quarters of our science objectives.”
The seismometer allows scientists to peer into the Martian interior by studying ground motion — also known as marsquakes. Each marsquake acts as a kind of flashbulb that illuminates the structure of the planet’s interior. By analyzing how seismic waves pass through the layers of the planet, scientists can deduce the depth and composition of these layers.
“Having the seismometer on the ground is like holding a phone up to your ear,” said Philippe Lognonné, principal investigator of SEIS from Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP) and Paris Diderot University. “We’re thrilled that we’re now in the best position to listen to all the seismic waves from below Mars’ surface and from its deep interior.”
In the coming days, the InSight team will work on leveling the seismometer, which is sitting on ground that is tilted 2 to 3 degrees. The first seismometer science data should begin to flow back to Earth after the seismometer is in the right position.
But engineers and scientists at JPL, the French national space agency Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES) and other institutions affiliated with the SEIS team will need several additional weeks to make sure the returned data are as clear as possible. For one thing, they will check and possibly adjust the seismometer’s long, wire-lined tether to minimize noise that could travel along it to the seismometer. Then, in early January, engineers expect to command the robotic arm to place the Wind and Thermal Shield over the seismometer to stabilize the environment around the sensors.
Assuming that there are no unexpected issues, the InSight team plans to deploy the heat probe onto the Martian surface by late January. HP3 will be on the east side of the lander’s work space, roughly the same distance away from the lander as the seismometer.
For now, though, the team is focusing on getting those first bits of seismic data (however noisy) back from the Martian surface.
“We look forward to popping some Champagne when we start to get data from InSight’s seismometer on the ground,” Banerdt added. “I have a bottle ready for the occasion.”

Associated Press,"(JAKARTA) — A shallow earthquake in central Indonesia has killed three people and damaged more than 300 homes. Indonesia’s Meteorology and Geophysics Agency said the magnitude-4.4 quake that occurred Wednesday at a depth of 4 kilometers (2.4 miles) was centered about 52 kilometers (32 miles) north of Kebumen, a densely populated district of Central Java province. Central Java’s Disaster Management Agency head Sarwo Pramana said Thursday the quake which was felt in many parts of the province killed two elderly people and a 13-year-old boy who were crushed by collapsing buildings. He said 21 people were hospitalized with injuries and more than 2,100 people have been evacuated to temporary shelters.

Kota was only 13 when he was swept away in a tidal wave. After his body was discovered, Tanno thought the spirit of her son might wonder what happened in the newest issues of Jump. First, Tanno put some copies in his casket. Then, she put some out on the Buddhist altar in their house dedicated to her son. Each week, she now buys the latest issue and has back ordered missing ones. Tanno has since rebuilt her house, which was destroyed in the quake. She built a room for Kota, which is filled with his mementoes as well as shelves and shelves of Weekly Jump. One Piece is still in serialization.

Associated Press and Kelly McLaughlin,"A magnitude 6.6 earthquake has hit northern Japan near the major city of Sapporo, the US Geological Survey reports. The agency said the earthquake struck the northern island of Hokkaido at about 3 a.m. local time on Thursday and had a depth of 33.4 kilometers (21 miles). While no tsunami warning has been issued, police told Accuweather that people may have been buried alive when homes collapsed. Police said at least five houses collapsed in the earthquake, and there are also reports of collapsed roads and power outages. National broadcaster NHK reported that an 82-year-old man was found without vital signs. The quake's epicenter is about 27.3 kilometers (17 miles) east of the city of Tomakomai, which has a population of about 175,000, and 64.8 kilometers (40.3 miles) southeast of Sapporo, which is a major metropolitan area of 1.9 million people. An aftershock measuring magnitude 5.3 hit the region just minutes after the first quake. The Kyodo news service reports that in Tokyo, the central government set up a liaison unit at the crisis management center of the prime minister's office to gather information on the temblor. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga says Prime Minister Shinzo Abe instructed officials to ascertain the extent of damage and extend a helping hand to those affected. The news service reports that the quake triggered a blackout across a wide area in Hokkaido. It also affected telephone service and television broadcasting in Sapporo.","A magnitude 6.6 earthquake struck the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido at about 3 a.m. local time on Thursday.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The 7.5-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit the eastern Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday is confirmed to have killed hundreds of people, the New York Times reported on Saturday, with at least 405 confirmed deaths in the city of Palu and the toll likely to rise much higher as search-and-rescue teams continue to arrive. Hundreds more are injured. The Times reported that the disaster leveled large swathes of the city in addition to nearby coastal communities, with thousands of structures destroyed. The precise number of dead may be difficult to determine, the paper added, as there were workers and security personnel present as preparations were underway for a beachside festival with dances and other performances, as well a high likelihood the tsunami pulled many people back into the ocean: The twin disasters a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, and the swirling wall of water it unleashed killed at least 405 people in Palu and destroyed thousands of buildings there, including a shopping mall, a hotel, seaside restaurants and several mosques. We have found corpses from the earthquake as well as bodies swept up by the tsunami, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, said in a television interview. Indonesian officials were preparing for a sharp rise in the death toll because search-and-rescue teams had yet to reach populous coastal settlements near Palu. Vice President Jusuf Kalla of Indonesia told a local news website that thousands may have died, with an unknown number washed out to sea. Kalla added that when the infamous Indian Ocean tsunami struck Aceh in northern Sumatra in 2004, a death toll initially indicated at 40 people eventually rose to over over 130,000 (estimates suggest at least 230,000 people died as a result of the disaster in total across 14 countries). Palu, a city of 300,000, may have also been particularly hard struck because emergency alert systems that could have warned of the tsunami were rendered useless by collapsing cell towers during the earthquake, the Times wrote. Indonesias meteorological and physics agency also lifted its own tsunami advisory little more than half an hour after the earthquake struck, though it has not yet been determined whether the waves were already hitting the coast by the time it chose to do so. The Washington Post reported that the nations emergency officials are investigating why many members of the public did not seem to have been properly alerted about the risk of the wave: Indonesian officials also may face another reckoning over why the tsunami alerts were pulled even as a disaster was roaring ashore, raising questions about the level of monitoring and post-quake analysis in a nation along some of the worlds most active fault lines. People were still going about their activities on the beach and did not immediately run, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesias National Disaster Management Agency, who said that hundreds were gathered in Palu for a beach party. The number of deaths, he said, will continue to rise as the search continues. The emergency response is being hindered by damaged or destroyed roads, ports, and communications lines, the Post added, as well as the number of personnel still deployed to the island of Lombok following another devastating 6.9-magnitude earthquake that killed over 450 in August. A 21-year-old air traffic controller at a regional airport, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, stayed at his post as other personnel evacuated, ensuring the takeoff of Batik Air Flight 6231. According to the Post, the plane had hundreds on board; the air traffic controller jumped from the tower to his death as its roof collapsed, while the pilot (identified by the Times as Ricosetta Mafella) posted a short video of the oncoming wave to Instagram. Thank God there is a voice (Holy Spirit i believe) telling me to depart early, he wrote. Im rushing the boarding process. Late by 30 second i would not have flown. Though Indonesia is in the Ring of Firea roughly 25,000-mile chain of volcanoes and other tectonic hot spots that stretches across the Pacific Ocean and plays host to 90 percent of the worlds earthquakes National Geographic reported that the tsunami was unexpected at this quake. It was recorded as the result of a strike-slip fault, during which tectonic plates grind against each other horizontally rather than vertically. Vertical displacement is more likely to cause a tsunami than horizontal movement of a fault. According to National Geographic, University of Oxford geophysicist Baptiste Gombert said that the regions geology is incredibly complex but initial signs are that landslides either above or below the water line played a role. Its also possible the waves were amplified by the shape of the bay as the tsunami forced water into the restricted space. Indonesias central statistics agency estimates that around 2.4 million people could be impacted by the disaster, according to the Times.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Hungry survivors of an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia said on Wednesday they were scavenging for food in farms as President Joko Widodo made a second visit to the area to ramp up aid efforts five days after disaster struck. The official death toll from the 7.5 magnitude quake that hit the west coast of Sulawesi island last Friday rose to 1,407, many killed by tsunami waves it triggered. (GRAPHIC: Catastrophe in Sulawesi - tmsnrt.rs/2OqQlUo ) But officials fear the toll could soar, as most of the confirmed dead have come from Palu, a small city 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta, and losses in remote areas remain unknown, as communications are down, and bridges and roads have been destroyed or blocked by landslides. National disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said most of the aid effort had been concentrated in Palu, where electricity supply has yet to be restored. But rescue workers have begun to reach more remote areas in a disaster zone that encompasses 1.4 million people. Johnny Lim, a restaurant owner reached by telephone in Donggala town, said he was surviving on coconuts. “It’s a zombie town. Everything’s destroyed. Nothing’s left,” Lim said over a crackling line. “We’re on our last legs. There’s no food, no water.” In another part of Donggala district, which has a population of 300,000 people, Ahmad Derajat, said survivors were scavenging for food in fields and orchards. “What we’re relying on right now is food from farms and sharing whatever we find like sweet potatoes or bananas,” said Derajat whose house was swept away by the tsunami leaving a jumble of furniture, collapsed tin roofs and wooden beams. “Why aren’t they dropping aid by helicopter?” he asked. Aid worker Lian Gogali described a perilous situation in Donggala, which includes a string of cut-off, small towns along a coast road north of Palu close to the quake’s epicenter. “Everyone is desperate for food and water. There’s no food, water, or gasoline. The government is missing,” Gogali said, adding that her aid group had only been able to send in a trickle of rations by motorbike. Underlining a growing sense of urgency, President Widodo made his second visit to the disaster zone, putting on an orange hard hat to talk to rescue workers at a collapsed hotel in Palu. “What I’ve observed after returning now is heavy equipment has arrived, logistics have started to arrive although it’s not at maximum yet, fuel has partly arrived,” Widodo told reporters. ‘PRESIDENT NOT HEARING’ Widodo, who will seek re-election next year, called on Tuesday for reinforcements in the search for victims, saying everyone had to be found. He repeated that on Wednesday, after inspecting what he called an “evacuation” effort at the Hotel Roa Roa, where he said some 30 people lay buried in the ruins. Yahdi Basma, a leader from a village south of Palu hoping to get his family on a cargo plane out, said Widodo had no idea of the extent of the suffering. “The president is not hearing about the remote areas, only about the tsunami and about Palu,” he said. “There are hundreds of people still buried under the mud in my village... There is no aid whatsoever which is why we’re leaving.” At least seven cargo planes arrived at Palu airport earlier on Wednesday carrying tonnes of aid, some bedecked in the red and white national colors and stamped with the presidential office seal declaring: “Assistance from the President of Republic of Indonesia”. The quake brought down hotels, shopping malls and thousands of houses in Palu, while tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) scoured its beachfront shortly afterwards. About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood were swallowed up by ground liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid, and hundreds of people are believed to have perished, the disaster agency said. Indonesian Red Cross disaster responders said the village of Petobo, just south of Palu, which was home to almost 500 people, had been “wiped off the map”. “They are finding devastation and tragedy everywhere,” Iris van Deinse, of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said in a statement. Nearby, rescue workers, some using an excavator, were searching for 52 children missing since liquefaction destroyed their bible study camp. Bodies of 35 of the children have been found. Aircraft, tents, water treatment facilities and generators were the main needs for survivors including more than 70,000 displaced people, according to the national disaster mitigation agency spokesman. Sitting on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to quakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Adding to Sulawesi’s woes, the Soputan volcano in the north of the island, 600 km (375 miles) northeast of Palu, erupted on Wednesday but there were no reports of casualties or damage.

Laignee Barron,"Rescuers are scrambling to reach hundreds of trekkers stranded on a mountain in Indonesia after a massive earthquake triggered landslides. Early Sunday morning, a 6.4-magnitude quake rocked Lombok Island in Indonesia’s southeast, killing at least 14 people and injuring another 160. Not far from the epicenter, Mount Rinjani was hit with slides that blocked off escape routes, the BBC reports. Rescuers evacuated more than 800 tourists from the mountain, according to the Associated Press. Helicopters have been dispatched to search for another 266 who remain trapped. A Malaysian climber who was on a hiking trip to Lombok is reportedly among those killed. The tremor rattled the popular tourist destination just before 7 am local time, damaging thousands of homes. While the epicenter was located in Mataram, in northern Lombok, the quake was felt further afield, including 25 miles west in Bali. Dozens of aftershocks rippled through the area leading to falling debris and toppled concrete, which the country’s disaster agency said caused most of the fatalities. Indonesia’s meteorology and geophysics agency said it recorded over 130 aftershocks. “The tremors were strong – I noticed waves in the hotel pool,” BBC Marathi journalist Vinayak Gaikwad said from Gili Trawangan Island, about 4 miles away from the epicenter. “Thirty minutes later there was the first strong aftershock. The locals were worried because many of their structures are made from wood and bamboo,” he added. The quake triggered blackouts in at least two districts. Located in the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire,” a chain of volcanoes and fault lines, Indonesia is particularly prone to seismic activity. In 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake near Sumatra prompted a tsunami and led to more than 230,000 deaths.",Rescuers are searching for more than 200 people believed to be stranded on a mountain,2018-07-30T05:50:13Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}","Hundreds Trapped, 14 Dead After a Massive Earthquake Struck an Indonesian Tourist Island",http://time.com/5352421/lombok-earthquake-hikers-trapped/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/rtx6d77y.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,quake,1
Andi Jatmiko and Stephen Wright / AP,"(SENGGIGI, Indonesia) — Thousands left homeless by a powerful quake that ruptured roads and flattened buildings on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok sheltered Monday night in makeshift tents as authorities said rescuers hadn’t yet reached all devastated areas and expect the toll of 98 dead to climb. It was the second deadly quake in a week to hit Lombok, a less-developed island compared with its more famous neighbor Bali, where the strong tremors caused panic and damaged buildings. A July 29 quake killed 16 people and damaged hundreds of houses on Lombok, some of which collapsed in Sunday evening’s quake, measured at magnitude 7.0 by Indonesian authorities and 6.9 by the U.S. Geological Survey. Damage was “massive” in mountainous northern Lombok, where the quake was centered, said National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. In several districts, more than half the homes were destroyed or severely damaged. A large mosque collapsed on worshippers in northern Lombok’s Lading-Lading village, and rescuers used a backhoe to search the debris. The number of victims was unknown. Some areas still hadn’t been reached 24 hours after the quake because of collapsed bridges, blocked and ruptured roads and the loss of power and communications. Nugroho said the death toll had risen to 98 and warned it will continue to increase. All but two of were killed on Lombok; the others died on Bali. More than 230 people were seriously injured. Thousands of homes and buildings were damaged and those displaced camped wherever they could — in sports fields and on roadsides, cobbling together ramshackle shelters and building campfires for warmth. Sahril, who uses one name, said he escaped his collapsing house in North Lombok with his immediate family, but his older brother is buried in his flattened home in the village of Cubek. “He was serving customers when the earthquake happened. The customers managed to escape, but he himself didn’t,” Sahril said. “His two-story house collapsed and buried him. He had no chance to scream (for) help.” The quake struck at a shallow depth of 10.5 km (6 mi). Shallow quakes tend to cause more damage than deeper ones. “We were sitting there having dinner at about 7 o’clock last night, we just felt a really big sort of shaking and the lights went off and everyone just ran,” Australian tourist Kim Liebelt said as he waited with other travelers for a flight out at Lombok’s international airport. “And then the roof started falling down on us, rocks and rubble and then just everyone running to get away,” he said. Videos showed screaming people running in panic from a shopping mall and a neighborhood in Bali where parked vehicles swayed. On Lombok, soldiers and other rescuers carried the injured on stretchers and carpets. Many were treated outdoors because hospitals were damaged. “People panicked and scattered on the streets, and buildings and houses that had been damaged by the previous earthquake had become more damaged and collapsed,” Nugroho said. The quake triggered a tsunami warning, and frightened people rushed from their homes to higher ground, particularly in North Lombok and Mataram, the capital of West Nusa Tenggara province. The warning was lifted after only small waves were recorded. “When it happened, we stood with residents in the middle of the street and watched houses collapse around us,” said Yustrianda Sirio, supervisor of a group of university students from Java doing a community service program in East Lombok. “Many of us screamed hysterically.” He said the group already had been staying in tents after the July 29 quake, but now officials told them to return to Java. “We really want to stay here to help the villagers,” he said. On Gili Trawangan, one of three popular vacation islands near Lombok, thousands of tourists and residents spent Sunday night on a hill because of tsunami fears, said British visitor Saffron Amis. “There was a lot of screaming and crying, particularly from the locals,” said Amis, from Brighton. “We spoke to a lot of them and they were panicking about their family in Lombok. It was just a lot of panic because no one knew what was happening.” By Monday morning, with electricity off and hotels and hostels damaged, thousands were desperate to leave. Hundreds packed a sliver of brilliant white sand beach on the 16 sq km (6 sq mi) Trawangan island, shouting at rescue personnel trying to ensure an orderly evacuation, according to video and photos from the local water police. Nugroho said authorities deployed ships to evacuate people from the three islands. About 2,700 had left, but several thousand more tourists and hotel employees are waiting to leave, he said. Like Bali, Lombok is known for pristine beaches and mountains. Hotels and other buildings in both locations are not allowed to exceed the height of coconut trees. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because of its location on the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. In December 2004, a massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries. Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, in Lombok for a regional security meeting, said he and his delegation were dining in their hotel’s 12th-floor restaurant when the quake struck, plunging the building into darkness and throwing people to the floor. “Mate, we were knocked certainly to the floor.

But people out in the villages or elsewhere haven’t been so lucky, unfortunately.” The Bali and Lombok airports have stayed open. Model Chrissy Teigen, who was in Bali with singer-husband John Legend and their two children, live-tweeted the shaking. “Bali. Trembling. So long,” Teigen tweeted to her 10.6 million followers. Hours later, she asked news organizations not to write more stories about her lively stream-of-consciousness tweets, suggesting media focus instead on those who need help.","Damage was ""massive"" in mountainous northern Lombok, rescuers said",2018-08-07T02:04:41Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Thousands Homeless After Two Deadly Earthquakes Struck an Indonesian Island,http://time.com/5359465/indonesia-lombok-earthquake-homeless/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/ap18218376460498.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,quake,1
Kanupriya Kapoor,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Relatives of hundreds of people missing after an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reacted with anger, sadness and resignation on Sunday to a decision by the state disaster agency to end searches for bodies later this week. The 7.5 magnitude quake on Sept. 28 brought down shopping malls, hotels and other buildings in the city of Palu, while tsunami waves smashed into its beachfront. But perhaps more deadly was soil liquefaction which obliterated several Palu neighborhoods. No one knows how many people are missing but it is at least in the hundreds, rescuers say. The official death toll has risen to 1,763 but bodies are still being recovered, at least 34 in one place alone on Saturday and more on Sunday. “Many of us are angry that we haven’t found our families and friends and they want to give up?” said Hajah Ikaya, 60, who says she lost her sister, brother-in-law and niece in the Balaroa neighborhood in the south of the city. They are all missing. Balaroa was one of areas particularly hard hit by liquefaction, which turns the ground into a roiling quagmire, destroying houses and dragging people under the mud and debris. The disaster agency said earlier liquefaction destroyed 1,700 houses in one neighborhood alone with hundreds of people buried in the mud. “We’re Muslim. We need a proper burial, in the Islamic way,” said Ikaya. “We don’t want this.” Disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a briefing in Jakarta some limited searching might continue but large-scale searches with many personnel and heavy equipment would cease on Oct. 11. Debris would be cleared and areas hit by liquefaction would be turned into parks and sports venues. Surveys would be carried out and people living in vulnerable places would be moved. “We don’t want the community to be relocated to such dangerous places,” Nugroho said. Most of the dead from the quake and tsunami were in Palu, the region’s main urban center. Figures for more remote areas are trickling in but they seem to have suffered fewer deaths than the city. Dede Diman, 25, a resident of Petobo, another neighborhood in Palu that was laid waste by liquefaction, said rescuers hadn’t even started searching where his sister was lost. “We’re already angry,” said Diman, who is living in a shelter with his brother and another sister. Their mother was killed and her body found. “We don’t agree with giving up. Even if they give up, we won’t. We want to find our sister.” Graphic: Catastrophe in Sulawesi - tmsnrt.rs/2OqQlUo PRAYERS Mohammad Irfan, 25, got home to Palu on Sunday, as air services picked up, from his job on Bali island, to help search for his missing grandfather. “I’d feel very sad if the search mission ends because there are so many still missing and buried,” he said. A grieving father was resigned to the search ending without his two-year-old daughter being found. “What’s the point anyway? At this stage, they’re not even recognizable,” said Ondre, 38, who makes toys for a living. His wife and two daughters were swept away in the tsunami that hit Palu’s seafront after the earthquake. He found the bodies of his wife and older daughter but is still looking for his younger daughter. “I don’t want her to feel like her father never tried to find her. My soul wouldn’t rest,” he said by a mass grave atop a hill overlooking Palu’s bay as the sun set, where he had come to offer prayers. Sulawesi is one of Indonesia’s five main islands. The archipelago sees frequent earthquakes and occasional tsunami. In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Earlier on Sunday, dozens of Christians gathered outside ruined churches for services to give thanks for their survival and to mourn members of their congregation killed in the disaster. Indonesia has the world’s biggest Muslim population but there are Christian communities throughout the archipelago, including in Palu. “We are so relieved to be alive but sad because so many of our congregation died,” said Dewi Febriani, 26, after a service in a tent outside the Toraja Church in Jono Oge village, south of Palu. Jono Oge was hit hard by liquefaction with dozens of teenagers at a nearby church and Bible camp killed. Many of lie buried in the mud.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo made a second visit to earthquake-devastated Sulawesi island on Wednesday, saying efforts to help survivors were gearing up and he was keen to see economic activity resume. Five days after disaster struck, time is running out for anyone trapped under collapsed buildings, while aid workers warned of increasing desperation in hard-hit outlying areas that have yet to get any help at all. The official death toll from the 7.5 magnitude quake that struck the west coast of Sulawesi last Friday stood at 1,234, many killed by tsunami waves triggered by the quake. But officials fear the toll could soar, as most of the confirmed dead have come from Palu, a small city 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta, and losses in remote areas largely cut off since Friday have yet to be determined. Underlining a growing sense of urgency, Widodo made his second visit to the disaster zone, putting on an orange hard hat to talk to rescue workers at a collapsed Palu hotel. “What I’ve observed after returning now is heavy equipment has arrived, logistics have started to arrive although it’s not at maximum yet, fuel has partly arrived,” Widodo told reporters. Asked about efforts to restore electricity, he said: “This is all a process. Most importantly, I’ve asked the governor to reopen economic centers so people start to return to daily activities, while the evacuation process continues, and later rehabilitation and reconstruction.” Widodo, who will seek re-election next year, called on Tuesday for reinforcements in the search for victims, saying everyone had to be found. He repeated that on Wednesday, after inspecting what he called an “evacuation” effort at the Hotel Roa Roa, where he said some 30 people lay buried in the ruins. “We’ll continue this process so all the victims can be retrieved,” he said. At least seven cargo planes arrived at Palu airport earlier on Wednesday carrying tonnes of aid, some bedecked in the red and white national colors and stamped with the presidential office seal declaring: “Assistance from the President of Republic of Indonesia”. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said late on Tuesday rescuers had reached all four of the badly affected districts, which together have a population of 1.4 million, but he declined to give an estimate of casualties. “We hope the death toll does not rise,” he said. “We’re continuing rescue operations but right now the team is racing against time.” ‘GOVERNMENT MISSING’ The quake brought down hotels, shopping malls and thousands of houses in Palu, while tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) scoured its beachfront shortly afterwards. About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood alone were swallowed up by ground liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid, and hundreds of people are believed to have perished, the disaster agency said. Adding to Sulawesi’s woes, the Soputan volcano in the north of the island, about 600 km (375 miles) northeast of Palu, erupted early on Wednesday but there were no reports of any casualties or damage. Ash was not expected to disrupt flights. But concern is growing about conditions in remote areas, many of which have been cut off by destroyed road, landslides and downed bridges. Aid worker Lian Gogali said the situation in badly hit Donggala district was very difficult. “Everyone is desperate for food and water. There’s no food, water, or gasoline. The government is missing,” she said. She said her aid group had been sending in a trickle of rations into the district of some 300,000 people by motorbike. The national disaster agency has said tents, food, water and sanitation facilities for more than 60,000 displaced people are in short supply. Police have done little to stop outbreaks of looting. The government has played down the problem, saying victims could take essentials and shops would be compensated. The government has said it would accept offers of international aid, after shunning outside help this year when two major earthquakes struck Lombok island, south of Sulawesi. U.S. President Donald Trump extended condolences in a phone call with Widodo, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters in Washington. The United States has provided initial funding, deployed government disaster experts and was working to determine what other help can be given, she said. Sitting on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to quakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

Fathin Ungku,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo ordered more rescuers to hunt for victims of a devastating earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi, saying on Tuesday everyone had to be found, as the scale of destruction became clearer. Some remote areas have been out of contact for more than three days and officials fear the confirmed death toll of 844 could soar into the thousands when losses in those areas are revealed. “The are some main priorities that we must tackle and the first is to evacuate, find and save victims who’ve not yet been found,” Widodo told a government meeting to coordinate disaster recovery efforts. He said he had ordered the national search and rescue agency to send more police and soldiers into the affected districts, some cut off since Friday’s 7.5 magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami waves destroyed roads, triggered landslides and downed bridges. The Red Cross said the situation was “nightmarish” and reports from its workers venturing into one cut-off area, Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter, indicated it had been hit “extremely hard”. Four badly hit districts have a combined population of about 1.4 million. Most of the confirmed dead have been in the small city of Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. The quake triggered tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) that smashed into the city’s beachfront, while hotels and shopping malls collapsed in ruins and some neighborhoods were swallowed up by ground liquefaction. Among those killed in the area were 34 children at a Christian bible study camp, a Red Cross official said. More than 50 of the dead were taken to a mass grave on the outskirts of Palu on Tuesday, while rescuers held out hope they could still save lives. “We suspect there are still some survivors trapped inside,” the head of one rescue team, Agus Haryono, told Reuters at the collapsed seven-storey Hotel Roa Roa. About 50 people were believed to have been caught inside the hotel when it was brought down. About 12 people have been recovered from the ruins, with one more body on Tuesday. Three of the victims were recovered alive. Haryono pored over the hotel’s blueprints and building plans, searching for possible pockets and a way through to them. A faint smell of decomposition hung in the air. “We have to be very careful so we don’t risk hurting any survivors when we move the debris,” he said. Power has yet to be restored in the area and access by land to outlying villages has been disrupted by broken roads, landslides and downed bridges. Nearly 60,000 people have been displaced and are in need of emergency help, while thousands have been streaming out of stricken areas. ‘BURIED FAST’ Indonesia has said it would accept offers of international aid, having shunned outside help earlier this year when an earthquake struck the island of Lombok. Aftershocks have rattled jangled nerves. A particular horror in several areas in and around Palu was liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid. About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood were swallowed up, with hundreds of people believed buried, the national disaster agency said. Before-and-after satellite pictures show a largely built-up neighborhood just south of Palu’s airport seemingly wiped clean of all signs of life by liquefaction. Elsewhere on the outskirts of Palu, trucks brought 54 bodies to a mass grave dug in sandy soil. Most of the bodies had not been claimed, a policeman said, but some relatives turned up to pay respects to loved ones at the 50 meter (165 feet) trench, where the smell of decomposition was overpowering. “It’s OK if he’s buried in the mass grave, it’s better to have him buried fast,” said Rosmawati Binti Yahya, 52, whose husband was among those placed in the grave, before heading off to look for her missing daughter. Commercial airlines have struggled to restore operations at Palu’s quake-damaged airport but military aircraft took some survivors out on Monday, while about 3,000 people thronged the airport hoping for any flight out. A navy vessel capable of taking 1,000 people at a time was due to be deployed to help with the evacuation. The power company was working to restore electricity while the state oil firm had sent in fuel, officials said. Teams of police were out on the streets on Tuesday, clearing debris and providing some reassurance to traumatized residents worried about looting.

Kanupriya Kapoor,"PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia is in a race against time to save victims of a devastating earthquake and tsunami on Sulawesi island, the government said on Tuesday, as the official death toll rose to more than 1,200 and looting fueled fears of lawlessness. Four days after the double disaster struck, officials feared the toll could soar, as most of the confirmed dead had come from Palu, a small city 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta. Some remote areas have been largely cut off after Friday’s 7.5 magnitude quake triggered tsunami waves, destroying roads and bridges, and their losses have yet to be determined. “The team is racing against time because it’s already D+four,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of National Disaster Mitigation Agency, told a briefing in Jakarta, referring to four days since the quake. He said rescuers had reached all four of the badly affected districts, which together have a population of 1.4 million, but he declined to give an estimate of casualties. He gave few details of the conditions rescuers had found, saying they were similar to those in Palu. Earlier, President Joko Widodo called for reinforcements in the search for survivors saying everyone had to be found. The official death toll surged to 1,234 with 800 people seriously injured. There has been particular concern about Donggala, a district of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter of the quake, which only a few aid workers have managed to reach. Nugroho said it had been “devastated” by the tsunami. A video from the district, broadcast by the Antara state news agency, showed widespread destruction, including flattened buildings and a ship hurled into port buildings by the tsunami. “What we need is food, water, medicine, but to up now we’ve got nothing,” said an unidentified man standing in ruins. In Palu, tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) smashed into the beachfront, while hotels and shopping malls collapsed in ruins. About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood were swallowed up by ground liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid, and hundreds of people are believed to have perished, the disaster agency said. Before-and-after satellite pictures showed a largely built-up neighborhood just south of Palu’s airport seemingly wiped clean of all signs of life by liquefaction. Nugroho said Sigi district was “flattened” by liquefaction. Among the dead were 34 children killed at a Christian bible study camp. LEAVING AND LOOTING More than 65,000 homes were damaged and more than 60,000 people have been displaced and are in need of emergency help. Thousands of people have been streaming out of stricken areas. Commercial airlines have struggled to restore operations at Palu’s damaged airport but military aircraft have taken some survivors out. Many more want to leave. The government has ordered that aid be airlifted in but there’s little sign of help on Palu’s shattered streets and survivors appeared increasingly desperate. A Reuters news team saw a shop cleared by about 100 people, shouting, scrambling and fighting each other for items including clothes, toiletries, blankets and water. Many people grabbed diapers while one man clutched a rice cooker as he headed for the door. Non-essential goods were scattered on the floor amid shards of broken glass. Police were at the scene but did not intervene. The government has played down looting saying victims could take essentials and shops would be compensated. Indonesia is all too familiar with earthquakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. It has said it would accept offers of international aid, after shunning outside help this year when an earthquake struck Lombok island. A spokesman for the main U.N. aid coordinating agency, OCHA, said humanitarian agencies were in contact with the government and ready to help. “There is an immediate need for food, clean water, shelter, medical care and psycho-social support,” the spokesman, Jens Laerke, told a briefing in Geneva. State port operator Pelindo IV said a ship carrying 50 tonnes of supplies including rice and baby milk had arrived in Palu on Monday. It was unclear if the aid had been distributed. ‘BURIED FAST’ Power has yet to be restored and aftershocks have rattled nerves but rescuers in Palu held out hope they could still save lives. “We suspect there are still some survivors trapped inside,” the head of one rescue team, Agus Haryono, told Reuters at the collapsed Hotel Roa Roa as he pored over its blueprints.

"Associated Press, Associated Press","Breaking news. (Photo: USA TODAY) TAIPEI, Taiwan – A strong and shallow earthquake struck off Taiwan’s east coast on Sunday night, but there were no immediate reports of any injuries or damage. The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude-6.1 quake’s epicenter was 9 miles northeast of the city of Hualien, at a depth of just 4.9 miles. Shallow quakes tend to cause more damage than deeper ones. Taiwan’s Central News Agency said the island’s earthquake monitoring agency registered seven tremors around that time, with the strongest recorded at a magnitude of 5.8 and a depth of 10 miles. Earthquakes frequently rattle Taiwan, but most are minor and cause little or no damage. However, a magnitude-7.6 quake in central Taiwan in 1999 killed more than 2,300 people. In 2016, a shallow earthquake in southern Taiwan killed at least two dozen people.

AP,"TANJUNG, Indonesia (AP) — Scientists say the powerful Indonesian earthquake that killed nearly 400 people lifted the island it struck by as much as 25 centimeters (10 inches). The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said on Saturday that 387 people died, jumping from the 321 it reported the previous day, as search and rescue teams continued to sift through the rubble and people already buried by relatives are accounted for. Using satellite images of Lombok from the days following the Aug. 5 quake, scientists from NASA and the California Institute of Technology’s joint rapid imaging project made a ground deformation map and measured changes in the island’s surface. In the northwest of the island near the epicenter, the rupturing faultline lifted the earth by a quarter of a meter. In other places it dropped by 5-15 centimeters (2-6 inches). NASA said satellite observations can help authorities respond to earthquakes and other natural or manmade disasters. Almost 390,000 people, about 10 percent of Lombok's population, are homeless or displaced after the earthquake, which damaged and destroyed about 68,000 homes. Disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said three districts in the north of Lombok still haven't received any assistance. The governor of West Nusa Tenggara province, which includes Lombok, has extended the official emergency period by two weeks to Aug. 25. ""It's estimated the death toll will continue to grow because there are still victims who are suspected of being buried by landslides and collapsed buildings and there are deaths that have not been recorded,"" Nugroho said. The number of evacuees fluctuates, he said, because not all evacuee points have been counted and some people tend to their gardens and properties during the day and return to the tent camps at night. Some people don't need to evacuate because their homes aren't damaged but have come to refugee centers because they feel traumatized. Nearly a week since the 7.0 quake, Lombok is still reeling but glimmers of normality were returning for some and devout villagers are making plans for temporary replacements of mosques that were flattened. In Tanjung, one of the worst affected districts in the hard-hit north of the island, a food market opened Saturday and locals bought vegetables and fish. Some shops also opened for business despite being in damaged buildings. “I had to borrow money from someone to buy morning glory to be resold here,” said Natbudi, one of the market vendors. “If I just stay at the camp and don’t come here to sell then I don’t have money to buy rice.” Lombok, a popular and less developed tourist destination than neighboring Bali, was hit by three strong quakes in little over a week and has endured more than 500 aftershocks. A July 29 quake killed 16 people. An aftershock measuring magnitude 5.9 on Thursday caused panic, more damage and more than two dozen injuries. Villager Sunarto, buying fish at the makeshift market, said it was a relief to do something ordinary. “I feel happy and thank God that finally the market is open,” he said. “We can buy our needs while waiting for the situation to get back to normal even though we’re still worried.” Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because of its location on the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. In December 2004, a massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries.

Lydia O'Connor,"A magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck off the coast of southern Peru early Sunday morning, leaving at least one dead and injuring dozens of others, authorities said. The large quake occurred about 25 miles offshore from Acari, a town in Peru’s southern Arequipa region, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. Shaking could be felt throughout the region and even as far north as the capital city of Lima, about 350 miles away, according to local media reports. The U.S. Geological Survey said the offshore quake did not present a tsunami threat. The quake has killed at least one person, Arequipa Gov. Yamila Osorio said. The victim, 55-year-old Justo Palomino Yucra, died after being by crushed by a rock in the town of Yauca. While some news outlets have reported a second death, Osorio said the official count remains at just one. Another 65 people were injured in the quake, Peru’s Civil Defense Institute chief Jorge Chavez told local radio station RPP. While assessing the damage in Chala and Acari, two of the hardest-hit towns, Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski told reporters that about 100 homes have collapsed. The quake also triggered power outages and damaged roads in affected towns.

Earthquakes are a major risk in Peru, where highly active fault lines are responsible for the uplift of the massive Andes mountain range. In 2007, a magnitude 8.0 quake that also struck southern Peru claimed nearly 600 lives. Sunday’s quake is a glimpse at how bad a bigger earthquake in a more populated part of Peru would be. The country’s lawmakers have warned in recent years that a large earthquake in Lima could cause some 30,000 deaths and destroy 200,000 homes. “Lima is not prepared, really, because of the risky circumstances our people live in,” Mayor Luis Castañeda said in 2015.

JAMES BARRON,"Some of the performers tore them up. One of Mr. Siegels regulars, the pianist Ryan Shirar, started a GoFundMe campaign that has raised about $24,000 for Mr. Siegels bills, which included rent on a temporary apartment. His own place, in a building between First and Second Avenue, was off limits. There are five steps down from the street to the lobby, he said, and I couldnt take steps.
He planned Mondays show at Town Hall between physical therapy sessions. The Broadway by the Year series, which started in 2000, was a career change for Mr. Siegel, who with his wife had written more than 40 books, including Jack Nicholson: The Unauthorized Biography, Richard Chamberlain: An Actors Life, The Encyclopedia of Hollywood and American Film Comedy. They had also written as critics for a number of publications and websites; currently, they write The Siegel Column for theaterpizzazz.com.
Town Hall, even though its in the theater district, did not have any theater-centric programming, he recalled. They wanted a theater audience. I had the idea for Broadway by the Year. I didnt have the title but I had the idea. They said, Would you produce it for us? I said, Happy to do it, but I havent produced anything in my life, not even a puppet show in the backyard when he was growing up in Fair Lawn, N.J.
He started with 1943, for the heavy anchor of Oklahoma! the Rodgers and Hammerstein hit and got a taste of the performers life.
Five minutes before the first curtain, I peeked out from stage left and saw the audience was full, he recalled, and I started to quake, literally shaking. I said, I cant go out there. I have to find a way to calm down. He did so by telling himself the audience was not there to see him but the performers he had hired. He said he has not had a case of nerves since.
Mondays show will look at how music changed as Broadway went from the Roaring Twenties into the Great Depression. For 1928, he will highlight the shows that introduced I Cant Give You Anything But Love and Makin Whoopee; an operetta called The New Moon because, he said, operettas were big on Broadway in the 1920s; and Animal Crackers, the Marx Brothers comedy that was later filmed.
The other year on Mondays bill, 1935, is remembered nowadays for Gershwins Porgy and Bess. But Mr. Siegel will also look at Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Harts Jumbo and Cole Porters Jubilee, among others.","Scott Siegler at Town Hall theater in Times Square where he is the producer of “Broadway by the Year,” a series that anthologizes Broadway shows by the year in which they had their premieres.",2019-02-24T16:00:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Grace Notes: He Knows Broadway, Year by Year.

Associated Press,"(BEIJING) — A magnitude-6.4 earthquake struck Tuesday near the coast of Taiwan, and people may be trapped inside a building. The U.S. Geological Survey says the quake struck late Tuesday about 21 kilometers (13 miles) northeast of Hualien, on the island’s east coast. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency reported that the ground floor of the Marshal Hotel, a building in Hualien district, had caved in and people were believed to be trapped inside. The agency posted photos showing a road fractured in several parts. Taiwanese media reported that aside from the cave in on the ground floor of the Marshal Hotel, a separate hotel known as the Beautiful Life Hotel, is tilting. Tuesday night’s quake follows one over the weekend off the coast of Hualien on the east of Taiwan, which lies along the famed “Pacific Rim of Fire” known for seismic activity from Alaska to Southeast Asia. The agency quoted a spokesman of Taiwan’s Executive Yuan, the governing cabinet’s office, as saying that search teams from other areas were headed to Hualien. The preliminary information suggests the quake was about 9.5 kilometers (6 miles) deep.","The ground floor of the Marshal Hotel, a building in Hualien district, had caved in and people were believed to be trapped inside, according to one report",2018-02-06T18:38:09Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Hotel Guests Feared Trapped After 6.4-Magnitude Earthquake in Taiwan,http://time.com/5135787/hotel-guests-feared-trapped-after-6-4-magnitude-earthquake-in-taiwan/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rex_at_leat_two_dead_some_100_injur_93.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,quake,1

"Associated Press, Associated Press","A damaged building in Pieve Torina after the strong earthquake hit Marche region, in central Italy, October 30, 2016. (Photo: CRISTIANO CHIODI, EPA) MILAN – A magnitude 4.7 quake shook residents and structures early Tuesday in a region of central Italy that had been struck by a series of powerful quakes in 2016. No deaths or injuries were reported. Mayors in towns affected did, however, report some damage from the temblor, which struck just before dawn, and said that checks were under way. Schools in some towns were closed for the day, while a local train line was reopened after being closed temporarily. The quake struck near the town of Macerata in the Marche region, which is still recovering from powerful quakes in October 2016 that caused widespread damage but no deaths, and was felt in the neighboring regions of Umbria and Lazio. The October 2016 quakes, including one registering 6.1 in magnitude, came two months after a deadly quake killed some 300 to the south in Amatrice, meaning many vulnerable structures in the mountainous, quake-prone had been rendered uninhabitable. That was cited by civil protection officials as a key reason that the most powerful quake in nearly 40 years didn’t cause loss of life. The mayor of the town of Muccia in Macerata province, Mario Baroni, where the quake was centered, told Sky News24 that the temblor had caused the partial collapse of a 17th century bell tower that had been damaged in 2016. He said the main concern was to ascertain any damage to homes that had remained inhabitable after the 2016 quakes. “We have few remaining inhabitable homes, and if they are damaged we will have even more people displaced by earthquakes,” he said. Just 120 residences in Muccia have remained inhabitable after the 2016 quakes, and more than half of the town’s 920 residents continue to live in emergency housing, according to the news agency ANSA. Baroni said that the Tuesday temblor was the strongest since October 2016 even if the area remains seismically active with frequent smaller quakes, including one in January. “In the end, people are beginning to live with quakes. But the uncertainty is creating a sense of anxiety and worry,” Baroli said. The mayor in nearby Pieve Torina, Alessandro Gentilucci, said authorities were checking structures. ANSA reported that four families were evacuated from their homes in the town. “This situation never seems to end,” Gentilucci said. “We are back in a dramatic situation, reliving scenes I never thought to relive.” The director of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, Salvatore Stramondo, said that the Amatrice quake had reactivated a series of faults that have triggered dozens of seismic events a day in a vast region from Amatrice to Norcia to Macerata over the last 20 months. An average of three quakes a month register magnitudes between 4 and 5, he said.

Associated Press,"LOS ANGELES - A magnitude 5.3 earthquake struck Thursday under the ocean off Southern California and was felt widely along the mainland coast, but there were no reports of damage except to a chimney on one of the Channel Islands. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake occurred at 12:29 p.m. in the Channel Islands region, about 38 miles (61 kilometers) southwest of the mainland city of Ventura. Some bricks fell from a chimney at an 1860s ranch on Santa Cruz Island, but no one was hurt, said Yvonne Menard, spokeswoman for Channel Islands National Park. The quake's epicenter was 17 miles (27 kilometers) from Santa Cruz Island, which is largely unpopulated but does have some staff and is visited by campers. Authorities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties did not report any immediate damage. The Los Angeles Fire Department said it went into ""earthquake mode"" and firefighters from all 106 of its firehouses began surveys of their territories, including bridges, dams, large buildings and power lines. ""We currently have no reports of damage or injuries,"" spokeswoman Margaret Stewart said. Scientists at the California Institute of Technology's seismology laboratory in Pasadena said the earthquake warning system under development for the West Coast gave about 10 seconds of warning before shaking arrived. Earthquakes of such size usually occur about once a year in Southern California, although the most recent one was in 2014, according to veteran seismologist Lucy Jones, recently retired from the USGS. The 96-square-mile (248-square-kilometer) Santa Cruz Island is the largest in the chain of eight Channel Islands, five of which are in the national park. Most of Santa Cruz Island, including the historic ranch, is owned by The Nature Conservancy, which cooperatively manages the island with the Park Service.","CBS News Los Angeles earthquake: Magnitude 5.3 quake strikes off California ABC15 Arizona LOS ANGELES - A magnitude 5.3 earthquake struck Thursday under the ocean off Southern California and was felt widely along the mainland coast, but there were no reports …",2018-04-06T03:09:32Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Abc15.com'}",Los Angeles earthquake: Magnitude 5.3 quake strikes off California - ABC15 Arizona,https://www.abc15.com/news/national/los-angeles-earthquake-magnitude-53-quake-strikes-off-california,https://mediaassets.abc15.com//photo/2011/09/19/earthquake_20110919135506_900_675.JPG,,Abc15.com,quake,1

"Eric Van Allen on Compete, shared by Riley MacLeod to Kotaku","We all love to compete, but as the generation that grew up on Quake and Brood War gets older, we’re not as keen on energy drinks and pop rocks anymore. Joints can ache after an hour’s worth of play, and quality-of-life improvements are a bigger deal than a mild video card increase or another headset. This guide for the competitive player is less about the hardware and more about the lifestyle. Whether some Discord pals are begging for an upgrade to their voice set-up or someone’s old creaky wrists are, like mine, popping like corn with every new solo queue game, here’s some ideas to gift that esports aficionado who already has the tools, but could use a few quality-of-life improvements. SteelSeries QcK Mousepad Most esports gift guides go for the classic keyboard and mouse. And while some clacky keys and a high DPI are great for gaming, the secret MVP is the mousepad. When I finally splurged on a new mouse, I was wondering why it didn’t feel quite as revolutionary as I’d hoped; because, it turns out, my raggedy cloth “mousepad” from college wasn’t providing a good surface for the laser. One trip to the store later, my mouse glides effortlessly on its new habitat. This pad is the one I use, but most mouse manufacturers will also have a line of pads that have great features like rubber grips to prevent slipping and a good frictionless surface to let the mouse soar through every sweeping arm motion. Blue Snowball Mic A headset might be your preference for gaming sessions, but if you know someone who wants a mic quality upgrade or maybe wants to start streaming their games, a good standalone desktop mic is handy to have. The Snowball has been a podcasting staple for a reason: it’s compact, portable, easy to use, and provides great audio in a variety of situations. It works on both PC and on consoles like the PlayStation 4, and lets you bust out some high-quality headphones while getting that little strand mic away from your face. The Stick Compete ’s recurring physical therapy source Dr. Caitlin McGee had a few suggestions for foam rollers and other ergonomic ideas, but The Stick stuck out. A body massage roller for relieving pain, this is great for those who get a lot of soreness in wrists, neck, or really any area that could use some TLC after a long gaming session. It’s a good idea to help your sore muscles out when they need it, and The Stick can help you care for those 200+ APM wrists.
