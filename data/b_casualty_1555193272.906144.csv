Brian Raftery,"Early on Friday, WarnerMedia announced it was shuttering FilmStruck, its streaming service that traffics exclusively in classic Hollywood and arthouse movieseverything from On the Town to Seven Samurai to Night of the Living Dead. In a statement, the company noted that the FilmStruck was largely a niche service, a fact that was actually part of the two-year-old streamers appeal: Drawing titles from the voluminous Warner Bros. catalog and the prestigious Criterion Collection, FilmStruck was one of the only services catering to incurable movie nerds, the kind of enthusiasts who could devour all three previous iterations of A Star is Born in a single weekend. Its a huge loss, one with grave implications for what the streaming environment might look like in the future. FilmStruck wasnt the only casualty of the recent merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner: Last week, the newly minted monolith closed down the on-again, off-again digital comedy platform Super Deluxe, while the popular Korean-language provider DramaFever was axed just a few days prior. Both were dynamic, creatively vibrant outlets with dedicated fanbases. But thats not enough for WarnerMedia chief John Stankey, whos made it clear his company and its providers cant merely be hugethey have to be massive enough to accrue hours of engagement, he told employees at an internal meeting in July. That way, he noted, you get more data and information about a customer that then allows you to do things like monetize through alternate models of advertising as well as subscriptions, which I think is very important to play in tomorrows world. Whats clearly not important in that new strategy is smaller platforms like Super Deluxe or FilmStruckoutlets that cant possibly provide enough users (and user data) to make them worth the companys time. Its a pragmatic calculation, one thats to be expected when we willingly appoint technocrats as our cultural gatekeepers. But it also seems short-sighted: If WarnerMedias plan is to roll all of its offerings into one giant stand-alone serviceas the company is expected to do next year its the niches that will make it stand apart from the countless other streams. One reason for Netflixs success is that it strives to appeal to everyone sitcom enthusiasts, true-crime lovers, baking-contest addicts. Its breadth of programming, from high-budget limited series to tiny documentaries, is what makes it feel essential to everybody. If WarnerMedia had eventually rolled FilmStruck into its bigger service, it would have been an enticing add-on for movie lovers, who are largely underserved by the big streaming services. The film catalogs of Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime are barely curated and erratically arranged: Theyre great if, say, you randomly want to watch The Terminator on a Thursday night, but good luck finding too many older or more oddball offerings on those platforms. And with video stores dead, landing a physical copy of, say, The Seventh Seal requires far more legwork than it once did. Which is what made FilmStruck so special: At a time when non-blockbuster movies are being devaluedboth in theaters and at homeit was a smart, accessible portal into movie history. Most streaming services encourage passivity; they want you to sit back and turn over hours to your life to the screen, without having to search too hard. FilmStruck, with its clean interface and manageable line-up, allowed you to dig around. It was the equivalent of a knowledgeable but none-too-pushy video-store clerk, pointing you toward titles like Seven Brides for Seven Brothers or Purple Noon or The American Friend the kind of classics that are all but buried on other services. And it did so with enthusiasm and lots of background intel (FilmStruck often included commentary tracks, a huge plus for at-home movie scholars). Thankfully, there are other streaming options for cinephiles; MUBI, Kanopy, and Fandor offer up decades-spanning archives. But the sudden demise of FilmStruck should serve as a dire warning to anyone who believed the streaming era would open up our cultural history: The more we entrust our art to the tech-titans, the quicker it can disappear. FilmStruck closes at the end of November, giving you another month to mainline as many film-essentials as possible. Hopefully, its offerings will end up somewhere else. But even if they do, you may want to pull your old DVDs from the basement and dust them off. In a few years, they may be your best ticket to watching the classics.

MARK LEIBOVICH,"Politics has always loved a good odd-couple story. That the cable combatants James Carville (the Bill Clinton strategist) and Mary Matalin (the Bush and Cheney operative) were married in real life held a certain novelty and quaintness in the relatively tame Beltway soap opera of the 1990s. It could also be marketable. The Carville-Matalin political-enemies/life-partners routine reaped them a fortune of book, speaking, TV and endorsement deals.
But the love-over-politics plotline seems to be another casualty of an administration that has torched even the most time-honored of Washington chestnuts. Far from anything uplifting, the ballad of George and Kellyanne has provided a running background mishegoss to the main noise. George will tweet, with increasing disgust, about the president; people (who pay attention to these things) will notice, and the media will cover it, especially when he takes on a matter relating to presidential scandal, including impeachment, which he had experience with as a prime mover against Bill Clintons presidency two decades ago.
Its also hard to look away when George seems to implicitly or explicitly chastise those who still support and enable Mr. Trump (for example, his wife). Members of Team Kellyanne jump on Twitter to retaliate, on her behalf. Trumps 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said George was a bad husband, and Eric Trump called his actions horrible. George told The Washington Post that he was compelled to tweet about the White House so I dont end up screaming at her, meaning Kellyanne. All totally normal!
At first, it was impossible not to wonder whether the Conways were staging some elaborate marital feud, tailor-made to gin up maximum publicity in the attention vortex that is Donald Trumps White House. Were they positioning themselves for some kind of post-White House reconciliation act? You could imagine the joint memoir or reality show or live stage possibilities.
But it is also impossible not to wonder whether their joint memoir is being written in real time, and we are watching a life partnership fracture on Twitter, a casualty of a third wheel in the marriage Donald Trump.
This is the part of the story where we call in the authorities to remind us that (slowly, everyone) no one really knows what goes on in the privacy of a marriage. Hey, I dont live in their house, Mr. Carville cautioned when I reached him by phone in Louisiana, where he and Ms. Matalin have lived for 12 years in apparent harmony (and if not, it would be off-brand, so they would never tweet about it). They might be the happiest people or the saddest people in the world, Mr. Carville said of the Conways. Or maybe somewhere in between, like everyone.","Are we watching a life partnership fracture on Twitter, a casualty of Donald Trump?",2019-03-30T18:30:01Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",news analysis: We’re All Stuck Inside George and Kellyanne’s Marriage,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/sunday-review/kellyanne-george-conway-marriage.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/31/opinion/sunday/31leibovich/31leibovich-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,casualty,1
MATT APUZZO and MILAN SCHREUER,"The agreement has recently become a flash point for nationalist and far-right groups in Europe, who have called it an effort to impose a globalist agenda on sovereign governments. Over the weekend, the police used water cannons to disperse thousands of demonstrators who protested the agreement in Brussels.
In the face of rising right-wing opposition to the pact, Mr. Michel asked the Parliament this month to vote on whether to support it. The N-VA opposed it, but Mr. Mr. Michels remaining partners won support from left-wing parties to support the measure. With that backing, Mr. Michel said he would endorse the agreement.
Karen Van Vlierberge, a deputy permanent representative at Belgiums United Nations mission, said on Tuesday that the position had not changed. We will vote in favor, she said of the pact.
Supporters have complained that nationalist, anti-immigrant groups have misrepresented the agreement. The pact explicitly recognizes state sovereignty and the right of each government to decide its own immigration policies.
Nevertheless, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, one such right-wing leader, has dismissed the compact as a pro-migration document.
Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia have also rejected the accord, as has the United States, which initially supported it. President Trump withdrew his support last year, declaring it at odds with his immigration policies.
King Philippe will now consider the resignation and it is unclear when he might act on it.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"“There were opportunities for the staff to have intervened if they had been armed,” Sheriff Gualtieri said. The only armed school resource officer on campus on the day of the rampage, Deputy Scot Peterson, remained outside the building. He resigned and has since said he did not go in because he was not sure of the gunman’s location. When students arrive at Stoneman Douglas for the new school year on Wednesday, security changes will be evident. New chain-link fences ring the inside of campus, including around the vacant freshman building where the shooting took place, which will never be used again. More surveillance cameras are mounted high up on the walls. Classroom doors have been outfitted with handles that lock automatically. Clear plastic backpacks will no longer be required, as they were in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, but identification badges will remain mandatory. Visitors will have to be buzzed in. Three school resource officers — instead of only one — will be on staff. What will matter most in Parkland and elsewhere, however, will be what school districts do behind the scenes, said Alberto Carvalho, superintendent of the neighboring Miami-Dade County Public Schools, which has also expanded policing and invested in more advanced security technology. The most effective way to prevent a tragedy is by giving school communities a way to report concerns about troubled students and then offer those students the help they need, Mr. Carvalho said. “After all of this, the strongest tool we have available to use is low cost but highly effective: It’s the level of alertness of parents, students and community members,” he said. “We really mean it when we say, ‘If you see something, say something.’”","The shooting in Parkland, Fla., spurred school districts into reinforcing buildings, hiring armed guards and training staff to handle mass casualty events.",2018-08-11T15:18:34Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Back-to-School Shopping for Districts: Armed Guards, Cameras and Metal Detectors",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/11/us/back-to-school-security-guns.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/12/us/12schoolsecurity-01/00schoolsecurity-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,casualty,1
RON NIXON,"Around 6:30 a.m., officials said, Jakelin began having seizures and her temperature had climbed to nearly 106 degrees. At the Lordsburg station, Border Patrol agents with medical training tried to help her before she was flown to a hospital in El Paso. There, she went into cardiac arrest and died. Officials said she also had brain swelling. Kevin K. McAleenan, the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, said Border Patrol agents did everything they could to save Jakelins life. The agents involved are deeply affected and empathize with the father over the loss of his daughter, Mr. McAleenan said in a statement.

Taylor Hatmaker,"Facebook’s latest public controversy appears to have claimed its first major casualty. According to reporting from the New York Times, the social media giant is poised to part ways with its high profile chief security officer, Alex Stamos. That story suggests that Stamos created friction within Facebook by pushing for an aggressive approach to exploring and disclosing to the public the platform’s role in disseminating Russian state-sponsored disinformation to users. Stamos apparently initiated his exit in December 2017 but was convinced to stay on through August to avoid the hit to public perception, the New York Times reports. Stamos weighed in over the weekend, arguing that Facebook’s revelations around the Trump campaign-linked data analytics firm did not qualify as a “breach” in the technical sense. The term that generally connotes hacking or a technical compromise of some kind, though the Cambridge Analytica situation involves a since deprecated lax API and a business model that revolves around collecting massive troves of personal data and doling it out in ways often far from transparent to the average user. I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in. — Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) March 17, 2018 Stamos, who joined the company in June of 2015 after spending nearly year and a half time wrestling with privacy woes at Yahoo, is generally well respected within the security community. According to a story from Reuters in 2016, Stamos reportedly left his position at the top security officer at Yahoo after the company complied with a secret U.S. intelligence directive that allowed the government to search Yahoo user emails via purpose-built software. Stamos’s presence at Facebook — and his at times candid explanations of the internal workings and reasoning of the often opaque social network — projected the sense that the company was taking user privacy seriously. Depending on what happens next, the security officer’s absence at Facebook is likely to speak volumes too.","Facebook’s latest public controversy appears to have claimed its first major casualty.

ROD NORDLAND,"“The Taliban don’t want peace, because they think they can win the war,” said the embattled governor of Baghlan Province, Abdul Hai Nimati, at his office here in Pul-i-Kumri. “If it goes on like this, they’re going to win.” Appointed by President Ashraf Ghani, Mr. Nimati is a former jihadi commander who fought the Soviets and the Communist government during the 1980s and 1990s. “Back in those days, we had all the advantages of fighting a guerrilla war that the Taliban have now,” he said, almost wistfully. “We have to defend everywhere, and they can attack anywhere.” The figure of 400 Afghan soldiers and police officers killed last week leaked out of a meeting last weekend between Gen. Austin Scott Miller, the new American military commander, and Western diplomats in Kabul, according to two of those present, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was meant to be off the record. Asked about the meeting, the American military spokesman, Col. Dave Butler, did not specifically address the number killed last week, instead saying, “General Miller’s remarks are not accurately reflected by your sources’ recollection.” He added: “He was reflecting on Afghan sacrifice over a several-week period. He was relaying a sense of urgency to the team and encouraging focus on the mission.” The quiet acknowledgment of higher casualties is coming at a time of alarm about the Taliban’s gains across Afghanistan. More districts than at any time since 2001 — including some provincial capitals — have fallen under threat or outright control by the insurgents over the past year.","A member of the Afghan National Army training with United States Army soldiers in Helmand Province in 2016.

Jon Russell,"Bike-sharing, the year’s hottest startup trend in China and beyond, looks like it is about to see the biggest casualty of its cut-throat competition. Bluegogo, which had raised $90 million from investors and operates around 700,000 bikes across China, seems headed for the deadpool after Technode, our Chinese partner site, reported that the company has lost a slew of top executives and is now preventing users from withdrawing their 100 RMB ($15) deposit due to financial issues.

Staff have reportedly already waited months without being paid, and the website is no longer online. In yet another bad sign: the CEO is said to be ‘somewhere overseas.’ From the now defunct website Bluegogo is some way behind billion-dollar startups Mobike and Ofo, which have been backed by huge firms like Tencent and Alibaba and are in talks over a potential merger, but it does have a major China presence and it did make an effort to expand to San Francisco.

The New York Times recently talked to a few professional movers to get their thoughts on the matter, some of which echo my own. Plan in Advance Before this move, my official moving strategy had been “throw everything in a box” typically seconds before I threw it in the back of my friend’s car to move to my new home. While there were definitely some last-minute packing adventures with this most recent re-location, I actually started packing a month before the move and paid special care to how I was packing up my belongings. Even if you’re super organized, moving is stressful. Hiring a moving company makes it a little… Read more Read In general, unsurprisingly, you want to pack things in such a way that they won’t get damaged, and will be easy to locate once you’re in your new place. We divided my old apartment up into sectors and packed in sections, making sure that the boxes we packed were both light and contained like items. Yes, your bedroom stuff might fit in the kitchen box, but you’re really just making things complicated for yourself down the line. Come up with a packing “plan” and stick to it. I hate packing, but when we broke it up into sections it didn’t seem nearly as bad. Packing for an hour each night is a heck of a lot easier than frantically packing for the 12 hours leading up to the movers’ arrival. Wrap Those Breakables Wrapping every dish in your cabinet, and especially every pint glass (I think I have 100) is obnoxious. It’s also necessary. Pack those boxes with the idea that they’re going to get thrown around. They might get dropped. They might get dropped down a flight of stairs. Wrap things in bubble wrap, or kitchen towels, or something. We used liquor boxes with dividends to move some glassware which made things a tiny bit easier. The idea is to not leave anything up to chance. If it’s important enough to move then it’s probably important enough to protect. The New York Times also suggests that dishes should be packed on their sides, not flat. You’ll want to remove the coffee pot from your coffee machine, as well (seems obvious to me, but apparently some people don’t do it), and you need to secure the swinging arm in that grandfather clock you want to move. The big mirror you have? Move it between a few mattresses. Come Up With a System Two friends of mine just made the trek from New York to San Francisco.

Whether it’s a significant other or just a roommate, make sure you’ve successfully divided up your property before the movers arrive, not after.

Anthony Ha,"A recent Facebook algorithm change seems to have claimed a high-profile casualty: LittleThings, a digital publisher focused on inspirational and how-to content for women, which shut down yesterday. I wrote about the company at the beginning of 2016, when it raised debt funding from City National Bank. At the time, it seemed to be flying high, becoming one of the largest lifestyle publishers online and, according to one report, publishing the single most popular Facebook post in 2015. But things were a bit rockier in recent months, according to a staff memo from CEO Joe Speiser that was published by Business Insider. Apparently there were “especially large setbacks” in August of last year, and while LittleThings managed “to quickly right the ship, and rebuild the company with new business lines and revenue streams,” Speiser began talking to larger media organizations about an acquisition. Then Facebook made another big change to its algorithm, one that was supposed to prioritize content from friends and family over news publishers. Speiser said this cut LittleThings’ influencer and organic traffic (which was its most valuable traffic) by 75 percent. “No previous algorithm update ever came close to this level of decimation,” he wrote. “The position it put us in was beyond dire. The businesses looking to acquire LittleThings got spooked and promptly exited the sale process, leaving us in jeopardy of our bank debt convenants and ultimately bringing an expedited end to our incredible story.” Speiser said he’s hoping to find some way to resurrect the LittleThings brand in the future. In the meantime, the company is done.

Victoria Song,"Allo is the latest casualty in Googles long and tired road to building a chat app that can rival Apples iMessage. After passing on further Allo investment back in April, Google officially announced this week that its pulling the plug on the chat app in March 2019. Are we surprised? Not really. Googles always made a mess of its messaging strategy. Allo popped onto the scene in September 2016, and it was supposed to be a smarter messaging app that let people get more out of their texts. It let you send stickers à la Facebook Messenger, and had Google Assistant built in. That said, when Google paused investment, it also ported over its most popular features like smart replies, GIFs, and desktop support to the Messages app. It didnt help that at launch, Allo didnt support SMS. (If you were one the few who liked Allo, you can find instructions on how to back up your stuff here.) But Allo is just another corpse in the graveyard of failed Google communication products. To name a few, theres Google Wave, Google Buzz, Gchat, ans Google Spaces. The announcement also basically confirmed Hangouts will be split into Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet. And while regular consumers will still have access to the services, Google didnt offer any clues to timing and stressed Hangouts will be enterprise focused. Duo, another Google video call app, is miraculously still alive as Google cited consumer successthough for how long is anyones guess. At the moment, Google seems to be pinning its hopes on its Messages app. Earlier this year, it announced Chat, another confusingly named service that, yes, is different from Gchat and no, isnt another freaking app. Chat is Googles attempt at getting mobile carriers to adopt the Rich Communication Services (RCS) protocol and do away with SMS. While it was initially aimed to roll out sometime this year, it looks like Verizon might be the first to adopt RCS in 2019. Thats a long way of saying this Google service will finally support features like read receipts, typing indicators, better group texts, and full resolution videos and photos. Things that iMessage already has and has had for years. Whether Chat succeeds will depend on carriers, as Google cant just say Okay fam, were all RCS now. And as you can already guess, Apples not on board. After all, its iMessages app has plenty of features that Chat wont, including location sharing, text effects, and crucially, end-to-end encryption. But if Google really is going all-in on Messages, then killing Allo makes a ton of sense. Not only does it simplify its fractured communications strategy to just FIVE apps, its harvesting the best parts of Allo to bring Messages up to speed. RIP Allo.

This reduces the original Defenders to Jessica Jones, The Punisher, and Daredevil, whose third season just made its debut. This is frankly a huge disappointment to fans of the Defenders series. Luke Cage had a strong first two seasons, with a terrific supporting castmost notably Alfre Woodard as Mariah Dillard, and her right hand, Hernan ""Shades"" Alzarez (Theo Rossi). While season 2 was a bit uneven, it ended with the dearly departed Mariah turning the tables on Luke, deeding him the Harlem's Paradise nightclub. We were looking forward to seeing what kind of corrupting influence that kind of power might have had on Harlem's hero. Here's the joint statement from Marvel and Netflix: ""Unfortunately, Marvel's Luke Cage will not return for a third season. Everyone at Marvel Television and Netflix is grateful to the dedicated showrunner, writers, cast and crew who brought Harlem's Hero to life for the past two seasons, and to all the fans who have supported the series."" However, a source told the Hollywood Reporter the cancellation was due to ""creative differences and the inability to agree to terms for a third season of the show."" That might come as a surprise, since a a third season was considered all but a done deal, with scripts in development and all the main actors still under contract. But then the writer's room was suspended in September, with rumors of trimming the season from 13 episodes to ten. Deadline Hollywood has more : ""It eventually escalated to behind-the-scenes turmoil in the past two days and demands for changes in creative reign. With Marvel and Netflix seemingly in intractable and different sides of the disputes, a harsh cancelation became the only viable exit strategy, it appears."" So far there has been no comment from star Mike Colter or show runner Cheo Hodari Coker. But Finn Jones, star of the also-cancelled Iron Fist, showed his solidarity by posting an image on Instagram of the Iron Fist meeting the fist of Luke Cage, punctuated by two fist emojis (one black, one white) on either side of a heart.",Harlem's hero is the latest casualty as Netflix does a little housecleaning.,2018-10-20T05:08:54Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Another Defender bites the dust as Netflix cancels Luke Cage,https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/another-defender-bites-the-dust-as-netflix-cancels-luke-cage/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cageTOP-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,casualty,1
Laura Vitto,"A Southwest Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing in Philadelphia after part of its engine broke off and shattered a passenger window. The National Transportation Safety Board has confirmed there was one casualty — the first US commercial flight casualty since 2013. Information about the landing is also coming in via social media and local news. SEE ALSO: Pilot captures heartstopping moment when his plane's engine fails mid-air According to a statement from Southwest Airlines, the Boeing 737-700 from New York's LaGuardia Airport headed toward Dallas, Texas, landed at Philadelphia International Airport, and was carrying 143 people, plus five crew members at the time of landing. Here's a gif of that flight path, via Flight Aware: NBC10 in Philadelphia reports that one passenger's father-in-law reported via his daughter that a woman was sucked toward the open window. From NBC10: The jet's left engine blew shortly after takeoff, passengers said. Pieces of shrapnel flew into the plane's fuselage and at least one window, the passengers and FAA said. ""There is a hole in the side of the aircraft, also,"" an aircraft controller relayed to firefighters at the airport. Passengers aboard the flight posted photos and video from the scene on social media shortly after landing, including images of the destroyed engine and the broken window. One passenger, Marty Martinez of Dallas, went live on Facebook ahead of the emergency landing. Though much of the video is garbled, the video shows Martinez wearing an oxygen mask. In the comments, he shared harrowing details from the moment after the window shattered next to a passenger. He writes: ""Flight attendants ran over calling for passengers to help cover the hole as they broke down and began uncontrollably crying and looking horrified as they looked outside. Plane dropped dramatically and it smelled like fire with ash coming down on everyone thru the vents. Absolutely terrifying, but we are okay."" In a later post, he explained his decision to go live on Facebook: I literally bought WiFi as the plane was going down because I wanted to be able to reach the people I loved...thinking these were my final moments on earth. And put in a position to have to prioritize the people I loved to send them my final words was an absolutely gut wrenching feeling. So I thought to Facebook LIVE my experience, thinking this would be my last communication with the people I loved and my team back home. Per the aviation experts over at NYC Aviation, an engine failure of this kind is pretty uncommon. And yes, it’s possible that a person could be partially pulled out an open airplane window due to the enormous pressure difference between the cabin and the atmosphere at high altitude. Indeed. Engines are made to be able to fail and remain contained, specifically to avoid shrapnel piercing the fuselage and fuel tanks. Hoping the passenger is ok. https://t.co/tSSJrW3XGx — NYCAviation (@NYCAviation) April 17, 2018 Trying to confirm, but the window breaking and any body part pulled outward, with entire body not fitting and being stuck, sounds possible. — NYCAviation (@NYCAviation) April 17, 2018 Though a plane window is likely too small to eject an adult's body from a plane, there have been past incidents where much larger holes were ripped in planes, leading to fatalities. In 1988, a Boeing 737-200 blew open after, per the Federal Aviation Agency, ""an explosive decompression occurred,"" killing a flight attendant who was pulled from the plane, and injuring eight others.

Stine Jacobsen,"(Reuters) - Iceland’s WOW air became the latest budget airline casualty on Thursday, halting operations and cancelling all future flights after efforts to raise more funds failed. 
WOW, which focused on low-cost travel across the Atlantic, advised stranded travelers to seek flights with other airlines. It flew a total of 3.5 million passengers last year. 
“This is probably the hardest thing I have ever done but the reality is that we have run out of time and have unfortunately not been able to secure the funding of the company,” WOW CEO and founder Skuli Mogensen wrote in a letter to the company’s 1,000 employees. 
“I will never be able to forgive myself for not taking action sooner,” he added. 
WOW had earlier postponed flights on Thursday as it entered what it had hoped were the final stages of an equity raising with a group of investors. 
“My flight from Boston has been canceled. Having a hard time getting through to anyone on the phone. Can you help me at all?” Twitter user Marc Solari wrote. 
WOW replied with an apology and offer of further assistance. 
WOW is the latest budget airline to collapse as the European airline sector grapples with over-capacity and high fuel costs. Recent failures include Britain’s Flybmi, Nordic budget airline Primera Air and Cypriot counterpart Cobalt. 
“RESCUE FARES” 
Other airlines including, Icelandair, Easyjet and Norwegian stepped in offering discounted ‘rescue fares’ to stranded passengers, according to the Icelandic Transport Authority 
WOW has been pursuing different avenues to raise money over the past few months. 
It ended talks with rival Icelandair last Sunday while veteran low-cost airline investor Bill Franke also had canceled a proposed investment through private equity fund Indigo Partners. 
Icelandair shares traded up 13 percent at 1215 GMT after the failure of a competitor. 
Founded in 2011 by entrepreneur Mogensen, WOW used smaller single-aisle planes to fly between Iceland and many destinations in the United States and Europe. 
Its website had advertised flights from London to cities such as New York and Boston for as little as 150 pounds, although the journey went via the Icelandic capital Reykjavik. 
Norwegian Air has a little over half of the market share in the fast-growing, low-cost, long-haul transatlantic market, while WOW controlled a quarter in 2018.

There are fears of a knock-on effect on Iceland’s important tourism industry. 
Around 30 percent of tourists visiting Iceland last year flew with WOW and the collapse could trigger a 16 percent drop in tourists this year, research from Icelandic bank Arion showed.

MICHELLE BLACK,"Before last year, I had never thought about what happens when the bodies of soldiers killed overseas are returned to the United States. On Oct. 16, 2017, I experienced it firsthand as I escorted my young sons through an airport to collect their fathers remains.
My husband, Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, and his team were ambushed outside the village of Tongo Tongo, Niger, 12 days earlier. Islamic State militants who had been tracking the units movements shot and killed Bryan along with three other American soldiers. My husbands remains were transported to Dover Air Force Base for processing within 24 hours of the ambush; it took two weeks after that for his body to be transferred to North Carolina, where we live. It wasnt until I saw the coffin come out of the commercial jets cargo hold that his death finally became real for me.
At 11 a.m., the casualty-assistance officer assigned to our family by the Army picked up me and my two boys, ages 9 and 11, my in-laws and several family members for the hourlong drive to Raleigh Durham International Airport. The officer was the one who had been with us since wed been notified of Bryans death. At the airport, three representatives from the U.S.O., a charity that provides services to military members and their families, met us at the curb and escorted us through security and across the airport to a private room inside the U.S.O. lounge. After a short briefing on the days plan, we were guided to the gate to meet Bryans plane.
I took my boys hands as we rode down the glass-walled elevator and whispered to them that everything would be O.K. I kept my eyes straight ahead and tried hard to walk purposefully to keep from panicking or crying as we stepped into the crowd of travelers. My children followed my lead until we reached the gate. The casualty-assistance officer called our attention to the 22 soldiers who marched down the main thoroughfare of the airport walkway making their way toward us. Curious travelers stopped and stared at the procession of soldiers in their dress blues the ceremonys purpose dawning on the onlookers slowly. Some people snapped to attention to show us respect; some even saluted. Others ducked their heads, as though they were caught staring at a car wreck, then they scurried off or turned their backs.",The wife of an American soldier killed in the Niger ambush recounts the day she and her sons collected his remains at the airport.,2018-12-21T10:00:11Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",At War: My Husband Was Killed in Niger.

Katie Reilly,"Some high-poverty school districts are bracing for the fact that federally funded lunch programs could become a casualty of the government shutdown if it drags on for another month.
At least one district in rural North Carolina is taking precautionary measures, cutting out treats like ice cream and reducing lunch menus to the “minimum level to conserve food and funding” starting Tuesday. The shutdown, which started Dec. 22, is the longest in U.S. history.
“We’re in uncharted waters. We’ve never gone through anything like this before. The shutdown has gone on longer than any other, and we don’t know how long it’s going to last,” Terri Hedrick, spokesperson for Vance County Schools in Henderson, North Carolina, tells TIME.
The district — which provides free breakfast and lunch to all students — plans to start offering one main lunch entree, bread, two vegetables, one fruit and milk, cutting out a choice of multiple lunch entrees. The district will also stop offering ice cream and will only offer bottled water and juice until the current inventory runs out.
“No fresh produce will be included, except at elementary schools as part of the Fresh Fruit &amp; Vegetable Program,” the district said in a Facebook post. “This program will be decreased to two days each week.”
Vance County schools provide free breakfast and lunch to all students in the district — where more than 90% of students qualify for free and reduced-price lunch — through the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), a federal grant established by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 for schools in low-income areas. Through the CEP, schools serve breakfast and lunch at no cost to students and are later reimbursed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which is one of nine federal departments and agencies affected by the shutdown.
About 20 million students in nearly 100,000 schools also receive free lunches through the National School Lunch Program, and another 2 million students receive reduced-price lunches. The United States Department of Agriculture has emphasized that such child nutrition programs have been fully funded through March.
“There’s understandable concern about child nutrition programs, but this needs to be clear: USDA’s child nutrition programs are funded quarterly and are fully funded through the end of March. Includes National School Lunch, School Breakfast, and Child &amp; Adult Care Food programs,” U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Purdue tweeted on Friday afternoon. 
But Hedrick says her district has started to prepare for the worst-case scenario, rationing food to make sure that its more than 6,000 students don’t go hungry if the shutdown continues.
“We haven’t run out of food, but we feel like taking these proactive steps will enable us to save food supplies and money,” Hedrick says. “We’re a small rural district in a low-wealth county here in North Carolina, and we don’t have an abundant amount cash reserves to support our school nutrition program if the federal funds aren’t there.”
Meanwhile, many school districts have also had to expand their free-lunch offerings to help students whose parents are federal employees who have been furloughed or forced to work without a paycheck during the shutdown.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides food stamps to more than 40 million Americans, will continue to be funded through February, but many SNAP recipients received their February benefits early this month and will not receive another payment until the shutdown ends. Government agencies and advocacy groups have urged SNAP recipients to budget carefully.
At a press conference on Thursday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told residents to “prepare for the worst,” warning that 1.6 million New Yorkers will lose access to SNAP benefits on March 1.
“We are now entering nothing less than a full-blown crisis that is about to have a massive effects on the people of New York City, and it is a crisis with no end in sight,” he said.
“If you said, ‘Tell me what might be your number one concern,’ it is food for children. This crisis could literally mean that food was taken out of the mouths of children,” de Blasio said, adding that New York City schools would draw on reserve funding to continue offering meals at school. 
“It’s going to be a real challenging situation.”

Following McFarland’s conviction on two counts of wire fraud by the US Attorney’s office earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission has settled with him and two of his lieutenants, Grant Margolin (his CMO) and Daniel Simon (an independent contractor), after alleging that the trio had fraudulently hoovered up money from more than 100 investors by misrepresenting themselves. The quote from the SEC’s latest press release is choice : McFarland induced investors to entrust him with tens of millions of dollars by fraudulently inflating key operational, financial metrics and successes of his companies, as well as his own personal success – including by giving investors a doctored brokerage account statement purporting to show personal stock holdings of over $2.5 million when, in reality, the account held shares worth under $1,500. Naturally, McFarland used the money he received to fund the lifestyle he’d always wanted — partying with celebs, private jets, etc. — as is the wont of the high-end scammer. “McFarland gained the trust of investors by falsely portraying himself as a skilled entrepreneur running a series of successful media companies,” said Melissa Hodgman, the associate director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division, in another absolutely brutal quote. Image: Fyre Festival LLC McFarland, Margolin, and Simon were charged with “violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws,” and the three have agreed to pay back the money they bilked. McFarland owes $27.4 million and has been permanently barred from serving as either an officer or a director of a public company; Margolin owes $35,000, and agreed to a 7-year ban; Simon owes a relatively reasonable $15,000, and has been banned for three years. (As the SEC deftly notes: this settlement is still subject to court approval.) It’s a fine ending to last year’s wild saga, which is remembered fondly by everyone who didn’t buy $12,000 tickets for McFarland’s “once-in-a-lifetime” concert in the Bahamas. But honestly, it could only have ended this way; any good deed that generates this much schadenfreude and embarrasses hundreds of wealthy socialites cannot go unpunished. (Jeffrey Atkins, aka Ja Rule, who promoted the festival alongside McFarland and co., has not been charged with anything.) Even if we won’t always have McFarland, we’ll always have Fyre Festival.

RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.,"Mr. Doyen wrote that the shooting “appears to have been the first act of mass violence at an event at which a D.H.S.-certified service or technology was employed” — one of the conditions for triggering the liability shield. “No court opinions apply or interpret the statute,” he added. The federally certified security company at the concert, Contemporary Services Corporation, has been seeking “a public statement by the Secretary of Homeland Security that the mass shooting was an ‘act of terrorism,’” Mr. Doyen wrote. MGM declined to comment on whether it, too, has been lobbying the department to declare the shooting an act of terror, which could help its case. A Department of Homeland Security spokesman declined to comment on whether any review is underway of how to characterize the shooting. Lawyers for Mr. Paddock’s victims reacted with outrage to the MGM lawsuits, which were filed in Nevada and California last Friday, calling the move an unprecedented and specious attempt to protect the company no matter what the facts eventually show. “It’s all about immunizing themselves from liability and staying out of state courts,” said Craig Eiland, a lawyer in Austin, Tex., who represents hundreds of shooting victims. “They want to say that it does not matter how negligent MGM was” in allowing Mr. Paddock to stockpile an arsenal in his Mandalay Bay hotel room. Mr. Eiland said MGM’s effort to use the law this way, if successful, could provide a road map for other companies to escape responsibility for future mass-casualty attacks. “Their theory is that this security company goes to D.H.S. and gets some type of certificate, and so now MGM is immune, and everybody in the future who hires the company is immune,” he said. “It’s outrageous, and that’s not what the law is, and we would all be less safe.”","MGM Resorts International, which owns the Mandalay Bay hotel, wants a federal court to rule that it can’t be held liable for a mass shooting last year in which the gunman used one of its rooms.",2018-07-18T00:30:05Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","MGM Resorts Sues 1,000 Victims of Las Vegas Shooting, Seeking to Avoid Liability",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/us/mgm-resorts-sues-victims.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/18/us/18mgm/18mgm-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,casualty,1
Lina Batarags,"There's a new look among some luxury hotels, and it's a whole lot smaller — and barer — than it used to be. 
 It's part of a move towards ""lean luxury,"" Quartzy's Rosie Spinks wrote, and while the pared-down room sizes and simplified amenities are cost-conscious decisions, there's also another factor at play in the change. 
 ""By cutting back on both the size of the rooms ... and some of the more costly amenities of a traditional luxury hotel, hospitality companies can offer better locations, a design-led sensibility with higher quality materials, and an altogether elevated experience — for a pretty damn reasonable price,"" Spinks reported. ""They also tend to look way better on Instagram."" 
Read more: Luxury hotels around the world have private rooms that are so elite they're not even listed online — and some are available only via email booking
 The goal with lean luxury hotels, Spinks continued, is to be ""far more functional and user-experience-oriented than a standard grand hotel room."" 
 Instagram is changing the look of luxury 
 The effect Instagram is having on luxury hotels isn't all that surprising when you consider the way it's changed the way people, many of them millennials, travel at large. As Robb Report previously reported, people are planning trips around the world specifically for Instagram photos; similarly, some previously under-the-radar destinations — like the now-famous blue city in Morocco— are suddenly seeing upticks in tourism because they are so Instagram-friendly. 
 Spinks writes that ""clean lines, minimal fussiness, and functional design lead the ethos"" when it comes to the look of lean luxury hotels. Much like the NYC penthouse that was designed specifically as a backdrop for Instagram influencers, hotels are being designed with photography at top of mind. 
 And in an era where Instagram exposure can bring in enough traction that a luxe hotel in Switzerland was able to entirely eliminate its marketing budget, it's a logical point for hotels to turn their focus towards. 
 One such hotel featuring pared-down room aesthetics is Arlo Hotel, a microhotel in SoHo, NYC. Business Insider's Katie Warren visited the hotel in 2018 and found that the careful design of the 150-square-foot rooms kept them from feeling cramped. 
 ""The rooms were definitely small, but for someone who doesn't plan to spend much time in their hotel room and isn't traveling with multiple large pieces of luggage, I think it would be a fun and memorable place to stay,"" she wrote. Despite its diminutive room sizes, though, the hotel is still on the expensive side: Room rates start around $330, compared to the NYC average of $216. 
 The other end of the luxury hotel spectrum 
 That's not to say that over-the-top amenities are disappearing from hotels at large. Lean luxury hotels aren't necessarily replacing the traditional luxury hotel — instead, they're opening up a new type of aesthetic on the other end of the spectrum. 
A room in the Burj Al Arab, the world's ""first seven-star hotel.""
Annie Zheng/Business Insider
Some hotels are pivoting towards customized amenities that personalize a guest's stay, primarily in the form of hotel staff remembering guests' food, drink, and product preferences, and delivering those upon the guest's arrival.

 Others are still leaning into the traditional vision of luxury and all its over-the-top trappings. In December, Business Insider's Harrison Jacobs visited the Burj Al Arab in Dubai, a $1 billion hotel that's been described as the best hotel in the world and ""the world's first seven-star hotel."" Every room in the hotel, he wrote, is a duplex suite that comes with a butler, an extensive mini bar, fresh fruit upon arrival, and a luxe mattress that can cost up to $15,000. 
 ""I've stayed at many five-star hotels at this point,"" Jacobs wrote. ""The Burj is undoubtedly a class above them all.""","Some high-end hotels are making a move towards ""lean luxury"" with smaller room sizes and fewer amenities, Quartzy reported.

Indo Asian News Service,"An improvised explosive device (IED) went off in a Jammu and Kashmir village in Awantipora on Saturday, barely 4 km from the February 14 Pulwama attack spot where 40 CRPF troopers lost their lives.
No life was lost in the 3 a.m. explosion though that rocked the Amlar village. But window panes of houses were shattered and a large crater was created at the blast site, the police said.
The Pulwama attack cascaded into a major cross-border tension between India and Pakistan after the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) claimed the attack, and New Delhi responded with an Indian Air Force strike on the JeM’s largest terror camp within a fortnight. 
An IAF pilot was subsequently captured by Islamabad during a dogfight, but was eventually returned within two days.

Scroll Staff,"Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday refused to provide a figure for the number of Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists said to have been killed in the Indian Air Forces strikes on the outfits camp in Pakistans Balakot on February 26. The Foreign Secretary [Vijay Gokhale] didnt give a figure, she told reporters, according to The Hindu. He gave a statement. That is the Government of Indias position.
The air strikes were carried out in response to a terrorist attack on a Central Reserve Police Force convoy in Kashmirs Pulwama on February 14, which killed 40 soldiers.
Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa on Monday said that the Indian Air Force is not in a position to count the number of casualties in the cross-border strikes. He said the government would provide such a number. On Sunday, BJP chief Amit Shah claimed that over 250 terrorists were killed in the attacks.
Sitharaman also parried a question about whether India will release satellite imagery of the area which was struck. Well, I cant say it now, the defence minister said.
Sitharaman said the attack on Balakot was not a military action, but merely a pointed hit that India decided to make on Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist camps. We ensured no civilian there was affected in the attack, she said.
The defence minister added that both the National Democratic Alliance and the erstwhile United Progressive Alliance governments had given Pakistan evidence of terror training camps in its territory. However, Pakistan has not dismantled any terror camp, she added.
The defence minister also denied any connection between the air strikes and the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, ANI reported. There is no relationship between the air strike and elections, she said. It was based upon intelligence inputs on terrorist activities in Pakistan, to be unleashed against India. 
Opposition leaders, including West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Congress leader Navjot Sidhu had asked the Centre whether the air strikes were related to the General Elections, which are expected to be held in April and May. They had asked the government to share details about the strike.

Credit Walter McBride/Corbis, via Getty Images On his website, the platinum blond celebrity chef and Food Network star Guy Fieri says he has “opened over 63 restaurant around the world and at sea.” He doesn’t say how many he has closed, but the 500-seat monster, Guy’s American Kitchen &amp; Bar in Times Square, is about to become one casualty. Its signature Donkey Sauce will stop flowing after the nearby ball drop on Dec. 31. “I’m proud that for over five and a half years, Guy’s American in New York City served millions of happy guests from all over the world,” Mr. Fieri said in a statement. “And upon the restaurant’s closing, I’d like to say thank you to all of the team members and guests who made it all happen.” Mr. Fieri did not say why he was closing the restaurant, which features what he calls “American comfort food gone wild.” The demise could not be attributed to the scathing, no-stars review by Pete Wells of The New York Times because that appeared back in November 2012, shortly after the restaurant opened. The review, which went viral, noted, among other details, “how very far from awesome the Awesome Pretzel Chicken Tenders are.” The restaurant is part of the Blue Stein Group, a New York collection of restaurants that includes the Heartland Brewery chain and similar places that feature beer. Jon Bloostein, the group’s chief executive, is out of town and could not be reached for comment.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption About 7,000 candidates - many of them women - are running in the elections Iraqis are due to vote in the first parliamentary elections since the government declared victory over so-called Islamic State (IS) last year. About 7,000 candidates from rival coalition alliances are vying for seats in the 329-member assembly. Iraq is still struggling to rebuild itself after four years of war against IS, a BBC correspondent says. He says whoever wins will need to keep Iraq's fragile unity in the face of sectarian and separatist tensions. Polls across the country are due to open at 04:00 GMT and close at 15:00 GMT. Iraqis can vote for rival lists of candidates. Most are predominantly Shia or Sunni, though the Kurds have their own lists. The Shia-led government has won praise for the fight against IS militants, and security has vastly improved across the country. But many Iraqis are disillusioned by widespread government corruption and a weak economy, the BBC's Martin Patience reports. The vote also comes just days after US President Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal.

 A mass grave in the Bongende is thought to contain 100 bodies
A UN investigation says violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo last year may amount to crimes against humanity.
It says at least 500 people were killed, including families burnt alive in their homes and a two-year-old who was thrown into a septic tank.
Ethnic violence broke out when one community wanted to bury one of their traditional chiefs on another community's land.
The investigation adds that violence could flare up again at any time.
Investigators say the violence between 16 and 18 December was ""planned and executed with the support of customary chiefs"". 
Members of the Batende community attacked Banunu villages ""with extreme violence and speed, allowing little time to escape"". 
It adds that the provincial authorities in Yumbi, in Mai-Ndombe Province, in the west of the country, ""appear to have failed in their responsibility to protect the population"". 
The casualty numbers are probably a lot higher than the 535 in the report. 
In January the UN said they suspected at least 890 people had died.
They sent out an investigation team who only managed to reach three out of the four villages at the heart of the attack.
Bodies are also believed to have been thrown into the Congo River.
Voting in the 30 December presidential election was postponed until 31 March in Yumbi because of the violence. Opposition candidate Felix Tshisekedi has already been declared the winner.","People were burnt alive and a two-year-old was thrown into a septic tank, a UN investigation says.",2019-03-12T12:09:46Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}","DR Congo: Violence may be crime against humanity, UN says",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-47538851,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8CA9/production/_105990063_hi052150489.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,casualty,1
James Vincent,"FIFA is the latest casualty of Belgium’s loot box ban, with publisher EA announcing that it will stop selling FIFA points, the game’s in-game currency, in the country as of January 31st. In FIFA 19 ’s Ultimate Team mode, players can earn FIFA Points in-game or buy them with a credit or debit card. These points can then be used to purchase packs of players known as FUT packs. The quality of the players inside each pack varies, though as of FIFA 19, EA does now share the odds (or “Pack Probabilities”) of gamers finding each class of player. When Belgium introduced its loot box ban last year it defined the practice as an “illegal game of chance.” EA was defiant, and said loot boxes were not a form of gambling and that its games were “developed and implemented ethically and lawfully around the world.” Credit: EA FUT packs let gamers unlock new players using currency earned in-game or bought with real money. But in a statement this week, the company admitted defeat, saying that “after further discussions with the Belgian authorities, we have decided to stop offering FIFA Points for sale in Belgium.” Players in Belgium who previously bought FIFA points will be able to spend them or continue to earn them in-game, but they won’t be able to purchase new ones. FIFA 19 is the latest game to be affected by Belgium’s new law, with publisher Square Enix pulling a trio of titles (including Final Fantasty and Kingdom Hearts titles) earlier this year. Belgium is not a particularly large market for video games compared to the rest of Europe or North America, but its stance on loot boxes could be the tip of a legislative iceberg. Lawmakers in the UK, US, Japan, and elsewhere have all examined the issue of loot boxes in recent months, worried that young people could become addicted to these randomized rewards. Further scrutiny could yet lead to further bans, covering more than just FIFA.","FIFA players in Belgium will  no longer be able to buy FIFA points using real money as of January 31st 2019.

 Insurgents bombed the military intelligence base in Wardak province
Dozens of Afghan security personnel were killed by Taliban militants who overran a military intelligence base near Kabul, officials have confirmed.
At least 43 people were killed and 54 injured in the attack, the NDS intelligence service told the BBC.
Insurgents blew their way into the base using a car bomb before opening fire. Some reports put the toll at over 100.
It is one of the deadliest attacks on the secret service and follows a string of battlefield setbacks for the army.
Monday's attack on the National Directorate for Security (NDS) base in central Wardak province came hours before the Taliban held another round of peace talks with US diplomats in Qatar. 
Reports say the base in Maidan Shahr, about 30km (19 miles) south-west of Kabul, is a training centre for pro-government militia members.
The militants smashed their way in by detonating a captured Humvee packed with explosives. At least two gunmen then opened fire in the compound.
A second car bombing attempt was foiled by the Afghan security forces and three would-be suicide attackers were killed, the NDS told the BBC. 
The Taliban said on Monday they had attacked an Afghan special forces unit and 190 people had been killed. The group often inflates casualty figures from their attacks.
Officials initially acknowledged about 20 deaths but the latest unconfirmed reports say some 70 bodies have so far been pulled from the rubble. 
Most casualties were caused by the partial collapse of the building's roof when it was hit by the force of the Humvee blast.
The Taliban's power and reach has surged since foreign combat troops left Afghanistan in 2014.
US-led combat operations against the Taliban, the main insurgent group in Afghanistan, officially ended in that year, but some foreign troops remain in the country to provide training and assistance to Afghan forces, who do most of the fighting.
However the US has been carrying out a sustained air bombing campaign since President Trump announced a new strategy in 2017.
Image copyrightEPAImage caption
 Much of the building's roof collapsed, causing most of the casualties
The Taliban frequently carries out deadly attacks targeting military bases, soldiers and police and in recent years US and Afghan officials have withheld detailed casualty figures as they are deemed too sensitive.
But late last year, President Ashraf Ghani said more than 28,000 Afghan police and soldiers had been killed since 2015.
The Taliban emerged in the early 1990s following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, shortly before the demise of the Soviet Union.
The militants went on to rule Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, until they were driven from power by US-led troops following the 9/11 attacks, which the US blamed on al-Qaeda militants who were hosted by the Taliban.
In November, Russia hosted a landmark international meeting on Afghanistan in Moscow aimed at kick-starting peace talks.

ABC News,"Florida Rep. Brian Mast was enjoying a peaceful day at the pool with his kids last week, legally carrying his concealed pistol, when a scary thought struck him. ""I'm looking at all the balconies and thinking of [the massacre] in Las Vegas. I was sitting there with my conceal carry 9mm Glock, and thinking that I would be a sitting duck, and my children would be sitting ducks, for anybody that was sitting up on one of those balconies, and had barricaded themselves in a room, and were ready to go out there, and induce that kind of carnage,"" he told ABC News' ""Powerhouse Politics"" podcast. That vulnerable moment triggered him to ask President Donald Trump to push the pause button on certain gun sales, Mast said. ""Let’s pause on selling these weapons that have been used in these incidents, just like the travel ban,"" he said. ""We’re going to pause 30, 60, 90 days and let’s see who has access. Let’s present some solutions."" Mast explained to hosts Jonathan Karl and Rick Klein, he wants to take Trump's model of a travel ban and layer it on a policy of pausing sales of assault rifles until a fail-safe system is put in place to prevent a mass shooter from striking again. Seventeen people were killed on Valentine's Day when suspect Nikolas Cruz opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Already, Mast, who has only been in Congress for a year, is feeling the heat from his proposed pause, but said that surprisingly, he's not heard a word from the NRA, who supported his election. ""I haven’t heard from the NRA, but I don’t have to hear from them to know we are at odds on this,"" he said. Rep. Brian Mast (R-FL) salutes as he arrives for a town hall meeting at the Havert L. Fenn Center, Feb. 24, 2017, in Fort Pierce, Fla. Mast worked as a bomb disposal expert in the U.S. Army under the elite Joint Special Operations Command in Afghanistan. But his life changed in an instant when he lost both legs to an improvised explosive device. He earned the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart among other honors, but still wanted to serve away from the battlefield. His experience on the frontlines motivates his call for a temporary ban, he said, explaining that he carried a weapon similar to an AR-15 and has witnessed the damage delivered by a bullet from a high-powered rifle. ""The U.S. Army said, 'This is the best tool that we can give you to kill our enemies. That’s the best thing we can give you right now to put in your hands in the most dangerous country on the face of the Earth.' That tool that they gave me is not suited for unfettered access to every person because they are 18 years or older. We are not a safer society because of that,"" Mast said. He also weighed in on Trump's plan to arm teachers, saying it has serious drawbacks. ""Teachers are people, too,"" he said. ""They have problems at home and work. We have to be very careful about what we put in a teacher’s hands, too. What if they left a firearm laying around?"" But the loss of one person in particular has made Mast determined to find the middle ground, he said. He attended the funeral of Aaron Feis, his friend who was killed saving students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14. Mast is not worried about becoming a political casualty because of his controversial stand, he said. ""I never worried about becoming a casualty because it was in the effort of saving lives,"" he said. ""That was my job as a bomb technician. If anyone thinks I’m going to worry about being some political casualty, it’s going to be the last thing on my mind. ""I try to do what’s right.""","""I'm not worried about being a political casualty,"" Rep.

THOMAS GIBBONS-NEFF and JULIAN E. BARNES,"Peace is not easy; it needs courage and bilateral honor, Mr. Ghani said.
European officials have previously said they would rapidly pull their forces from Afghanistan if the American military was shorn too small to provide logistic support. American officials said enough troops would remain even if they were cut to 7,000 to continue the European training mission as outlined in the Pentagons plan.
In some respects, the focus on counterterrorism missions in Afghanistan is an endorsement of a plan by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the Obama administration debated its own war strategy in 2009. Mr. Bidens proposal was ultimately rejected in favor of a counterinsurgency plan, which called for training local forces and a surge of American troops, as pushed by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who was then the top commander in Afghanistan.
Taliban negotiators deeply oppose the proposal for American counterterrorism troops to remain in Afghanistan for up to five years, and officials were unsure if a shorter period of time would be accepted by the militants rank and file.
Scaling back the training mission could leave the beleaguered Afghan military not just vulnerable to attacks, but at risk of fracturing. In January, Mr. Ghani announced that more than 45,000 Afghan troops had died since 2014; Pentagon officials have called their casualty numbers unsustainable.
Despite pouring billions of dollars into the Afghan military for more than a decade, Pentagon audits show that a renewed effort to modernize the fledgling Afghan Air Force will most likely not be self-sufficient until the mid-2030s.
Speaking to lawmakers in December, the incoming commander for American troops in the Middle East, Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., said that Afghan forces could not sustain themselves without American and NATO support.","U.S. forces would all but end their decade-long focus on training Afghan troops under the plan, which is being discussed in talks with the Taliban and was devised in part to appeal to President Trump.",2019-02-28T19:13:16Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Under Peace Plan, U.S. Military Would Exit Afghanistan Within Five Years",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/us/politics/afghanistan-military-withdrawal.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/27/us/00dc-troops/00dc-troops-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,casualty,1
ROD NORDLAND,"Anthony Cordesman, an official in the Defense Department during the final years of the Vietnam War, recently wrote a paper detailing the parallels between the two wars. In an interview, Mr. Cordesman, now a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, recalled how late in the Vietnam War we concealed the casualty rates, the absentee rates, the ghost soldier rates, just as the American military and the government of President Ashraf Ghani are doing now.
Just as in Vietnam, under the shell of top leadership there were many deep divisions, Mr. Cordesman said. In Afghanistan, you have a country of power brokers. A lot of the underlying economy is extremely weak, buoyed up by war and aid. And as thats reduced, you find less and less reason for the economy and political structure to hold together.
In some ways, Afghanistan is actually in worse shape than South Vietnam was when the American military left in 1973; the country fell to the Communists in 1975. In Afghanistan, the only major hard currency earner is the narcotics sector, other than war and aid, Mr. Cordesman said. Vietnam, in contrast, had a more diverse economy. Even the Afghan military units are weaker. There were some very good units in Vietnam, he said.
The British historian Max Hastings, author of the recent book Vietnam, an Epic Tragedy 1945-1975, said he sees many similarities between Vietnam and Afghanistan. Western governments and commanders still dont seem to have got the message that winning firefights is meaningless unless we can also achieve a real cultural, social and political engagement with local societies, he said. 
For most people in Afghanistan, as in Vietnam, daily life represents an endless series of accommodations, compromises and judgments about who is likely to win, Mr. Hastings said. Most of them today put their money on the Taliban not necessarily because they like them, but because they seem likely to be around longer than us.",Many experts worry that the U.S. is repeating the mistakes of Vietnam in Afghanistan.,2019-02-02T19:46:58Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",news analysis: Is This the Right Way to End a War?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/sunday-review/war-vietnam-afghanistan-withdrawal.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/03/opinion/sunday/03nordland/03nordland-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,casualty,1
CHARLIE WARZEL,"On Friday, a man in his late 20s strapped on a helmet camera, loaded his car with weapons, drove to a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand and began shooting at anyone who came into his line of vision. He broadcast the act of mass terror live for the world to watch on social media.
Forty-nine people were killed in the attack, which occurred at two different mosques in the city.
A 17-minute video of a portion of the attack, which leapt across the internet faster than social media censors could remove it, is one of the most disturbing, high-definition records of a mass casualty attack of the digital age a grotesque first-person-shooter-like record of mans capacity for inhumanity. 
Videos of attacks are designed to amplify the terror, of course. But what makes this atrocity an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence, as Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described it, is both the methodical nature in which the massacre was conducted and how it was apparently engineered for maximum virality.
Though platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube scrambled to take down the recording and an accompanying manifesto from the gunman, they were no match for the speed of their users; new artificial-intelligence tools created to scrub such platforms of terrorist content could not defeat human cunning and impulse to gawk. In minutes, the video was downloaded and mirrored onto additional platforms where it ricocheted around the globe.

News18.com,"New Delhi: One hundred and two tea garden workers in Assam have died after consuming toxic liquor, while 200 others have been hospitalised. The incident took place on Thursday evening when the workers at Salmara tea garden had consumed the liquor. The deaths come less than two weeks after more than 100 people died from drinking tainted alcohol in Uttarkhand and Uttar Pradesh.
The police have so far arrested 12 people, including the owners of the illegal country-made liquor factory, in Jugibaari area near the garden. 
 ""Every 10 minutes we are getting reports of casualties from different places. So far about 200 people are in hospital with many of them critical,"" Assam Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told Reuters via telephone. 
""Doctors from nearby districts and other medical colleges have been rushed in to deal with the crisis,"" said Sarma, after visiting patients at Jorhat, located some 300 kilometres east of the state's financial hub, Guwahati.The government has ordered probe. Two excise officials of Salmara area have been suspended for neglect.
We will investigate the incident. The guilty wont be spared, said Golaghat Deputy Commissioner, Dhiren Hazarika while speaking to News 18 Assam Northeast.
Meanwhile, local resident, Prabin Das, who heads a committee demanding prohibition of liquor was allegedly attacked by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) activists in Golaghat when he blamed the state excise department for its failure in checking the manufacture of spurious liquor.
It all happens because of a nexus between the excise department and illicit liquor manufacturers, said Das.
On the other hand, opposition Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) president has demanded adequate compensation for the families of the victims.
The death tolls from the two recent incidents, however, are believed to be the deadliest since a similar case killed 172 in West Bengal in 2011.
Dilip Rajbnonshi, a doctor at the government hospital in Golaghat, located some 40 kilometres southwest of Jorhat said the deaths were due to ""spurious country liquor"".
A number of women are among the casualties. Many of those that drank the liquor were tea plantation workers who had just received their weekly wages, according to another state government official.","Death Toll in Assam Hooch Tragedy Touches 94, Health Minister Says New Casualty Every 10 Minutes News18 The police have so far arrested 12 people, including the owners of the illegal country-made liquor factory, in Jugibaari area near the garden.

Michael Hardy,"In the DC Comics universe, Metropolis is the fictional mega-city where Clark Kent works as a reporter for The Daily Planet and, in his spare time, fights crime as Superman. In the real world, Metropolis is a small town of about 6,500 people in southern Illinois, just across the Ohio River from Kentucky. The histories of the real and imaginary towns converged in 1972, when DC Comics officially declared Metropolis, Illinois the “Home of Superman” and announced plans to build a $50 million “Amazing World of Superman” theme park—complete with a 200-foot-tall statue of the Man of Steel. The theme park was never built, a casualty of the 1973 OPEC oil embargo, which made road trips prohibitively expensive for most Americans. Instead, the Illinois town—which was founded in 1839, nearly a century before Action Comics #1 introduced the world to the man from Krypton—capitalized on its Superman connection by turning itself into a tourism destination for comic book fans. The town is dotted with Superman-related attractions, including a 15-foot-high bronze Superman statue, a Lois Lane statue, and the Super Museum and Gift Store, which claims to own versions of “virtually every Superman toy ever produced.” The town newspaper is even called The Metropolis Planet. The centerpiece of the town’s Superman tourism is the annual Superman Celebration, which draws several thousand comic book fans each year to Metropolis for four days of costume contests, movie screenings, and celebrity appearances. The festival celebrated its 40th anniversary earlier this month. “It feels like a small-town carnival,” says Los Angeles–based photographer Lisa Guerriero, who has attended the festival twice. “They have a wrestling match; they have Superboy and Supergirl contests for the kids.” Guerriero says the festival is a linchpin of the local economy, which has been in decline ever since the closure of the Kentucky coal and uranium mines that once employed many of its residents. Except for the comic book connection, Metropolis is similar to many other small Midwestern towns hit hard by deindustrialization: Although the town has a grocery store, residents must cross the Ohio River into Kentucky to see a doctor or to do their other shopping. “There was a wave of people who left, but there are also people who stay,” she says. “I do a lot of photography in small towns in the Midwest, and what always interests me is how they survive.” On her visits to the festival, Guerriero met many of the world’s most hardcore Superman fans. One of them, a mailman from Carbondale, Illinois, said he’s been making an annual pilgrimage to Metropolis for 30 years. “He told me this was probably the last year,” the photographer says. “He’s 65 and doesn’t think it’s appropriate to dress up as Superman anymore.”","For the past 40 years, the small Illinois town of Metropolis has hosted the Superman Celebration.",2018-07-03T14:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",Superman's Metropolis is Real—It's a Small Town in Illinois,https://www.wired.com/story/superman-celebration-metropolis-illinois/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5b3567294263671c40ab7f7d/191:100/pass/Superman_Guerriero_1.jpg,wired,Wired,casualty,1
Yasmeen Serhan,"If the ever-stalling Brexit negotiations range in character from bewildering to boring, there was at least something familiar about them this week. To wit, the idea that a border wall could be coming, and that someone else was going to pay for it. It wasn’t President Trump offering his take on the U.K.’s impending exit from the EU. Rather, it was British lawmaker Kate Hoey, stating her own vision for what should happen if a hard border returned between Ireland (part of the EU) and Northern Ireland (part of the U.K.). A vocal Brexit supporter, the Labour party lawmaker argued Monday that anything resembling a physical barrier on what will become the only land border between the U.K. and the EU was unnecessary, and that if the EU wanted one, it would have to put it up alone. “We’re not the ones who’re going to be putting up the physical border,” Hoey told BBC Radio 4. “If this ends up with a no deal, we won’t be putting up the border—they’ll have to pay for it because it doesn’t need to happen.” Hoey’s comments came in response to the Irish government’s recent insistence that it would not assent to Brexit talks moving on to phase two of the negotiations, unless the U.K. government guaranteed in writing that no hard border would return between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Such a border, which could involve customs checks and controls, would significantly change the boundary that exists today, namely by rendering it visible. Currently, it’s only by noticing subtle changes in the color of road signs or the shift in speed limit metrics that a traveler can tell where one country ends and the other begins. A hard border would change that. And while Hoey’s opposition to such a change is shared on both sides of the Brexit negotiating table, her proposal that they therefore should simply not impose one is not—in part because it fails to recognize the circumstances that could make a stronger border necessary in the first place. In addition to leaving the EU, the U.K. has also opted to leave the bloc’s single market and customs union —membership to each of which has allowed goods and services to travel between the U.K. and the rest of its member states tariff-free. Absent a trade deal (which could take years to negotiate) or some sort of transition period, the U.K. will be subject to tariffs like any other country outside the single market and customs union once it leaves the EU in March 2019. This would make at least a customs border on the island of Ireland necessary from that point forward. It’s not just EU law that mandates this. As a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), whose rules the U.K. will fall under once it leaves the EU, the U.K. will be required to impose its own customs checks. “The idea that you can just not have a border with the EU is mind-bogglingly ill informed,” Edward Burke, an assistant professor in international relations at the University of Nottingham, told me. “The WTO is really unyielding on this point that for international trade to work, every state needs to essentially police its borders from a customs point of view. … It’s non-negotiable.” Both the U.K. and the EU have stressed the importance of finding a “flexible and imaginative,” solution to the Irish border issue, with some proposing that Northern Ireland be permitted to independently remain within the bloc’s single market and customs union—a special status that would effectively resolve the U.K.-EU land border issue and leave trade and freedom of movement within the island of Ireland largely unaffected. But it’s a solution that many hardline Brexiteers, including the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), have rejected. “They simply will not entertain at this point any potential exceptions, as complicated or as difficult but ultimately economically beneficial as they are,” Burke said of the DUP, which is currently propping up U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative government in London. He noted that the party’s opposition to this is more political than economic, stemming from “visceral fears that go back to the idea that once you detach Northern Ireland in a more significant way from the rest of the U.K. in how it conducts international trade agreements [and] how it relates to the EU, that it’s essentially a political backdoor then for future conversations about Irish unity.” The reason for that largely has to do with Irish and Northern Irish history, dating back to the decades-long period of sectarian fighting from the 1960s through much of the 1990s known as the Troubles. During this period, Unionists (who are represented by parties like the DUP) advocated for Northern Ireland to remain part of the U.K., while Republicans (who are now largely represented by parties like DUP’s opposition, Sinn Féin) advocated for the North to join the Republic of Ireland. While the conflict ended with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, the underlying sensitivities are still in place. And on the border, it was the EU that mitigated them; Northern Ireland remained part of the U.K., satisfying Unionists, while being deeply integrated with the Republic of Ireland, as the Republicans wanted. Katy Hayward, a political sociologist at Queen’s University Belfast, told me the effect is already visible in communities along the border, noting in her research that Brexit’s impact has already been “polarizing” for those living on either side. “It’s still a very important dividing line distinguishing between people’s political preferences,” Hayward told me in October, adding that “the legacy of conflict and the legacy of complex British-Irish relations—they’re all intertwined in the border.” But it’s Northern Ireland that stands to be the most vulnerable if a hard border is reimposed. While much of the country’s commerce relies on the U.K., a significant amount also relies on the Republic of Ireland, which accounts for 34 percent of its trade. More than half of its exports go to the EU overall. “The economics point in one direction, and the politics point in the opposite direction,” Professor Richard G. Whitman, an associate fellow with the Europe Programme at Chatham House, told me. “The problem for the DUP is they’re sort of doing the splits on that, because obviously anything that leads to a significant downturn in Northern Ireland’s economy is obviously going to hit their supporters and potentially hit them at the ballot box. On the other hand, you’re butting up against core Unionist principles in terms of the fact that Northern Ireland should not be in any way different from the mainland.” Northern Ireland’s precarious political situation hasn’t helped, either. Though the DUP currently enjoys a powerful role within the U.K. government, Northern Ireland hasn’t had a government in nearly a year. Since the power-sharing government between the DUP and Sinn Féin collapsed in January, Belfast has been relegated to being a political observer to Brexit negotiations and, by extension, its fate outside the EU. “The interests of Northern Ireland have been outsourced to Dublin and to London,” Whitman said. “They are in a way bystanders at the moment to what Dublin and to what London are suggesting would be in the best interest of Northern Ireland, and that’s probably not a good thing for Northern Ireland.” “The U.K. is going off on its own trajectory and its economic interests—the economic interest of London—are not the same as those of Northern Ireland in many ways,” Hayward said, adding: “If Ireland is turning its face away from Britain and trying to secure its own interests, then where does this leave Northern Ireland? It almost feels like sort of falling in between the cracks—between Britain and the Republic of Ireland. So this is a deep concern.” With negotiations progressing on the main sticking points about the separation, the Irish border remains the most uncertain issue hanging over negotiations. Whether talks will move on to the next phase of negotiations will depend on what EU leaders decide when they convene for the European Council meeting next month—a decision that will no doubt be informed by Dublin. “If the U.K. offer is unacceptable for Ireland, it will also be unacceptable for the EU,” European Council President Donald Tusk said Friday. “This is why the key to the U.K.’s future lies—in some ways—in Dublin, at least as long as Brexit negotiations continue.”","With no government in Belfast and the border issue unresolved, anxiety grows about the country’s future.",2017-12-01T19:14:43Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",Northern Ireland Could Be Brexit's Biggest Casualty,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/12/northern-ireland-is-falling-between-the-cracks/546875/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/11/RTSHRHZ/facebook.jpg?1511880319,,Theatlantic.com,casualty,1

Tom McKay,"A “strong magnitude 7.1 earthquake” struck the southern coast of Peru on Sunday morning, leaving at least one dead, several missing, and dozens injured, CNBC reported. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake struck roughly 22.4 miles (36 kilometers) offshore centered about 25 miles (40 km) into the Pacific Ocean from the town of Acari. CNBC reported that local officials said one man was killed by a rock in Yauca. Beyond that, there were some indications that the damage may not be as grim as originally reported. Per the BBC, Health Minister Abel Salinas disputed reports that 17 miners had gone missing inside a collapsed shaft. Reports of another death in Bella Union were also disputed by local officials. Per CNN, the National Civil Defense Institute reported at least 65 additional injuries “in the cities of Arequipa, Ica and Ayacucho.” The casualty count is likely to rise as emergency personnel continue to look through rubble. Though the U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center warned that a wall of water could come crashing onto the shoreline, fortunately no such tsunami actually occurred and the center later advised that the threat had passed. Earthquakes of magnitude 7 and higher are considered major events with the possibility of serious damage or casualties; only an estimated 20 or so occur each year. A magnitude 8.0 quake in 2007 off the central coast of Peru was estimated to have killed well over 500 people and destroyed tens of thousands of buildings. Earthquakes are fairly common in Peru due to its proximity to massive fault lines, as the Christian Science Monitor noted in 2013: Peru is located on the “Ring of Fire,” the belt of earthquakes and volcanoes surrounding the Pacific Ocean. All along its western coast, the South American plate is colliding with the Nazca plate, forcing the heavier ocean crust down into the Earth’s mantle. The collision of the plates is like a slow-motion car wreck. They’re colliding at only 3 inches per year, but that’s enough to cause frequent earthquakes—and build the Andes Mountains. The tectonically active region along the coast of South America, known to geologists as the South American arc, is more than 4,000 miles long, from just below the southern tip of Chile to just off the coast of Panama. Despite the high risk throughout Peru, though, the situation with regards to preparation for seismic events (particularly in construction and building standards) is not so good.

Jess Joho,"At this point we're emotionally prepared to watch nearly every person die in Game of Thrones Season 8. But there's probably a far worse casualty of winter: the dragons. Because even if they somehow survive the Great War to come, there's a high chance they'll need to be killed anyway.
I deliver this theory with an extremely heavy heart. Dragons are my favorite characters on the show. The concept of having a weapon of mass destruction for a pet is so awesome that I regularly dress my dog up in a custom-made Etsy Drogon costume. Last season, I threatened to burn everyone alive if Drogon died. I wrote a whole guide on how to cope with Viserion's death. If I had it my way, Gendry would be forging some rad Valyrian steel armor for Daenerys' reptile babies as we speak.
But it's increasingly looking as if the dragons will, like the White Walkers, need to be wiped out by the end of this song of ice and fire.
First, though, let's go over some basic facts about the three dragons we know, and what we can learn about the other dragons we never met from Game of Thrones history. We will almost certainly be getting some dragon on dragon violence in Season 8, which last happened during the Dance with Dragons, the historic Targaryen civil war that began the extinction of these magical creatures.
Size matters
In the dragon versus dragon battles detailed in the recently released Targaryen history book Fire and Blood, it's clear size matters.
Who's a big boy?!
Image: hbo
As we know, Drogon is by far the biggest of Daenerys's three dragons, while Viserion was always the smallest. In the books, he's also the clumsiest, and the one nicest to people who aren't his mom (hello foreshadowing). In Season 7, Drogon's comparable to a Boeing 747 plane, Game of Thrones showrunners say. Meanwhile Viserion is roughly three times smaller, according to fan calculations. 
Dragons also famously never stop growing as long as they live, but that's not true for Viserion, who is now dead. But as of Season 8, that probably won't matter too much, since Rhaegal and Drogon won't have much time to keep growing even if their undead brother doesn't at all.
SEE ALSO: Everything to remember from 'Game of Thrones' Season 1
There's speculation as to why Drogon is bigger, which will be relevant for when we start talking about the possibility of other dragons in the world. For one, Drogon's egg was always the biggest. For another, it's also believed that caging dragons stunts their growth, and Daenerys did just that to Viserion and Rhaegal in Season 4, while Drogon got to roam around Old Valyria.
That matters because both Targaryens and maesters believe dragon size is also affected by their proximity to volcanoes known as the Fourteen Flames along the Valyrian peninsula. Drogon probably got a boost from his time in the old country, and all three of them got a boost while on Dragonstone.
Something that hasn't come up in the show, though, is that Winterfell is actually built on top of mysterious hot springs no one can explain. Northern legends speak of the heat coming from a dragon hidden beneath the crypts of Winterfell. Meanwhile maesters theorize the hot springs are connected to the Fourteen Flames.
So maybe spending time in Winterfell will help our two living dragons grow even stronger. Or maybe they'll find another, more ancient dragon.
What we can predict about the impending dragon battles
Our favorite fan speculation about how the dragon-on-dragon violence will shake out in Season 8 is that in a parallel to the Season 1 scene when Khal Drogo kills Viserys the dragons with their namesakes will do the same. That means big boy Drogon will take down Viserion.
In addition, Targaryen history proves that size isn't everything.
Speed sometimes outmatched sheer size in previous dragon vs. dragon showdowns. Age also played a role, with smaller, swifter, younger dragons besting bigger, slower, and much older dragons. But age doesn't matter for our three dragon siblings, who hatched at the same time.
Another very important factor is the dragon's relationship with his/her dragonrider. The more time they have to form a strong bond, the more they move as one. So that presents an interesting problem for our three presumed dragonriders in Season 8.
Daenerys has spent the most time with her mount, and is the only one who's waged battle with him. If as we all suspect Jon rides Rhaegal (the dragon named after his father), he'll have some serious catching up to do to keep up with the other two. Because the Night King arguably has the strongest psychic relationship to the creatures he raises from the dead.
What we know about ice dragons, and what Viserion is now
Season 6 showed that Dany shared a telepathic connection with her three babies. But a White Walker's control over its resurrected wights is beyond telepathic it's a puppet master controlling a puppet. Also that likely means any connection Dany had with Viserion was completely severed when the Night King touched him.
There was some debate among fans whether Viserion was a wight dragon (a zombie-like mindless dead creature completely controlled by its master), or a White Walker dragon (a living, autonomous being transformed into a White Walker like Craster's baby in Season 4). We're betting on the former. Which is worse, since he won't remember mommy Dany.
Still, Viserion is in completely unknown territory. There are northern legends about ice dragons, but they are a totally different species than Daenerys' Valyrian dragons. They are literally made of ice (the opposite of Valyrian dragons, which are ""fire made flesh""), breathing ice instead of fire.
Viserion's biology and species didn't change after he was resurrected, but there are no records of what happens when a fire dragon's magic is mixed with a White Walker's ice magic. But according to io9, the Season 7 finale's leaked script clarifies that Viserion is breathing blue flames at the Wall, not ice (making him not a real ice dragon as defined by George R. R. Martin).
Valyrian dragons are far from the only species of dragons
That brings up another fun fact we should remember about the dragons in the Game of Thrones universe: Valyrian dragons were far from the first or only types of dragons. 
Actually, some maesters believe that the ""bloodmages of Valyria used wyvern stock to create dragons"" (wyvern are a type of non-fire breathing lizard). So they're not technically even real dragons, but hybrids. The Valyrians might've tried to create a tamable version of true dragons from the wild.
There's rumor of a different, more ancient species of dragon still living in Asshai by the Shadow, too (which is where Melisandre is from). In the World of Ice and Fire companion book, it's explained that:
There were dragons in Westeros, once, long before the Targaryens came, as our own legends and histories tell us. If dragons did first spring from the Fourteen Flames, they must have been spread across much of the known world before they were tamed. And, in fact, there is evidence for this, as dragon bones have been found as far north as Ib, and even in the jungles of Sothoryos. But the Valyrians harnessed and subjugated them as no one else could.
So it's highly possible there were dragons in Westeros during the Long Night, when the White Walkers first invaded thousands of years ago (which happened before the Valyrian empire). We don't know what happened to all those dragons maybe they were eliminated by the White Walkers, who would not take kindly to fire-breathing weapons of mass destruction.
Maybe this isn't the first dragon the Night King ever rode ...
Image: hbo
There's even evidence that the dragons from Asshai were used to build the Five Forts, a very similar structure to Westeros' Wall made out of dragonglass and built after the Long Night. So it sounds like dragons played some sort of role last time the White Walkers came.
How a new dragon might rise in Season 8
We've already mentioned in passing a few ways that unknown dragons could emerge in Season 8. Maybe one's been hiding out in the crypts of Winterfell. Maybe another native Westerosi dragon has been holed up elsewhere for all this time, since dragons live very, very long. Maybe Melisandre will come back from her trip in Season 7 with a dragon from Asshai.
There's lots of ice dragon imagery from the Wall in the books.
Image: hbo
In a 1999 interview, George R. R. Martin not only stated that there were once dragons everywhere, but also that: 
""There are no more dragons known to exist ... but this is a medieval period, and large parts of the world are still terra incognita, so there are always tales of dragon sightings in far off mysterious places. The maesters tend to discount those.""
There are even other hints that Dany and/or Jon could summon a new dragon, because in the books Melisandre often talks of visions of a dragon rising from stone.
There's a lot of speculation about what that actually means. She thinks it's waking the dragon statues on Dragonstone. But fans speculate it could be an ice dragon from the Wall. Regardless, Dany and Jon's conversation in the Season 7 finale about her being barren is a huge indication that they'll have a baby, whether human or reptilian. 
Why the dragons need to die
But here comes the sad part. Because if we look at the history and the themes of Game of Thrones, it becomes clear that all dragons must die.
George R. R. Martin is all about showing how history repeats itself, even when (actually especially when) people have forgotten that history. This is the second time the White Walkers have risen. Daenerys is the second Targaryen with three dragons who vowed to conquer Westeros. 
We all know this isn't going to work out for either of them.
Image: hbo
Remember that, at the beginning of this whole story, people kept saying that magic died a long time ago. They mention the lack of White Walkers and dragons as evidence that magic is gone forever and, according to most maesters, that's a good thing. If history is to repeat itself now though if peace is truly to be restored to the world by the end of the series then that means magical beings who wreak havoc and destruction need to be terminated.
And the dragons can be just as devastatingly destructive as the White Walkers.
There's also another key piece of evidence that the dragons will need to die along with the White Walkers by the end of Season 8. And it's to do with the irregular seasons that we've all accepted as just a normal part of the Game of Thrones universe.
Many times, George R. R. Martin has stated that the reason behind the irregular seasons is magical in nature, not scientific (as some have speculated). He also said that, by the end of the story, we would get an explanation for the irregular seasonal patterns. And presumably, that will involve learning how to fix it.
Songs of ice and fire have a tendency to end tragically in 'Game of Thrones.'
Image: hbo
Despite the awe they inspire, magical beings like the dragons and White Walkers are unnatural. As we mentioned, the Valyrian dragons were unholy experiments made from blood magic. The White Walkers defy the natural cycle of death and life. 
The magical beings associated with changing temperatures and weather patterns in this song of ice and fire are: White Walkers (who literally bring winter with them) and dragons (who literally have fire-made flesh and are tied to volcanic eruptions like the Doom of Valyria). 
Don't believe us? Consider that in the Season 6 reveal scene of how the White Walkers were created, the Children of the Forest tie a man to a weirwood tree. Thousands of years later, Bran revisits that same weirwood tree in a vision, and it's the White Walker's home base now covered in snow.
Ultimately, it's hard to believe it's just a coincidence that, at the same time that the White Walkers return from several centuries of slumber, the first dragons are also born into the world. And George R. R. Martin famously promised the series would have a ""bittersweet"" ending.
What could be more bittersweet than the realization that to save the world, magic must die. And that the story we've watched unfold for eight seasons is about restoring natural order to a magical imbalance between ice (the White Walkers) and fire (dragons and the Lord of Light) that began ages ago.
This isn't just the song of ice and fire coming together. It's the song's final notes.","At this point we're emotionally prepared to watch nearly every person die in Game of Thrones Season 8.

"USA TODAY, Aamer Madhani, USA TODAY","A Toronto police official says the man accused of driving a rental van into a crowd of pedestrians in Toronto posted a ""cryptic"" Facebook message minutes before the attack. (April 24) AP A local Toronto muslim group holds up signs for love and courage at a makeshift memorial on Yonge St. on April 24, 2018 in Toronto. A suspect identified as Alek Minassian, 25, is in custody after a driver in a white rental van drove into multiple pedestrians, killing 10 and injuring more than a dozen others. (Photo: Cole Burston, Getty Images) TORONTO — This city is reeling in the aftermath of this week’s van attack that killed 10 and injured 14 more, but its residents refuse to be broken. The Queen City began edging back to normal Wednesday as police reopened the roughly 16-block stretch of Yonge Street where suspect Alek Minassian allegedly mounted a sidewalk in a white rental van and plowed down pedestrians. Marie Lewis, 53, who lives near the crime scene, made the sign of the cross as she walked by the growing makeshift memorial near the corner where the suspect began the attack. Lewis said she has not shed her last tear over the tragedy, but she refuses to let the incident instill fear. “My Toronto is a beautiful city,” said Lewis, who moved to Canada’s biggest metropolis from Newfoundland at 17 and never left. “I will still do the things I’ve always done. I will feel safe walking on my streets and enjoy my life. If you live by fear and stay at home, you can die at home.” Ontario premier Kathleen Wynne noted that the “unnatural calm” along Yonge Street in recent days had been an eerie and “stark reminder of violence” cutting through the city. This portion of Yonge Street — one of the busiest streets in Toronto — includes a mile-long stretch of Asian restaurants, grocery stores and businesses and is seen as a second downtown for the city. At one end of the crime scene sits Mel Lastman Square — a public space named after the founder of Bad Boy Furniture who went on to serve 24 years as mayor — that’s the site of festivals, city-sponsored concerts and an ice rink in the winter. “The lives of the families and friends of the victims are changed forever,” Wynne said. “But our collective job now is to find a way to grieve, to acknowledge that pain and stand with those who have lost so much — and then to make sure that the life of this vibrant, good city and province goes on.” More: Incel: What it is and why Alek Minassian praised Elliot Rodger More: Toronto van attack suspect Alek Minassian's Facebook account praised mass killer More: After Toronto van attack, Canadians mourn and ask simple question: Why? To that end, the city’s sports fans will also get a much-needed diversion on Wednesday evening in one of the most important nights in Toronto history for its big league teams. The Maple Leafs face the Boston Bruins in Game 7 of the NHL playoffs. The Raptors are in a pivotal Game 5 against the Washington Wizards. And Toronto FC soccer club faces Chivas Guadalajara in the final leg of the CONCACAF Champions League final. A watch party was scheduled so fans can keep tabs on all three teams outside the Air Canada Centre, the Maple Leafs home rink. While authorities say they’ve uncovered no evidence that the attack was connected to international terrorism, police said security will be tight around the party. The suspect, who police say posted a cryptic note on Facebook praising a misogynistic killer shortly before the incident, has been charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder. Canadian authorities say it will be some time before they officially identify the 10 killed in the van attack, but families and friends of a few of the victims have confirmed their loved ones were among the dead. The family of Dorothy Sewell, 80, described her as a fantastic grandmother who was passionate about her Toronto sports teams. Anne-Marie D’Amico, a 30-year-old Toronto woman, was killed near the Yonge Street headquarters of the investment company where she worked, her family said. “We want everyone to know that she embodied the definition of altruism,” D’Amico said. “After this week’s horror, we hope that in this time, people fight with the same altruism rather than with anger and hatred.” The dead also represented the city’s international mosaic — two victims were South Korean students studying in the city, according to the South Korean government. One man killed was a Jordanian man, Munir Abdu Habib Al-Najjar, according to Jordanian media reports. Another victim identified Wednesday was Renuka Amarasinghe, an immigrant from Sri Lanka who worked for the Toronto District School Board, according to the board’s trustee Tiffany Ford. Nelumi Manikku, 24, a fellow Sri Lankan whose family knew Amarasinghe, said the incident has been devastating for the city’s tight-knit Sri Lankan and Buddhist community. Amarasinghe attended Toronto Mahavihara Buddhist Centre and was the mother of a 7-year-old boy, Diyon. Manikku, who dropped flowers at the memorial to honor Amarasinghe, said that while the incident shook her she doesn’t want to be overwhelmed by fear. Instead, she is making a small change to her daily life. “After this, I’ve decided I’m no longer going to walk around with my ear phones on,” said Manikku, who like many big city dwellers used earbuds to help her block out the big city noise. “One of those sounds can be what saves your life."" As heartbreaking as this week has been for the city, some Toronto residents said that there is also an awareness that the tragedy was a rare moment of evil in a city that has a relatively low violent-crime rate. “Every time you drive down the street, you’re trusting the guy coming the other way not to come in your lane,” Toronto resident Brian Hull said. “We live in a trusting society. We have to have faith.” Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2vQsC8c",Canada's biggest city is edging back to normalcy following the most-deadly mass casualty incident it has endured in decades.,2018-04-25T21:18:10Z,"{'id': 'usa-today', 'name': 'USA Today'}","'My Toronto is a beautiful city': After van attack, residents refuse to be deterred by fear",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/04/25/toronto-van-attack-city-fear/550647002/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=amp&utm_campaign=speakable,https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/581841430c6ceab62aad91a49b47b140be4e887e/c=0-264-5184-3193&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2018/04/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636601917069437396-GTY-950808436.jpg,usa-today,USA Today,casualty,1

Alison Foreman,"The days of beaming your favorite Netflix show to your Apple TV are officially over. 
Netflix suddenly and unceremoniously stopped supporting AirPlay capability, quietly informing users accustomed to the wireless streaming feature of the change via service support page. 
AirPlay is no longer supported for use with Netflix due to technical limitations, the announcement read, offering up few additional details. 
Image: netflix
Some users have interpreted Netflix's unexpected parting of the ways with AirPlay as a not-so-subtle dig between competitors. Apple just recently announced a major play for streaming service dominance with Apple TV+ and prior to that ""technical limitations"" announcement, Netflix had been consistently compatible with AirPlay, first beginning in 2013.
SEE ALSO: Hollywood elite line up to support Apple TV+ in sleek originals promo
In a statement via The Verge, Netflix expanded upon the decision, saying it was ""not a business competition play,"" but rather a casualty of image quality control:
""We want to make sure our members have a great Netflix experience on any device they use. With AirPlay support rolling out to third-party devices, there isnt a way for us to distinguish between devices (what is an Apple TV vs. what isnt) or certify these experiences. Therefore, we have decided to discontinue Netflix AirPlay support to ensure our standard of quality for viewing is being met.
At present, it does not appear as if Netflix has any plans to rectify the issue at hand.

TAIMOOR SHAH and FAHIM ABED,"Mira Jan Akka, a tribal elder from Sangin, gave a similar narrative, saying that the Taliban had targeted three outposts belonging to army, police and pro-government militia members, all recently installed after a military operation in the area. All three posts were wiped out by the Taliban, none of the forces in them survived, he said.
We do not know the exact casualty figures, because the government is not sharing information, Mr. Akka added.
Sangin was bitterly fought over by the Taliban when British forces held it, and later when the American Marines took over; for both countries, more soldiers were killed in the district than anywhere else in Afghanistan. When the Marines handed over responsibility for Sangin to the Afghans, similarly high casualties resulted. The insurgents now hold most of the territory there, with the government holed up in the district seat and on bases.
After a yearlong campaign, the Taliban took over the government and administrative center of Sangin in 2017, in what was viewed at the time as an important symbolic victory for the insurgents. The government responded by moving the district capital buildings to a new area, and in that way claimed to have retained control of the district.
Omar Zwak, spokesman for the governor of Helmand, said on Sunday, There are casualties to our forces but we have sent an investigation team to find out more, and also deployed more security forces to secure the situation.
Mr. Alokozai, the senator, and other local officials said it was not credible that the government had no details on a loss of such a scale, the worst in southern Afghanistan this year.
Abdul Hai Akhundzada, a member of Parliament from Helmand, said that the Taliban attack on security outposts in Sangin had killed more than 60 security forces.","Two days after the attack, Afghan officials said they still did not have all the details or a death toll, but a lawmaker from the area put the number dead at 65.",2019-03-24T13:24:17Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Taliban Kill Dozens of Security Forces in Major Strike in Afghanistan,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/24/world/asia/taliban-attack-afghanistan-helmand.html,https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,casualty,1
Christopher Zara,"Businesses, brands, and media companies are preparing for a Facebook apocalypse after an update yesterday in which CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was refocusing the site’s powerful news feed algorithm so that it prioritizes posts from friends and family. For companies that rely on Facebook as a promotional vehicle, the terrifying takeaway here is that they can expect to see significantly reduced reach in an environment that has already been delivering diminishing returns. In announcing the change, Zuckerberg even made a startling admission: “[B]y making these changes, I expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down,” he said. It’s not the only thing that’s going down. Shares of Facebook dipped almost 5% after the news sunk in, opening at $178.08 this morning compared to $187.77 at the close of the previous day. Interestingly, Zuckerberg has been talking about these tweaks for a while now and the market has largely shrugged them off. The stock even hit an all-time high of $188 earlier this week. If history is any guide, today’s dip is likely to be another temporary crater.

Matthew Lynley,"After rocketing to a $250 million valuation in 2015 amid a massive hype cycle for on-demand companies, on-demand startup Shyp is shutting down today. CEO Kevin Gibbon announced that the company would be shutting down in a blog post this afternoon. The company is ending operations immediately after, like many on-demand companies, struggling to find a scalable model beyond its launching point in San Francisco. Shyp missed targets for expanding to cities beyond its core base as well as pulled back from Miami. In July, Shyp said it would be reducing its headcount and shutting down all operations beyond San Francisco. The company raised $50 million in a deal led by John Doerr at Kleiner Perkins back in 2015, one of his last huge checks as a variety of firms jumped onto the on-demand space. The thesis at the time was pretty sound: look at a strip mall, and see which businesses can come to you first. Shipping was a natural one, but there was also food, and eventually groceries. Today, there are only a few left standing, with Postmates, Instacart and DoorDash among the most prominent ones. Even then, Instacart is now under threat from Amazon, which is ramping up its own two-hour delivery after buying Whole Foods. “At the time, I approached everything I did as an engineer,” Gibbon wrote. “Rather than change direction, I tasked the team with expanding geographically and dreaming up innovative features and growth tactics to further penetrate the consumer market. To this day, I’m in awe of the vigor the team possessed in tackling a 200-year-old industry. But, growth at all costs is a dangerous trap that many startups fall into, mine included.” Shyp is now a casualty of the delivery space. Where it originally sought to make up the cost of delivery in the form of cheaper bulk costs for those deliveries, Shyp’s one-size-fits-all delivery — where you could deliver a computer or a bike — eventually ended up being one of the most challenging and frustrating elements of its business. It began adding fees to its online returns business and changing prices for its bulk shipments. As it turns out, a $5 carte blanche for delivery was not a model that really made sense. Indeed, that growth-at-all-costs directive has cost many startups, with companies like Sprig shutting down and many companies getting slapped on the wrist for aggressive growth tactics like text spamming. It also meant that startups had to very quickly develop an effective playbook that, in the end, might not actually translate to markets beyond their core competency. Shyp pivoted to focusing on businesses toward the tail end of its lifetime, including a big deal with eBay, which we had heard at the time was doing well. “We decided to keep the popular-but-unprofitable parts of our business running, with small teams of their own behind them,” he wrote. “This was a mistake—my mistake. While large, established companies have the financial freedom to explore new product categories for the sake of exploring, for startups it can be irresponsible.” But Gibbon said the company kept parts of its popular but challenged models online – which may have also contributed to its eventual shut-down. The company expected to be in cities like Boston, Seattle and Philadelphia in early 2016, but that didn’t end up panning out. And Shyp increasingly felt the challenges of an on-demand model, trying to push the cost to the consumer as low as possible while handling the overheads and logistical headaches of a delivery business. “My early mistakes in Shyp’s business ended up being prohibitive to our survival,” Gibbon wrote. “For that, I am sorry.”","After rocketing to a $250 million valuation in 2015 amid a massive hype cycle for on-demand companies, on-demand startup Shyp is shutting down today.

Zia Weise,"ISTANBUL—When a diplomatic row with the United States sent Turkey’s national currency into free fall in early August, the news made headlines around the world. In Turkey, however, readers were hard-pressed to find any mention of the crisis on the next day’s front pages. There was no ban on reporting the news—or, rather, the government had no need to impose one. The vast majority of the country’s mainstream media is owned by relatives or allies of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s strongman president. Self-censorship is pervasive; critical journalists are jailed, fined, or fired. Some have fled the country. In press freedom rankings, Turkey hovers between Russia and Iraq. In his speeches, Erdoğan regularly vilifies journalists as “terrorists” while stoking fears of terrorism among his voters. He frequently eschews facts and voices conspiracy theories, including the idea that Turkey’s allies are secretly working to undermine the country’s supposed economic might. Like many strongmen, he takes criticism personally. Since becoming president in 2014, he has sued some 2,000 people for “insulting” him. Dissenting voices struggle to be heard. In the run-up to this summer’s elections, Turkey’s state broadcaster devoted 181 hours to Erdoğan and his allies, but only 16 hours to his main rival despite being legally required to give equal airtime. While Turkey’s journalists have never experienced the level of independence their American colleagues enjoy, there was a brief period of relative press freedom in the 2000s. When that golden era came to an end is difficult to pinpoint. Erdoğan and his government did not destroy Turkey’s free press with a single action or piece of legislation. Instead, they chipped away at it, bit by bit. How Erdogan made Turkey authoritarian again In 2002, the election victory of Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) seemed to herald swift change. Erdoğan broke the army’s stranglehold on politics and society, implemented democratic reforms as part of Turkey’s bid to join the European Union, and made conciliatory in-roads towards the country’s Kurdish minority. His victory also heralded an era of unprecedented freedom for Turkey’s press, which had faced restrictions throughout history. Notably, the AKP liberalized the press law, introducing greater protections against state interference, strengthening journalists’ right to protect their sources, and largely replacing prison sentences for certain violations (ranging from contempt to “encouraging assault or suicide” to “illicit disclosures”) with fines. Emboldened by these reforms, newspapers began covering subjects once deemed taboo, like minority rights. “When me and my friends look at the stories we did then, we say ‘Wow, we were brave,’” Ezgi Başaran, a former newspaper editor in Turkey now at Oxford University’s St. Anthony College, told me. “There is no way these stories would be published now.” But true media diversity remained an illusion. A small group of competing tycoons owned most mainstream media outlets, often influencing the editorial line to their advantage. (Turkish media owners were, and remain, free to invest in other sectors, regardless of conflicts of interest.) Doğan Media Group, then Turkey’s leading media company, owned five major national newspapers and numerous TV stations, including the country’s leading daily Hürriyet and CNN Türk, while also investing in the energy, tourism, and finance sectors. Self-censorship persisted. Even without explicit threats, many editors and reporters toed an invisible line for fear of legal consequences. Court cases against journalists increased and legislation remained restrictive, despite the new press law. “Insulting” Turkishness, the government, or certain state institutions has also been a crime since the 1920s. Turkey’s constitution guarantees a free press, but also criminalizes reporting that threatens national security. What constitutes such a threat is left deliberately vague. (Similarly, Turkey’s anti-terror law allows the state to prosecute journalists for unspecified “terror propaganda.”) Mehveş Evin, a prominent journalist, told me that Turkish reporters simply did not touch certain topics—like Erdoğan’s family. “But I would still call the time between 2002 and, say, 2011 or 2012 the most pluralistic and free time,” he said. But in 2007, roughly around the time the AKP won its second election, the climate shifted. Erdoğan, until 2014 Turkey’s prime minister, won a dispute with the strictly secularist military over his choice of president. Then the police stumbled upon an alleged coup plot by a clandestine organization dubbed Ergenekon, prompting a series of high-profile trials, followed by another coup plot case code-named “Sledgehammer” in 2010. The trials saw hundreds of military officers convicted, along with numerous journalists, judges, and academics. The list of accusations was long: Ergenekon, which was said to include both civilians and military officers belonging to Turkey’s “ deep state,” allegedly conspired to assassinate public figures and finance global terror groups with the sale of chemical weapons, among other nefarious plans. But much of the evidence was questionable. Years later, even the government disowned the trials as a sham. “With Ergenekon, [the AKP] started taking apart the Turkish state as we knew it,” Nevşin Mengü, a well-known television anchor who covered the trials as a junior reporter, told me. The trials crippled the military and loosened the old secular establishment’s grip on state institutions. After 2007, Turkey’s reforms slowed and the AKP’s influence on the judiciary and the bureaucracy grew. Still, few realized the magnitude of the shift that had taken place. “We believed the state would be stronger than the government. I’ve now understood that no system is immune to this,” Mengü said. In 2013, Erdoğan began to turn increasingly authoritarian. In the summer of that year, Turkish police brutally quashed a nationwide anti-government protest. The mainstream media’s self-censorship took on outlandish proportions, with CNN Türk broadcasting a documentary about penguins at the height of the crackdown. Later that year, a major corruption scandal rocked the nation. Prosecutors accused members of Erdoğan’s inner circle of bribery and money-laundering. Days later, leaked recordings appeared to capture the president telling his son to hide large amounts of money. The tapes are believed to have been released by followers of Fetullah Gülen, a Pennsylvania-based imam who had been an ally of Erdoğan until a power struggle drove them apart. Until 2013, journalists at Gülen-linked newspapers had often cheered on the detention of colleagues that criticized the AKP government or the imam’s secretive movement. In 2014, they themselves became the target of police raids, and government trustees took over Gülenist media companies. The 2016 raid against Zaman, the Gülenists’ flagship newspaper, made headlines around the world. Turkey’s war on journalists Meanwhile, the government also reached for more subtle measures to silence critical voices. In 2009, after newspapers owned by Doğan Media Group reported on a corruption scandal, the government slapped the company with a $2.5-billion fine, forcing it to sell off two of its newspapers to a pro-government company. Businessmen loyal to Erdoğan were eagerly buying up mainstream media outlets; those newspapers subsequently adopted a staunchly pro-government line. Journalists unwilling to comply were fired. Often the government enabled the sales, as was the case with the Sabah newspaper: In 2007, a state agency accused its previous owners of fraud and seized the paper. It was subsequently sold to Çalık Holding, whose CEO at the time, Berat Albayrak, is Erdoğan’s son-in-law. Today, Sabah has become the most influential pro-government outlet, where the president’s advisors moonlight as columnists. Most journalists place Turkey’s point of no return in 2015. In June of that year, the AKP lost its majority in parliamentary elections. Shortly after, an attack prompted the government to halt a peace process with Kurdish militants and begin whipping up nationalist sentiment to win back votes. Their strategy helped them regain control of parliament that year. But Turkish society, already divided along multiple lines, became increasingly polarized. Erdoğan’s us-and-them rhetoric had severe implications for the press. “You have to be on one side. They’re pushing you to be a patriot, not a journalist,” Evin said. In 2015, she was fired from her newspaper, Milliyet, for reporting on the military operation in Kurdish cities. Critical reporting on security matters was increasingly prosecuted as “terror propaganda.” Journalists increasingly faced violence. In September 2015, a mob attacked the Hürriyet offices in Istanbul, accusing the paper of misquoting Erdoğan. A series of terror attacks and a failed coup attempt in 2016, blamed on the Gülenists, further heightened nationalist sentiment. The government used the coup attempt to justify a vast purge of state institutions and civil society, imprisoning anyone with tenuous ties to “terror groups.” Journalists were jailed for talking to certain sources or working for Gülenist or Kurdish nationalist outlets. More than 100 media outlets were forcibly shut down. In the name of national security, Erdoğan imposed emergency rule and governed by decree. “2016 was when the rule of law ended in Turkey,” Erol Önderoğlu, Turkey representative for Reporters Without Borders, told me. As of this summer, Erdoğan rules Turkey as an executive president with sweeping powers, having abolished the country’s parliamentary system. The final nail in the coffin for Turkey’s mainstream press, meanwhile, came this spring, when Doğan Media Group, along with Hürriyet, was sold to a government-friendly corporation. Now, Önderoglu said, “the government controls more than 85 percent of national mainstream media.” Birgün, a small independent newspaper, estimates that pro-government outlets represent 90 percent of national newspaper circulation. These days, the tiniest criticism or inconvenient fact can get a reporter into trouble. Nevşin Mengü lost her job at CNN Türk last year, after she reported that Erdoğan’s meeting with President Donald Trump lasted only 23 minutes, implying that Turkey was not as important to the Trump administration as Ankara thought. “Erdoğan told our Ankara office: ‘I want your boss to take care of this woman’, so they took me off air,” she said. Yet Mengü and her colleagues do not consider governmental repression or intimidation the only important factor. Press freedom also eroded, they said, because journalists in Turkey did not defend each other. “The lack of solidarity has brought us to this point. It’s the most you can do, as journalists—if there’s an attack on a colleague, get together and protest,” Ezgi Başaran said. Today’s media landscape in Turkey is not entirely devoid of critical reporting, but the remaining publications are struggling. Few businesses want to risk incurring the government’s wrath by advertising in critical newspapers; digital outlets in particular face financial difficulties. Their reporters and editors are routinely prosecuted by the courts, which have long lost their independence. More than 100 journalists sit behind bars. “People might say, Turkey never had a free press and the rule of law was never there. But it literally took a decade and a half to come here,” Başaran said. Western democracies ought to see what happened in her country as a warning, she added. “When you look at Poland, Hungary and now the U.S., I do see distinct similarities in how these illiberal populist governments operate. It’s the same rhetoric.”",The free press is always a casualty along the road to authoritarianism.,2018-08-23T19:36:10Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",How Did Things Get so Bad for Turkey’s Journalists?,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/08/destroying-free-press-erdogan-turkey/568402/,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/08/RTR4HY12/facebook.jpg?1535047002,,Theatlantic.com,casualty,1
"Kevin Menes, MD","The night that Stephen Paddock opened fire on thousands of people at a Las Vegas country music concert, nearby Sunrise Hospital received more than 200 penetrating gunshot wound victims. Dr. Kevin Menes was the attending in charge of the ED that night, and thanks to his experience supporting a local SWAT team, he’d thought ahead about how he might mobilize his department in the event of a mass casualty incident. This is his story, a s told to Judith Tintinalli, MD, MS Edited by Logan Plaster I’m a night shift doc. My work week is Friday to Monday, 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Most people don’t want to work those shifts. But that’s when most of the action comes in, so that’s when I work. It was a Sunday night when the EMS telemetry call came in to alert Sunrise Hospital of a mass casualty incident. All hospitals in Las Vegas are notified in a MCI to prepare for incoming patients. As I listened to the tele, there happened to be a police officer who was there for an unrelated incident. I saw him looking at his radio. I asked him, “Hey. Is this real?” and he said, “Yeah, man.” I ran down to my car and grabbed my police radio. The first thing that I heard when I turned it on to the area command was officers yelling, “Automatic fire…country music concert.” Ten o’clock at night at an open air concert, automatic fire into 10-20 thousand people or more in an open field—that’s a lot of people who could get hurt. At that point, I put into action a plan that I had thought of beforehand. It might sound odd, but I had thought about these problems well ahead of time because of the way I always approached resuscitations: Preplan ahead Ask hard questions Figure out solutions Mentally rehearse plans so that when the problem arrives, you don’t have to jump over a mental hurdle since the solution is already worked out It’s an open secret that Las Vegas is a big target because of its large crowds. For years I had been planning how I would handle a MCI, but I rarely shared it because people might think I was crazy. The first thing I did was tell the secretaries I needed every operating room open. I needed every scrub tech, every nurse, every perfusionist, every anesthesiologist, every surgeon—they all need to get here right away. They immediately began making phone calls. I told the trauma nurses that I needed all the treatment areas completely clear. Nurses were instructed to keep an eye out for crashing patients and make sure that all patients had bilateral 14-18 gauge IVs ready for the moment that they would decompensate. We also initiated our hospital’s “code triage,” in which staff from upstairs would come down to help by bringing down gurneys and spare manpower. We took all of our empty ED beds and wheelchairs out into the ambulance bay. Anybody who could push a patient, from environmental services to EKG techs to CNAs, came out to the ambulance bay. I said to the staff, “I’ll call it out. I’ll tell you guys where to go, and you guys bring these people in.” When the shooting started, there were four emergency physicians, one trauma surgeon, and a trauma resident in the ER. That night I was working with Dr. Patrick Flores and Dr. James Walker, two physicians I’ve worked with for over five years. We’ve gotten in trouble together many times for doing thoracotomies before the surgeon could arrive. I know how these guys work. We’ve done major resuscitations together. We are like brothers. We also had a new guy, Dr. Michael Tang, who just graduated residency and had been there for a few months. Dr. Allan MacIntyre was the Trauma Surgeon working that night. Front (L-R): Kevin Menes, MD, James Walker, DO Rear (L-R): Patrick Flores, DO, Michael Tang, DO Here is how our emergency department is laid out. Station 1 has a central desk with four trauma bays. Trauma 1 and 2 have two beds in each bay. Trauma 3 and 4 have one bed in each bay. The most critical care traumas usually go to Trauma 3 and 4. Also attached to Station 1 is our critical care pod. That has four beds in it. Adjacent to that is our psychiatric area where we fit eight beds close together. Station 2 is down the hallway from Station 1. Station 2 has a central nurse desk surrounded by eight beds that are in line of sight. Station 4 is the end of the hallway after Station 2. It opens up to a large room with a central desk with eight beds surrounding a wide U-shaped hallway. Taking the U-shaped hallway of Station 4 all the way around will lead you to the Med Room to the left, Rapid Track, and Station 3 to the right. The Med Room is an open room with recliners typically used to give medications. Rapid Track is a row of chairs in the hallway. Station 3 has multiple “Death Beds,” rooms that are isolated and private rooms with a door, out of line of sight from the nurse’s desk. In my mind, that was the worst place to put any of these traumas, so I told the nurses to not put anybody into those rooms. THE MCI TRIAGE PLAN My plan was that we were going to take care of all of our major resuscitations (red tags) in Station 1. Station 2 was going to have our orange tags, patients with threatening gunshots in critical areas, but had not crashed yet. This is not in the textbook. In my mind, these orange tags were expected to crump near the end of the Golden Hour. Station 4 was going to have the yellow tags, patients that had torso/neck or proximal extremity shots that looked very stable and were expected to survive past the Golden Hour. Rapid Track and Med room would hold the green tags, staffed by two PAs, were just going to end up sitting on the floor or stuffed into an area with people watching over and making sure that none of them crumped. The ER doctors would resuscitate and send the resuscitated patients to Trauma 3 or 4 for the trauma surgeon to prioritize to the OR. In preplanning, I knew that as we started to get some of these red tags stabilized, the anesthesiologists and surgeons would start arriving and we could open up more ORs. That’s the first major choke point. I can resuscitate four or five people, but that operating room was going to be the key to stopping the bleeding and saving lives. In a high volume penetrating MCI like this, you really need flow. You need people to get stabilized and into the operating room, not sitting around perseverating about what test to order next. Getting those ORs staffed and opened was my biggest priority. With potentially hundreds of incoming patients, it was going to be a matter of eyeballing patients or feeling for carotid pulses because we didn’t have enough monitors. Everything was 100% clinical judgment. You’re looking at all these patients, and you’re just waiting for them to declare themselves—and then you start to work on them. THEY ARRIVED FOUR TO A CAR I was out in the ambulance bay when the first police cars arrived with patients. There were three to four people inside each cruiser. Two people on the floorboards and two in the back seat, and they were in bad shape. These patients were “scoop and run”—minimal to no prior medical care but brought in a timely manner. They had thready pulses, so they went directly to Station 1, our red tag area. By textbook standards, some of these first arrivals should have been black tags, but I sent them to the red tag area anyway. I didn’t black tag a single one. We took everybody that came in—I pulled at least 10 people from cars that I knew were dead—and sent them straight back to Station 1 so that another doc could see them. If the two of us ended up thinking that this person was dead, then I knew that it was a legitimate black tag. I would pull a patient and yell “Rapid track. Station four. Station two. Station one.” The staff would then wheel the patients in gurneys or wheelchairs to those areas, drop then off, and come back for more. Over the years in the ED and working with SWAT, I’ve honed what I call Applied Ballistics and Wound Estimation. It’s a visual CT scanner. We all do it as emergency physicians. You look at a GSW and guess the trajectory and the potential internal injuries. Then you decide if they’re dying now, in a few minutes, or in an hour. Instead of wasting valuable resuscitation time actually tagging the patients, they were sent to their respective tagged areas. I would look at these patients as they came in, and I would grade them red to green. Some were shot in the neck or shot in the chest, but they were still awake and talking to me. These went into my orange area because I knew that I probably had 30 minutes before they crashed. Inside, the Red Tags were getting resuscitated and brought to the Trauma surgeon who would prioritize the patients to the OR. It was important to get the red tags into the operating room because the orange tags would start to crump and become the next red tags. The yellow tags would start becoming orange tags. After 30 or 40 minutes, I’d triaged the sickest group of patients I had ever seen. About 150 patients had come into the emergency department. I was pulling people five or six at a time out of patrol cars, pickup trucks, ambulances, you name it. I noticed that the first cars carried most of the red tags, and now most of the vehicles had stable yellow and green tags. At that point, one of the nurses came running out into the ambulance bay and just yelled, “Menes! You need to get inside! They’re getting behind!” I turned to Deb Bowerman, the RN who had been with me triaging and said, “You saw what I’ve been doing. Put these people in the right places.” She said, “I got it.” And so I turned triage over to a nurse. The textbook says that triage should be run by the most experienced doctor, but at that point what else could we do? I ran to Station 1. There were people all over the place, adhering somewhat to the triage plan. But due to the large bolus of patients, the patients overflowed into the hallways. One of the first images I can remember is Dr. Walker, Dr. Flores, and I intubating three GSWs to the head. We were in the hallway of Station 1 with the beds side by side. We were butt to butt intubating these three people. “I need etomidate! I need sux!” Up until then, the nurses would go over to the Pyxis, put their finger on the scanner, and we would wait. Right then, I realized a flow issue. I needed these medications now. I turned to our ED pharmacist and asked for every vial of etomidate and succinylcholine in the hospital. I told one of the trauma nurses that we need every unit of O negative up here now. The blood bank gave us every unit they had. In order to increase the flow through the resuscitation process, nurses had Etomidate, Succinylcholine, and units of 0 negative in their pockets or nearby, I realized that these GSWs to the head were going to clog up the ER. Neurosurgery had not arrived yet, and I was expecting another bolus of patients. I told the three other ER doctors that altered, isolated GSWs to the head would get intubated, sent to CT scan, then up to Trauma ICU to wait for the Neurosurgeons to arrive. This helped offload some of the volume, and it freed up our nurses to help with the orange tags that were becoming reds. As planned, all of the early red tags in Station 1 were shuffled into the operating room as our orange tags started crashing. NO MORE THORACOSTOMY TRAYS OR VENTILATORS – TIME TO IMPROVISE My partners were busy in Station 1, so I went over to Station 2. I remember intubating and dropping four chest tubes on two women in a single room, then shuffling them into Station 1 to get prioritized for the operating room. More patients started crumping in Station 2, so I started doing multiple stabilization measures. Then I sent these patients off to Station 1 for prioritization to the OR. We didn’t do any FAST or CTs on these initial red tags. We didn’t do any central lines or needle decompressions; we went straight to chest tube. If they were crumping with a GSW to the chest, they’d get a diagnostic chest tube. We ran out of thoracostomy trays, so I used suture kits and scalpels. I would cut down to the ribs, pop the pleura with a needle driver or Mosquito clamp, then take the same suture kit and stitch it in place. When I ran out of chest tubes, I used an ET tube as a temporary chest tube while we waited for more supplies. We didn’t do any thorocotomies that night. That was valuable time we used to save the red and orange tag patients. By this time, all the patients had bilateral IVs. As the orange tags and yellow tags would become red tags, it became very apparent that those early IVs, put in while patients still had decent veins, were lifesaving. As the patients decompensated, we had adequate access to rapidly transfuse and stabilize patients. If we didn’t have that early IV access, we would have spent valuable time trying to cannulate flat veins. Eventually, the yellow tag patients in Station 4 started turning into red tags. This was later into the Golden Hour, and there were only 4 resuscitologists in the ER. I remember there were two girls who got shot in the neck, both of whom had expanding hematomas. I ended up intubating both of them. I did a chest tube on one, then moved them both to Station 1 and eventually the OR. I had just stabilized those two girls, when the yellow tags started crumping down the line. The other ER docs were still working hard in Station 1. One Station 4 nurse would shout, “Menes! I need you here!” and then another would pull me to another patient. I said, “Bring all your patients together.” They brought them all towards me, and I was at the head of multiple beds, spiraling out like flower petals around its center. We pushed drugs on all of them, and they all got intubated, transfused, chest tubed, and then shuffled to Station 1. Around that time the respiratory therapist, said, “Menes, we don’t have any more ventilators.” I said, “It’s fine,” and requested some Y tubing. Dr. Greg Neyman, a resident a year ahead of me in residency, had done a study on the use of ventilators in a mass casualty situation. What he came up with was that if you have two people who are roughly the same size and tidal volume, you can just double the tidal volume and stick them on Y tubing on one ventilator. “YOU’RE A SHARK. GET OUT THERE AND FIND BLOOD!” As fresh ER doctors would arrive, I would brief them on the layout, the list of workarounds we were doing, and tell them, “You’re a shark. Get out there and find blood!” I wanted them to find those dying patients in the sea of patients still there. Within hours, we had hundreds of doctors, nurses, and midlevels arrive at the hospital to help. Around this time was my last big resuscitation, a middle-aged woman with a GSW to the lateral right chest who developed shock from a contralateral pneumothorax. She received a diagnostic left chest tube and blood, and her blood pressure stabilized. She was taken back to the OR after I secured her chest tube. She was eventually found to have a transected aorta. I heard just recently that she survived and got discharged. Throughout the night, I would look up from what I was doing and scan the room to see if anyone was crumping. I noticed a choke point forming for CT. We were now left with stable yellow tags. These patients needed CAT Scans. Typically, the CT Tech picks up the patient, transfers them onto the scanner, and then they bring the patient back. These yellow tag patients were shot in the torso, but for some reason were stable even after 2 or 3 hours. I told the CT Tech, go over to the CAT scan machine, and sit behind the controls. “I don’t want you to move. You’re just going to press buttons for the rest of the night.” Then I took every nurse that was free—at that point we had a lot of extra staff—and told them that all the people who needed CAT scans needed to be lined up in the ambulance hallway outside of CAT scan. We placed monitors on them, and nurses watched them. Then the nurses assisted getting each patient on and off the CT, and then back over to Stations 2 and 4. I called it the CT Conga Line. I identified another choke point with the green tag patients. Many were shot in the extremities. They had potential fractures or open fractures and needed X-rays. The standard way of doing things is taking the patient for an X-Ray, then sending it off to the radiologist so they can read it in their reading room. That was just going to take too long. So I told our CEO, Todd Sklamberg, “I need a radiologist here in the ER. I’m going to attach him to an X-Ray tech because our machines have little screens on them.” They X-Rayed patients, the radiologist read off the screen, and we would decide on disposition right there. It was around four o’clock when I started trying to look at a CAT scan report. I tried to read it, but I think I burned every neurotransmitter that night. I remember looking at it and not understanding a single word that was on there. At that point, I knew I was more dangerous to the patients than helpful. These were stable yellow tags that needed a set of fresh eyes. By then, we had a lot of doctors who had arrived, so I turned that aspect of care over to them. AFTER THE DUST SETTLED When I thought about it afterwards, I realized that it was all about flow. If you eliminate these narrow choke points that occur along the way, you can get people seen and evaluated sooner by the correct specialist. As ER doctors, we can resuscitate and stabilize, but it is up to the surgeons to do damage control surgery. Prompt damage control is the key to saving somebody in a penetrating trauma. In the end, we officially had 215 penetrating gunshot wounds, but the actual number is much higher. As I would circle the ER “looking for blood,” I would hear the green tags say, “You know what? I’m not that bad—I’ll be fine.” Over time, they would walk out without getting registered. Our true number was well over 250. The surgery team performed an unprecedented feat that night. The numbers speak for themselves. In six hours, they did 28 damage control surgeries and 67 surgeries in the first 24 hours. We had dispositioned almost all 215 patients by about 5 o’clock in the morning, just a little more than seven hours after the ordeal began. That’s about 30 GSWs per hour. I couldn’t believe that we saved that many people in that short amount of time. It’s a testament to how amazingly well the hospital team worked together that night. We did everything we could. 8 GSWs to the chest 10 GSWs to the head 13 GSWs to the abdomen 17 Ortho GSWs 33 GSWs to the neck or major extremities CONTROLLED CHAOS: MCI LESSONS LEARNED Flow is king. Destroy the choke points to allow patients to flow to definitive care. By organizing patients into clear physical zones, they were able to avoid wasting time writing too many tags. That’s precious time that could be spent with resuscitations. The Orange tag in triage allowed Menes’s team to focus on the most critically wounded while keeping a very close eye on those who were badly wounded but would soon crash. Don’t have enough ventilators? Pair patients of similar size, double the tidal volume, and use Y tubing to ventilate two patients on one vent. Mentally rehearse difficult scenarios ahead of time. This can be just as valuable as actual practice. Think through what you will do if/when your current plan of action fails. Not enough monitors? Place all patients in line of sight, and use clinical judgment to find the crashing patients.

"USA TODAY, Ben Mutzabaugh, USA TODAY","This photo provided by Alaska Airlines shows an Embraer E175 of affiliate Horizon Air at Paine Field in Everett, Washington.

Its official. The resumption of commercial air service at Paine Field in Everett, Washington, will be delayed, a casualty of the ongoing government shutdown.
Alaska Airlines had expected to begin flying from the airport on Feb. 11, but now thats postponed at least until March.
Paine Field, located about 25 miles north of downtown Seattle, has not had commercial airline service in decades. Two airlines, Alaska and United, had planned to begin flying from the airport following the completion of a new passenger terminal there. But that plan required approvals from the Federal Aviation Administration.
Speculation began to build earlier this month about whether the shutdown would affect the start of flights there, and thats turned out to be the case.
Several key groups within the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which conduct crucial certification and oversight work required for the start of commercial air service at Paine Field, are subject to furloughs because of the government shutdown, Alaska Airlines said in a post to its corporate blog. The FAAs work on the environmental assessment continues. However, essential work groups within the FAA are furloughed and further delays are expected if the shutdown continues.
For now, Alaska says it has pushed back its planned launch of Everett flights to March 4. Still, it noted that date remains subject to receipt of all required government approvals.
Its a tough decision, but we believe the responsible action is to postpone the start of service at Paine Field, the carrier added in its statement.

Last SlideNext Slide
The airline said Everett customers affected by the postponement are automatically being rebooked to their destinations on flights from the carrier's main hub in Seattle. ""Itll be for a time thats closest to their original Paine Field flight,"" Alaska said in its blog. 
Alternatively, Alaska will allow customers to push their Everett itineraries to March or later without paying a change fee. Customers traveling from Everett before March 4 can request a refund if they decide not to travel.
Alaskas flights that were to begin Feb. 11 were to be the first of a schedule that will eventually include 18 flights from Everett to eight destinations: Las Vegas; Los Angeles; Orange County, California; Phoenix; Portland, Oregon; San Diego; San Francisco; and San Jose, California.
United's first flights at Everett arent scheduled to begin until March 31. Its schedule will feature six daily round-trips to two of its hubs, including four San Francisco flights and two Denver flights.
The return of Paine Field to the U.S. aviation map has become a highly anticipated aviation story for 2019, both locally and among U.S. industry observers.
Paine Field already hosts a busy flight schedule, but thats not from regular airline service. Instead, the facility is adjacent to Boeings largest assembly line, where the U.S. jetmaker performs final assembly on its 747, 767, 777 and 787 widebody aircraft.
Boeings large aircraft keep a heavy flight schedule at the airport, which also hosts some private general aviation flying.
But in May 2017, Alaska Airlines announced its intention to begin flying from Everett, which is about 25 miles north of downtown Seattle.
Seattle-baaed Alaska Airlines already operates its busy hub at the fast-growing Seattle-Tacoma International Airport that sits about 15 miles south of the city.
When it announced its plans for Everett, it touted the move as a way to expand its reach into the northern stretch of Seattles metro area, where travelers can face daunting traffic on Interstate 5 to get to Seattle-Tacoma.
United also flies from Seattle-Tacoma, where it offers up to 40 daily flights to its U.S. hubs.

"USA TODAY, Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY","LOS ANGELESIt wasn't that long ago for Apple retail chief Angela Ahrendts was being talked about as a potential successor to current CEO Tim Cook. 
The former Burberry's CEO joined Apple five years ago to take over its retail division. On Tuesday, Apple announced she was out of a job, with such little fanfare that the headline of the release was about her successor, Deirdre OBrien, being named the Senior Vice President of Retail + People. 
O'Brien is a 31-year Apple veteran who is currently in charge of human resources.

In the release, Ahrendts said she was leaving Apple for ""new personal and professional pursuits.""
Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said the move is a big ""surprise,"" considering how many thought she was the ""heir apparent"" to Cook. ""But if you look at the success of the retail side, even though she's a retail legend, it's been rocky. If Apple was going to make a change, this is a good time to do it rather than six months from now, when it will launch new iPhones.""
After years of runaway sales success for the iPhone, Apple's holiday quarter found a 16 percent year over year sales dip for the once iconic product. Apple has blamed the results of changing conditions in China and a fluctuating dollar in many markets.
It's not that the retail stores have done poorly, says Ives, but they've haven't grown sales either, says Ives.
""Someone new could be a good thing, given the lackluster performance we've seen over the last six to nine months,"" he adds.

Privacy: What if Apple ran social media and Facebook?
Just last week, Ahrendts introduced several new programs for the store, a series of classes called ""Today at Apple,"" that look to bring education to consumers, as a way of hooking them deeper into the Apple ecosystem. 
Apple has 506 stores and recently opened a big, splashy one in Paris, on the Champs-Élysées. In an interview with USA TODAY in November, she said Apple was one-third of the way through upgrading the retail stores into gathering spaces, where people can come in, get service and support and learn about everything they would do on their devices.

"Louisville Courier Journal, Tim Sullivan, Louisville Courier Journal","Of the 25 racetracks that share their casualty counts with the public, only one was more deadly last year than Churchill Downs.
And despite its recent rash of gloomy headlines, it wasn’t Santa Anita.
Only Illinois’ Hawthorne Race Course lost horses at a faster pace than Churchill Downs did in 2018, according to the Jockey Club’s Equine Injury Database.
Over the past three years, only the boutique meet conducted at California’s Sonoma County Fair exceeded Churchill’s race-related mortality rate.
Unlike its Kentucky colleagues at Keeneland and Turfway Park, Churchill Downs does not publicly disclose its racing fatalities, but a spokesman for the track confirmed figures obtained through a public records request of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission.

 (Photo: Brian Bohannon, AP)
Those records show the home of the Kentucky Derby has lost 43 thoroughbreds to racing injuries since 2016, a 2.42 per 1,000-start average that was 50 percent higher than the national average during the same three-year span.
Last year, with 16 fatalities in 5,856 starts, Churchill’s death rate was higher still: 2.73 per 1,000.
Santa Anita deaths: After 22 horses die at track, Congress wants to ban dangerous doping
While stressing the causes of this carnage were “multi-factorial,” track consultant Mick Peterson said the racing industry should respond with the singular urgency the U.S. space program showed after the Soviet Union’s 1957 launch of the Sputnik satellite.
“It really is one of those moments where we need to step back and say we’ve got to do this better, and we’ve got to change how we’re doing it,” said Peterson, director of the University of Kentucky’s agriculture equine programs. “Because otherwise the industry is not going to survive. People don’t accept (racing fatalities) the way they did.”
According to the Equine Injury Database, which includes input from roughly 98 percent of North American races, thoroughbreds sustained 6,134 fatal racing injuries between 2009 and 2018.
But though the annual count of race-related deaths has decreased from 790 to 493 during the last decade, this is at least as much a reflection of fewer tracks and dwindling racing dates as it is a sign of meaningful safety advancements.
Racing is undeniably risky, especially for the horse, and managing those risks grows more delicate as society grows less tolerant of suspected animal abuse.   
“What’s happened in America over the last several years is horse racing is running scared,” said Patrick Battuello, HorseracingWrongs.com founder. “Look at the other entertainment businesses that use animals: Ringling Brothers, Sea World. Greyhound racing is in its death throes. What makes horse racing exempt?
“They can’t stop the killing. It’s inherent. Even if they were to mitigate it a little bit, they can’t get it to zero. What’s the acceptable loss ratio? Things are changing. It’s always been reported as a sport, but in the end it’s animal exploitation and it’s got to go.”

Since the Kentucky Derby continues to draw crowds comparable to the population of major cities, the end of racing would not appear to be imminent. While on-track wagering has declined for six straight years in the U.S., off-track betting has risen four years in a row.

Still, the fallout from Santa Anita’s recent fatalities, which included an abrupt track shutdown and some rapid-fire reforms, speaks to the sport’s acute sense of crisis. Though Churchill Downs has rarely been the loudest voice on industry issues, befitting its corporate culture and shareholder sensitivities, it is poorly positioned to abdicate responsibility.
“Nobody’s got more exposure than Churchill, just because of the Derby,” Peterson said. “It takes exactly one horse to change the narrative: Battle of Midway at Santa Anita, Eight Belles (euthanized after the 2008 Derby). People aren’t always watching, but when they are, it matters.”
Background: After Santa Anita's horse deaths, 'we have to care' in Kentucky
Churchill Downs spokesman Darren Rogers said the track has responded to its recent run of catastrophic injuries by redoubling its efforts on areas within its control, specifically the racing surface itself. He said the track would soon announce “a more formalized investigative process” for racing fatalities, probably before the April 27 start of the spring meet.
“We’ve shown as an industry leader that we won’t hesitate to make any of these changes that have proven safety benefits,” Rogers said. “Maximizing the health of our athletes is paramount to us. ...
“Safety is an issue that everyone in the industry shares responsibility for. We’re committed to making it safer. We’re committed to minimizing the risks of injury, period. We owe it to everyone to collaborate with other leaders and raise the bar in making racing safer.”

Horsemen sometimes contradict themselves on this score. While proclaiming the welfare of the horse as their top priority, many of them remain staunchly opposed to statistically safer synthetic surfaces.
In each of the 10 years of the Equine Injury Database, synthetic racetracks have produced fewer fatalities per start than have dirt surfaces.
Over a decade, the difference is 50 percent: 1.2 per 1,000 starts to 1.8 per 1,000 starts. Nonetheless, only five synthetic tracks remain in operation in North America: Arlington Park, Golden Gate Fields, Presque Isle Downs, Turfway Park and Woodbine.
“Looking at it right now, the big difference between the synthetic and the dirt is the synthetic is insensitive to moisture content,” said Peterson, who has an engineer doctorate. “And so, we see that big difference.
“Look at the other entertainment businesses that use animals: Ringling Brothers, Sea World. Greyhound racing is in its death throes. What makes horse racing exempt?”
Patrick Battuello, HorseracingWrongs.com founder
“The trainers and the owners are making a legitimate case that they’re getting different kinds of injuries on the synthetic and it’s not extending (horses’) careers, but there are fewer catastrophic injuries. We have to take that seriously as well, even though nobody has funded the study that has proven that.”
Dr. Mary Scollay, the KHRC’s equine medical director, cautions that mitigating one risk can exacerbate others, and that “if you just address one factor, you have missed the boat.”
To illustrate her point, she referenced her work with a New York task force charged with investigating an increase in racing fatalities at Aqueduct in 2010-11.
“One of the things that we identified as a risk factor was the purse-to-claiming price ratio,” Scollay wrote.  “Purses were inflated by an infusion of casino dollars, so that a $10,000 claiming horse was racing for a purse of $40,000. This established the horse as a disposable commodity.  The purse was worth more than the horse, so horses could be ‘used up’ in pursuit of the large purses.”
More: Six weeks out, there's not much clarity about 2019 Kentucky Derby field
In response, the task force recommended that the ratio between a purse and a claiming price not exceed 1.6-1. But when other regional tracks began offering higher purses for claiming races, Aqueduct suffered from smaller fields and reduced wagering.
“It becomes a death spiral in terms of a business model,” she said.
If horse racing is to last for the long term, at Churchill Downs and elsewhere, it is going to need comprehensive solutions to systemic problems.

Beatrice Christofaro,"Britain's Royal Air Force only caused one civilian casualty while killing more than 4,000 ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria, according to new figures from the country's Ministry of Defence (MoD). 
 The research charity Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) obtained the data under freedom of information laws which tracks the RAF's bomb raids from September 2014 to January 2019. 
 AOAV has expressed skepticism that the RAF managed to protect civilians with almost total success as it killed thousands of enemy combatants. 
 Ian Overton, the charity's executive director, said: ""'The RAF's claim of a ratio of one civilian casualty against 4,315 enemies must be a world record in modern conflict. Yet few conflict experts believe this to be true. "" 
 The 4,315 figure includes those who were wounded as well as those killed.

 The MoD data shows that of the 4,315 combatants it killed or injured, 75% were in Iraq. The other 25% were in Syria. 
 According to AOAV's analysis, most RAF strikes on Mosul and Raqqa, former ISIS strongholds, were aimed at buildings. 
 The majority of airstrikes also respond to events occurring on the ground, increasing the risk for civilians, the charity said.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Violence has risen since international combat troops left Afghanistan three years ago The strength of the Afghan security forces has declined sharply over the past 12 months due to desertions and high casualty rates, a US government watchdog has said. The number of security forces personnel has fallen by about 10% to just under 300,000, according to a new report. The findings come a day after a wave of attacks killed nearly 40 people. The report says more of the population is falling under the control of militant groups including the Taliban. The report was released by a group known as Sigar (the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction). It says the Taliban and other militant groups now either control or influence more areas of the country since the group started recording the data in late 2015. The Taliban and other insurgent groups have been inflicting heavy casualties on Afghan forces and the security agencies seem unable to stop suicide attacks even in heavily protected areas like the capital, Kabul, says the BBC's Ethirajan Anbarasan. ""Building up the Afghan forces is a top priority for the US and our international allies, so it is worrisome to see Afghan force strength decreasing,"" John Sopko, the head of Sigar, told Reuters news agency. A BBC study released earlier this year found that Taliban fighters were openly active in nearly three-quarters of the country. The Afghan government, however, says it controls most areas. But attacks claimed by Taliban and Islamic State group militants have killed scores in Kabul and elsewhere. The BBC research also suggests that IS is more active in Afghanistan than ever before, although it remains far less powerful than the Taliban. Last year, US President Donald Trump announced the US military would stay in the country indefinitely. US-led forces have spent billions of dollars trying to defeat the Taliban. Last year, the US said it would send 3,000 extra troops to Afghanistan as the Taliban gained ground and the security situation deteriorated.","The forces have seen a drop in numbers as the security situation deteriorates, a new report finds.",2018-05-01T09:51:14Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Afghan security forces 'shrink sharply' - US watchdog,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-43961408,https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9363/production/_101113773_046487936-1.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,casualty,1
Sadiq Naqvi,"At least 72 more people succumbed to alcohol poisoning in two districts of Assam on Saturday, taking the death toll to 114 in what has turned into one of the worst episodes of mass hooch deaths in recent years. 
The deaths, mostly of tea estate workers in Golaghat and Jorhat districts, came less than two weeks after tainted liquor killed about 100 people in the Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. 
Parimal Suklabaidya, Assam’s excise minister, said the tragedy happened despite clear instructions to district officials to be extra vigilant following the episode in the northern states that took place in the second week of this month. 
Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, on Tuesday ordered top officials to ensure “a complete ban on sale of illegal liquor” and take steps to arrest and punish the guilty. He also announced an ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh for the dead and Rs 50,000 to those undergoing treatment. 
Sonowal visited the Jorhat Medical College Hospital where several victims were undergoing treatment and inquired about their conditions.
The police has detained 12 persons so far in connection with the incident, out of which three who had consumed the alcohol had to be hospitalised, according to Mukesh Agarwal, the additional director general of police, law and order. 
According to Agarwal, 114 persons have succumbed to alcohol poisioning so far, including 71 from Golaghat district and 43 from mostly Borhola area of Jorhat district. 
At least five people who served as the distributors of the illicit liquor died in the tragedy, according to police officials in Golaghat. 
A top police official said there are at least 17 other suspects involved in selling the illicit alcohol who have been identified across the district which saw deaths reported from Halmira Tea Estate, Wokha Tea Estate, Gobindpur. 
At the Halmira Tea estate hospital, which accounted for at least 38 casualties, the patients started arriving at 4.10 pm on Thursday. Bondhoin Bowri was the first one to arrive. 
“Within next ten minutes, Draupodi Urang (62) landed at the hospital with similar symptoms of alcohol poisoning,” said Pranjal Sharma, the medical officer at the seven bed hospital at the tea estate. 
By 9.30 pm in the evening 23 persons were referred by Sharma to the Golaghat Civil Hospital. 
In Jugibari village, the locals vandalised the belongings of at least three residents of the village who were involved in making Sulai after news of two deaths from the village. At least one person detained by Golaghat Police belonged to Jugibari. 
According to Pushpraj Singh, Superintendent of Police, Golaghat, Jugibari cannot be the only place where the spurious liquor that led to deaths was produced. “There can be multiple producers at different locations but we have to investigate what is common contaminant,” Singh said. 
Sulai, the local brew, is mostly made from just fermented rice or Jaggery which is mixed with alum, calcium carbide and other contaminants before it is distilled. To make it more potent, the producers even mix ethanol.
“We have to investigate what was the common contaminant,” said Singh. “Use of methyl alcohol instead of ethyl alcohol could the reason. Jaggery could also be the reason but it is unlikely,” he said adding the forensic department team arriving on Saturday would offer more clues.

Karishma Hasnat,"Guwahati: Charging the opposition of doing politics over the IAF strike at the Jaish-e-Mohammed camp, home minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday asked opposition leaders to go to Pakistan and find out how many terrorists were killed in Balakot.Some of our opposition leaders are asking how many terrorists died in the air strike. This will be revealed today or tomorrow. The responsibility of Indian Air Force was to hit the target, and they accomplished that. I would ask my friends in Congress to go to Pakistan and find out how many died, he said at a rally in Assams Dhubri district.
Singh claimed that National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) system had informed about presence of around 300 active mobile phones at the site before the air strike by the air force. 
 The NTRO said there were 300 mobile phones with active signal strength in the area before the strike. Now, keep guessing the number of deaths of course, 300 active mobile phones cant belong to plants and trees there, said Singh. 
Now will you (opposition) not believe the NTRO also, Singh asked.Stating that the Modi government is committed to avenging the death of 40 CRPF soldiers in Pulwama, Singh said that anyone trying to destabilise the country will not be spared.
If need be, we will dig them out of hell, but no one who wants to destabilize the country would be forgiven. If you have a problem or any demand, the government is always ready for talks in a democratic set up, but if anyone chooses arms to fulfill their demands, we will not forgive them, the home minister said.
Ahead of 2019 general elections, Rajnath Singh once again reiterated the governments commitment to give shelter to non-Muslim minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan in India. The controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill had lapsed after it failed to clear the Rajya Sabha hurdle in the Budget Session of Parliament, the last before polls. 
He added that the government will decide on the fate of 'foreigners' without subjecting them to inhuman treatment.
We will do justice to victims of religious persecution who come to India from neighboring countries, but we will not let foreigners be subjected to inhuman treatment. We will discuss their status with the respective government of their country of origin, and decide.
The home minister in his speech also paid tribute to the 40 CRPF soldiers who were killed in the deadliest suicide attack by Pakistan-based terror outfit JeM in Pulwama on February 14.

Judy Berman,"Game of Thrones fans are sure to witness many deaths in season 8, but rumor has it that the show’s most painful casualty will come after the series finale. As Netflix firehoses content and cashed-up streaming services keep emerging to transform media giants’ intellectual property into profit, critics like me have been fretting over the seemingly inevitable demise of television as mass cultural event. That panic has crystalized around Game of Thrones—a series that remains both hugely popular and widely respected at a time when ratings and prestige sometimes seem mutually exclusive.
This kind of consensus hit can be really healthy for a society as fragmented as ours. Divided by class, politics and identity, we can at least come together to watch Game of Thrones—which averaged 32.8 million legal viewers in season seven. If fantasy buffs, academics, TV critics, proponents of Strong Female Characters, the Gay of Thrones crew, Black Twitter, Barack Obama, J. Lo, Tom Brady and Beyoncé are all losing their minds over the same thing at the same time, the demise of that collective obsession is worth lamenting—or so the argument goes. Yet I’m not sure I agree. As anyone who’s found themselves in the crosshairs of a massive online fan community can tell you, an entertainment monoculture isn’t inherently good. A lively cultural conversation may be desirable, but the content of that conversation matters. And when it comes to Game of Thrones, I’m not convinced that this particular discourse still deserves the hand-wringing.
This is partly the fault of the show itself. Stellar performances, an HBO pedigree and early seasons that invested as much energy in character development and ideological conflicts as they now devote to dragon-vs.-zombie combat made Game of Thrones the kind of drama everyone was obliged to take seriously from the beginning. (Even the criticisms about rape and arguably exploitative depictions of female characters that have followed the show for the entirety of its run presuppose that viewers should expect more sophistication out of this narrative than the typical fantasy quest.)
It’s become a very different story since creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss started diverging from George R.R. Martin’s source material, which they ran out of entirely in season five. Episodes like “Battle of the Bastards” and season five’s beyond-the-Wall battle “Hardhome” (both directed by Miguel Sapochnik) were technical marvels on a scale that TV had never even attempted before. But it’s telling that these moments, rather than character beats or ethical dilemmas, now generate the most anticipation and analysis. Viewers who need more out of serialized narratives than expensive spectacles have spent the past few seasons mourning the wittier, more thought-provoking show that was. Now, episodes feel too thematically slight to justify all the chatter they inspire.
A lot of that talk has revolved around clues, Easter eggs and subtle callbacks to scenes that aired in 2011 or 2012. To some extent, that’s a natural trajectory for a show with such grand ambitions. Game of Thrones spent years building Westeros (and its viewership, which has more than tripled since season 1); the payoff is a captive audience’s immersion in that world’s history and lore. Yet there’s a difference between making the most of an established setting and letting minutiae overtake big ideas. Meanwhile, for reasons that have as much to do with the Redditization of cultural criticism as they do with the series’ devolution into pure plot, more substantive conversations of the kind early seasons encouraged have gotten drowned out by fan theories, publicity stunts and character stanning—the kind of stuff that makes my eyes glaze over. Millions of us watched Daenerys and Jon Snow consummate their icky romance, sure. What did it do for us as a society?
This isn’t an indictment of TV that entertains more than it provokes thought. (That would be pretty hypocritical coming from someone who relishes every second of Lindsay Lohan’s Beach Club!) Still, with something like 500 scripted series airing every year, it’s fair to ask: Why is Game of Thrones the one current show we can all supposedly agree is good, profound and—despite the incest and magic—applicable to everything? Many of the answers are obvious: It’s based on widely loved books. It predated the streaming boom. It’s a one-stop shop for TV-MA violence and invariably odd sex. HBO has sunk enormous sums of money into it, including a marketing budget sufficient to make the announcement of a distant premiere date break the internet.
This is another way of saying that Game of Thrones has flourished largely because it was set up to flourish—because the people who bankroll prestige television decided before the first season even went into production that this story of battles, bastards and butts was worth an episodic budget three times as large as that of the typical cable series. In turn, the kind of viewers who subscribed to a channel that once had the tagline “it’s not TV, it’s HBO”—a group that traditionally values the opinions of critics—who might otherwise have dismissed the show, sight unseen, as genre trash embraced it instead.
Again, this isn’t a bad thing in isolation. Water-cooler TV of generations past was grounded in the particulars of contemporary American life; even Seinfeld sparked debate over social norms. But authors from Edgar Allan Poe to Octavia Butler have long since proven the myopia of genre snobbery and demonstrated that genre fiction can speak just as eloquently to the human experience as realism.
What’s frustrating is how narrow the brand of entertainment populism that elevated Game of Thrones to such an exalted plane of cultural significance, and kept it there even as the quality of its storytelling slipped, tends to be. As in the movies, it seldom seems to benefit genres or audiences that aren’t predominantly white and male. There are exceptions: Black Panther. Gone Girl. The Good Wife. But most of the time, even the best genre releases that center underserved demographics rarely get the funding or a priori respect they deserve. Despite constant calls to diversify Hollywood, the assumption that everyone wants to watch white guys and white guys only want to watch themselves is far from dead.
Consider Get Out, which overcame a February release and a budget less than a third the size of one Game of Thrones season 8 episode on its way to becoming a classic “social thriller.” One of HBO’s biggest hits in recent years, the female-focused whodunit Big Little Lies, has the sizable budget that comes with A-list producer-stars like Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman. (Would the adaptation of Liane Moriarty’s novel even have gotten made without them?) Yet plenty of critics initially dismissed it as a glossy soap, failing to see that it uses Lifetime clichés just as smartly and subversively as George R.R. Martin uses fantasy tropes.
As the monoculture of Game of Thrones mania reassembles in anticipation of one last season, the genre show that has crossed my mind most often is Killing Eve. The devilishly smart, fun, layered, female-led spy thriller debuted quietly last spring on BBC America, a channel previously best known for importing Doctor Who. It saw consistent week-over-week audience growth throughout its first season—a rare feat—thanks to a vocal fan base. And after months of muted praise, Eve turned out to be critics’ single favorite series of 2018. This past Sunday, its season two premiere bested its season one finale in the ratings by an impressive 67 percent. In terms of viewership as well as mass-cultural impact, it still doesn’t compare to Game of Thrones. But it’s worth considering that the discrepancy might say more about the biases of check signers and gatekeepers than it does about the quality, relevance or potential widespread appeal of each show.
Of course it’s nice to have a show that can serve as a cultural lingua franca, especially now that Americans of different ages, races, religions, regions, countries of origin, genders, sexualities and education levels so rarely seem to understand each other. Yet I can’t say I’ll really miss that shared experience when all we’re ever talking about is whether an ice dragon can kill a fire dragon and who (if anyone) will end up on the Iron Throne. In any case, amid a TV landscape whose dizzying expansion has fostered scores of “niche” shows that speak to so many different kinds of people, it seems crazy to go to pieces over the loss of Game of Thrones. If the price of variety and visibility is consensus, I’m happy to pay it.

"Abdul Qadir Sediqi, Rupam Jain","Afghan men stand in front of a collapsed building of a military base after a car bomb attack in Maidan Wardak, Afghanistan, Jan. 21, 2019.
STRINGER/Reuters
A Taliban attack in central Afghanistan on Monday killed scores of security personnel, officials said, with some estimates putting the death toll at more than 100, amid government silence about one of the most deadly insurgent attacks in months.
Attackers rammed a captured military Humvee packed with explosives into a training centre of the National Directorate for Security in Maidan Wardak province, west of the capital Kabul. At least two gunmen followed up, spraying the compound with gunfire before they were shot down.
We have information that 126 people have been killed in the explosion inside the military training centre, eight special commandoes are among the dead, said a senior official in the defence ministry in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Local officials also said that scores of troops and NDS personnel were killed in the attack but there was no official confirmation of the casualty toll, with officials ordered not to talk to media for fear of damaging morale.
A Taliban attack on an Afghan military compound killed over a hundred security forces on Monday. Hours later the militant group announced it had met with the U.S. special envoy to the country.Reuters
I have been told not to make the death toll figures public. It is frustrating to hide the facts, said a senior interior ministry official in Kabul.
The complex attack on a highly secured base underlined the heavy pressure facing Afghan security forces as increasingly confident Taliban fighters have stepped up operations, even as diplomatic efforts to agree a peaceful settlement to the conflict have begun.
Taliban insurgents, fighting to drive out international forces from Afghanistan and reintroduce their version of strict Islamic law, claimed responsibility for the attack, which spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said killed 190 people.
The attack, the most serious against Afghan forces in months, occurred on the same day that Taliban representatives met Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, in Qatar.
Last week, Taliban fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 in the capital, Kabul but casualties from Mondays attack appear to have been far higher.
MANY DEAD BODIES
Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak, said he saw the bodies of 35 members of the Afghan forces in the hospital.

Story continues below advertisement
Many more were killed. Several bodies were transported to Kabul city and many injured were transferred to hospitals in Kabul, said Hotak, adding that the government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in morale of the Afghan forces.
Mondays attack caused the biggest casualty total suffered by Afghan forces since August 2018, when the Taliban overran central Ghazni province. That confrontation killed 150 Afghan security forces and 95 civilians dead, as well as hundreds of Taliban fighters, said officials then.
President Ashraf Ghanis office said in a statement the enemies of the country had carried out the attack and had killed and wounded a number of our beloved and honest sons.
In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures but U.S. commanders have said repeatedly that the losses being suffered by Afghan forces are unsustainable. Last year Ghani said 28,000 Afghan police officers and soldiers had been killed since 2015.
The British embassy in Afghanistan said Mondays casualties were a stark reminder of the sacrifice the Afghan security and defence forces make for their country.",Taliban attack on security base in Afghanistan kills more than 100 The Globe and Mail Taliban kill more than 100 Afghan security force members with car bomb CBC.ca Taliban militants kill dozens at Afghan intelligence base BBC News Taliban kill ‘more than 100 …,2019-01-21T14:26:47Z,"{'id': 'the-globe-and-mail', 'name': 'The Globe And Mail'}",Taliban attack on security base in Afghanistan kills more than 100 - The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-taliban-attack-kills-more-than-100-at-military-compound-in-afghanistan/,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/yZYRRGQKxKX8DhInWeBnIw6ZSgA=/1200x0/filters:quality(80)/arc-anglerfish-tgam-prod-tgam.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WRTQT236RFATVLCYVQWMVJCGCI.JPG,the-globe-and-mail,The Globe And Mail,casualty,1
Dell Cameron,"The head of the U.S. intelligence community is no longer required to publish an annual report detailing the number of civilians and enemy combatants killed in U.S. drone strikes abroad.
President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Wednesday revoking the reporting requirement, which had been implemented in the Obama administrations final year.
Section 3 of Executive Order 13732 made it a requirement for the director of national intelligence (DNI) to make public, on the first of each May, an unclassified summary of combatant and non-combatant deaths resulting from the strikes.
The order, which calls civilian deaths a tragic and at times unavoidable consequence of the use of force, states that minimizing such casualties is key to maintaining the support of partner governments and vulnerable populations, and further helps to enhance the legitimacy and sustainability of U.S. operations critical to national security.
Last year, the Washington Post reported that the Trump administration had simply ignored the order. But now it doesnt have to. 
The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for the 2018 fiscal year set up a similar obligation for the secretary of defense to report the number of civilians killed by drones to congressional defense committees each year. The bill was expanded for 2019 to say that the casualty report shall be made available to the public at the same time it is submitted to Congress, unless the secretary of defense certifies that doing so poses a threat to the national security interests of the United States.
Wednesdays executive order has no effect on the NDAAs reporting requirements.
Nonpartisan think-tank New America reported last month that, as compared to the previous administration, Trump had tripled the number of strikes in Somalia in a quarter of the time. In Yemen, where the U.S. has been fighting al-Qaida for well over a decade, Obama racked up 184 strikes over his eight years in office; Trump racked up about half that number in only two.
The Associated Press reported in November that, over the course of a year, around a third of the people killed by drones in Yemen counted as civilian casualties.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The pursuit of better drone technology in the U.S. has sparked outrage among employees of some tech companies contracted by the Pentagon over fears that their contributions may be used in lethal work.
Googles involvement in Project Maven, which seeks to develop artificial intelligence for analyzing drone footage, was first reported by Gizmodo last March. The subsequent backlash among Google employees, around a dozen of whom resigned in protest, ultimately pressured the company not to renew its Maven contract with the Pentagon.",The head of the U.S. intelligence community is no longer required to publish an annual report detailing the number of civilians and enemy combatants killed in U.S. drone strikes abroad.

NICHOLAS FANDOS,"Border security and immigration issues are important, and we should deal with them, but we can deal with several important issues at the same time, said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. We cant put the rest of the business of government on hold while these issues, important though they are, are resolved.
For House Democrats, the return to normal governance provides a window to reclaim some of the attention the shutdown drained from the initial rollout of their legislative agenda. House Democratic leaders had insisted when they took control early this month that the shutdown would not impact their carefully choreographed agenda rollout. But it did.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and her allies plan to hold a ceremony on Wednesday to formally reintroduce the Paycheck Fairness Act, a measure designed to equalize pay between men and women that Democrats have tried to enact for 20 years. Like other bills under consideration in the House, it is unlikely to be taken up by the Republican-controlled Senate, but it is a key piece of Democrats messaging to voters ahead of the 2020 elections.
Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Trump also are likely to renew discussion in the coming days about a date to reschedule the presidents State of the Union address, which was previously scheduled for Tuesday and became a casualty of the shutdown. Last week, Ms. Pelosi rescinded her invitation for the president to address Congress while the government was still shuttered, and has said subsequently that the two sides will work to find an agreeable date in the future to allow time to prepare.
On the House floor, Democrats will bring up a vote on legislation that would give nonmilitary federal workers a pay raise in line with the pay increase members of the military have received. The legislation, if it became law, would override an executive order issued by Mr. Trump a week into the shutdown that froze civilian federal pay.
The House Armed Services Committee will hold a hearing on Tuesday about the cost and rationale behind the deployment by Mr. Trump of thousands of active duty troops to the southern border. Representative Adam Smith of Washington, the committees chairman, said in a statement that there has not been adequate justification for the use of our military personnel in this way.
And the Judiciary Committee will hold the first hearing on the For the People Act to start building support for the legislation that would overhaul key aspects of the way federal elections are financed and held. In an interview, Mr. Nadler ticked off a dozen or so other policy areas awaiting attention by his committee alone.","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the Capitol on Friday.

"Jordan Weissmann, Jordan Weissmann","Donald Trump’s new trade war appears to have claimed its first casualty. The New York Times reports that Gary Cohn, the president’s top economic adviser, is preparing to quit the White House. Anonymous officials tell the paper there is no “ single factor” behind Cohn’s decision to resign. But the timing is rather hard to ignore. Trump is preparing to impose large tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, a move that Cohn opposes. The National Economic Council director has been mounting an internal persuasion campaign to convince Trump to water down the plan he unexpectedly announced last week. But as of now, it looks like protectionists in the White House are winning the debate, and Cohn has had enough. “Gary has been my chief economic adviser and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again,” Trump said in a statement to Times. “He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.” That may sound like pro forma praise for a departing lieutenant. But while Cohn may be exiting on a bit of a low note, having lost an important brawl over economic policy, one could argue that of all the major Trump administration officials to bail thus far, he is the only one to have accomplished his major goal. As the former president of Goldman Sachs, Cohn was the unofficial leader of the White House’s Wall Street wing—capital’s inside man on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, a status that earned him the not-so-subtly anti-Semitic nickname “Globalist Gary” from the administration’s Breitbart contingent. (Cohn is Jewish.) With his commanding frame and ex-trader’s personality, he quickly won the president’s esteem, and for a while, Trump even considered picking Cohn to be the next Federal Reserve chair. But Cohn’s chances at the job apparently collapsed after he decided to publicly criticize the Trump’s response to the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, during which the president blamed neo-Nazis and counterprotesters for the deadly violence that erupted. Cohn reportedly considered leaving the White House after the Charlottesville disgrace, going so far as to draw up a resignation letter (a fact which someone of course leaked to press, just so everybody knew just how upset Cohn was). But instead, he stayed on, and ultimately helped oversee the administration’s successful push to massively slash taxes for corporations. He wasn’t always the smoothest public salesman for the effort. He once kvelled that corporate CEOs were the “most excited group out there” about the bill, thus undercutting the Republican Party’s message that their tax cuts would mainly help workers. There was the awkward hand-raising incident. But ultimately, Cohn helped get the job done. And his friends in the banking industry were, of course, one of the biggest winners from the bill. Gary Cohn: The man who swallowed the president’s racism and personal humiliation in order to guide tax cuts for his old employer at Goldman Sachs, and then quit over some steel tariffs. Wall Street is sure to welcome him back as a hero.","Donald Trump’s new trade war appears to have claimed its first casualty.

Shan Wang,"What We’re Following Sessions Out: Attorney General Jeff Sessions—who recused himself from the Russia investigation in 2017—handed in his resignation just a day after the midterm elections, forced out by President Donald Trump. His new replacement has in the past expressed skepticism about the reach of the Russia investigation —which he’ll now oversee. While there’s no denying Sessions has been an efficient lieutenant for Trump’s policy priorities, his relationship with the president has been on the rocks for some time, and many of Trump’s evangelical allies disliked him as well.

(Debra Reid / AP) Evening Read America’s political divides cut many ways. But one other widening gulf is the partisan divide among college-educated white voters and non-college-educated ones: There’s a question that splits Americans neatly in two. Every year, on its American Values Survey, the Public Religion Research Institute asks Americans whether they “think American culture and way of life has mostly changed for the better, or has it mostly changed for the worse?” Fifty percent of Americans say that it’s gotten better in this year’s poll, and 47 percent say that it has gotten worse. But for white voters, the answer to that question is split by education level. Fifty-eight percent of college-educated whites this year say that America has gotten better since 1950, while 57 percent of non-college-educated whites say that it’s gotten worse. When President Trump says “Make America great again,” the again is instructive. He’s capitalizing on the nostalgia that non-college-educated white voters have for America’s past. Read on.

Uri Friedman,"When Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev solemnly signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty at the White House, the leaders of the world’s superpowers hailed the transition from an era of “mounting risk of nuclear war” to one marked by the “demilitarization of human life.” But when Donald Trump unceremoniously declared the treaty dead over the weekend, the mood was different. After taking a shot at Barack Obama for not pulling out of the agreement in response to Russian violations, the president complained about how unfair it is that Russia and China get to “do weapons” that “we’re not allowed to” and boasted of the hundreds of billions of dollars that the U.S. military could “play with” were it to build new nuclear weapons of its own. The demilitarization of human life this was not. The Trump administration has yet to formally withdraw from the INF treaty, but if the president makes good on his pledge the move would be massively significant. Here’s why. What exactly is the INF treaty? For decades during the Cold War, the United States had been obsessed with defending the homeland against the Soviet Union’s nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles. But by the late 1970s, it confronted a new threat from the Soviet nuclear arsenal: the deployment of shorter-range ballistic missiles capable of targeting America’s NATO allies with little advance notice. The United States responded with what the inexorable logic of the Cold War demanded: stationing similar missiles in Western Europe, capable of striking the Soviet Union. But it simultaneously pursued negotiations that culminated in a 1987 agreement between Reagan and Gorbachev. [ Kori Schake: Trump ] is right to leave this nuclear agreement The INF treaty required the United States and Soviet Union to permanently eliminate all ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers—the types of weapons systems, numbering in the thousands, that precipitated the showdown in Europe. In effect, it eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons. Along with the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which drastically reduced the number of long-range Soviet and American nuclear weapons, it was critical in ending the nuclear-arms race. Why has Trump decided to ditch it? The United States and Russia have for years been trading accusations that the other party is violating the INF treaty (Russia purportedly with a banned cruise missile, the U.S. allegedly with its missile-defense systems in Eastern Europe). But they have persisted with the agreement. Less than a year ago, the Trump administration unveiled a strategy of sticking with the INF while pressuring Russia into compliance through a mix of diplomacy, sanctions, and talk of researching and developing prohibited weapons systems of its own if necessary. As recently as this summer, Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, was still describing the INF to reporters as “probably the most successful treaty in [the] history of arms control.” What’s changed is that National Security Adviser John Bolton now appears to have “the president’s ear on this issue,” Kingston Reif, the director of disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association, a nonpartisan organization that seeks to raise awareness about arms-control efforts, told me. Bolton, a proto-America Firster who joined the Trump administration in the spring, has long opposed international arms-control and nuclear nonproliferation agreements that he has claimed are utterly ineffectual or intolerable infringements on the United States’ freedom of action. During the George W. Bush administration, he helped engineer the U.S. withdrawal from a treaty with Russia limiting anti-ballistic missile systems and an agreement with North Korea rolling back its nuclear program, and he championed Washington’s exit from the Iran nuclear deal under Trump. In 2011, well before the United States was calling out Russia for violating the INF, Bolton argued for either bringing new countries into the treaty or scrapping the accord entirely, since it constrained America’s ability to counter rival nuclear powers like China and nuclear aspirants like Iran and North Korea. (Even without its own intermediate-range missiles near China, Iran, and North Korea, the United States can still deter these countries with other elements of its nuclear-weapons arsenal such as nuclear-capable aircraft and submarines.) Trump has made a strikingly similar case—condemning the treaty for rendering the United States shackled and outgunned by a resurgent Russia and rising China, even as he floats the idea of one day reviving and expanding the agreement to include other nuclear-armed states. [ Rand Paul: The U.S. must engage with Russia ] Richard Burt, who helped negotiate the INF treaty during the Reagan administration, said that while he’d “love to believe that this is a very clever strategy to get leverage over the Russians” and compel them to adhere to the terms of the treaty, he seriously doubts it. Instead, he thinks Trump’s decision is an effort to shake off restraints and assert unfettered American sovereignty—just as the administration has done by withdrawing from the Paris climate pact and trade agreements. What happens next? History teaches that leaders only agree to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons when they improve relations with adversaries and no longer fear the types of war they once did, the nuclear-weapons expert George Perkovich once told me. If that’s the case, however, the inverse is also true: When the ranks of adversaries swell and the specter of war looms large, nuclear build-ups are a natural temptation. Trump’s intention to quit the INF and hesitancy to renew another Obama-era nuclear arms-control accord with Russia are in one sense symptoms of just how fierce competition between the world’s great powers has become. In walking away from the treaty, the president is recognizing a “changed reality” in both technological and strategic terms, Bolton declared on Tuesday during a visit to Russia. Burt, who is now a managing partner at the firm McLarty Associates, predicted that a U.S. withdrawal from the INF treaty would prompt Russia to again deploy intermediate-range missiles and the United States to react by rolling out new sea- and air-based weapons systems even if they don’t redeploy ground-based missiles to Europe. (America’s NATO allies, which might not agree to host these missiles, have so far reacted to Trump’s announcement with a mix of praise and criticism.) He added that the United States and Russia are now both pouring vast sums of money into upgrading strategic bombers, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and shiny new objects like hypersonic glide vehicles and anti-satellite systems. [ Read: Trump’s pointless untruths about U.S. nuclear weapons ] “We’re in a process of sleepwalking into a new nuclear-arms race” with no restraints, Burt told me. When he served in government, in the 1980s, there was “a hypersensitivity [to] and awareness of the dangers of a nuclear conflict.” No longer. What does all this mean for efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons? When it comes to arms-control and nuclear-nonproliferation agreements, Donald Trump has shown himself to be a consummate dealbreaker. At the same time, in his pursuit of a nuclear deal with North Korea, a better nuclear deal with Iran, and now an expanded INF treaty with Russia and China, he has yet to prove himself a dealmaker. Taken together, the moves could not just encourage an arms race among nuclear-armed states, but push other countries to consider whether they too want to add such weapons. “The existing framework for nuclear control and constraints is unraveling,” Burt noted. “If the two largest nuclear powers are walking away from arms-control agreements, it provides an excuse for other countries to acquire nuclear weapons.” “It’s easy to look back [at the Cold War] and say, ‘Gee, we avoided a nuclear conflict because we were so smart.’ I happen to think it was ‘we were very lucky,’” he continued. “And if we’re going to go through another nuclear-arms race, this time we might not be that lucky.”",The next casualty of President Trump’s suspicion of multilateral deals could be a 30-year-old arms accord with Russia.,2018-10-24T14:14:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Theatlantic.com'}",Trump Hates International Treaties.

Talia Lakritz,"At around 9:12 a.m. on Saturday morning, the Chico Fire Department, Police Department, and Butte County EMS responded to a report of a ""mass casualty"" overdose that killed one man and left 12 injured, according to KHSL-TV. 
 Mike O'Brien, a police captain in Chico, California, said at a news conference on Saturday night that four of the victims were in critical condition, NBC reported. 
 ""Certainly there's potential for additional fatalities,"" he said at a news conference. ""I want to emphasize that."" 
 O'Brien also said that there is ""every indication"" that this mass overdose was caused by the ingestion of fentanyl combined with another substance and that it appears that the victims all knew each other. The source of the drugs is not yet known, and the victims have not yet been identified. 
 Chico Fire Department Division Chief Jesse Alexander said that there were six people receiving CPR at the same time, according to KHSL-TV. Two of the first responders who administered CPR and Naloxone, a treatment for opiod overdoses, were also hospitalized and subsequently released. The scene is being treated as a hazmat site. 
 Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, according to the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). In 2017, drug overdoses led to 70,237 deaths, and more than two-thirds involved opioids. 
 Chico Fire Department Chief Steven Standridge called it a ""large, mass casualty incident"" at the news conference. 
 KRCR News Channel 7 wrote on Twitter that one of their reporters, Meaghan Mackey, was attacked while reporting from the scene and is ""very shaken up but is okay."" 
 Video of the incident was seemingly ripped from a live stream and posted on Facebook. Mackey begins delivering a report but was interrupted by someone off-camera saying ""this is disrespectful"" before the camera falls to the ground and screams are heard.

Kelly McLaughlin,"A 23-year-old man from Utah was arrested after threatening to use a 3-D-printed gun to commit a mass shooting at a small Salt Lake City university, police say. Austin James David West, of South Jordan, was charged August 9 with a misdemeanor of making a threat of violence. He was arrested a day earlier after talking with a fellow student at Broadview University ""about using a gun to shoot students,"" a police report seen by Deseret News said. West also sent texts on August 7 to another student saying he would commit a shooting that ""people would be talking about,"" according to a search warrant unsealed in court on Tuesday. ""The text messages sent by the suspect reference killing people with a 3-D-printed gun so the gun could not be traced back to him,"" the warrant stated. It continued: ""The message contained images of what appears to be a male in a video holding a rifle while standing over another male that is lying on the ground."" His statements were reported to the university, prompting the dean to email faculty and students warning them of the threat. The student who received the messages told police that West ""has a fascination with firearms and violence."" ""(He) described Austin as being quite interested in serial killers, school shooters and other mass casualty type events. He described Austin as liking up close and personal violence such as wounds caused by a knife,"" according to the affidavit. ""(He) believed Austin could be capable of committing a mass casualty type event such as a school shooting."" A gun expert told KUTV that 3-D-printed guns are not yet advanced enough to carry out mass shootings. Clark Aposhian, a chairman for the Utah Shooting Sports Council and a gun expert, said: ""It's like holding a firecracker in your hand; it's going to hurt."" He also said a gunman would likely get one or two shots out of a 3-D-printed gun before it started to break down. News of West's arrest comes after a Seattle judge approved a motion to block Texas-based Defense Distributed founder Cody Wilson from releasing the blueprints to 3-D-printed guns online. Nineteen states and Washington, DC, had sought an injection to stop the release of the blueprints. The states argued that online access to the undetectable guns would pose as a security risk. Meanwhile, Wilson said on Tuesday that he had started selling the blueprints online regardless of the court order.","Austin James David West, 23, was arrested after allegedly making threats to commit a mass shooting at Broadview University, police say.

Patrick Allan,"Last week, the United States and its allies France and the UK fired 105 missiles — most of them Tomahawks —at Syrian targets in an attempt to prevent future chemical attacks in the Syrian Civil War. But what are the alleged chemical weapons being used? And what exactly do they do to people? Here’s what you need to know. Check the news and you’re guaranteed to hear to about conflict in some part of the world. But… Read more Read Sarin Sarin is an odorless and colorless liquid that is an extremely potent nerve agent. It’s often released in the air as a vapor spray or aerosol in a target area. Once a lethal dose of the vapor is inhaled, it causes lung muscle paralysis, and, depending on the amount inhaled, death can occur within one to 10 minutes. Even those who do not inhale a lethal dose of the chemical, or absorb some through the skin, can suffer permanent neurological damage. The production and stockpiling of sarin was outlawed in 1997 by the United Nations’ Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993, and it is now considered a Schedule 1 substance. The U.S. stopped production of sarin as far back as 1957. Still, the substance has been used by a Japanese cult to attack civilians on the subway, as well as by Iraqi insurgents, and it’s still being used in the ongoing Syrian Civil War. Chlorine Gas Chlorine gas, also known as bertholite, might sound similar to the stuff that keeps swimming pools clean, but it most definitely is not. The substance is a remnant of the deadly chemical weapons used during World War I. Once the gas is released in the air, victims smell something akin to pepper and pineapple, then are overwhelmed with a metallic taste in the mouth. Then comes stinging in the throat and chest as it attacks the respiratory system, eyes, and skin. Once chlorine gas has reached the lungs, it reacts with moisture to form hydrochloric acid, essentially burning from the inside out. The gas is arguably less deadly than sarin or mustard gas because it can be filtered out with gas masks, but not many civilians have them on hand. It has been used in the Iraq War in 2007, against Kurdish forces in Iraq in 2015, and the Syrian government has allegedly used it in the form of barrel bombs and rockets as recently as January and February of this year. Mustard Gas Like chlorine gas, mustard gas ( or sulfur mustard ) is a chemical weapon that originated with WWI trench warfare. The substance is a cytotoxic and vesicant chemical agent, so it causes blistering of both the skin and lungs of its victims. The chemical is also mutagenic and carcinogenic, meaning it can cause genetic mutations as well as cancer. Victims rarely suffer immediate symptoms, so many are unknowingly exposed to high dosages and may feel completely normal at first. And the substance easily penetrates common clothing fabrics like wool and cotton, so it’s hard to protect the skin. Once exposed, victims smell an odor similar to mustard plants, garlic, or horseradish. Soon, they begin to feel intense itching and skin irritation over the next 24 hours. Gradually, those irritated areas become a chemical burn and victims develop blisters filled with a yellow fluid ( here’s the least graphic photo I could find ). These burns can range anywhere from first-degree burns to deadly third-degree burns. If one’s eyes are exposed during an attack, blindness is also a possibility. During a hearing on October 12th, experts warned the U.S. House of Representatives that an EMP… Read more Read Technically, mustard gas isn’t even a gas; it’s a fine mist of liquid droplets dispensed from a device (be it artillery shells, bombs, missiles, or spraying from planes overhead), much like sarin. These pure sulfur mustards are actually colorless liquids, but when used in chemical warfare, the “gas” appears to be a nauseating yellow-brown—hence the name. Mustard gas saw most of its use in the first World War, but has since been used during attacks in the U.K., Spain, France, China, and all over the Middle East, including Syria’s Civil War. Agent 15 Agent 15, or 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate (NATO code “BZ”), is an odorless, non-lethal “psycho-chemical” or hallucinogenic nerve agent used by militaries to incapacitate targets. “Agent 15"" is the name for the supposed Iraqi military brand of the substance. Once inhaled or ingested, it messes with the central nervous system, causing abrupt changes in mental status and delirium. Overdose of the substance can be deadly. The disturbing film Jacob’s Ladder is loosely based on the longterm effects of the chemical agent. In recent years, Syrian contacts have suggested that Agent 15 was used in an attack in Homs, but there hasn’t been enough evidence to confirm. Agent 15 was also allegedly used in an attack on Ghouta in 2013. VX Agent This synthetic chemical compound is considered to be the deadliest nerve agent known to man, but is extremely rare in its use. VX agent, or “ venomous agent x,” is extremely toxic and kills very quickly. Once administered, either via direct spray or the poisoning of food or water, victims experience violent convulsions, followed by unconsciousness, paralysis, and finally death. The best way to describe the way it works is a “pesticide for people,” gradually tiring and suffocating the body.

Perhaps what’s worst about the substance is that it evaporates extremely slowly, so it persists in the environment it was used.

"Associated Press, Yuri Kageyama, Associated Press","This picture shows an aerial view of flooded houses in Saka Town, Hiroshima prefecture on July 7, 2018. (Photo: STR, AFP/Getty Images) TOKYO – Torrents of rainfall and flooding battered a widespread area in southwestern Japan on Saturday, with local media casualty reports climbing quickly. Public broadcaster NHK said 38 people were dead, four were injured seriously and 47 were missing. Television footage showed a residential area in Okayama prefecture seeped in brown water spreading like a huge lake. Some people fled to rooftops and balconies and waved furiously at hovering rescue helicopters. Okayama prefecture said a man caught in a landslide died, and six others were missing. Evacuation orders had been issued to more than 360,000 people, the prefecture said in a statement. Throughout the affected areas, parked cars sat in pools of water. NHK TV said water had reached as high as 16 feet in the worst-hit areas. Kyodo news service, which put the death tally at 34 people, said one death was in a landslide in Hiroshima, which had set off a fire, while the body of a child was found in another area. NHK said a woman died in her home in Hiroshima when it got buried in a mudslide. Assessing overall casualties was a challenge because of the widespread damage. NHK repeatedly urged those awaiting rescue to not lose hope. In Ehime prefecture, a woman was found dead on the second floor of a home hit by a landslide, Kyodo said. Also in Ehime, two elementary-school girls and their mother who got sucked into a mudslide were rescued but their hearts weren’t beating, it said. Kyoto prefecture said it was working to control flooding at several dams and identified one fatality as a 52-year-old woman. Military water trucks were rushing to areas where water systems were no longer working, Okayama prefecture said. Troops in camouflage outfits helped people and pets reach dry land on small military boats. Evacuation orders or advisories were sent for 4.72 million people, and 48,000 members of the Self-Defense Forces, police and firefighters were mobilized for search missions, according to Kyodo. As of Saturday, 1.6 million people have evacuated, according to the Guardian.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Members of the Taliban delegation take their seats at the Moscow talks Russia is hosting a landmark international meeting on Afghanistan aimed at kick-starting peace talks after decades of war. It is the first time representatives of the Taliban militant group have attended such an event. Russia's foreign minister said their presence, along with members of Afghanistan's High Peace Council, could help pave the way for direct talks. About a dozen other countries, including the US, are also attending. ""We discussed the subject of direct talks with the Taliban and asked them to choose the place and the starting time,"" said a High Peace Council spokesman, Russia's RIA news agency reported. The Taliban have said the meeting is ""not about negotiating with any side"". Western officials and the Afghan government view the Moscow talks with some suspicion - some fear it could derail other efforts at negotiations. Countries also present in Moscow include China, Pakistan, Iran, India and Central Asian states. So how big a deal is this meeting? Observers do not expect quick results from the Moscow talks - previous attempts at brokering a peace process have all failed. But the fact that the Taliban are in the same room as Afghan delegates, in Russia, with the US also in attendance is seen as significant. Russia and the Taliban, for example, are historic foes, although they have begun talking in recent years. US and Afghan forces have been fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan for more than a decade. And the US and Russia are former Cold War enemies who are still mistrustful of each other. 'It's triumph for Russian diplomacy' By Dawood Azami, BBC World Service The Moscow meeting highlights Russia's return to the diplomatic forefront in Afghan affairs. Image copyright AFP Image caption Afghans tired of war recently walked hundreds of kilometres across the country to demand an end to the conflict It's the first time that Moscow has invited the Afghan Taliban, who sent a high-level delegation. Both the US and the Afghan government don't want Russia to lead such an initiative, known as the ""Moscow Format"". But despite reservations by some, all 11 countries invited by Moscow are participating in different ways. Again, this is a first and unprecedented. Although no significant breakthroughs are expected, bringing all the relevant players under one roof is a huge success for Russian diplomacy. Russia is in a unique position to host such a meeting as it is the only country on talking terms with all players. Who are the Taliban? The Taliban emerged in the early 1990s following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, shortly before the demise of the Soviet Union. Image caption The Taliban have vastly strengthened their hand on the battlefield in recent years The militants went on to rule Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, until they were driven from power by US-led troops following the 9/11 attacks, which the US blamed on al-Qaeda militants who were hosted by the Taliban. The Taliban's power and reach have surged since foreign combat troops left Afghanistan in 2014. They say their international status will be further strengthened by going to Moscow. Research carried out by the BBC in January suggested that the Taliban were openly active in almost 70% of Afghanistan at the time, while being in control of 14 districts, or 4% of the country. Are there other peace moves? The US is engaged in its own direct talks with the Taliban and attending these meetings in Moscow is significant. It turned down an invitation to the first meeting Russia hosted last year. But this time the US said a representative from its embassy in Moscow would attend to ""observe the discussions"". Media caption Taliban ""threaten 70% of Afghanistan"", BBC investigation finds The Taliban sent a five-member delegation from its political office based in Qatar. It emerged in July that Taliban officials secretly met a senior US diplomat in Qatar. Another round of talks were held last month. And there have been other signs of change. On Thursday, Pakistan confirmed it had freed a senior Taliban leader, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, from jail last month at the request of the US. ""He was released to provide impetus to the peace and reconciliation efforts in Afghanistan,"" said a Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman. In June the Afghan government and the Taliban agreed a three-day ceasefire to coincide with the end of the Ramadan fasting month, Eid. How costly has the war been? Given the high frequency and spread of Taliban violence, the Afghan security forces are overstretched and, in some cases, overwhelmed. Afghan forces have been fighting hard to stop the Taliban's expansion. But their casualty rate remains alarmingly high and appears to be increasing. Civilian deaths and injuries have also hit record highs. Casualty figures for the conflict, which began in 2001, are the highest since the UN started keeping records in 2009.","Russia hopes the meeting in Moscow, attended by the militants for the first time, will promote peace.",2018-11-09T14:50:52Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Afghanistan war: Taliban attend landmark peace talks,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46155189,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/294E/production/_104247501_07e24fab-0f00-49b1-87c4-34d522af0dc3.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,casualty,1
Vera Bergengruen,"The number of US troops who died in war zones rose in 2017, the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency, for the first time in six years. As of Dec. 28, at least 33 military personnel had been killed in war zones overseas compared to 26 last year, according to an analysis of casualty statements released by the Pentagon. At least 21 of those died in combat, according to the Pentagon — some in places where the US presence was not widely known. The total is a far cry from the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2007, when more than 1,000 US troops were killed. But the variety of places where US troops died in combat may indicate what lies ahead under an administration that has granted the military greater authority than its predecessors had to act without consulting leaders in Washington, DC. Former military officials and experts say 2017 also showed a worrisome trend toward less transparency about how and where US troops are killed. In June, the US military said it would no longer release immediate information about US combat deaths in Afghanistan. The Trump administration also has been opaque about troop levels in some countries such as Syria, where US officials finally acknowledged that 2,000, not 500, US forces were operating. High-profile combat deaths in Yemen, Niger, and Somalia this year led to the first realization for many Americans — and some members of Congress — that hundreds of US troops were fighting in those countries. The trend toward decreased transparency is also fueled by the growing reliance on US special forces, whose operations are shrouded in secrecy from the public and Congress. That is likely to mean that the circumstances of troop deaths in places like Yemen and Somalia will continue to be a mystery. The reliance on special forces also has meant the elite troops are dying at rates higher than conventional forces. Last year, for the first time, more commandos died than conventional forces, and that trend continued in 2017 — even though special forces make up only 5% of the US armed forces. In 2017, US special forces have served in 143 countries, or nearly three quarters of the nations in the world. There are currently 8,000 US special forces deployed in more than 80 countries — up from roughly 2,900 special forces in 2001. The longest conflict in US history, the war in Afghanistan, is in its 17th year, with the battle expanding to include ISIS-linked militants and a resurgent Taliban. Fifteen US service members died there in 2017, with the military categorizing at least 11 of them as hostile deaths. At least five were investigated as possible friendly fire incidents, including three killed by an Afghan soldier in June. In two other episodes in March, a total of 11 American soldiers were wounded by Afghan soldiers in so-called “green-on-blue” attacks in Helmand Province. In addition, 101 US troops were wounded in Afghanistan this year, according to Defense Department data. In August, Trump approved sending 3,000 more US troops to the country. There are now roughly 14,000 US troops in Afghanistan, according to the Pentagon. April 8 — Staff Sgt. Mark Alencar Staff Sgt. Mark R. De Alencar, 37, an Army Green Beret, was killed on April 8 in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, when his unit clashed with ISIS-affiliated forces. The US military has not released more details. To honor his promise to his stepdaughter, after his death more than 80 of Alencar’s fellow Green Berets went to her graduation from Niceville High School in Niceville, Florida, in June. April 27 — Sgt. Cameron Thomas Sgt. Joshua Rodgers Sgt. Cameron Thomas, 23, from Kettering, Ohio, and Sgt. Joshua Rodgers, 22, from Bloomington, Illinois, were killed April 27 in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, during a raid targeting an ISIS-affiliated militant leader that turned into an hours-long firefight. The two Army Rangers were on their third deployments. After the incident, the US military said it was investigating whether they were killed by friendly fire. June 10 — Sgt. Eric M. Houck Sgt. William M. Bays Cpl. Dillon C. Baldridge Sgt. Eric M. Houck, 25, from Baltimore, Maryland, Sgt. William M. Bays, 29, from Barstow, California, and Cpl. Dillon C. Baldridge, 22, from Youngsville, North Carolina, were killed in Nangahar Province when an Afghan soldier turned his weapon on them and opened fire. Houck was married to his high school sweetheart, with whom he had two children. His funeral was held on June 18, Father’s Day. Bays left behind a wife and three daughters. Baldrige’s father said his son had always wanted to be a soldier. ""He'd be up at five in the morning watching the Military Channel on TV,” his father told a local news outlet. “What kind of kid does that?"" July 3 — Pfc. Hansen Kirkpatrick Pfc. Hansen Kirkpatrick, 19, of Wasilla, Alaska, died after an attack in Helmand Province on July 3. Two other soldiers were wounded in the same attack, which the US military said it would investigate. Kirkpatrick deployed from Fort Bliss, Texas, in January with about 1,500 soldiers on a nine-month rotation in support of the NATO-led mission to train, advise, and assist Afghan security forces. Aug. 2 — Spc. Christopher Michael Harris Sgt. Jonathon Michael Hunter Spc. Christopher Harris, 25, of Jackson Springs, North Carolina, and Sgt. Jonathon Hunter, 23, of Columbus, Indiana, were killed in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar on Aug. 2 when a suicide bomber attacked a NATO convoy. The Taliban took responsibility for the attack, which also injured four other US service members. Both were part of the 82nd Airborne Division based in Fort Bragg, N.C. Harris had just recently learned his wife was pregnant. Hunter had spent a year studying music at Indiana State University with dreams of becoming a recording producer before joining the Army, his family said. He was just 32 days into his first deployment when he was killed. Aug.16 — Staff Sgt. Aaron R. Butler Army Staff Sgt. Aaron Butler, 27, of Monticello, Utah, died on Aug. 16 in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, when a structure that had been booby-trapped by ISIS militants exploded during an operation. The Green Beret had been in Afghanistan since April. The first Utah resident to die in combat since 2013, Butler was a four-time state wrestling champion who served a Mormon mission in Ghana after graduating high school in 2008. Nov. 4 — Sgt. 1st Class Stephen B. Cribben Army SFC Stephen Cribben, 33, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, a Green Beret, died in a combat operation the details of which have still not been released. Cribben’s family said he decided to enlist after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He left behind a wife and two young children. THE WAR AGAINST ISIS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA Nineteen US service members lost their lives this year supporting Operation Inherent Resolve, the name given to the US campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Five of those are listed as hostile deaths by the Pentagon, although few details have been released about the 14 “noncombat” casualties. Aug. 13 — Army Spc. Allen Levi Stigler Jr. Sgt. Roshain Euvince Brooks Army Spc. Allen Levi Stigler Jr., 22, of Arlington, Texas, and Sgt. Roshain Euvince Brooks, 30, of Brooklyn, New York, were killed on Aug. 13 when an artillery round meant to be fired at an ISIS target exploded prematurely at an undisclosed location in Iraq. Five other soldiers were injured in the incident. Stigler was on his first combat deployment and was expected to go home in a month when he was killed. Almost 100 members of a local Jeep and Truck club showed up to honor Stigler at his funeral. A citizen of Jamaica, Brooks moved to Brooklyn as a teenager and joined the Army in 2012. His father made headlines later in the year, when Trump claimed that unlike his predecessors he had called all families of fallen soldiers. “I said to my daughter, ‘Can you teach me to tweet, so I can tweet at the president and tell him he’s a liar?’” Brooks told the Washington Post. “You know when you hear people lying, and you want to fight? That’s the way I feel last night. He’s a damn liar.” Oct. 1 — Spc. Alexander Missildine Spc. Alexander Missildine, 20, of Tyler, Texas, was killed when an improvised explosive device exploded near his vehicle in Ninawa Province, Iraq. He joined the Army right after high school and had been in Iraq for less than a month, working as a motor transport operator, when he was killed. April 29 — 1st Lt. Weston Lee Army Lt. Weston Lee, a 25-year-old platoon leader with the US Army's 82nd Airborne Division, was killed on April 29 when an improvised explosive device exploded while he was on a patrol outside the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. A 2014 graduate of the University of North Georgia, he was on his first deployment. US special forces, many of them highly trained and experienced veterans of several deployments, died in places where the US military expanded operations in 2017, including Yemen, Niger, and Somalia. At least five US troops were killed in action serving in US Africa Command this year, the same number that died fighting ISIS as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. Jan. 29 — Chief Petty Officer Ryan Owens Chief Petty Officer William ""Ryan"" Owens, 36, of Peoria, Illinois, a Navy SEAL, was killed in Yemen in the first military action undertaken by the Trump administration. He died when what the US military says was an intelligence-gathering operation turned into a lengthy firefight. Three other US service members were injured when an MV-22 Osprey, sent to evacuate the wounded, lost power and crash-landed. Owens had enlisted in the Navy in 1998 and had three children. His father, Bill Owens, refused to meet with President Trump at Dover Air Force Base when his son’s body was returned. In his first address to Congress, Trump lauded Ryan Owens, and the chamber gave his widow, Carryn, an emotional standing ovation. May 5 — Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator Kyle Milliken Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator Kyle Milliken, 38, a Navy SEAL from Falmouth, Maine, was killed during an operation against al-Shabaab in a remote area of Somalia, about 40 miles west of the capital Mogadishu. He was killed a month after President Trump had approved the use of aggressive military operations and expanded airstrikes to target the group. He was the first US service member to be killed in action in Somalia since the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, which led to the deaths of 18 troops and inspired Black Hawk Down. A 15-year veteran who joined the Navy in 2002, he’d also deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, where in 2007 alone, he conducted 48 combat missions. He left behind a wife and two children. Oct. 4 — Sgt. La David Johnson Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson Staff Sgt. Bryan Black Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson, 39, of Springboro, Ohio; Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright, 29, of Lyons, Georgia; Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, 35, of Puyallup, Washington; and Sgt. La David Johnson, 25, of Miami Gardens, Florida, died when they were ambushed by ISIS-linked militants in the village of Tongo Tongo, near the Niger–Mali border, on Oct. 4. Their deaths shone a spotlight on the little-known operations of the US military in Niger and are still under investigation. Jeremiah Johnson owned his own business before he joined the Army in October 2007. He left behind his wife of 15 years, Crystal Johnson, and two teenage daughters. Wright, the third of four brothers in a military family, was on his second deployment in Africa and was making plans to move to Philadelphia afterward to be closer to his girlfriend. Black, a Special Forces medic, had learned the local dialect Hausa during a previous deployment to Niger and was in great demand because of it. “I’m not going to lie, but I was a little jealous of Bryan’s celebrity status,” one of his fellow Green Berets said. La David Johnson became the face of the attack when it took 48 hours for his body to be recovered from the site of the ambush. He left behind a pregnant wife and two children. ● Got a confidential tip? Submit it here.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"I love clicks as much as the next online journalist. I love that there is an uncertain thing happening, with infinite angles to write about and to scare people with. But as the Chinese Tiangong-1 satellite nears its final descent to Earth this weekend, I need to remind you: It’s not a big deal. That might sound silly, given how much press coverage this thing is getting. We’ve written a relatively level-headed take about what FEMA would do if the satellite actually posed a threat. Others, even Reuters, have written much more fearfully about the object. So let’s get some facts straight. The Earth is huge and mostly uninhabited. I know we think we are important because we are the only apes who can use a computer, but we are very puny compared to our Earth, whose surface area is nearly 200 million square miles. It’s hard to quantize just what percentage of the Earth is inhabited, given that it’s three-quarters water and some say humans influence around 83 percent of the remaining land. But as a back-of-the-envelope, if all 7 billion humans took up around four square feet each, that’s about 1000 square miles total. Again, the Earth is very big and we are very small. No one has ever been killed by space debris, and there is a shitload of space debris. Vox points out that two Americans have been hit by things from space: Lottie Williams in 1997 was grazed on the shoulder, and Ann Hodges was hit in the stomach by a meteor in 1954. Both women survived. The media is really hyping this space station up a lot, since “China loses control of a satellite and now it’s plummeting to the ground” definitely makes for some real clicky content. But compared to other reentries, this craft really small. Take a look at the list of uncontrolled reentries on Wikipedia here —there were some really big guys, like Skylab (152,000 pounds), Salyut 7 (88,000 pounds), Cosmos 557 (42,800 pounds). Several of these have landed in inhabited areas, and the only casualty was that a piece of Skylab killed a cow. Tiangong-1 is not on the list yet, but it will be at the very bottom, at a tiny 18,750 pounds. This is around the mass of a school bus or a little heavier than an elephant. If you’re still worried, only 10 percent to 40 percent of that stuff will actually make it to the ground, according to the Aerospace Corporation. These pieces will be traveling between 18 miles to 180 miles per hour depending on the wind. Those are the speeds of approximately a little league pitcher throwing a baseball and a professional tennis player serving a tennis ball. All of that is to say, sure, some lucky people might get to see the satellite streak across the sky. Some of the satellite will make it to the ground, potentially in an inhabited area. But you will be fine. If you still don’t believe me, just stay inside. It will all be over soon.","I love clicks as much as the next online journalist.

Marines with Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force-Crisis Response-Africa fire an M-240B medium machine gun US Marine Corps/Cpl. Holly Pernell Two members of Marine Special Operations Command received valor awards for their heroism during a gun battle last year with al Qaeda militants in Northern Africa, a spokeswoman for U.S. Africa Command confirmed on Wednesday. While on a three-day operation to train, advise, and assist partner forces in the unnamed country — which the command withheld due to ""classification considerations, force protection, and diplomatic sensitivities"" — the Marine Special Operations Team on February 28, 2017, became engaged in a ""fierce fight against members of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb,"" according to one of the award citations for the unnamed Marines, who are often referred to as ""Raiders."" The two award citations for the Navy &amp; Marine Corps Achievement Medal (with ""V"" distinguishing device for valor) were released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Task &amp; Purpose. Despite redactions of names and the specific Marine Raider team involved, the citations provide a glimpse of a battle between Americans and militants on the African continent that had not previously been made public. While the specific country where the battle took place remains unknown, Northern Africa consists of Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara, according to the United Nations. Africa Command spokeswoman Samantha Reho told Task &amp; Purpose in a statement that partner forces initially engaged and killed one al Qaeda fighter with small arms fire before calling for helicopter support. Militants then attempted to flank the Marines and partner forces from the rear, leading the Marines to ""return fire in self-defense."" According to one citation, the Raiders' communications chief and assistant element leader — typically a sergeant or above — ""provided critical communications relay and ensured proper positioning of partner force elements."" The citation went on to say the Marine, while under accurate enemy fire, provided immediate trauma care for a fellow Raider who was wounded and helped evacuate him into a partner force helicopter that was hovering six feet above his position. The second citation for an element member on the team — typically a sergeant or below — captures how the battle raged from the helicopter overhead. While onboard the partner force helicopter, the Marine fired at militants below, coordinated close air support, and directed the gunners and pilots on board the aircraft. The militants responded with accurate fire, however, and a partner force soldier behind the helicopter's M60 machine gun was shot twice in the foot, after which ""[the Marine Raider] took control of the M60 and continued to suppress the enemy while treating the wounded gunner,"" the citation said. ""He then accompanied the helicopter during the casualty evacuation of the Marine Raider and a second casualty later in the day, and conducted two re-supply deliveries all under enemy fire,"" the citation added. The partner force ultimately secured the site of the battle and ""assessed two enemies were killed,"" Reho told Task &amp; Purpose. The wounded Marine was evacuated and has since made a full recovery The gun battle between Marines and al Qaeda militants took place seven months before a deadly battle between ISIS militants and U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers who were advising partner forces in Niger. The October 4, 2017 ambush resulted in the deaths of four Americans service members and led the Pentagon to conduct a major review of U.S special operations missions in Africa.","US Marine Corps/Cpl.

Mark Wilson,"Google Allo is done. Announced in 2016, it was Google’s big attempt to build a Google chatbot right into your text message conversations. Allo’s death signals something important to the tech industry: Nobody wants a chatbot listening in on their intimate conversations–especially when that chatbot is near useless. Allo did all the things you’d expect from a new messaging app: It incorporated richer fonts and multimedia tools, much like competitors iMessage or WhatsApp. But its coup de grâce against its competition was supposed to be The Power of Google Itself, with Search manifesting itself within the app as an omnipresent third wheel that was always listening, always ready to pipe up at moment’s notice to help find a restaurant and book reservations. [Photo: Google] That third wheel was powered by the Google Assistant, which Rebecca Michael, then Google’s head of marketing of messaging products, described as “an ongoing dialog between you and Google that helps you get things done in your world” as she debuted Allo onstage in 2016. What did that mean in a practical sense? More or less, I’d say “let’s go out to dinner,” and suddenly Allo would prompt me with a pop-up button: “DID SOMEONE SAY ITALIAN FOOD!?!?!?” I suspected Allo might not be long for this world, and two years later, the experiment is over. The company announced it would instead refocus on the Android Messages app (to which it has added some Allo features) and stop all support for the app in March. It’s a decision that illustrates some of the reasons the chatbot craze hasn’t lived up to the hype. Earlier this year, The Verge reported that not enough people were using Allo. It’s as if nobody wanted Google listening and responding to their private chats! In fact, to avoid this eavesdropping, you had to use Allo’s “Incognito Mode.” That’s right, you had to tell Google, “Hey, I’d like this conversation between me and my husband to be private, thanks!” While plenty of smartphone users are willing to give up some of their privacy for a useful feature, the promise of Allo interrupting conversations seemingly wasn’t enough to get people to download and commit to the app. It depended on sucking up messaging data to power functionality that wasn’t really all that useful. It was a bad equation for users. [Image: Google] Google isn’t alone in Allo’s failings. The whole industry was in a chatbot frenzy for a while. Facebook M –its much-heralded smart assistant that could deliver you goods or do just about anything else for you–was also announced in a 2016 keynote only to be discontinued by the start of 2018. Allo and M share eerie parallels, both in chronology and story: Silicon Valley company with limitless resources and half a duopoly in online advertising builds automated subordinate to help you find things and probably sell you stuff. Instead, users opted for the simplicity of talking to other people. Who woulda thunk? It doesn’t help that since 2016, the sheen of Silicon Valley has been tarnished by scandals like Cambridge Analytica, which offered many users the first true demonstration of how social media platforms could use their data to damage society itself. My stomach churns when someone contacts me on Facebook Messenger. It’s as if a friend invited me to a their birthday party at a restaurant I hate. I have to show up, but don’t make me shake hands with the chef I saw letting Putin spit in my amuse-bouche! The last thing I want at this point is to share any more data with a strong-arming, democracy-weakening platform such as Facebook. Yet I can’t help but suspect the bigger reason many chatbots have failed is that is that they overpromised and underdelivered. Great user interfaces–for any product–offer people just a few clear options on purpose. You can close the window. Click the like button. Swipe the message. They communicate finite possibilities because, by design, software can only do finite things. Chatbots–and the very premise of conversational interfaces–suggest limitless possibilities, but they have trouble clearly communicating what they can do in the first place. Oh, you can “play a game,” Allo? Great! Does that mean you can clean up dog crap for me? Can you advise me on my deepest, most drunken existential crises, Siri? Can you scratch the middle part of my back, Alexa? Describing these interactions as “conversations” to users is a massive oversell. It promises possibilities that chatbots haven’t fulfilled, because neither the software nor the design is there yet. Just look at Smart Reply, one feature of Allo that still exists in Gmail and Google’s Messages app. It communicated clearly and concisely what it could do, and how it could save users time. Building upon some of the same technologies found in Allo, Google no longer wants to sell us on chatbots. It’s turning us into them, instead.","Google Allo is the latest casualty of Silicon Valley’s course correction on conversational interfaces. Google Allo is done.

Andrea Thompson,"The U.S. government’s partial shutdown is in its third week, and the pinch of the protracted standoff over funding for a wall along the country’s border with Mexico is starting to be felt—not only by workers missing paychecks, but also in terms of important science that is not getting done.
About 800,000 workers have either been furloughed or, if their jobs are deemed essential to protecting lives and property, are working without pay across dozens of shuttered agencies and departments. These include several that do significant scientific work such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior Department, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)—the parent agency of the National Weather Service. Although day-to-day forecasting operations continue at the NWS, key improvements to weather models have been put on pause. Data needed for research projects may be inaccessible; and if the shutdown continues much longer, preparedness training will be canceled for emergency managers in coastal communities looking warily ahead to the coming hurricane season after the devastating storms of recent years.
Eric Blake, a forecaster with the NWS’s National Hurricane Center in Miami spoke with Scientific American about the shutdown’s impact on the NWS and its employees (in his capacity as the National Weather Service Employees Organization union steward at the center).
[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]
Hundreds of NWS employees are unable to attend the meeting of the American Meteorological Society this week with the shutdown—what can missing such conferences mean?
The AMS conference is the largest gathering of meteorologists that we attend, and in one respect it’s our wrap-up of the [hurricane] season: How did we do? What are the challenges? And what are we looking forward to for the next several years? This is a conference attended by hundreds, if not more, of students—it’s good to energize them and motivate them. We’re trying to recruit the next generation of people who want to work for the federal government—and not attending that kind of conference really has a negative ripple effect. People get to questioning, “Well, is this the organization that I want to work for?”
And scientific conferences in general, I think, are very energizing. Anytime I go, I usually come home with a whole list of notes like, “Oh, I didn't think of this. I should do this differently.” It’s interaction that you can’t get anywhere else, and you don’t even know where it’s going to lead [for future research].
How is the development of weather models being impacted?
EMC, the Environmental Modeling Center—they’re the main point of contact for improving the Hurricane Center models, and really the Weather Service model in general. And that organization is basically furloughed; there's very few staff working now. Every fiscal year they set out to improve [some] model, and they have timetables to meet. And now we’re in the third week here. Delays for a day or two—that can easily be absorbed. But the longer this goes on, the more likely it is to have negative consequences down the line. And the most immediate one is the upgrade to the GFS (Global Forecast System) model. That’s expected to be implemented—I think it’s the end of the month, the beginning of the next month. And assuming it’s still shut down, that’s not going to happen. So you're pushing things back and back.
And this is the time of year where the most work is done for hurricanes, because it’s a time when all the operational people [or forecasters] are more available. You’re trying to put the best physics into hurricane models, trying new data sources. That type of development is basically halted now. It’s hard to do this type of development during hurricane season. Without the Environmental Modeling Center you wouldn’t have had the dramatic improvements that you’ve seen in terms of the track and intensity forecasts [for hurricanes] that we saw over the past several decades. It’s basically freezing the hurricane development work, and I don't think anyone wants that.
How is the shutdown affecting emergency preparedness efforts prior to hurricane season?
We host, with FEMA (the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency), three one-week intensive training sessions for emergency managers and decision makers from across the Gulf and east coasts of the United States. In many ways it’s “Hurricanes 101”—about Hurricane Center products, and FEMA, and test cases of hurricanes and what you would do, and learning about the hurricane tools that the emergency managers have at their disposal. It’s kind of the big course that we encourage all the managers to take to be better prepared for the hurricane season. The first course starts next week, and if the shutdown is still ongoing, that’s just not going to happen.
NWS offices have been understaffed for several years now—how might the shutdown hamper hiring plans?
The Weather Service for many years has had a reduced staff, and we can’t hire anyone new if this is ongoing. It just kind of throws another wrench into the whole, broken hiring process. This isn’t going to help fill the vacancies we have at the Hurricane Center. If you want people for hurricane season, it takes some time because they have to go [through] security checks. You want to give as much time as you can.
How is the mood among co-workers you’ve spoken with?
I think things are getting much more serious now, because of people missing their paychecks. That’s serious—and, I mean, it’s a hard time to be a federal employee when, you know, during the shutdown the president announces that, “Oh, by the way, you’re not getting paid and you’re not getting a raise.” It isn’t a high-morale time, I can guarantee you that.
What do hurricane forecasters still working during the shutdown do without support staff?
We can’t really do any of the outreach, any of the training—our main thrust in the off-season. So you’re kind of put in this weird position of, like, so you work on personal research or projects that you have—but if you need data from another NOAA agency, but it’s furloughed…, it’s a weird place to be in.
There irony is—it’s a weird irony—that the Hurricane Center is less affected in a shutdown during hurricane season. [The off-season] is a time of the year where the so-called nonessential stuff—model development, the improvements for the next hurricane season—[is happening]. If [a shutdown] happens in August, then everyone's working [because all the work being done then is considered essential].
Employees just really want to work, and they want to be paid—and they love their jobs.",Weather models are not being updated and training sessions might be canceled during the budget standoff -- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com,2019-01-09T11:45:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Scientificamerican.com'}",Another Casualty of the Government Shutdown: Hurricane Preparedness,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/another-casualty-of-the-government-shutdown-hurricane-preparedness/,https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/0940A5D0-0681-4ED5-911A19F019211432.jpg,,Scientificamerican.com,casualty,1

Akin Oyedele,"Martin Gilbert can claim bragging rights as one of the people who called the 2008 financial crisis — or at least an important part of it. In a 2007 conference in Monaco, he warned about Wall Street's affinity to collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, the complex financial instruments that went down with the mortgage market. Ten years after the financial crisis, the co-CEO of Standard Life Aberdeen, a $736 billion asset manager and one of Europe's largest, is flagging another debt instrument. It's covenant-lite loans, which lenders are increasingly issuing out to companies that seek less-restrictive financing terms. In these arrangements, lenders waive or water down certain so-called covenants, such as whether a company can pay dividends. Breaching these would normally give lenders the option to redeem the loan early. Companies with weaker credit ratings are taking on more risk with covenant-lite loans and their investors could face a greater downside during the next downturn, according to Moody's. Gilbert shared with Business Insider, via email, why he's wary of these loans, and other reflections on the anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers headquarters seen September 15, 2008. Mario Tama/Getty Business Insider: You steered Aberdeen clear of the market for collateralized debt obligations ahead of the crisis. What similar instruments are you wary of now? Martin Gilbert: Yes, we steered clear of CDOs. I was pretty vocal about the risk they posed when speaking at a conference in Monaco in 2007. I viewed them as financially engineered vehicles that enabled misallocation of capital. We avoided getting involved with them. Currently, I'm wary of covenant-lite debt paper for a variety of reasons, a good example of which are certain weaker covenants, which allow borrowers to essentially strip assets away from the restricted group. This has found its way into some high-yield documentation recently and became topical during the J.Crew restructuring in the US. The market has, however, managed to get this language removed in a number of cases but it's nevertheless indicative of a wider trend. The following week was a maelstrom in markets. BI: Where were you and what you were doing during that weekend in September, and when you heard Lehman Brothers had finally filed for bankruptcy on Monday? Gilbert: I was in London that weekend and the following week. There was a lot of panic that weekend because many people had assumed the US Treasury simply would not let an institution as big as Lehman go. The bank's problems were no mystery at the time, but it was the fact that they were allowed to fail that was a watershed moment. It was when investors realized there was a limit to what the US authorities would bear. The following week was a maelstrom in markets and I spent the entire week working with colleagues to analyze how the event would impact us as the dominoes kept on falling. I have to say though, the atmosphere in the office was not one of panic. Everyone had a clear sense of purpose and was trying to find practical solutions to the issues that markets were throwing up. It was stressful and intense, but it was all about keeping a cool head in those days and weeks in the immediate aftermath. BI: What are some of the biggest lessons from the crisis and ensuing market crash, especially for younger investors who want to learn from history? Gilbert: Don't sell at the point of maximum pain. The scale of the great financial crisis was really something else but there are common threads running through all crises. Markets have a habit of bouncing back and you have to do whatever you can to take a step back. Another lesson is to stick to the basics. Invest in what you understand, spread your risk and know that if something looks too good to be true, it almost certainly is. The products that the banks were churning out in the run-up to the crisis were ever more complex and built on even shakier fundamentals. Don't sell at the point of maximum pain. This relates to another lesson, and that is that the nature of a globalized economy makes neatly apportioning blame very hard. Banks have rightly taken a lot of the blame for the crisis, but it was a failing at all levels by governments, regulators, investors, rating agencies, and the banks. When the crisis hit, each party spent quite some time pointing the finger at everyone else. No one party was to blame, but they were all culpable. BI: What could regulators have done differently post-crisis? Gilbert: Regulators did a pretty decent job in their immediate response to the crisis. One of the problems with financial markets is that they act a bit like water running down a hill. If something, like regulation, tries to block a certain route, the market tends to find a way around it sooner or later. This unfortunately means that we might not understand the shortcomings of the post-crisis regulation until it is really tested in the next crisis. It could be desirable to see more support for securitization. Regulators rightly came down on securitization hard after the crisis because it played a big part in what happened. Securitization is a brilliant tool to match risk and return profiles to appropriate investors. When it is misused to create or obscure unnecessary layers of leverage, though, the crisis shows that it can be extremely harmful. What I find encouraging is that, on the whole, regulation has been pragmatic. I'm a big believer in working with regulators. They have a tough job and the task of avoiding a repeat of 2008 is not solely theirs. BI: If there's another 2008-style crunch, what should the balance between government and private-sector intervention be, given that bailouts to Wall Street remain a grievance? Gilbert: It's inevitable that in periods of major crisis governments get involved. The degree to which their responses will be coordinated globally is an open question. The political environment has changed significantly since 2008, so governments may not unite and work together. In many countries, the ""too big to fail"" mindset is history and governments feel less inclined to intervene and individual companies will be left to sink, swim, or be rescued (acquired) by a competitor. That said, governments are very sensitive to public opinion so may well act in situations if the private sector doesn't. They also recognize that the financial sector oils the wheels of the economy to get growth going again. Leverage and illiquidity are also the normal ingredients for more systemic-style crises. BI: What might the next 2008-style crisis be? Gilbert: That's the $1 billion question, or the $650 billion question given by how much the US economy shrank from September 2008 to the end of 2009. Unfortunately, as Nassim Nicholas Taleb has argued, black swan events that trigger financial crises come from left field and are difficult to predict. As we experienced 10 years ago, the global financial system is so interconnected that even a relatively small part, such as sub-prime mortgages, can cause a domino-like effect. BI: What risks should investors be watching to avert another crisis like that? Gilbert: I'm not sure investors can avert a future crisis if seeds have been sown and problems have grown. What investors can watch for are signs of complacency, greed, and overt risk-taking within the financial system. Leverage and illiquidity are also the normal ingredients for more systemic-style crises. If investors see signs of these emerging then they should perhaps prepare for the worst and hope for the best, in terms of diversifying their portfolios.","Collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, were a major financial casualty of the 2008 crisis.

Sinan Salaheddin / AP,"(BAGHDAD) — Two suicide bombers blew themselves up at a busy street market in central Baghdad on Monday, in back-to-back explosions that killed at least 16 people, the Interior Ministry said. The Health Ministry said 26 died. The attackers struck during the rush-hour at the city’s Tayran Square, said the ministry’s spokesman, Maj. Gen. Saad Maan. The area around the square is usually crowded by laborers seeking work and the explosions also wounded at least 65 people, he said. The Health Ministry, meanwhile, gave a far higher casualty toll. Spokesman Saif al-Badr said 26 people were killed and that 90 were wounded but the Interior Ministry couldn’t confirm those figures. Different casualty tolls are common in the immediate aftermath of such large attacks. Ambulances rushed to the scene as security forces sealed off the area with yellow tape. Slippers could be seen scattered about on the blood-stained pavement as cleaners hurried to clear the debris. Photographs posted on social media showed lifeless bodies and pieces of limbs. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but it bore the hallmarks of the Islamic State group, which has claimed many such attacks in the past. The twin explosions shocked residents in the Iraqi capital because large attacks had decreased significantly in Baghdad and other parts of country since security forces retook nearly all territory once held by IS militants. Iraqi and U.S. officials have warned that IS would continue with insurgent-style attacks even after the Iraqi military and U.S.-led coalition succeeded in uprooting the Islamic State group across the country. The cost of victory has been nearly incalculable as the three years of war against IS devastated much of northern and western Iraq — roughly a third of the country — where Islamic State militants had held most of the territory.",The explosions also wounded at least 65 people,2018-01-15T07:49:43Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",A Double Suicide Bombing in Baghdad has Killed at Least 16 People,http://time.com/5103109/baghdad-double-suicide-bombing/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/2018-01-15t064634z_1014925379_rc164205c100_rtrmadp_3_mideast-crisis-iraq-blast-1.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,casualty,1

Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader provided the casualty information at about 9:30 p.m. Thursday, more than two hours after a Ride the Ducks tourist boat reportedly sank near the Branson Belle with a reported 31 people on board. Rader said a sheriff's deputy was off duty working security at the scene and helped rescue people. Recovery efforts continued after dark, with some passengers still unaccounted for. A dive team from Western Taney County was in the water and a team from the Missouri State Highway Patrol was on the way, as well. Rader said family members of passengers should got to Branson City Hall. Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader provided the casualty information at about 9:30 p.m. Thursday, July 19, 2018. Springfield News-Leader First responders from multiple agencies responded to the incident, initially reported as a “mass casualty incident” involving a ""tourist type boat"" on Table Rock Lake. Divers staged near the Showboat Branson Belle, according to a statement issued by the Southern Stone County Fire Protection District. The statement, issued at 8:20 p.m., specified that the Branson Belle itself was not involved. Rader said weather was thought to have caused the Ride the Ducks boat to capsize. Weather reports had high wind hitting the area about 7 p.m. Capt. Jim Pulley, owner of Sea Tow Table Rock Lake, said the storm hit the lake with 80 mph winds that kicked up waves five feet high. He said his Sea Tow boats were helping with crowd control near the site where the Duck boat capsized a short distance behind the Showboat Branson Belle, which was tied to its dock. “Western Taney County has got divers in the water where the Duck boat went down,” Pulley said. “The Ducks have a ramp access where they put in, and when the wind hit it pushed the boat right square behind the Branson Belle.” Pulley said several docks also broke loose during the wind storm, and the Water Patrol helped rescue two personal watercraft boats that capsized in the wind. Crews are working at the scene of a ""mass casualty incident” involving a ""tourist type boat"" on Table Rock Lake. Springfield News-Leader A spokeswoman for Ripley's Believe It Or Not said the company is aware of an incident involving one of its tour boats. The schedule for Thursday showed there were tours every 30 minutes from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. A News-Leader reporter on the scene about 9 p.m. could see boats with lights on the water as darkness fell. Fire district spokesman Eric Nielsen confirmed there had been casualties and said more information about the search effort would be available soon. Steve Linderberg, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said a severe line of storms blew through the Springfield between 6:15 and 6:30 p.m. ""We had a line of very strong thunderstorms that caused 74 mph winds here in Springfield,"" he said. Linderberg said a top wind speed of 63 mph was measured at the Branson Airport near 7 p.m. Thursday. He said the winds were likely stronger over the lake.

The portmanteau came to prominence in 2017 through the nation's dual citizenship political saga, said the Australian National Dictionary Centre. It describes a person who is a dual citizen of Australia and New Zealand - as was the case with Australia's deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce. Mr Joyce was removed from office in October for being a kwaussie. He won back his seat in a by-election on Saturday after renouncing his New Zealand citizenship. Under Australia's constitution, politicians cannot be dual citizens. ""Kwaussie was used to describe the most high-profile casualty of the crisis, deputy prime minister and National Party leader Barnaby Joyce,"" said Dr Amanda Laugesen, the dictionary centre director. ""In a time of covfefe, fake news, and tweetstorms, the Australian National Dictionary Centre has looked for a word of the year that is both lexically interesting and Australian."" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The term kwaussie was first used to describe actor Russell Crowe Although popularised by the political saga, the word can also refer to a New Zealander living in Australia, or a person of Australian and New Zealand descent, she said. Friendly rivalry between Australia and New Zealand has often led to minor quibbles over claims to famous citizens. Famous 'kwaussies' Russell Crowe: The first usage of kwaussie was found in a 2002 profile of the New Zealand-born actor, a long-time resident of Australia, Dr Laugesen said. Keith Urban: The country music star was born in New Zealand but established his success in Australia, before making it big in Nashville. Jane Campion: The Oscar-winning director of The Piano and Top of the Lake was born in New Zealand but studied in Australia, where she has also found success. Barnaby Joyce: Australia's deputy prime minister was disqualified from office after a court ruled he was a citizen of New Zealand by descent. Scott Ludlam lost his job as an Australian senator in July, after migrating from New Zealand as a child. Dr Laugesen said kwaussie was primarily used in Australia and on social media to refer to Mr Joyce and Mr Ludlam, and the eligibility saga. Last year, ""democracy sausage"" was chosen as Australia's word of the year - a nod to a local election-day tradition. In November, dictionary publisher Collins chose the phrase ""fake news"" as its word of the year. The runners-up The Australian National Dictionary Centre said the words shortlisted in 2017 reflected many events that shaped the nation's political, cultural and social landscape: Makarrata: (in traditional Aboriginal culture) A ceremonial ritual that aims to restore peace after a dispute. Jumper punch: (from Australian Rules football) A punch disguised as the action of grabbing hold of the opponent's jumper. Postal survey: A survey conducted by post; largely in reference to Australia's non-binding poll on legalising same-sex marriage. Robodebt: A reference to a local scandal that saw Australians incurring debt through an automated programme.

As a candidate, he had no hesitation about declaring the entire nation of Mexico drug dealers, criminals and rapists on his own say-so. He early and often questioned his predecessors birthplace despite clear proof that he was peddling untruths. But now, the brash defier of political correctness has turned punctilious: In the face of mounting evidence that Saudi Arabia is implicated in the murder of a U.S. resident, the president frets about a rush to judgment. Ideals, not weapons deals, make America great Other American leaders, however, are stepping up and speaking out. Members of Congress, including members of Trumps party, are expressing their horror in unvarnished terms and promising reprisals. I cant imagine that if what we think happened that we would take no action, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told Bloomberg. U.S. business leaders are boycotting a Saudi investment conference. At least three blue-chip Washington lobbying firms Glover Park, Harbour and BGR have reportedly severed ties with the Saudis. (OK, thats just three Saudi lobbyists down and 63 to go and one of those three might have been inspired to do the right thing by an ultimatum. But its a start). To borrow a term popularized by former President George H.W. Bush, these are points of light signs that in at least some quarters, Americans are remembering what truly makes this country great: Its ideals. Not its military contracts. The momentum toward decency needs to build. As Khashoggi warned, silence in the face of evil equals consent. Impunity for thugs begets more thugs. And Khashoggis disappearance was not an isolated incident. It is just the latest in a series of horrific crimes against journalists. More: Can Donald Trump handle the truth about Jamal Khashoggi? Trump's Khashoggi reaction sure makes him seem bought and paid for by Saudi Arabia Khashoggi wake-up call for US: Stop following Saudi Arabia's lead. It's a police state. As Kathleen Carroll, president of the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists, pointed out in a tweet, reports of Khashoggis murder capped a fortnight in which journalists were murdered in Bulgaria, Somalia and Mexico. Last week, Myanmar, which just sentenced Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo to seven years in jail on phony charges, arrested three more journalists after they wrote stories critical of the government. Egypt has yet to free Shawkan, the photojournalist jailed for more than five years for the ""crime"" of taking pictures of an anti-government protest, The government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, which has accused the Saudis of murdering Khashoggi in Istanbul, is certainly not doing so out of love for freedom of the press: Under Erdogans leadership, Turkey has become the worlds No. 1 jailer of journalists. And lets not forget that Erdogans thugs attacked protesters and the reporters covering them on U.S. soil. In this country, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials continue to push for the deportation of Emilio Gutiérrez-Soto, a law abiding Mexican journalist who sought asylum here when his reporting on official corruption in his country made him the target of death threats. Khashoggi was a warrior for free speech Theres a global war going on, and its not just against journalists. Its against what journalists represent: free speech. Joseph Bahout, a friend of Khashoggi and a scholar with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was speaking of the Middle East but could have been talking about the larger world when he told NPR this week that spaces of freedom and action and even thinking are narrowing by the minute. Americans have always had a healthy resentment of elites. President Trump rode that into power in 2016. Around the world, we now are seeing where unchecked elitism can lead: to dictatorial oligarchies run by governments or criminal cartels whose leaders think that their oil or their drugs or their power gives them the right to play by a different set of rules than those that apply to the rest of us. Journalists make a living from calling out that kind of entitlement, and now they are getting killed for it. Its time for Americans to decide, and to ask their leaders to declare: Which side are you on? Kathy Kiely is the Lee Hills chair in Free Press Studies at the Missouri Journalism School.

Riva Gold,"As the U.S. and China risk a trade war, investors worry Europe could be a major casualty. Global stocks have been whipsawed in recent sessions as investors grapple with conflicting signals from senior officials in the Trump administration on future trade policy between the world’s two biggest economies. Many investors have already started selling Europe, concerned that trade frictions could dent an already fragile economic recovery in a region heavily exposed to international trade. In recent weeks, investors have withdrawn billions of dollars from European equity and bond funds. Export-intensive sectors have taken a drubbing, with the region’s auto stocks down 11% over the past month—now standing within 1% of a bear market—while the wider Stoxx Europe 600 index has fallen 3.3%. Europe is exposed to a series of direct and indirect trade costs, investors say. The U.S. has already placed tariffs on European steel and aluminum and investors worry the same could happen to cars, a key driver of Germany’s export engine. Even if Europe can avoid direct tariffs, the global supply chains that its companies rely upon for components could be hit as the U.S. and China target each other’s products. Goods and services exports make up 27% of the euro area’s gross domestic product, compared with 12% for the U.S. and 21% for China, according to data from the European Central Bank. If China and the U.S. do enter a trade war, any effect on their economies will be felt in Europe. Both make up Europe’s biggest export markets. “Europe is very sensitive to trade and to the global economy,” said Thomas Costerg, economist at Pictet Wealth Management.“ Europe is always caught in the crossfire,” and always suffers more when there is a hit to global growth, he said. What appeared to start as a China-oriented U.S. trade agenda has already spilled into direct confrontation with Europe. After the Trump administration imposed metals tariffs in Europe and elsewhere, the EU retaliated by placing tariffs on many U.S. products such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles and bourbon. For investors, an unexpected profit warning from Daimler AG last week really hit home the direct risks to Europe. The German car manufacturer said that Chinese retaliatory import duties on vehicles built in the U.S. would hit sales and profits. The European auto sector fell for seven straight sessions through Monday. “We think that the warning from Daimler […] is a line in the sand,” said Barbara Reinhard, head of asset allocation at Voya Investment Management. Initial trade tensions were more focused on narrow corners of the U.S. market, but autos are much more global in nature and would likely hit Europe harder, she said. So far in June, shares of Italian-American Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which generates 53% of its revenues in the U.S. according to FactSet, have fallen 15%, while Volkswagen AG and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG have each lost 8.7%. The auto sector makes up 14% of Germany’s benchmark DAX index. Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates that U.S. car tariffs at 25% could lower euro area GDP by at least 0.3%, excluding any second-round effects on investor confidence, business spending and changes in other export markets. But it isn’t only Europe’s cars that have deep ties to the U.S. and China. Those two countries make up a combined 24% of the Stoxx Europe 600’s revenues according to FactSet, meaning the index is exposed to any slowdowns in their economies. Investors are betting this could hurt the region’s corporate profits. Fund managers withdrew around $17 billion from European equities in May and June and $8 billion from European bond funds, according to data from the Institute of International Finance and EPFR Global. U.S. assets now make up 58% of global fund portfolios- the highest since before the presidential election in 2016, according to the IIF data. “A lot of the success of the European recovery has been based on strong export performance, particularly from Germany,” said Chris Iggo, chief investment officer for fixed income at AXA Investment Managers. “In Europe, one might expect some kind of bounce in [economic] activity, but that might not show through if firms are worried about the trade side and what that implies for investment and employment plans,” he said. Already, there are signs trade uncertainty is creeping into economic data. The eurozone’s June manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index showed a decline for the export-reliant manufacturing sector to 55 from 55.5 in May, an 18-month low. As expectations for growth and monetary policy diverge, the yield gap between 10-year German and U.S. government bonds last week closed at its highest since March 1989, according to Tradeweb and Thomson Reuters data. To be sure, if the trade barbs remain squarely between the U.S. and elsewhere, some investors see opportunities for Europe to benefit. If the EU takes a fairly neutral stance and remains free of punitive tariffs from both the U.S. and China, member states could benefit by substituting the two countries in each other’s export markets, according to Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis. Companies exporting autos and chemical products in particular could benefit, she said. But many investors are concerned the trade issues come at a time when the region’s fractious politics make Europe more vulnerable and less able to unite in its response to increased trade tensions. Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon, points to Germany’s increasingly delicate coalition government, potential clashes between Brussels and Italy’s new antiestablishment government and ongoing debates around Brexit. “All this points to a far more fragile Europe,” he said.

HT Correspondent,"Air Force does not count casualties, they only count targets, Air chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said on Monday while adding that the casualty figure in the air strike on the Jaish camp in Balakot camp will be given out by the government.
“IAF is not in a postilion to clarify the number of casualties. The government will clarify that. We don’t count human casualties, we count what targets we have hit or not,” Dhanoa said in his first comments since the February 26 attack on a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) camp.
The pre-dawn air strike on February 26 by the IAF on Jaish’s biggest terror camp in Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province came on the 13th day of the terror attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama that left 40 jawans dead.
Air chief’s statement came a day after BJP chief Amit Shah said that over 250 terrorists were killed in the airstrike carried out by the IAF.
“After Pulwama attack, everyone thought surgical strike can’t be done this time..now what will happen?... At that time Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government did an airstrike on the 13th day and killed more than 250 terrorists without any harm on our side,” Shah said in Gujarat on Sunday.
On the timing of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman return to flying, Air chief Dhanoa said in his press briefing on Monday that medical fitness will decide the issue
“Whether he (Wing Commander #Abhinandan) flies or not depends on his medical fitness. That’s why post ejection, he has undergone medical check. Whatever treatment required, will be given. Once we get his medical fitness, he will get into fighter cockpit,” Dhanoa said.
Abhinandan, whose plane crashed as he chased Pakistani jets, was freed by that country on Friday and is undergoing fitness checks as he received injuries after ejection from the plane and was also attacked by a mob.
Responding to reports of Pakistan having denied any airstrike by India, the Air chief said, “If we plan to hit the target, we hit the target, otherwise why would he (Pak PM) have responded, if we dropped bombs in the jungles why would he respond.”
Commenting on the timing of the induction of the controversial Rafale jet , Dhanoa said it should come into India’s inventory by September. “When an adversary attacks you, every aircraft is used,” Dhanoa said, adding that the MiG 21 jet used in the dog fight with Pakistan is an upgraded aircraft with advanced weapons system

Justin Caffier,"It’s no surprise that the concept of self-care was drilled into our psyches throughout last year. When it comes to mental health, we don't seem to be doing so hot. According to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people around the world are affected by depression. The UK just appointed a minister to deal with the nation’s endemic loneliness. Shit’s got so bad that we’ve even started replacing our Top 40 song titles with the Suicide Prevention Hotline phone number. In a perfect world, we’d all have easy, affordable access to mental healthcare professionals and be able to properly treat these maladies. But, with so many still unable to procure medical aid for their corporeal injuries, it’s clear we are still far from a utopia where mental wellness is regarded as a priority. And since Rick &amp; Morty co-creator Dan Harmon only has so many hours in a given day to personally counsel the depressed, this growing problem is still in desperate need of a substantial solution. A team of Stanford researchers thinks they may have developed the answer to this problem—or at least a stopgap until we get our affairs properly in order. Their glimmer of hope comes in the form of Woebot, an AI chatbot that operates entirely within Facebook Messenger and uses standard cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques to provide users with no-frills sessions through their phone or computer. Over the course of a 5-10 minute CBT session, prompted by the a push-notification from the bot, the user simply types out or taps auto-populating responses to Woebot's inquiries. After a free two-week trial of daily check-ins, users can choose to opt into paid plans. Conceived of by clinical research psychologist Alison Darcy and developed by AI heavyweight Andrew Ng, Woebot is hoping to assist underserved segments of the mentally unwell population without the income or insurance to utilize traditional practices. As someone who has long suffered from depression (and is both underpaid and underinsured), I figured I'd give Woebot a try. Over the years I’ve learned how to manage and weather my depression—for the most part. Even so, the occasional surprise tidal wave of melancholy hits and drenches me, taking me out of commission for its duration. It was during a recent bad spell that I signed up for the service. Initially, I had a hard time taking Woebot seriously. While I’d been able to set aside the terrible name its creators had chosen for it and go in with an open mind, my first conversation with the program tested my faith in the efficacy of the service. Though I hadn’t expected a full-on holo-Freud, the AI’s vacillation between soulless call center decision tree script and / r/fellowkids -worthy fumbles with youthful parlance (don’t use the smirk emoji unless you’re trying to fuck me, Woebot) was leaving me as cold. The knockoff WALL-E illustration used as the bot’s avatar was the only whimsical element that seemed to agree with me. Ignoring Woebot’s credibility-diminishing usage of emoji, I pressed onward as it laid out a plan-of-action and qualifiers for the forthcoming two week trial. Woebot made it abundantly clear that it was, by no means, a substitute for a human therapist and “not capable of really understanding what [I] need.” While I appreciated how forthcoming it was, the more Woebot told me, the more I worried that this was simply a CBT toolkit directory programmed to occasionally call me “homie” and swap “OK” with “oki.” Thankfully, after our initial session, Woebot adopted a somewhat more clinical tone as it probed my psyche for problems to treat. After asking me to identify examples of unhelpful thought processes like ""all-or-nothing thinking"" and ""should statements,"" the bot would still throw in a celebratory GIF. Beyond that, however, things were starting to feel professional. Better still, I was actually going along with the exercises in earnest and found myself glad that I was now able to put a name to specific thoughts, even if I was still dubious that any progress would be made. Over the next two weeks, my feelings toward the bot ebbed and flowed as we continued with the daily check-ins. Sometimes, I appreciated Wobebot’s requests for me to type out what I was currently doing or feeling, enjoying the catharsis of purging the negativity with words. Other times, I felt pandered to by its replies. Whether I was venting about financial struggles or complaining about a frustrating scheduling hiccup, Woebot dished out the same few canned “empathy” responses. I’m convinced that, had I admitted to assassinating archduke Franz Ferdinand, Woebot would’ve hit me with another “sounds like you’re dealing with a lot right now.” Furthermore, despite Woebot’s alleged “deep learning,” it was constantly forgetting that we’d already gone over particular lessons and kept repeating the same things over and over like my mom at a family reunion. Woebot might have been cataloging my responses, but was it really listening to me? This seemed as if it would be the highest and, frankly, most essential hurdle for the program to overcome, given that it was entering an industry reliant on the patient feeling heard. Toward the end of the trial period, to my surprise, I noticed my mood had actually began to improve. Somehow, despite my resistance and Woebot’s unforgivable penchant for sending Minion GIFs, I did indeed feel better. Maybe Woebot’s lame jokes and persistent, cheerful pings were actually enough to trick the dumb monkey part of my brain into believing that another sentient entity was rooting for me to push through the stormy weather. Perhaps my eye-rolling at its laughably non-human dialogue was by design; a tactic to steer my thoughts to how superior I am to these lines of code, rather than let my mind spiral into further negativity. On the other hand, there’s a chance this turn for the better was going to happen over the course of the two weeks regardless of whether or not I’d been using the bot. Woebot’s website cites a 2017 Stanford study, done during its beta period, that found the chatbot to be “a feasible, engaging, and effective way to deliver CBT” when compared to information-only CBT apps. Reading the study, and holding it up to my own experience, I couldn't help but feel that further research would be needed to determine whether these results were a case of correlation or causation. And by that time, AI will likely have improved by leaps and bounds again to the point of rendering such a study unproductive. When our trial time together was up, Woebot attempted to sell me its paid plan with the “for the price of a cup of coffee” tactic I’d last seen used in 90s infomercials about adopting African kids. It accepted my rejection of the offer with relative dignity, wishing me continued happiness as we parted ways. Woebot checked in the next day and a few days after that to let me know that it was suddenly down to do more free sessions if I was up for it. At that point, however, I had fully recovered from my depressive bout so I again rebuked the offer. I want to give Woebot and its creators credit. I’m just not sure where to attribute it. Even if Woebot was not, in fact, directly responsible for lifting my spirits, it foreshadows a future of AI entities that will be able to compassionately, convincingly, and effectively accomplish this task. Darcy and Ng seeing the potential here and getting in on the ground floor is commendable, even if the product still feels half-baked. Perhaps when Her -like AIs are able to hold meaningful conversations and appropriately react to my confessions of self-doubt, I'd be willing to fork over $9 a week from my Universal Basic Income stipend. But in its current form, Woebot is just going to be added to the pile of nice therapists that tried their best but just didn’t get me. Follow Justin Caffier on Twitter.

Kristine Solomon,"Many of the most iconic American newspapers have been around since the 1800s, when the Industrial Revolution took off and made print more accessible to readers. To break into such a robust industry as newspapers in the 19th century was no easy feat, according to W. Joseph Campbell, media history professor at American University and author of "" Getting It Wrong: Debunking the Greatest Myths in American Journalism."" ""Multiple newspapers in major cities were slugging it out, and it was a very challenging market for newspapers to break into,"" Campbell told Business Insider. ""The casualty rate was very high."" Once established, remaining stable through the introduction of digital media in the late 1900s brought on another layer of challenges for print publications, and print advertising revenue began to decline by the billions, AEI reported. According to Campbell, a few legacy brands have been able to withstand the influence of digital media due to key components they possessed early on, like a strong point of view, a publisher with deep pockets, and a competitive price, that allowed them to go the distance.

One early casualty: Acxiom Corp. shares. Acxiom fell as much as 34 percent Thursday, its largest drop since 2001, after Facebook said it will no longer let advertisers use information from third-party data brokers like Acxiom in targeting of ads on its system. The marketing company said the change could cost it up to $25 million in profit in fiscal 2019. The selloff has left Acxiom shares at attractive levels for investors, according to William Blair analyst Adam Klauber.

The company hasn’t seen any effect so far on deal-related conversations and no one customer accounts for more than 10 percent of its revenue, Klauber said in a research note.

Germain Lussier,"When the family-focused Walt Disney Company moved to acquire 20th Century Fox, many wondered if the integration of Marvel properties would have one particular casualty: the R-rated nature of Deadpool. 
Well, on a recent earnings call, the CEO of Disney Bob Iger assured investors that Disney plans on keeping Deadpool rated R and that R-rated movies will be a part of their plans moving forward.
Were going to continue in that business, Iger said according to Variety. Iger explained that to differentiate between R-rated movies and more family-friendly fare the company will carefully brand those films. Meaning, they are unlikely to say Disney at the beginning of them. Which makes sensefor instance, Disney owns ESPN but theres no castle in front of Monday Night Football. ESPN is its own brand and Fox may continue to be its own brand as well. At least for R-rated movies.
Iger has alluded to this in the past. Way back in 2017, he answered a similar question by saying As long as we let the audiences know whats coming, we think we can manage that fine. But todays assertion was much more definitive.
It seems possible the fact Once Upon a Deadpool, the PG-13 recut of Deadpool 2, underperformed at the box office played a role in this. If that film had brought in a whole new audience for a character, maybe Disney wouldve considered taming him down. But, it seems, the merc will get to to keep his mouth.
The bigger question, though, remains unanswered. Will that continued R-rated world of Deadpool extended into the PG-13 world of the Avengers or, eventually, the X-Men? We still dont know, but well bring you more as we learn it.
Update: February 5 5:30pm - After publication, we added in Igers similar quotes from 2017.

Dana Varinsky and Leanna Garfield,"Boys who live on Tangier Island, a sliver of land in Virginia that is disappearing due to climate change-fueled sea-level rise. Christian Storm/Business Insider Twelve miles from either coast of the Chesapeake Bay sits a small island in danger of disappearing. Tangier Island, Virginia, is one of the most isolated and extraordinary places in the continental US. But the island sits just 4 feet or so above sea level, and a 2015 report suggests that little of it will be left in 50 years. President Donald Trump, however, disagrees. The Daily Times of Salisbury, Maryland, reports that after Trump saw a CNN report about Tangier Island last summer, the president called Mayor James ""Ooker"" Eskridge to tell him he shouldn't worry about a rise in sea levels. ""He said, 'Your island has been there for hundreds of years, and I believe your island will be there for hundreds more,'"" Eskridge told The Daily Times. ""Chesapeake Requiem,"" a forthcoming book by Earl Swift, paints a timely portrait of the 200-year-old crabbing community as it faces extinction from rising water levels.

http://www.facebook.com/Q13FOX,"SEATTLE — Imagine getting a text alert on your cellphone. An earthquake is coming. You have 15 seconds – at most – before it hits. How much could you really prepare for in 15 seconds? A lot, says Douglas Given, United States Geological Survey’s Early Warning Coordinator. “Early warning, of even a few seconds, would give you a jump on protective action,” Given says. “There are lots of situations where a few seconds or even tens of seconds of warning is enough to get out of harm’s way.” How does it work? USGS's Shake Alert Early Warning system is rolling out this year in Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Using a network of 850 sensors, the Shake Alert Early Warning system will detect an earthquake at one seismograph, then send warnings to other areas before that same earthquake can hit a few miles away. The initial roll out will give warnings to some governmental and transportation agencies, but the ultimate hope is to have an sent to cellphones in the area. It's not an earthquake predictor, Given says, but a way to know a few seconds early that a potentially destructive earthquake is coming. ""The amount of time you get depends on your distance from the earthquake,"" Given says, noting that locations further away from the epicenter will have more warning time. Given and other researchers started building Shake Alert in 2006. They hope to put 1,675 sensors down, and have a comprehensive warning system for the entire West Coast. This year's launch will serve agencies capable of utilizing an automatic system, such as one that could immediately shut off heavy machinery or slow trains. ""There are hundreds of things that can done with an automatic system,"" Given said. 'This can help reduce mass casualty events' San Francisco's rapid transportation system, BART, has been using Shake Alert since 2012, Given says. When an earthquake is spotted, BART almost instantaneously slows down its trains through a computer system. With research showing trains have a tendency to derail during an earthquake, this automatic application may save hundreds. ""They saw the value of (Shake Alert) very early on,"" Given says. ""This can help reduce mass casualty events. There are all sorts of applications for early warning."" But the idea of the Seattle resident getting a text alert - notifying them that an earthquake is coming - is about 3 to 5 years off, Given says. A personal early warning system is blocked by the speed in which alerts can be sent. Working with the cell companies and agencies like FEMA, it would still take almost a minute to send out mass warnings. Too long for an earthquake warning, Given says. ""One of the specific limitations of our limited public roll-out is the ability to do mass notifications to the public fast enough,"" Given says. ""It's not an unreasonable expectation, it's just not possible to do it yet."" How much warning will we ever get? Given says USGS is working with FEMA and the cell industry to reduce delays. A pilot project for individuals is in the works at a few agencies in Los Angeles. Given was not sure which companies and agencies in Seattle signed up for the early warning system, noting it would be ""a number of technical and industrial users."" He knew of at least one water company that planned to use the Shake Alert system in Seattle, shutting down certain pumps to prevent against damage. Given was clear to remind people this isn't earthquake prediction, it's just ""very rapid detection."" Ten or 20 seconds seems about the best warning we can get, as a sort of earthquake prediction seems is almost impossible, Given says. ""You're not ever going to get 10 minutes,"" Given says. The USGS will host a free public lecture on the Shake Alert system in California Thursday night, and it's available on live-stream.","SEATTLE -- Imagine getting a text alert on your cellphone.

Danny Crichton,"Facebook Messenger was down for me for about an hour earlier this week. My MacBook Pro randomly kernel panics overnight and restarts. Slack was down, and Github, and AWS. A little more than a year ago, Dyn went down, throwing the DNS layer of the internet into a tailspin. Practically every chip made by Intel has serious security flaws. Equifax leaked 143 million accounts. Tokyo-based Coincheck lost over $400 million in tokens due to hackers. If software is eating the world, then that might explain why everything seems so ridiculously broken these days. It’s easy to just blame companies, or hackers, or software engineers, and it’s just as easy to just give up and believe that nothing is going to get better and revert to a pre-agrarian society. What we have is a real crisis in reliability, not just across software, but across our entire society. Even the U.S. government had some serious downtime this week. What’s going on is that we have greatly increased the magnitude of complexity of our society’s systems, even as we couple them more tightly together. Charles Perrow, a sociology professor at Yale, described the combination of these two as “ normal accidents ” in an eponymous book. It’s an oxymoronic term for a very intelligent observation: that what we think of as “accidents” or crashes or bugs are really quite common and indeed, inevitable, given the design of systems that we rely on. Complex systems are ones in which changes, even small ones, can have disproportionate effects on the outcome of a system. Take last year’s downtime of S3, Amazon’s storage layer. According to Amazon’s after action report : “an authorized S3 team member using an established playbook executed a command which was intended to remove a small number of servers for one of the S3 subsystems that is used by the S3 billing process. Unfortunately, one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended.” Amazon has fixed the issue and put in new safeguards to make sure such a change can’t happen again. That’s fantastic, and Amazon should be lauded for writing up and disclosing a comprehensive report on the error. But this was a “normal accident” — the sheer complexity of Amazon’s services means that the surface area of things that can go wrong is practically infinite. On top of complexity, tight coupling means that various independent parts of a system are designed to work closely together. When S3 went down, it knocked out a bunch of major websites, because websites had no backup or redundancy in the event that Amazon’s services were not working. That is, except for Netflix, which had developed redundancies in its infrastructure to ensure that the failure of any individual component would not bring down the entire system. Everything about our modern world has increased complexity and how tightly coupled our systems are. Take software development itself. The (usually) clearly designed APIs and libraries of the host operating system have been replaced by a ghastly and constantly evolving collection of libraries and web frameworks, a palimpsest of code and hope. Even the supposedly stable parts of the stack can be our undoing. The Heartbleed bug in the OpenSSL library was a gaping hole in every single secure transaction that happened on the web. It just so happened that at the time, there was a single maintainer working full-time on the project, and that the OpenSSL Software Foundation had annual donations of $2,000. This starts to get at the rot that is happening. Everything requires maintenance, practically all the time. It doesn’t have to be millions of man-hours, but it is also certainly not going to be zero either. Yet, coding libraries are abandoned all the time. Many popular libraries are down to a single maintainer, who keeps the library alive but can hardly be expected to guarantee its performance. And yet, we laud innovators who build new software libraries even while the edifice of our progress disintegrates. Academics are increasingly studying this problem of how society views maintainers (hint: not well). Ultimately though, we are all responsible for these outcomes, and we all need to take the opportunity to reduce complexity and increase reliability for any system we are a part of, whether software or not. Can we do sensitivity analysis on each component of the system to ask what would happen if one system — or a combination of systems — would fail? Can we run simulations to prepare everyone from software engineers to CEOs how to handle a data breach, or a database failure, or a power outage? Can we build up more resilience by ensuring that there are carefully-designed redundancies in our most critical systems? Reliable systems do exist. The United States has not had a casualty from an airplane crash since 2013, and on a domestic carrier since 2009. There were 823 million passengers in the United States in 2016 alone. Clearly highly-redundant and reliable systems can be produced if we want them to and build the right culture of maintenance, safety, and reliability. For everyone, but particularly software engineers: let’s get back to basics. It’s better to have more reliable but less features than more features that are breaking every other day. Let’s move slow and break nothing. Reliability and resilience may just be the next major wave of technology we are waiting for, and for those of us who rely on our systems day in and day out, we are ready for this stable world.

Jonathan Shieber,"The once sleepy world of insurance has become the hot ticket for venture investors. Insurance technology companies have raised multiple billions of dollars in the past four years as venture capitalists finance industry disruptors and enabling technologies for established players to fend off new technology-based challengers. In the month since tech-enabled car insurance startup Root Insurance joined the billion dollar club after its $100 million investment round, new investments in startups serving insurers in categories like life insurance, liability insurance, and — most notably — in insurance assessment and analysis services illustrate both the pace of dealmaking in the category and the breadth of technologies being developed for the industry. In the second quarter of 2018, insurance technology investments totaled $527 million in 71 deals, according to a quarterly survey by Willis Tower Watson Securities. While that total amount committed was actually down significantly from the $985 million across 64 transactions in the second quarter of 2017, the total number of deals — at 71 — actually went up. No investment better illustrates the opportunity for investors to play both sides of the insurance industry against each other than the recent $20 million extension Slice Labs raised to an original $11.6 million Series A round which closed in October of 2017. It’s not normal. But abnormal is the new normal for insurance technology investing. Strategic investor The Co-operators, a $3.6 billion collective of Canadian insurance cooperatives, led the extension with participation from the company’s previous investors, XL Innovate, Horizons Fund, and Munich Re/HSB Ventures, and SOMPO, and additional new investors Vero Norte, the investment arm of Grupo Sura and JetBlue Technology Ventures. Slice now offers what it calls “insurance cloud services”, which basically takes the insurance modeling and approval methodologies that other companies have raised significant money to create standalone businesses with, and white labels them for established insurance providers. It’s a bit of a pivot for Slice, which initially launched with the thesis of providing an on-demand insurance policy and coverage for anything anyone wanted insured. If Slice is trying to give insurers the ability to build their own tools in-house and fight back against a deluge of startups, Covr Financial Technologies is trying to give those insurers new channels to sell through as they confront the dwindling of their direct sales channels. That company raised $10 million in a Series A round of its own — bringing the company’s total financing to $20 million. Joining previous investors Nyca Partners, Commerce Ventures, Contour Venture Partners and Connectivity Capital Partners was the strategic investor Allianz Life Ventures — the investment arm of the insurance giant Allianz. “Financial institutions see protection as an important component of the financial planning discussions they have with their customers and Covr is in a unique position to tap modern technology to solve this challenge,” said Emily Reitan, vice president of Strategy and Business Development for Allianz Life. Big banks like Morgan Stanley, US Bank and SunTrust all use either Covr’s digital advisor or consumer facing platforms to make life insurance sales part of a broader package of wealth management services. The idea is that the banks provide an additional service, and life insurers get another way to pitch to a customer while Covr gets a cut. “Covr is helping us solve an important financial need for our clients” said Michael Finnegan, Head of Insurance Platforms at Morgan Stanley in a statement. “They have allowed us to fundamentally change our insurance process to a technology-enabled solution that delivers a positive experience for both the financial advisor and our clients.” Finally there’s Jones, a startup that’s pitching liability insurance backed by Chubb for independent contractors and the building owners and managers that hire them. The company raised $2.8 million in a seed round fromHetz Ventures, JLL Spark, MetaProp Ventures, GroundUp Ventures and 500 Startups. The company’s technology marries pay-as-you-go insurance for contractors to obtain a certificate of insurance with a back-end management system for building managers and construction companies to ensure their compliance and oversight requirements are being met. The company is in beta with construction companies and real estate management firms like ARCO Construction and JLL, but if its services gain ground, it would mean a huge windfall for Chubb Insurance, which is the company’s sole underwriter for the insurance policies it’s pitching. Slice, Covr, and Jones all represent one type of startup business that’s attracting venture dollars — the enabling technologies or channels for existing insurers to experiment with or sell through to reach new consumers. Meanwhile, there’s another category of startup — and one that’s attracted massive valuations by running directly at incumbent players with an eye toward dislodging them from their perches atop the industry. It’s this category that has attracted the most money and the largest valuations in property and casualty, health, and auto insurance. Root Insurance is only the most recent example of this type of company. In health insurance Oscar Health is also valued at $1 billion for its attempts to try and unseat incumbents in health insurance. Lemonade raised $120 million from SoftBank (in what might be that firm’s only intelligent real estate-related deal ) and is likely approaching or surpassing that billion-dollar valuation threshold itself. As Rafal Walkiewicz, the chief executive of Willis Tower Watson noted in his report on the industry in the first quarter, “Investors are clearly willing to make increased bets on InsurTech and funding rounds are becoming larger.” But the bulk of the biggest investments were being made by pure-play venture capital firms rather than industry incumbents with more experience in insurance. “Perhaps the stakes are becoming too high for insurers,” Walkiwicz writes. “Especially if they are mostly investing in order to learn how to improve their existing processes.”",The once sleepy world of insurance has become the hot ticket for venture investors.

The Conversation,"Climate change gets blamed for a lot of things these days: inundating small islands, fueling catastrophic fires, amping-up hurricanes and smashing Arctic sea ice.
But a global review of insect research has found another casualty: 40% of insect species are declining and a third are endangered. It confirms what many have been suspecting: in Australia and around the world, arthropods which include insects, spiders, centipedes and the like appear to be in trouble.
The global review comes hard on the heels of research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA that suggests a potent link between intensifying heat waves and stunning declines in the abundance of arthropods.
If that studys findings are broadly valid something still far from certain it has chilling implications for global biodiversity.
Our natural world depends on arthropods. Steve Raubenstine/Pixabay
Arthropod Armageddon
In the mid-1970s, researchers on the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico conducted a large-scale study to measure the total biomass (living mass) of insects and other arthropods in the islands intact rainforests, using sweep nets and sticky-traps.
Four decades later, another research team returned to the island and repeated the study using identical methods and the same locations. To their surprise, they found that arthropod biomass was just one-eighth to one-sixtieth of that in the 1970s a shocking collapse overall.
And the carnage didnt end there. The team found that a bevy of arthropod-eating lizards, birds and frogs had fallen sharply in abundance as well.
Insects are crucial in food webs for species such as this jacamar. Pixabay
In the minds of many ecologists, a widespread collapse of arthropods could be downright apocalyptic. Arthropods pollinate some of our most important food crops and thousands of wild plant species, disperse seeds, recycle nutrients and form key links in food chains that sustain entire webs of life.
This ecological ubiquity arises because arthropods are so abundant and diverse, comprising at least two-thirds of all known species on Earth. In the 1940s, evolutionary biologist J. B. S. Haldane quipped that God has an inordinate fondness for beetles. Humans might think we rule the world, but the planet really belongs to arthropods.
Killer heat waves
The researchers who documented the arthropod collapse in Puerto Rico considered a variety of possible causes, including pesticides and habitat disruption. But the evidence kept pointing to another driver: rising temperatures.
Weather stations in Puerto Rico indicate that temperatures there have risen progressively in the past several decades by 2 on average.
But the researchers are far less worried about a gradual increase in temperature than the intensification of heat waveswhich have risen markedly in Puerto Rico. This is because nearly all living species have thresholds of temperature tolerance.
For example, research in Australia has shown that at 41, flying foxes become badly heat-stressed, struggling to find shade and flapping their wings desperately to stay cool.
But nudge the thermometer up just one more degree, to 42, and the bats suddenly die.
In November, heat waves that peaked above 42 in north Queensland killed off almost a third of the regions Spectacled Flying Foxes. The ground beneath bat colonies was littered with tens of thousands of dead animals. Dedicated animal carers could only save a small fraction of the dying bats.
The El Niño connection
El Niño events fluctuations in Pacific sea-surface temperatures that drive multi-year variations in weather across large swaths of the planet are also part of this story. New research appears to be resolving longstanding uncertainties about El Niños and global warming.
Recent studies published in Nature and Geophysical Research Letters suggest global warming will in fact intensify El Niños causing affected areas to suffer even more intensively from droughts and heat waves.
And this ties back to Puerto Rico, because the researchers there believe a series of unusually intense El Niño heatwaves were the cause the arthropod Armageddon. If theyre right then global warming was the gun, but El Niño pulled the trigger.
Beyond heat waves
Puerto Rico is certainly not the only place on Earth that has suffered severe declines in arthropods. Robust studies in Europe, North America, Australia and other locales have revealed big arthropod declines as well.
And while climatic factors have contributed to some of these declines, its clear that many other environmental changes, such as habitat disruption, pesticides, introduced pathogens, and light pollution, are also taking heavy tolls.
Monarch butterflies are declining in the USA and Mexico, probably from habitat disruption. Pixabay
So, at a planetary scale, arthropods are suffering from a wide variety of environmental insults. Theres no single reason why their populations are collapsing.
The bottom line is: were changing our world in many different ways at once. And the myriad little creatures that play so many critical roles in the fabric of life are struggling to survive the onslaught.

ConsenSys, a major blockchain entity fuelling Ethereum-related software solutions en masse, confirmed it was to be restructured in a way that would see unprofitable cryptocurrency it supports be cut off from funding altogether. So, after running the business on an avant-garde lust for worker autonomy and project variety, its founder Joseph Lubin was finally forced to admit ConsenSyss model is unsustainable in its current form. He added it was necessary to introduce metrics like revenue and return on investment to his business, as if they were at all revolutionary. Ultimately, all these events point to one thing an industry-wide problem with managing expectations. Companies seem to be ill-equipped to navigate rhetoric and hype to properly communicate the limitations of the technology they sell to the general public, as well as with institutional investors. If 2019 is to be earmarked by any specific milestones let it be a market-wide understanding of sustainability, no matter the price of Bitcoin. While the layoffs probably wont stop any time soon, analysts have already confirmed blockchain startups are withdrawing cryptocurrency from their coffers more regularly. In fact, companies in charge of Ethereum-based tokens siphoned at least 170,000 ETH ($17.7 million) in November, the third largest withdrawal period of the year.

"Beth Skwarecki on Vitals, shared by Beth Skwarecki to Lifehacker","the beginning, the laurel-or-yanny clip said laurel and nothing but laurel. Here is the original version of the clip, recorded by an opera singer working for Vocabulary.com. Chances are, you’ll hear it as laurel too. Let’s compare it to the viral clip and we’ll see exactly what changed, and why half of us hear the viral clip as yanny. The original recording came from Vocabulary.com’s 2007 effort to include pronunciations for the site’s most commonly looked-up words. This was the recording made for the word laurel. It was spoken by Jay Aubrey Jones, one of eight singers commissioned by the company to read the words from home using a provided laptop, microphone, and portable sound booth. (Opera singers are trained to read IPA, the pronunciation code that dictionaries also use.) Jones personally read about 36,000 words for the site. There were so many sound clips to process, says Vocabulary.com co-founder and chief technical officer Marc Tinkler, that software did everything automatically: trimming the beginning and end of each file, applying a noise-reduction filter if needed, and converting to the mp3 format that saves space and bandwidth. The beauty of the mp3 format is that it can compress sound files into a small enough amount of space to easily share around the internet. The drawback of the mp3 format is that it does this by removing sounds from the recording and introducing some glitchy, tinny noises. If you’re okay with a file that’s only slightly compressed, you can leave in most of the original sound information. But, says Tinkler, “this was back in 2007 or 2008, so we were pretty aggressive in the downsampling process.” I asked Tinkler if there was any chance he had the original file for comparison. He found it on a DVD in a storage closet, and uploaded it to Soundcloud for all to hear. Technically this is not the exact original, because Soundcloud provides it as an mp3 but it was originally recorded in an even higher quality format. But it’s more original, shall we say, than the version you and your friends have been arguing over. And it’s clear enough that we can now tell exactly what happened when the file was compressed. What Got Lost Compressing the laurel clip had a major casualty: the second speech formant. Without this part of the sound spectrum, an L can sound like “ee” and an R can sound maybe a little bit like an N. Here’s why. Sound waves each have a frequency. The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch we hear. But the sound of speech includes many frequencies at the same time. Our ears and brains pick out the strongest frequencies from this mess of sound. Speech scientists call these formants. The two lowest-pitch formants give us enough information to tell the difference between one vowel sound and another. If you open up a sound file in an analysis program, you can see these formants. That’s exactly what my father, a speech scientist at California University of Pennsylvania, did when I showed him the viral clip. He opened the mp3 in a program called Wavesurfer and proceeded to show me, on his laptop at the kitchen table, how I was wrong to hear laurel because the formants match up to the sounds “ee”, “a”, something ambiguous that could be an “n”, and a final “ee.” Yanny. But, he conceded, there’s just enough ambiguity that you could hear laurel if you really wanted to. (He suspected at first that the file was carefully crafted to be ambiguous, an intentional audio illusion.) For the record, I have never heard anything but laurel from this file. My dad can read the formants just from the black-and-white spectrogram view, but Wavesurfer helpfully detects them and color-codes them. Wavesurfer agrees with my dad, and reads this file as saying yanny. But if you give it the original file, it highlights a different set of formants: the ones that say, very clearly, laurel. To understand what happened, take a look at the red and green lines. These are the first two formants, which we’ll call F1 (red) and F2 (green). They both hover around the bottom of the spectrogram. A third formant, F3, floats high above them in blue, dipping down very close to the F2 during the R sound in laurel. But then look at the processed clip, the one that you’ve been sharing with your friends. (Click the arrow in the slideshow above.) It’s noisier overall, thanks to the mp3 compression. That noise blurs out the difference between the F1 and F2, leaving both Wavesurfer and our brains to figure there’s maybe only one formant down there, the F1. That means that the higher-up line, the one that dips down in the middle, looks like it must be the F2. At the beginning of the clip, the F1 and F2 down low next to each other are compatible with hearing an L. But if F1 is down there, and F2 is way up above 2000 hertz, that’s an “ee” or a Y sound. Obliterating the second formant changes how we interpret the sound. But There’s Enough Room to Disagree The viral, processed clip doesn’t entirely remove the second formant, just makes it harder to discern among the noise. If you’re expecting to hear laurel, and if your ears and brain can find two formants in the low frequencies, you can still hear it as laurel. But to a different person, the sounds of yanny might stand out more, as Gizmodo reported earlier this week. So what about those videos and slider tools that show you can change what you hear by listening to just the high or the low frequencies? It turns out that phenomenon, too, comes down to the speech formants. If you cut off the higher frequencies, you’ll be left with just the lower part of the spectrum, where the original F1 and F2 were. Your brain will work a little harder to be able to tell those two formants apart, instead of locking on to what it thinks is an F2 higher up. By contrast, if you listen to just the higher frequencies of the clip, your brain picks up on the real F3 as a possible F2, and assumes there must be a single F1 down in the lower part of the spectrum. So this trick changes your perception not because yanny is “in” one part of the spectrum and laurel “in” another, but because either way your brain is only hearing some of the formants, and is guessing at what the others might be.","the beginning, the laurel-or-yanny clip said laurel and nothing but laurel.

Bill Bischoff,"In 2017 we had Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria and destructive wildfires in California. Last year, we had Hurricanes Florence and Michael and more California wildfires. These events resulted in deaths and billions in property damage. The nation will undoubtedly be hit by other natural and manmade disasters in the not-too-distant future, because this is a big country and stuff happens. 
Unfortunately, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) places a new restriction on personal casualty loss deductions for 2018-2025. 
Heres what you need to know, starting with the necessary background information. 
Personal casualty loss basics
Our beloved Internal Revenue Code potentially allows individuals to claim federal income tax deductions for casualty losses to personal-use property. The word casualty means damage or destruction of property resulting from an identifiable event that is sudden and unexpected. So we are talking about casualties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, and the like. 
Calculating a personal casualty loss
For federal income tax purposes, a casualty loss generally equals the lesser of: (1) the tax basis of the property immediately before the casualty event or (2) the decrease in the propertys fair market value (FMV) due to the casualty event. 
The decrease in FMV (if any) is a frequent point of contention between taxpayers and the IRS. 
Recommendation: If you have a significant casualty loss, consider hiring a competent independent appraiser to establish the amount of the loss. In addition to backing up your tax-saving loss deduction, an independent appraisal may help you negotiate a better insurance settlement. 
Safe-harbor casualty loss calculation methods
The IRS provides five safe-harbor methods for measuring casualty losses for personal residences. The first three methods are: (1) the estimated repair cost method for losses of $20,000 or less, (2) the de minimis method for losses of $5,000 or less, and (3) the insurance method. The contractor safe-harbor method and the disaster loan appraisal safe-harbor method are only available for personal residence losses due to federally-declared disasters. For personal belongings, theres a safe-harbor method for measuring casualty losses under $5,000. The replacement cost safe-harbor method is available for personal belonging losses due to federally-declared disasters. (Source: IRS Revenue Procedure 2018-8.) When you use one of these safe-harbor methods to measure a personal casualty loss, the IRS cannot question your calculation. Your tax adviser can give you full details on how to use the safe-harbor methods. 
Warning: For purposes of eligibility for these safe-harbor casualty loss calculation methods, the term personal residence does not include any property that youve used as rental property or any property containing a home office used in a business. Condos and coops do not count as personal residences if you do not own the structural components (e.g. foundation, walls, and roof) or if you only own a fractional interest in the structural components. Trailers and mobile homes also do not count. The term personal belongings does not include cars, SUVs, trucks, vans, motorcycles, boats, aircraft, mobile homes, trailers, RVs, or off-road vehicles. Antiques and other assets that maintain or increase their value also do not count as personal belongings. 
Longstanding limitations on personal casualty loss deductions
To calculate the casualty loss deduction for personal-use property, you must take three steps. First subtract any insurance proceeds. Next, subtract $100 per casualty event. Finally, combine the results from the first two steps and then subtract 10% of your adjusted gross income (AGI) for the year you claim the loss deduction. AGI includes all taxable income items and is reduced by certain deductions, such as the ones for student loan interest, HSA contributions, and alimony paid. You can potentially deduct the loss that remains after all these subtractions as an itemized deduction on Schedule A of Form 1040. 
Remember: For 2018-2025, its harder to itemize because the TCJA basically doubled the standard deduction amounts. For 2018, the standard deductions are $12,000 for single filers, $18,000 for heads of households, and $24,000 for married joint-filing couples. For 2019, the standard deductions are $12,200, $18,350, and $24,400 respectively. 
Example 1: Calculating a personal casualty loss deduction
In 2018, you sustained a $40,000 loss to your home (after considering insurance reimbursements) due to a federally-declared disaster. Your AGI for last year was $100,000. Calculate your deductible loss of $29,900 ($40,000 - $100 - $10,000) on Form 4684 (Casualties and Thefts) and then deduct the loss on Schedule A of Form 1040. 
See also: After Hurricane Michael, what homeowners need to know about disaster insurance
Unfavorable TCJA change
For losses incurred in 20182025, the TCJA generally eliminates deductions for personal casualty losses, except for losses due to federally-declared disasters.
Exception: If you have personal casualty gains because your insurance proceeds exceeded the tax basis of the damaged or destroyed property, you can deduct personal casualty losses that are not due to a federally-declared disaster up to the amount of your personal casualty gains. 
Example 2: Calculating a personal casualty loss deduction under the new law.
Same as Example 1, except this time your $40,000 loss in 2018 was not due to a federally-declared disaster. The loss is non-deductible. Sorry about that.
Special deduction timing election
When your casualty loss is due to a federally-declared disaster, a special election allows you to deduct the loss on your tax return for the preceding year. If youve already filed your return for the preceding year, you can file an amended return to make the election and claim the deduction in the earlier year. 
Deadline: The election must be made by no later than six months after the due date (without considering extensions) for filing your Form 1040 for the year in which the disaster actually occurs. However, the election itself must be made on an original or amended return for the preceding year. Confusing? You bet.
Recommendation: The decision on whether or not to make the special deduction timing election should be based on an evaluation of: (1) whether you need cash quickly and (2) your overall tax situation in the casualty event year and the preceding year. Tax-wise, the most important factor is usually your AGI in those two years.
The bottom line
There you have it: most of what you need to know about disaster-related losses to personal-use property. For full details, see IRS Publication 547 (Casualties, Disasters, and Thefts). If you have a big loss, consider hiring a tax pro to deal with the complicated rules and prepare your return for the year you claim the loss deduction.",Only federally-declared disasters are affected.,2019-02-04T17:17:46Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Marketwatch.com'}",Tax Guy: House damaged by a hurricane?

Suzanne Barlyn,"(Reuters) - U.S. insurers are bracing for what could be $20 billion in losses as Hurricane Florence barrels toward the Carolinas and Virginia, bringing punishing rains and potentially deadly flooding. Hurricane Florence, on track to become the first Category 4 storm to make a direct hit on North Carolina in six decades, howled closer to shore on Wednesday, as schools and factories were being shuttered and authorities ordered more than 1 million people in the region to evacuate. Losses from Florence could be on par with those from two previous storms: Hurricane Hazel, which ravaged North Carolina in 1954, causing $15 billion in losses, and Hurricane Hugo in 1989, which caused $20 billion, according to a report from risk modeling firm RMS on Tuesday. “As we look back at previous events, although hurricanes making landfall in the Carolinas are rare, the losses through this triple-threat of storm surge, wind and inland flood, could also be significant,” RMS said in the report. The firm will have a better estimate for total insured losses after Florence makes landfall. The slow-moving storm could dump between 20 and 30 inches of rain in the Carolinas after making landfall, according to a report on Wednesday by risk modeler AIR Worldwide. More than 758,000 homes in the Carolinas and Virginia are at risk, according to risk assessment service CoreLogic. Liberty Mutual Insurance and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company write the most commercial property insurance coverage in North and South Carolina, according to a report on Wednesday by Moody’s, citing data from SNL Financial. Other top commercial property insurers in the region include The Travelers Companies, Chubb Ltd. and a U.S. subsidiary of Zurich Insurance Group, Moody’s said. The S&amp;P Composite 1500 Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Index fell 0.5 percent on Wednesday, with shares of insurers including Travelers Companies Inc, Allstate Corp, American International Group Inc and Chubb Ltd trading down less than one percent. “Stocks tend to fall in front of a storm because of uncertainty,” said Sandler O’Neill analyst Paul Newsome. They typically rebound once insurers and risk modelers get a clearer picture of actual losses and whether individual companies have enough capital in place to cover them, Newsome said.

Pia Ceres,"The gods of technology giveth, and they taketh away. Every year, we celebrate the latest and greatest gadgets and gearbut we also bid adieu to the ones we'll never use again. Below, our heartfelt obituaries to all the tech that died in 2018.
iPhone SE
Apple laid to rest the iPhone SE in September, after showcasing three flashy new iPhones. The SE is survived by a series of bigger phones, and we mourn the days when iPhones could fit comfortably in women's jeans pockets.
Kindle Voyage
Amazon quietly stopped selling the Kindle Voyage, its upscale e-reader with a glass screen, in July. It's all right, though; we always liked the Paperwhite better.
YouTube Annotations
Remember the olden days of YouTube? You'd be watching your favorite grainy videos and suddenly this ugly black rectangle would pop up, imploring you to ""click to subscribe"" or click on another link. Those intrusions, called YouTube annotations, were largely phased out this year. Existing ones will officially be erased in January 2019and not a moment too soon.
@sweden
Twitter lost a haven of sincerity when @sweden bid the platform hejdå in October. Since 2011, a new Swede has taken over the account each week to tweet dispatches of everyday life in Swedenincluding the perspectives of recent Swedish migrants, a prison guard, and a sheep farmer who tweeted photos of lambs.
Apple Music Connect
If you're wondering, ""Sorry, what is Apple Music Connect?"" then youre on the right track. Launched in 2015 as a social feed for artists, the platform never seemed to gain much traction. It played its swan song in Decembernot that you'd noticed.
Digg
The popular RSS and feed reader Digg went asunder in March. Its Reader app allowed users to curate and follow feeds from their favorite site. You still have a feed reader options, like Feedly.
FilmStruck
FilmStruck, the film streaming platform beloved by cinephiles for its classic and arthouse selection, went dark in November. Its took with it movies like Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and the 1933 King Kong. But not all is lost: There are still other streaming options with robust archives, like MUBI, Kanopy, and Fandor.
Musical.ly
Musical.ly isn't quite deadmore like reincarnated. The lip-syncing app was absorbed into TikTok this year, migrating users' accounts into the 15-second video social media app.
Nintendo Miitomo Network
Two years after its launch, Nintendo decided to sunset the Miitomo app this May. It brought an end a world where your bubbly, bobble-headed Mii could wander about and communicate with equally adorable, Nintendo-fied friends.
Path
Path is another casualty in the social media space. Founded in 2010 by a former Facebook employee, the more minimalistic and intimate platform flourished briefly, before finally being laid to rest in October.
StumbleUpon
For the curious, StumbleUpon was a window into the random wonders of the internet. With a single click, the discovery tool allowed users to click and be transported to a site that they might not have ever discovered. After 16 illustrious years, StumbleUpon took its final journey in June.
Swype
Why tap on a smartphone keyboard when you could simply swipe across the letters, without lifting a finger? Swype, the original app that popularized the swipe-not-type keyboard interaction, was pulled from the App Store and Google Play in February.
Tumblr porn
In December, Tumblr announced that it would ban ""adult content"" from its site, raising heated discussions about the place of sexuality and community on the internet. The transition has been rough: it was found that Tumblr's AI incorrectly marked items as NSFW. Off Tumblr, porn bloggers have tried to seek refuge for their content on other, smaller blog sites.
Google+, Inbox, URL Shortener, Allo
This year, Google announced that it will be pulling the plug on a number of its services. Messaging app Allo, email app Inbox, and the Google URL shortener will all be sunset in March 2019. In October, Google announced that they will shut down its Google+ social network for consumers, after it was revealed that the data of up to 500,000 users had been compromised for years.

The latest casualty was 68-year-old Thelma Villanueva, who died in the intensive care unit of the Zamboanga City Medical Center ""after [her] family decided to cease life support,"" the military's Western Mindanao Command said. 
Two blasts rocked the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Cathedral in Jolo Sunday morning while a mass was ongoing, killing parishioners and state troops. 
The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the military is looking at the involvement of the IS-inspired Abu Sayyaf group. 
Investigation showed a woman left one of the bombs near a pew inside the church, but authorities have yet to establish the culprit's identity.
Four persons of interest, including the sibling of a slain Abu Sayyaf official, earlier surrendered to government troops to deny their involvement in the bloody incident.
The government has launched an all-out war against the Abu Sayaff group in the wake of the attack while the military called for calm and public vigilance.

"Rashmi Shivni, PBS NewsHour","During times of war, wild animals are more likely to be hunted or displaced from their natural habitat by humans seeking shelter. Rates of ivory poaching goes up and animal reproduction declines. From 1950 to 2000, more than 80 percent of wars across the globe occurred within biodiversity hotspots, several at African wildlife preserves. Since it’s difficult to capture ecological data in conflict zones, the effects of warfare on wildlife has been a challenge to study. But one group of researchers examined about 200 documents and discovered some patterns. They describe their findings and suggestions for future conservation policy in a Nature paper published on Wednesday. Josh Daskin, a conservation ecologist at the Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies and lead author of this study, said his team chose to study Africa because it’s one of the last places on Earth with close-to-intact wildlife populations. “This place is emblematic of the broader impacts of war on wildlife, and particularly, both war and wildlife are dramatic on this continent.” Daskin learned about this problem while doing fieldwork at Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique in 2012. From 1977 to 1992, Mozambique underwent a civil war. Nearly a million people died. Several times during this period, the rebel army and Mozambican government used Gorongosa as a headquarters, and native species at the park faced many threats, Daskin said. People hunted their way through all the large mammals in the Savannah, Daskin said. “Everything that you normally think of on an African Savannah—elephants, buffaloes, zebra, wildebeest and a bunch of antelope species—was in this park, which lost well over 95 percent of its wildlife during this time.” In his latest research, Daskin and his team analyzed the little data that existed between 1946 to 2010. They looked at 253 populations of 36 large herbivorous mammals, including elephants and hippopotamuses, across 126 protected preserves in 19 African nations. Daskin focused on these large mammals because they’re known as “keystone species,” which means if their numbers drop, their ecosystem could crumble. The researchers then discovered that war tore through more than 70 percent of African parks, and the frequency of conflict—how often wars occurred—was the single most crucial predictor of wildlife population trends. During times of conflict, population growth rates fell. Other factors like protected-area size, conflict intensity or instances of drought had less of an impact. Daskin listed a number of ways, both direct and indirect, that animals suffer under human conflict. For example, a direct cause of death includes hunting animals for food or poaching for ivory. It was unclear whether gunfire or bombs hurt any animals during this time, but it remains a possibility. Indirect causes include disruption from humans fleeing violence and seeking shelter in animal habitats, food shortages or fewer opportunities to reproduce. “You could see war as a ‘knock-on effect,’ which means war unintentionally compromises wild animal populations,” said ecologist Robert Francis of King’s College London, who did not contribute to this study. “It’s hard for populations, for example, if their reproduction cycle is affected. War’s impact on reproduction will knock on the future populations because it takes decades to get back to a healthy population stage.” Francis said that researchers long knew about this issue but not the extent nor the details of such “knock-on effects.” He believes this research can inform other research and policy on the subject. “Africa is subject to a lot of conflicts and probably will be for a while,” Francis said. “So we need to figure out ways to sustain conservation, especially during ceasefires or times of peace, and set up a legacy of protection in those areas.” Though these findings seem bleak, Daskin’s team said that while conflict did lead to population decline, it rarely led to extinction, a sign that populations war-torn areas can recover from rapid declines. “Populations rarely blinked out of existence, and a great reason for that is due to places like Gorongosa, where the government and conservationists set up conditions so less poaching occurs, more people live healthier lives and everyone values their protected parks and wildlife,” Daskin said. “There is potential for restoration in these areas because conservation can only be successful when human communities around the park are successful and at peace.” This article is reprinted with permission from PBS NewsHour.

New Delhi, March 3
Three key operatives, including a Pakistan spy agency ISI Colonel, were killed in the February 26 Indian Air Force strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp at Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, sources have said.
There are also unconfirmed reports of JeM founder Masood Azhar’s death due to injuries. However, a Pakistan TV channel, quoting sources close to the family of the JeM chief, said Azhar is “alive”, without elaborating on his health condition.
Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had yesterday said Azhar was being treated at a hospital.
Inter-Services Intelligence Colonel Salim Qari, JeM trainer Maulana Moeen and the handler of Pulwama suicide bomber Adil Dar were among those killed in the IAF assault.
Colonel Qari was the trainer for almost three generations of suicide bombers and had carried out covert operations in India and Afghanistan. The ISI officer used to stay at the JeM camp.
There is credible human and technical intelligence to suggest Moeen, a bomb maker, was killed along with Dar’s handler. Sources said the number of terrorists killed in the Balakot strike was nearly 30 and not 250-300.
The airstrikes hit all terror safe houses, except the main building, located on a hilltop at Balakot where a sprawling 4.5-acre campus exists. 
Though the Balakot terror camp usually holds 250-300 trainee terrorists, Pakistan had moved out most of them apprehending a strike. “That night (February 26), no more than 80-100 terrorists were there,” the sources said.
Neither the Indian Government nor the IAF had claimed 300 casualties, as was being reported by the media based on the usual average strength of the terror camp.
Data and imagery with the government indicate the ‘Popeye’ air-to-surface missiles fired from Mirage 2000 fighter jets had hit the designated targets.
India also has inputs that its embassy in Afghanistan capital Kabul and consulates in Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif may be targeted by the JeM in retaliation, with the terror outfit now under pressure from Pakistan not to hit targets inside India.

Indian Kabul embassy and two consulates in Afghanistan on alert as these may be targeted by JeM in retaliation
Hurting national interest
""Cong-led UPA from 2004 to 2014 ran a terrible government. From 2014 to 2019, it was even a more terrible Opposition. Their statements have hurt India’s national interest. They give smiles to Pakistan to discredit India""—Arun Jaitley, FM
Aim was to send message
""The purpose of the airstrikes was not to cause human casualty but to send out the message that India is capable of hitting deep inside enemy lines. Neither PM Modi nor any government spokesperson had given any figure on the casualty. The media and social media did that""—SS Ahluwalia, Union Minister
Why question those asking
""Calling those who question veracity of strikes anti-national is baffling. Opposition should not fall into trap of changing entire poll discourse from pressing issues... How does it help the enemies? Only puts govt in tight spot."" —Mehbooba Mufti, PDP chief","3 key operatives died in Balakot The Tribune India ‘Abhinandan Varthaman is first IAF pilot to down an F-16’: Air Chief Marshal S Krishnaswamy Hindustan Times The Pakistan albatross The Tribune Opinion | Terror, the common thread linking Pulwama, Balakot Live…",2019-03-04T01:39:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Tribuneindia.com'}",3 key operatives died in Balakot - The Tribune India,https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/3-key-operatives-died-in-balakot/737704.html,https://images.tribuneindia.com/cms/gall_content/2019/3/2019_3$largeimg04_Monday_2019_065616193.jpg,,Tribuneindia.com,casualty,1
Julie Muncy,"For a long time, my most prized possession was a strategy guide. A lush, thick booklet of information and art devoted to the first game I ever beat: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I would look lovingly at the concept art and screenshots on the pages as I learned how to find all the Gold Skulltulas and forge the Big Goron's Swordand discovered, definitively, that the Triforce was not a collectible item. Years later, short on cash, I sold that strategy guide at a used games store. They gave me three dollars for it. The fate of that guide feels like a depressing microcosm for the strategy guide industry, which has all but shuttered entirely. Last week, Prima Games, the dominant force in the print publishing industry for videogame guides, announced that it would be shutting down, with closures beginning in the upcoming weeks and continuing until the final office closes in March of 2019. This means print strategy guides, formerly the best source of in-depth information about videogames to exist, will largely cease to exist in a broad consumer format. Smaller publishers and boutiques will undoubtedly continue to publish these guides, or at least books like them; hardcore players like their collectibles, after all. But the mainstream existence of the videogame strategy guide, once a major pillar of the industry, will be all but gone in less than a year's time. The truth is, strategy guides have been doomed for a while. The internet's freedom of information is a death knell to an industry predicated on revealing a piece of entertainment's secrets. As has been the case for years, any information that can be found in a strategy guide can be Googled or YouTubed within hours of a game's release, but there's a mystique to strategy guides, a joy. And that's what I'm going to miss. Media doesn't come with physical artifacts anymore. As the entertainment world continues to digitizethe content, the delivery, the very experienceit increasingly lacks the accoutrements of that experience. Those have become the purview of increasingly expensive collector's editions, specialized releases for only the most serious consumers. And in the gaming world, such artifacts are many: Figurines, steelcases, maps, flags. Bethesda's newest open-world behemoth Fallout 76 arrives this week, and while many will choose to simply download it via Steam or a console, diehard fans may opt for the Power Armor Edition, which at $200 comes with a wearable helmet (as well as a canvas carrying bag, should you choose to, dunno, carry it places). But such editions are purely elective, no matter how much you love a game or franchise; they're an aesthetic celebration. The strategy guide was a subtler, more utilitarian form of celebration, one that marked a game's presence in your life. Each one was a thick tome of secrets, and art, with every detail you could need to get through the game without too much trouble. Sometimes, I would even buy strategy guides for games that I didn't have the platform to play. Getting information about a game that way felt like a secondhand experience to playing, a way of gathering up enough data about a game that I could choreograph an approximation of the experience in my mind. The reason strategy guides are going extinct is self-evident: it's because not enough people are buying them. (Not even in e-book form.) But they're also a casualty of a slow transformation of media that has changed entertainment from objects that we own to licenses that we purchase, experiences we rent and store in the cloud or on game consoles, separated off from our material lives, never quite allowed to actually shape the space we live in. Those little books of game strategies and hidden wonders were always a minor part of my space. But they were always a part of it, and as modern media continues to transform into something increasingly unrecognizable, they'll be missed.

Andy Boxall,"Jack Taylor/Getty Images I n 2011, U.S. customs seized and presumably destroyed 60,000 Kinder Surprise eggs — a hollow chocolate egg with a capsule inside containing a toy. Why? The Food and Drug Administration banned the eggs for fear that over-eager children may scoff the chocolate egg and toy down in one go, thus choking on the plastic parts. “These chocolate treats may be cute and seasonal but they are too dangerous to children to be imported legally into the United States,” the Customs and Border Protection website read at the time. There’s no evidence Huawei products are a security threat. Then it was candy. Today it’s phones. While Huawei phones are not yet banned, Americans are now being told these devices are a threat to national security, giving the impression that simply by owning one, all our personal and private information is being monitored and presumably stored or stolen by a clandestine operation on another continent. No-one wants that, in the same way we don’t want little kids choking on a miniature plastic toys. But there’s no evidence Huawei products are a security threat. Like the original Kinder Surprise, Huawei phones are sold all over the world ( almost ) without incident. As scaremongers keep the P20 out of U.S. stores, Americans are missing out on one of the best Android phones available. And that’s shame, even if you don’t want one. One less option There are plenty of smartphones to buy. Spend over $500 and it’s almost assured that it’ll be good. Great, even. So why cry over a phone from a brand you don’t really know? It’s simple: Choice. Having more choice is excellent for us, because it pushes companies to give us better prices and make even better devices in the future, because they’re having to work harder to earn our support. Shutting out a manufacturer lessens that choice. Apple and Samsung must be chuckling away, because thanks to political and business machinations, they’ve not had to fight a newcomer. The Huawei P20 Pro isn’t a perfect phone, but it’s easily as good as any other phone released in the past year. Its camera is better than any other, and right now it’s our favorite Android phone of 2018. It’s absolutely worth your money. Like the Kinder Surprise, it’s inviting, fun, and you can’t buy one. Won’t someone think about the security? You may be thinking, “I trust these people saying Huawei and ZTE phones, services, and infrastructure equipment are a potential security risk.” It’s a fair point, and inviting trouble wouldn’t be sensible at all. You can read all about Huawei’s denial of any government involvement and how it’s privately owned — not by the state — on its site here, but is there any truth to the accusations? “All devices have some level of risk, which varies from device to device and manufacturer to manufacturer” Andrew Blaich, head of device intelligence at mobile security firm, Lookout, told Digital Trends there are three factors at play: “First, speculation fueled by fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Second, insider knowledge of something known, but the information cannot be revealed at this time. Third, a general guidance to minimize any possible risk in the future based on geopolitics or other factors.” Is there any truth to Huawei hardware having backdoors that would allow governments to spy in its users? “As of now, there is no publicly available evidence that this has happened,” he said. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Additionally, Blaich said it’s unfair to single out Huawei, adding, “All devices have some level of risk, which varies from device to device and manufacturer to manufacturer, all depending on the companies, developers, agencies, technology pipeline, app stores, or network operators involved.” Building trust Does that mean we should just accept the risk? No, of course not, so how about looking at Huawei’s relationship with the United Kingdom as a model for keeping everyone happy? Huawei set up the the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre in 2010 with the U.K. intelligence agency, GCHQ. Huawei is a major supplier of network infrastructure in the U.K., and its phones are available through all the big-name carriers with or without a contract. It has a 13 percent market share, according to Counterpoint research, behind Apple and Samsung. To help assuage concerns over security, Huawei set up the the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC) in 2010 with the U.K. intelligence agency, GCHQ. In it, phones and network equipment are tested by Huawei employees, extensively vetted by the U.K. government, and everything is reported to the CEO of the National Cyber Security Centre, which is a part of the GCHQ itself. “The Oversight Board concludes that in the year 2016-17, HCSEC fulfilled its obligations in respect of the provision of assurance that any risks to U.K. national security from Huawei’s involvement in the U.K.’s critical networks have been sufficiently mitigated,” reads the HCSEC 2017 annual report. Huawei works with the U.K. government in a sensible way to reduce fears. The result is more phones on sale, and a stronger, faster, more robust network on which they operate. Losing out Huawei didn’t become the world’s third largest phone maker and the largest supplier of telecoms equipment by not adapting. It’s conscious of China’s poor record when it comes to espionage, and it knows it needs to do all it can to convince governments and companies it’s not a threat. Its success has come with a limited amount of exposure in the U.S. But it’s a business, and selling phones and equipment in America means more profit, and a greater chance to become the world’s number one phone manufacturer — a repeatedly-stated company goal. American phone buyers aren’t just missing out on the P20 Pro; but also Huawei’s investment and expertise in 5G network equipment. The Wall Street Journal reported Washington is consumed with the idea that China will have wider 5G connectivity before the U.S., and wants to do nothing to assist in its technological advancement. It’s a closed-minded approach that may see consumers suffer once again, and place more control in the hands of officials and carriers. The barrier has resulted in Huawei deciding to leave the U.S. to get on without it for now. Current Huawei CEO Eric Xu said he “couldn’t explain” what was going on between China and the U.S., and that it was “beyond him.” Instead, Huawei will focus on the places where it’s already seeing success. And who can blame it? Don’t just shrug your shoulders That’s it. No P20 Pro for you. But if you want one, what can you do? Write to government representatives. Write to networks. How about going into AT&amp;T, Verizon, or Best Buy stores and asking for the Huawei P20 Pro? If enough people tell them, it’ll get back to management. Or, why not import one and really thumb your nose at the establishment? It’s not a choking hazard, so customs won’t seize it. Alternatively, you could always not buy a phone through AT&amp;T or Verizon next time, and choose an unlocked Google Pixel 2 instead. Why not import one and really thumb your nose at the establishment? Don’t think this will make a difference? If 60,000 Kinder Surprise eggs were stopped at the border, imagine how many slipped through. This, and a subtle change in packaging by Kinder, resulted in the considerably more throat-friendly Kinder Joy being sold in American stores by 2017. If we’re proactive enough, and refuse to take scaremongering at face value without evidence, perhaps Huawei’s next phone (which will have 5G, by the way) and the network equipment it connects to will be vetted by a government-backed operation in the U.S., to make sure no one is listening in. More choice means we all win, remember?","The scaremongering about trusting Huawei smartphones and network products has led to one casualty: the sale of one of 2018’s best phones.

Billy Perrigo,"President Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton launched a broadside against the International Criminal Court (ICC), the body mandated by most of the international community to prosecute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. In a speech to the conservative Federalist Society on Monday, Bolton announced that Washington would “use any means necessary” to push back against the organization’s influence. The ICC was established in 2002 in response to a decade of human rights abuses in countries such as Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Supported by 123 nations, it was intended to act as a “court of last resort,” to step in when nations’ legal systems fail. Since then, it has succeeded in convicting several war criminals, even as critics have slammed its slow bureaucracy and its toothlessness in prosecuting crimes outside Africa. Bolton added to those criticisms on Monday, his ire apparently provoked by the Court’s preparation to launch a probe into war crimes in Afghanistan. Last November, the ICC’s chief prosecutor asked judges to authorize an investigation, which could include examining the alleged torture of detainees by U.S. military and intelligence personnel. “Any day now,” Bolton said, “the ICC may announce the start of a formal investigation against these American patriots.” As a result, he warned, Washington was ready to take steps including banning judges of the “illegitimate court” from the country and sanctioning their funds in the U.S. financial system. It wasn’t first time Bolton has crossed the Court. Like several countries, the U.S. sees the court as a challenge to its constitutional authority. The U.S. joined Israel, China and Saudi Arabia in refusing to ratify the ICC’s founding document in 2002, citing its “unacceptable consequences for our national sovereignty.” A key person working on that decision was an Under Secretary of State in the George W. Bush Administration: John R. Bolton. In the years that followed, he spearheaded the signing of approximately 100 bilateral deals to prevent countries around the world handing Americans over to the ICC.That work, he said on Monday, “remains one of my proudest achievements.” None of those deals has ever been tested—no American has been indicted by the Court, let alone convicted. But murmurs of an investigation into war crimes in Afghanistan threaten to change that. Although the U.S. is not a member of the ICC, Afghanistan is. As a result, crimes committed on its territory can legally be brought to the Court, no matter the nationality of the perpetrator. “What we saw from Mr. Bolton on Sept. 10 was a preemptive strike to intimidate the ICC,” the director of the international justice program at Human Rights Watch, Richard Dicker, tells TIME. Washington’s resistance to the ICC is not new, but the threats coming from a senior administration official are—not to mention that the country’s refusal to cooperate could hinder other investigations, too, including Taliban war crimes committed in Afghanistan. “Bolton barely referenced any importance to holding to account in fair trial those responsible for mass slaughter of civilians, the use of rape as a weapon of war, ethnic cleansing as a practice,” says Dicker. “The first casualty here is any prospect of the U.S. credibly asserting itself as a champion for justice.” But it seems Bolton has a different casualty in mind. “The ICC,” he said in his speech, “is already dead to us.”",The U.S. has a long history of opposing the Court,2018-09-12T17:20:17Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",‘Already Dead to Us’: Why the Trump Administration Has a Problem with the International Criminal Court,http://time.com/5393624/john-bolton-international-criminal-court/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/gettyimages-1030570416.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,casualty,1

Chris Kenning,"Larry Nassar. Paul Sancya/AP Michigan State University is moving to fire a dean who it said had failed to enforce guidelines for Larry Nassar, the former doctor for USA Gymnastics. Interim Michigan State University President John Engler said in a memo that he would ask a faculty panel to revoke tenure for Dr. William Strampel, who oversaw the college. Nassar was given two prison sentences for molesting female athletes under the guise of medical treatment. Michigan State University is moving to fire a dean who it said had failed to enforce 2014 guidelines created for sports doctor Larry Nassar in treating young athletes after complaints of sexual misconduct against him. Interim Michigan State University President John Engler said in a memo on Friday he would ask a faculty panel to revoke tenure for Dr. William Strampel, who oversaw the college where Nassar worked but has been on medical leave since December. Nassar, who also was a doctor for USA Gymnastics, was recently given two prison sentences in Michigan of 40 to 125 years and 40 to 175 years for molesting female athletes under the guise of medical treatment for nearly 20 years. Michigan State University (MSU) has been criticized for its handling of complaints about Nassar stretching back for years. According to the university memo posted on its website, Strampel did not sufficiently communicate with others or enforce 2014 guidelines put in place for Nassar when performing osteopathic manipulation in sensitive areas. One of those guidelines included having another person present, the Lansing State Journal reported. MSU terminated Nassar in September 2016 for his failure to follow those protocols, including having another person present when he performed the procedures. Numerous women have alleged they were assaulted even after the guidelines were put in place, the memo said. “William Strampel did not act with the level of professionalism we expect from individuals who hold senior leadership positions, particularly in a position that involves student and patient safety,” Engler said in a statement. One of Strampel's attorneys, Steven Stapleton, declined to comment on Friday. Engler also said MSU would not cover Strampel’s legal expenses in relation to the Nassar matter. The move against Strampel marked the latest casualty from the scandal at MSU, which has also led to the resignation of the former MSU president and athletic director. The entire board of USA Gymnastics also resigned. “I sincerely hope the courageous survivors of Larry Nassar will see this as an unmistakable indication that things are changing quickly at Michigan State,"" Engler said.

Ben Lovejoy,"Asian Apple suppliers are the latest casualty in the war of words between Apple and the Trump administration. Key suppliers saw their share price fall by as much as 10% after Apple warned about the impact of Trump’s latest trade tariff proposal and Trump hit back with a suggestion that the company should do its manufacturing in the US … Reuters reported a lengthy list of Asian Apple suppliers whose shares were hit. Shares in China-based Apple suppliers Luxshare Precision, Shenzhen Sunway and Suzhou Dongshan Precision Manufacturing all dropped as much as 10 percent. Lens Technology, Universal Scientific Industrial Shanghai and Suzhou Anjie Technology fell between 6 and 8 percent. In Taiwan, camera lens-maker Largan Precision slid nearly 8 percent, Foxconn fell 3.4 percent, while assembler Pegatron Corp dropped nearly 4 percent. Taiwan’s ASE Technology, which counts Apple as one of its top clients, fell 2.9 percent. Apple warned that the Apple Pencil, AirPods, Apple Watch and even the Mac mini could find themselves subject to a massive 25% tariff, which cost would likely be passed on to consumers. CEO Tim Cook has been one of many business execs to warn that Trump’s trade war will do most damage to the US economy. Cook has also repeatedly explained why it is not realistic for Apple to move its manufacturing base to the US. As we’ve outlined ourselves: It’s no accident that much of Apple’s manufacturing happens in and around Shenzhen […] The Special Economic Zone […] was established way back in 1980, meaning that the city has had 37 years to grow into the manufacturing center of the tech world. Apple relies on a huge network of suppliers and sub-contractors, some of which may make just a single tiny component. The majority of them are based in Shenzhen and its immediate surrounds, so the logistics of bringing everything together in one place for assembly are straightforward. The idea of Apple carrying out major assembly operations in the U.S. when the vast majority of its suppliers are all centred in and around one city on the other side of the Pacific simply isn’t credible. While the usual assumption is that Apple manufacturing takes place in China because of cheap labor, that’s a relatively small benefit, labor costs accounting for just 2.2% of the cost of a typical iPhone. Lead iPhone supplier Foxconn has increasingly been moving to fully automated production lines, and is even planning completely automated factories with just a handful of workers. Any manufacturing operation set up in the US would almost certainly use this approach and thus create very few jobs.

DeLappe describes the way he is using GTA V as “essentially a game as a data visualizer.” In the background, DeLappe has added “God Bless America” on loop. As for why he has decided to use a video game like GTA V for this project about gun violence, it seems to be based on the often said NRA and conservative media quote that “ Guns don’t kill people, video games do.” This isn’t the first time DeLappe has used videos games to create art. In 2003 he and some friends used text chat in Quake III Arena to act out an episode of Friends. In 2006 he started a project, dead-in-iraq, that used the popular shooter America’s Army. He used the text chat in the game to manually list every American casualty from the war.

MICHAEL KIMMELMAN,"Hildebrand even lent the Kirchner to a show in Lucerne, Switzerland, in 1953. There’s a photograph in the Bern exhibition of that show. Like “Gurlitt: Status Report,” it recounted the Nazi campaign against modernism. I looked around at the visitors in Bern studying the wall texts explaining the Nazis and art. The museumgoers in the photograph, wearing pillbox hats and baggy suits, were doing the same. What’s that metaphor about rowing? You can’t move forward without looking back? Photo At the Kunstmuseum Bern, Otto Dix’s “Schütze vom Infanterieregiment 103” was seized by the Nazis as “degenerate” art. Dix chronicled the brutality of war and the decadence of postwar German society. Credit Kunstmuseum Bern Did I mention that Kirchner studied with Hildebrand’s father at the Technical University in Dresden? The Gurlitts were distinguished writers, art historians and painters. Hildebrand’s grandfather, Louis Gurlitt, painted plein-air sketches in the 19th century, some very beautiful ones. Cornelia Gurlitt, Hildebrand’s sister, was an artist in the Expressionist orbit of the Blue Rider group, influenced by Chagall. Cornelia’s drawings in Bern and Bonn are touching and urbane. She turns out to be another casualty, committing suicide in 1919, pregnant with the child of a married lover, the art critic Paul Fechter. Inconsolable, Cornelia’s father blamed her death on, of all things, the influence of the Lithuanian Jews of Vilnius, where Cornelia had volunteered to work as a field nurse on the Eastern Front. As I said, a mess. Breathless news accounts when the Gurlitt collection was uncovered speculated about a $1 billion trove of art. The fact is, it’s not really a collection, not in the true sense of the word. It’s a dealer’s inventory, this and that, about as curated as the cosmetics counter of a department store. Buying for Hitler, Hildebrand had a blank check and no scruples, obtaining works by Delacroix and Fragonard, Seurat and Courbet, sometimes to fill gaps in German museums left by the elimination of modern art, skimming off what he wanted to keep or sell. Photo On view in “Gurlitt: Status Report,” at the Kunstmuseum Bern, Emil Nolde’s “Green Coastal Landscape With Steamer.” Credit Kunstmuseum Bern He acquired a Paul Signac river scene; watercolors by August Macke; horses in a landscape by Franz Marc; a Monet of Waterloo Bridge; a Millet, a Boucher, some beautiful prints and drawings by Kollwitz, Munch, Liebermann and Menzel. The Frick Collection, it’s not. Of the 1,500 Gurlitt works, hundreds are family heirlooms by Louis and Cornelia; hundreds are Expressionist pictures and trace back to German museums; hundreds more, mass-production prints, have no real value.

Credit Kunstmuseum Bern So we’re talking 100 or maybe 200 works whose provenance, or previous ownership, may be a legitimate matter of debate and inquiry — ones possibly looted or acquired at forced sales by Jewish owners. Authorities announced earlier this month that they had identified the former owner of a portrait of a young woman by the 19th century French academician, Thomas Couture. I spent a few minutes pondering it in the Bonn show (whose subject is mostly Hildebrand). The work belonged to Georges Mandel, France’s interior minister in 1940. His opposition to the Vichy regime got him arrested and killed. After the war, Mandel’s lifelong partner, the French actress Beatrice Bretty, filed a claim for the Couture, which had been confiscated, noting a stitched hole in the canvas. Researchers identified the telltale mark the other day. Photo A visitor looks at “Portrait of a Sitting Young Woman” by the French artist Thomas Couture, in “Gurlitt: Status Report,” a double exhibition of works from the Cornelius Gurlitt estate. The authorities have recently identified the former owner. Credit Sascha Steinbach/European Pressphoto Agency That made six works traced back to their owners since Gurlitt researchers began their investigations four years ago. There have been grumblings in Germany about the time and money spent, yielding meager results, a few eyebrows raised over the confiscation of Cornelius Gurlitt’s art in the first place. The official excuse was tax evasion. The Germans pulled an Al Capone. But perhaps what’s most annoying is how Gurlitt still eclipses the art. It is Cornelius’s suitcase, the one in which the police found a hidden Monet, that you first see in Bonn, displayed like an icon in the opening gallery. In Bern, it is his dilapidated file cabinet, where he kept drawings and prints. Cornelius is the void at the heart of “Gurlitt: Status Report,” a man who never registered his address, who didn’t watch television or see a movie after 1967, a self-appointed keeper of the family flame. The line between pathology and strategy can be fuzzy. Gurlitt lived for his art, he said, though it wasn’t really his. For someone who came of age with rock ’n’ roll, he was a castaway from an earlier time to judge by accounts of his stuffy Munich apartment, with its threadbare sofa, its antique cart for schnapps, its Wagner collection and shelves stocked with Thomas Mann, porcelain trinkets and art books. Photo Henri Matisse’s “A Woman Sitting in a Chair,” shown on the Lost Art website, was among some 1,400 works German authorities confiscated from the residence of Cornelius Gurlitt, son of Hildebrand Gurlitt, an art dealer who worked for the Nazis. Looted from the Rosenberg collection, it was returned to the heirs. Credit Lost Art Koordinierungsstelle Ma, via Getty Images Among these was a postwar catalog mentioning a looted Matisse of a seated woman from the Paul Rosenberg collection. (One of the six, since returned to the heirs.) Cornelius made a note in the catalog about the picture.

"Felix Salmon, Felix Salmon","Warren Buffett attends a book party for Tap Dancing to Work: Warren Buffett on Practically Everything, 1966–2012, by Carol Loomis, at the Lambs Club on Nov. 26, 2012, in New York City. Warren Buffett is a fantastic long-term investor. When it comes to his stock investments, he’s famous for saying, “Our favorite holding period is forever.” A huge proportion of Buffett’s fortune comes, directly or indirectly, from his insurance operations, especially property and casualty insurance, which can suffer multibillion-dollar losses in the event of major hurricanes, hailstorms, and the like. It’s a prime example of a business that cannot be judged by quarterly earnings. And so it comes as no surprise to read Buffett extolling “practices that encourage long-term thinking and investment” in the Wall Street Journal, and decrying people and companies that focus on quarterly earnings. Buffett’s op-ed, which he co-wrote with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, is exactly the sort of thing that is designed to get people to nod their heads and feel that they’re drinking deeply from the Sage of Omaha’s bottomless fount of wisdom. But the more carefully you read the piece, the harder it becomes to find any real substance to it. Meaning slowly vanishes away, like the Cheshire cat, until all that’s left is the vestige of his avuncular smile. Buffett and Dimon wrote the op-ed as the frontmen for Business Roundtable, “an association of nearly 200 chief executive officers from major U.S. companies,” whose slogan (I’m not making this up) is “More than leaders. Leadership.” As Matt Levine points out, the two billionaire CEOs must have been carefully chosen to byline this thing: Over the course of decades, both of them have proven themselves to be very good at creating long-term shareholder value. If either man were to set up a private company tomorrow dedicated to “an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is,” they could surely raise billions of dollars for it. If almost any of the other 198 CEOs tried the same stunt, they’d get laughed out of the room. Investors concentrate on the short term because they require a certain degree of accountability, and as such it’s inherently suspicious that Business Roundtable rolled out the two members who have managed to free themselves most successfully from those otherwise-inescapable accountability constraints. The not-so-subtle message from Buffett and Dimon is that investors should treat all CEOs like they treat Buffett and Dimon. Which is silly, because of course they shouldn’t. The message from Buffett and Dimon is that investors should treat all CEOs like they treat Buffett and Dimon. But of course they shouldn’t. The other weird thing about the op-ed is that the authors don’t seem to have a problem with quarterly earnings reports at all. “Transparency about financial and operating results is an essential aspect of U.S. public markets, and we support being open with shareholders about actual financial and operational metrics,” they write. Instead, the subject of their column is something much narrower: not earnings reports, but rather earnings estimates. (The subhead of the piece is actually “Public companies should reduce or eliminate the practice of estimating quarterly earnings.”) Why are earnings estimates bad while earnings reports are good? Weirdly, Buffett and Dimon fail to address this rather obvious question. “In our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability,” they write. But the reason why companies have an unhealthy focus on short-term profits is that they fear that their stock price will fall if they release a single bad quarterly earnings report. And the reason that they put out quarterly earnings estimates is precisely so that they can manage the market’s expectations, and thereby make it less likely that they’ll be punished on earnings day. In other words, earnings estimates are a consequence of the market’s short-termism, not its cause. And if you got rid of them, the market would be just as short-termist as it is now. This proposal, then, isn’t an attempt to get rid of short-termism; it’s an attempt to get rid of a mechanism by which less-trusted companies try to earn the trust of the markets. (Only about one-third of companies put out earnings estimates, and it’s not the successful and mature third.) Rich people don’t need to build their credit; poor people do. This is much the same. Don’t ask billionaires whether these mechanisms are needed, because these mechanisms aren’t designed for billionaires. Dimon and Buffett don’t necessarily have malign intent here: I don’t think they’re deliberately trying to remove a mechanism that smaller companies use to become trusted. But that’s the effect of their proposal. There’s also a decided whiff of hypocrisy here. If you want to know how Buffett really feels about the market punishing companies for reporting unexpected earnings, don’t look at carefully workshopped pablum from Business Roundtable. Instead, look at his latest shareholder letter. Buffett’s WSJ op-ed opposing earnings estimates is a broadside against attempts to dampen down stock-market volatility. The only possible conclusion from it is that he would like to see stock-market volatility go up around the time of earnings reports. That’s a perfectly legitimate position to hold; many people believe that individual stocks aren’t volatile enough, given how risky they are. And if you’re really holding for the long term, then short-term volatility, once a quarter, really shouldn’t bother you. And yet, when writing to shareholders, Buffett complains bitterly about new rules that will make Berkshire Hathaway’s earnings more volatile. “Televised commentary on earnings releases is often instantaneous with their receipt, and newspaper headlines almost always focus on the year-over-year change in GAAP net income,” he writes. “Consequently, media reports sometimes highlight figures that unnecessarily frighten or encourage many readers or viewers.” Why is this bad? Only because it causes the exact same volatility that Buffett ostensibly is perfectly happy with, if he’s arguing to do away with the estimates that are carefully calibrated to keep stock trajectories on a steady upward path. If scared short-term investors dump a stock within seconds of an earnings release, and that stock is picked up at a discount by long-term investors buying the dip, you’d think that Buffett would be happy. But earnings volatility, even if it’s fine for everybody else, is seemingly bad for Berkshire Hathaway. There’s nothing particularly great about earnings estimates. Most companies don’t do them, which is exactly how it should be. But let’s please have fewer lectures on the subject from those who don’t need them. Especially when even those people have legitimate worries about how the market will react to official quarterly reports.","Warren Buffett is a fantastic long-term investor.

DEBORAH PAREDEZ,"Dr. Guzmán’s research, the Edgewood class of 1967 and my father’s story serve as reminders not only of the vexed relationship that Latinos have to documentation within the United States but also of the very limits and biases of official methods of documentation. For even in their most valorous acts as citizens, Latinos remain largely undocumented or appear at most as a fleeting spectral presence in the stories often told about the war in Vietnam. In the epigraph of the final chapter in his iconic chronicle “Dispatches,” Michael Herr records graffiti scrawled across the walls of the Tan Son Nhut airport: “Mendoza was here. 12 Sept 68. Texas.” and “Color me gone. (Mendoza is my buddy.).” This is the only reference to a Spanish-surnamed soldier in Mr. Herr’s otherwise perceptive rendering of the war. In this way, it joins other American portraits of Vietnam that color Latinos gone. Work by Latino veterans, artists and scholars have sought to fill in the silences left by the official archive and by the limited sampling of Dr. Guzmán’s foundational research. Some of these works include memoirs by decorated servicemen, like Everett Alvarez Jr.’s “ Chained Eagle ” and Roy Benavidez’s “The Three Wars of Roy Benavidez”; Charley Trujillo’s “ Soldados: Chicanos in Viet Nam ”; John C. Trejo’s “Carnales: A History of Chicano Vietnam Veterans”; Z. E. Sanchez’s “ Tiger Mountain: Hispanics in the Vietnam War ”; Juan Ramirez’s “ A Patriot After All: The Story of a Chicano Vietnam Vet ”; George Mariscal’s “ Aztlán and Viet Nam: Chicano and Chicana Experiences of the War ”; Lea Ybarra’s “ Vietnam Veteranos Recall the War ”; Lorena Oropeza’s “ Raza Sí, Guerra No!: Chicano Protest and Patriotism During the Vietnam War Era ”; Mylène Moreno’s 2015 documentary film “ On Two Fronts: Latinos &amp; Vietnam ”; and two oral history projects, Tomás Summers Sandoval’s “Vietnam Veteranos: Latino Testimonies of the War,” based at Pomona College, and Maggie Rivas-Rodriguez’s “The Voces Oral History Project,” based at the University of Texas. The voices recorded in these works reveal how the story of Edgewood is not exceptional to but representative of Latino experiences during Vietnam. Across the country, barrios in places like Greenlee County, Ariz.; Corcoran, Calif.; and the Bronx produced significant numbers of servicemen and suffered high casualty rates, largely because of limited economic and educational opportunities that left young Latino men especially vulnerable to the draft (as they were often ineligible for college deferments) or led them to enlist as a means of escape from foreclosed possibilities in jobs or schooling. Yet, while Latino veterans share many commonalities, their experiences in the war are as diverse as the category of Latino itself. Some, like Mr. Alvarez, a Navy pilot whose plane was shot down in the Gulf of Tonkin incident and who spent eight and a half years as a prisoner of war, enlisted as a way to follow a family tradition of military service and patriotic duty. Others joined the service as a means of exerting control over their destiny in response to what they understood as the inevitability of the draft. A few, like the Chicano student activist Rosalío Muñoz, bravely staged public protests refusing induction; many more, like my father, received their draft notice and reported for duty. This broad range of Latino veteran experiences, coupled with Dr. Guzmán’s research, galvanized the robust Latino antiwar efforts that culminated in one of the largest antiwar demonstrations during the Vietnam era: the Chicano Moratorium on Aug. 29, 1970, in which nearly 30,000 Latinos marched through Los Angeles. Latino antiwar activists were as diverse as Latino veterans and included university students like Mr. Muñoz; draft board members like Julian Camacho, a Korean War veteran who resigned from the Santa Cruz County draft board to protest the class inequities of the induction system; and family members of servicemen, such as Mr. Alvarez’s sister, Delia Alvarez, who, as a modern-day Antigone, spoke out against the state in an effort to honor her brother. The history of Latino participation in Vietnam, then, not only deepens our understanding of American involvement in the war but also, according to Dr. Summers Sandoval, “acts as a prism for a larger social history of the Brown Baby Boom generation and offers lessons about the terms and costs of integration for Latinos in the United States.” Or as the Vietnam veteran Charley Trujillo observed, “They wanted us to come out here and work in the cotton fields and call us Mexicans but as soon as there’s a war, all of a sudden, we’re American.” A few months after the Edgewood Vietnam Memorial’s unveiling, I entered my senior year at a high school across town. By then I had already begun to consider myself an aspiring writer and a child of the war. These two facts were, for me, profoundly connected. My first poem, written when I was 12, was a poem about Vietnam. So many of my poems since then have also returned to Vietnam and its particular impact on Latinos. Like Tomás Summers Sandoval, whose father also served, I am part of a generation of writers and scholars who are now adult children of Vietnam — the descendants of veterans or refugees — who grew up with the war and who try in our own work to do as my father did: stare into that dark hollow in an effort to extract what’s painful or to heal what’s broken. We write our way toward our parents, we write a way back from the war. As the recent anthology “ Inheriting the War: Poetry and Prose by Descendants of Vietnam Veterans and Refugees,” edited by Laren McClung, suggests, we recognize our profound connection to one another precisely through our attempts at documentation. My father came back from Vietnam, and together we create space to move through the silences left by the historical record, by the lasting effects of war, and by those Edgewood neighbors who never returned.

"Jordan Weissmann, Jordan Weissmann","Donald Trump is now on the warpath against Harley-Davidson, thanks to the company’s announcement this week that it would move some manufacturing overseas in order to avoid becoming a casualty of the president’s intensifying trade war with Europe. The motorcycle maker says it plans to start building bikes for the European market abroad, due to the 31 percent tariff European Union officials imposed on American motorcycles this month, which were a response to Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum. Trump expressed his displeasure with Harley-Davidson’s decision via tweet Tuesday morning, and accused the company of using the tariff as a convenient excuse to offshore U.S. jobs. Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand. That was long before Tariffs were announced. Hence, they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse. Shows how unbalanced &amp; unfair trade is, but we will fix it..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2018....When I had Harley-Davidson officials over to the White House, I chided them about tariffs in other countries, like India, being too high. Companies are now coming back to America. Harley must know that they won’t be able to sell back into U.S. without paying a big tax! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2018 Much like he did with the Canadian shoe smugglers, Trump seems to be conflating several different stories here. Earlier this year, Harley-Davidson announced that it was shuttering its manufacturing site in Kansas City, Missouri, due to shrinking U.S. demand, and moving some of the jobs there to another facility in Pennsylvania. The company is also opening a plant in Thailand in order to produce more affordable motorcycles to sell in Asian countries, many of which place high tariffs on American-made hogs. (The company’s CEO said he resorted to constructing the new factory as a “plan B” after it became obvious the United States would not join the Trans-Pacific partnership, which would have lowered tariffs on motorcycles). It is not clear that either of these developments have anything to do with Harley’s decision to move its production of bikes for Europe. Nor has the company ever said it was sending any operations from Kansas City to Asia. After Harley announced it was closing shop in Missouri, union members did accuse the manufacturer of plotting to ship production from the U.S. to Thailand, but the company denied this, calling the issues “separate and unrelated.” Trump also seems to be under the impression that Harley-Davidson is planning to build bikes overseas in order to send them back to the U.S. at cheaper prices. That is wrong, too. Again, the company says it is moving production of bikes for Europe to countries where they won’t face tariffs. It’s also worth noting that Harley-Davidson did not say it was sending that manufacturing to Thailand; it also has factories in India and Brazil, for instance. Of course, it is possible that Harley-Davidson is lying, that the company has been planning to offshore more of its production all along, and that it’s just using the tariffs as a cover story. One worker told USA Today that 35 percent of the motorcycles assembled in Kansas City were destined for export, which suggests some of its production could be headed abroad (the company never confirmed that number). But it’s just as plausible, in this case, that the company is telling the truth when it says the tariffs drove them to this latest move. Foreign governments have decided to retaliate against Trump’s protectionist measures by targeting iconic American products made in politically sensitive states with tariffs. That puts a giant target Harley, which is based in the swing state of Wisconsin. If the company’s executives believe we’re heading into a long period of conflict over trade, it’s obviously in their best interest to ride the heck out of dodge.

Adam Smith,"Have You Played? is an endless stream of game retrospectives. One a day, every day, perhaps for all time. Romance! Drama! Surgery! Ambulance crashes! Heart’s Medicine – Time to Heal is a time management game by way of medical soap operas, like Gray’s Anatomy or Casualty, and I kind of love it. If you’ve ever played Diner Dash or one of its many imitators, you’ll recognise the drill here. You are Allison Heart, a junior doctor who starts a new job hoping to become a surgeon, but ends up working the wards, then the pharmacy and various other departments before achieving her goal. I’m pretty sure that’s precisely how medical careers work and I’d like to think that hospitals are the hotbeds of betrayal, slapstick, tragedy and romance that the game depicts. Sure, you’re going to spend a lot of time clicking on various pieces of medical equipment and playing tiny mini-games to tap bubbles out of syringes and sort pills, but in between all of that there are all sorts of steamy and sorrowful shenanigans to enjoy. It’s actually not as steamy as I thought it might be and the love story actually takes a backseat for a while because there are all kinds of hospital administration issues to deal with. That might sound dull but there’s nothing dull about missing assignments of medicine, especially when patients are already under anaesthetic and LIVES ARE ON THE LINE, DAMN IT. If you’ve ever had even the slightest of soft spots for time management games, I’d recommend Heart’s Medicine. It’s silly when it needs to be, successfully sincere when it wants to be, and as polished as a shiny new stethoscope. There’s a sequel too and it’s called Hospital Heat. That suggests the steaminess will be off the charts, but knowing what I do about the first game’s wicked sense of humour, it also suggests the hospital will set on fire at some point.","Have You Played? is an endless stream of game retrospectives.

Dominic Tarason,"They say truth is the first casualty of war, which makes This War Of Mine ‘s latest expansion – The Last Broadcast – equivalent to playing on hard mode. Not only do you have to cope with the usual dangers of keeping a band of civilians alive and safe through a brutal, messy war, but this expansion has players riding the razor’s edge – uncovering and reporting the truth through it all. It’s the second of 11 Bit’s three season pass scenarios, and introduces new systems, characters, locations and dilemmas to the uncompromising survival scenario. A trailer reportedly lies below. The Last Broadcast seems an especially interesting spin on the This War Of Mine formula. While the base game asked you to make some tough choices for your own group of survivors, you’ve got more than your own people relying on you this time. In order to keep people safe, you’ll have to report on (to give one example) where enemy snipers have been targeting civilian traffic. Or you can choose not to, if you don’t want to earn the ire of an increasingly brutal military. You’ll have to risk your own people to go out and gather more information, too – being the good guy is hard. Even though it’s all part of a season pass, it’s still good to see 11 Bit still expanding on This War Of Mine while still juggling new content for Frostpunk. Between those two games and the apocalyptic Anomaly series, they’ve really made a name for themselves as the ‘depressing and tough choices’ studio. It’s been a while since the previous season pass release, too. The Father’s Promise (the first of the three) launched exactly one year ago now. I wonder if the third and final expansion (not counting side-scenario The Little Ones) will be out this time in 2019? This War Of Mine is available on Steam, Humble and GOG, though 70% off right now on Steam, bringing it down to £4.50/4.70/$6. The season pass costs £5.19/6.99/$6.99, or you can pick up The Last Broadcast by itself for £2.99/3.99/$3.99.","They say truth is the first casualty of war, which makes This War Of Mine‘s latest expansion – The Last Broadcast – equivalent to playing on hard mode.

Jared Keller,"A Republic of Korea soldiers from the ROK army 137th Infantry, and U.S. Soldiers from 1-2 Stryker Brigade Combat Team, load a casualty into a black hawk as part of medical evacuation training at Rodriguez Live Fire Complex, South Korea, March 15, 2016. US Army In a potential war with North Korea, the US has a limited ability to evacuate wounded service members from a battlefield in Korea. While the US would maintain an outsize wound-to-kill ratio, North Korea's air defenses could spell trouble for the US' traditional medevac efforts. To solve the problem, the US could add more maneuverable aircraft, improve upon its ground-medevac capabilities — or simply not go to war. With tensions between the U.S. government and North Korea at a historic high, the Department of Defense spent 2017 deterring an armed confrontation with Kim Jong Un’s regime on the Korean peninsula. The Pentagon deployed three carrier strike groups to the Western Pacific for the first time in a decade; stood up THAAD missile defense batteries in South Korea; and deployed squadrons of F-22 and F-35 fighter jets to patrol the skies near Pyongyang. All the stakeholders know that, even with overwhelming U.S. might and decades of wargaming, an invasion involving the 28,500 U.S. troops currently stationed in South Korea could bring massive casualties for military personnel and civilians, including an estimated 20,000 South Korean deaths a day from North Korean artillery. But according to a series of war games conducted last year at the Air War College on Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, the DoD also faces a limited ability to evacuate wounded service members from a battlefield in Korea — an obstacle that could send the U.S. military death toll soaring in an open conflict. The upshot: United States forces in a conventional ground war with North Korea could suffer an outsize wound-to-kill ratio due to those airlift difficulties, political science professor and war scholar Tanisha M. Fazal argues in today’s Washington Post. While the United States has endured nearly 7,000 combat casualties in the course of the military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, those numbers have remained relatively low and stable over time due to the DoD’s overwhelming air superiority in the region (an advantage best captured by the massive rise in bombing sorties against militants in the first year of the Trump administration). Under those conditions, evacuation of casualties by air — the fastest method, and hence the key to making injuries more survivable — is a no-brainer. The distribution of North Korea’s air forces, according to a Nov. 7, 2017 Congressional Research Service report on military options for the U.S. Defense Department Unlike al Qaeda or ISIS jihadists, however, North Korea is ready for an air war: A November 2017 assessment by the Congressional Research Service of the country’s military capabilities conclude that while Pyongyang’s air defenses are relatively outmoded, the North Korean Air Force possesses “a dense, overlapping air defense system of SA-2, SA-3, and SA-5” surface-to-air missile sites and other mobile and man-portable anti-air munitions — and that’s not even counting the Kim regime’s fleet of 1,300 Soviet-era aircraft intent on knocking U.S. assets out of the sky. Add it all together, and those air defenses spell trouble for an opposing force’s traditional medevac efforts. “Modern combat medicine has made great advances in stemming blood loss, for example, but those procedures are typically temporary measures, carried out to keep a patient alive until airlifted to a higher-level, trauma-care facility,” Fazal writes. “That was possible in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the United States had undisputed control of the skies. But it would not be true on the Korean Peninsula, at least at first.” Indeed, a 2012 assessment in Military Medicine found that late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein’s air defense command unit was effective enough during the initial months of the 2003 invasion that the U.S. military scrambled to develop forward-deployed medical and surgical teams to stabilize casualties near an injury point. It’s difficult to assess the DoD’s overall air evacuation capabilities in the event of war with North Korea, given the different system and structure of each branch’s various medical commands. (Air University and the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Task &amp; Purpose). But as part of the the Air War College simulation, the prospect of an aerial medevac for American troops was reduced to near zero through a conventional strike against a U.S. air base in South Korea; that, Fazal observed, forced a radical shift in how medics treat patients. via Scout Warrior “Certain casualties could be saved if air evacuation was possible — but would have little to no hope without evacuation, and thus would receive only palliative care,” Fazal wrote of the simulation. “A base commander would probably require medics to prioritize care for personnel essential to the mission, even if they had less severe injuries than others. Assuming that medicine and medical personnel would not be resupplied, medics would not be able to provide the standard of care to which the U.S. military has become accustomed.” Even without a direct strike on a U.S. staging area, air evacuations would remain a challenge. “Lift in the Pacific is always a problem and has been for years, simply because it’s just so big,” Lindsey Ford, a Asia Society fellow and former advisor to the Pentagon’s assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs, told Task &amp; Purpose. “To have the amount of lift you need to cover the tremendous amount of space, there is always a challenge, whether you’re talking about everyday operations or a unique medevac. Just think about that in the context of how many forces we currently have in the region.” Ford pointed to the 2006 evacuation of U.S. citizens from Lebanon, in which the Pentagon aided the Department of State in extracting 15,000 people over the span of two months in the largest overseas evacuation in U.S. history. While U.S. Central Command was responsible for extracting 90% of the U.S. evacuees to nearby Turkey and Cyprus, a 2007 Government Accountability Office review of the effort found that Israeli strikes on the Beirut airport and subsequent blockades of coastal ports seriously complicated air and sea evacuation efforts. The evacuations were primarily executed by U.S. and British naval flotillas, supplemented by contracted commercial or civilian ships; Marine CH-53 Super Stallion helicopters were used only for the most serious medical cases, primarily because Israeli munitions had “crippled airports, seaports and roads in retaliation for attacks by Hezbollah militants,” the New York Times reported at the time. A CH-53E Super Stallion, used by the Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 463, carries off an A-4 Jet during a sling load operation aboard Barber's Point Naval Air Station, Marine Corps Base Hawaii Thomson Reuters “That was just 15,000 [American civilians] evacuated,” Ford said of the Lebanon evacuation. “There are some 100,000 in Seoul, where, once war starts, there will be between 30,000 and 300,000 dead in just a few days.” There are two options available to the Pentagon to address this problem. The first simply involves improving medevac capabilities by adding more maneuverable aircraft. The Army is addressing this issue with the Future Vertical Lift project, designed to replace the iconic AH-64 Apache attack chopper and UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopter with an aircraft that combines speed and range with versatility and maneuverability. But since 2016, the Army’s Medical Research and Materiel Command has also been exploring the potential deployment of unmanned vehicles to conduct quick and relatively safe medevacs. Last March, Dragonfly Pictures unveiled the DP-14 Hawk as a potential one-man extraction craft; despite resistance to the deployment of robots downrange, a 2014 USAMRMC report stated that unmanned systems “can potentially conduct extraction and/or retrieval of combat casualties on behalf of the first responder and deliver the wounded Soldier (within a short distance) to a safer location.” But even the best aircraft can get held up in the skies or be too far from an extraction site, leaving the standard operating procedure for forward surgical teams as the next best option: Stabilize the patient and wait for the cavalry. The Pentagon has a long-established ground-medevac doctrine utilizing chains of medical outposts that connect a forward operating base to a secure medical facility in the rear. The Army’s Combat Casualty Care Research Program (CCCRP) is working overtime on new tech to accelerate diagnosis and treatment downrange, but the branch admits that “prolonged field care” is the primary capability gap of concern across the entire branch, according to the January/February issue of Army AT&amp;L Magazine. US Army “Experts say future battlefields will require medical efforts to be more assertive at the point of injury as opposed to standard forward aid locations,” Army AT&amp;L notes, “a shift that also radically changes the concept of the ‘golden hour’ standard of care, which relies on traditional medical transport to get service members treated within the first hour after injury.” Given the nature of defense planning, that shift in downrange medical treatment won’t come overnight, but it’s long overdue. Declassified documents from 1994 published by the Guardian last month showed that, while the Pentagon remained convinced it would eke out a victory in war with North Korea, a ground invasion would leave some 490,000 South Koreans and 52,000 U.S. troops wounded or killed in the first three months alone. After 15 years of air superiority in the Middle East and Southwest Asia, it appears the best strategy to avoid a breathtaking casualty rate in a conventional war with North Korea is the exact same as with a nuclear conflict with Pyongyang: The only winning move is not to play.","US Army In a potential war with North Korea, the US has a limited ability to evacuate wounded service members from a battlefield in Korea.

Tanya Lewis,"Editor’s Note (1/19/18): This is an updated version of an article published December 14, 2017. The last year has been a political whirlwind, to put it mildly. Donald Trump’s presidency has triggered tectonic shifts in numerous areas of government, and science and health care have been no exceptions. Just after the election Scientific American predicted Trump’s tenure would have widespread effects on environmental policy, climate and energy, health care, space, technology and education. A year into Trump’s presidency, many of these forecasts have panned out—along with some things no one saw coming. The Trump administration has taken what many see as a largely apathetic—and at times actively hostile—approach to science. The position of White House science adviser (director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, or OSTP) has been empty longer than under any other modern president, and many other science-related agency positions remain unfilled. These posts play a crucial role in advising the chief executive and senior White House staff as well as in informing policies, legislation and budgets. Meanwhile Trump has moved to install pro-industry leaders on science advisory boards to delay or roll back environmental and technological regulations as well as undercut access to health care. Not all of the news has been bad for science, however. In some areas Trump and his team have largely stayed the course, and research agency budgets have yet to be determined. But many feel the president’s overall actions to date do not bode well for U.S. scientific leadership, both at home and abroad. Here are some of the specific ways Trump and his administration have had an impact on science and science-related issues during their first year in office. Environment and Energy It is no secret that Trump does not take the threat of human-caused climate change seriously. Over the past year he has sought to reverse much of former Pres. Barack Obama’s environmental achievements. Trump hit the ground running with his nomination in December 2016 of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a fierce opponent of Obama’s climate policies and of regulation in general, to run the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The new president followed by installing former Texas Gov. Rick Perry as secretary of the Department of Energy (which Perry had once vowed to shut down). He also named Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke (R)—who would later help to preside over the largest land reduction of national monuments in U.S. history—as Interior Department secretary. Trump has taken an overtly friendly attitude toward the oil and gas industries: In January 2017 he signed orders to move ahead with construction of the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, in the face of strong opposition from Native Americans and climate activists. But perhaps Trump’s most controversial environmental decision to date was withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, the pledge made in 2015 by more than 190 countries to limit average global temperature increases to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The terms of the pact (which every country except the U.S. has now embraced) mean the actual withdrawal does not take effect until November 2020, however. And in the meantime many U.S. states and cities have pledged to help meet the climate accord targets, with some now organized under umbrella groups such as C40 and We Are Still In. Trump and Zinke have also pushed to open more federal lands to drilling and mining. In December Congress passed a massive tax bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which opened Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration. Earlier this month the administration announced a massive expansion of offshore drilling. The president has also proposed deep environmental budget cuts and moved to deregulate pollution monitoring —including repealing Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which regulates carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Just this week, most of the National Park System Advisory Board resigned in protest of the administration’s policies on climate change and the environment. Meanwhile thousands of government Web pages related to climate change have been taken down or buried, a recent report found. Nevertheless, the Trump administration’s efforts did not prevent government scientists last year from publishing their National Climate Assessment, a report many researchers feared would be muzzled. Pruitt, for his part, has not reversed the EPA’s endangerment finding, which forms the basis for much of the agency’s policy on regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Health Perhaps no part of Obama’s legacy has irked—and motivated—Trump (and his fellow Republicans) more than the Affordable Care Act (ACA), aka Obamacare. As soon as he entered office the president picked an outspoken ACA critic, Tom Price, as his Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary. (Price later resigned over criticism of his use of taxpayer-funded charter flights.) After Trump’s inauguration Republicans in Congress immediately took up the challenge of repealing and replacing the ACA. But despite repeated efforts, they were unable to get enough legislative votes. A repeal would have deprived millions of Americans —especially those with lower incomes—of health insurance as well as undermine women’s access to health and reproductive care. Still determined to make the ACA fail, Trump announced in October he would stop paying federal subsidies that reduce the amount low-income people pay out-of-pocket for health care. The recent tax bill removed the ACA’s health insurance mandate. This could result in more uninsured people, and thus higher medical premiums. The tax bill is also predicted to increase the federal deficit by an estimated $1.5 trillion over the next decade—a situation that would trigger automatic cuts to Medicare. Meanwhile the nation has been facing an opioid addiction and overdose crisis of epic proportions, and the administration has been slow to respond. A presidential panel issued an urgent recommendation in late summer that the White House declare the problem a national emergency—something the president had promised to do. He ultimately declared it a public health emergency, a designation that provides no additional funding on its own. Earlier this month the White House halted a program that evaluates “evidence-based” treatments for substance abuse and behavioral health problems. This comes on the heals of news reports the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out a list of seven terms (including “science-based” and “evidence-based”) that it says should not be used in CDC budget requests. Trump has also made lackluster progress on lowering drug prices, a task he had promised during his campaign to take on. His new nominee for HHS secretary, Alex Azar (who is awaiting Senate confirmation), is a former pharmaceutical executive who has been widely criticized for raising such prices. Technology The biggest impact Trump has had on the tech world is via his appointment of Ajit Pai as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. As predicted, Pai pushed to reverse the 2015 Open Internet Order—an Obama-era regulation that ensures internet service providers cannot deliberately slow or block content from specific sources—the basis for net neutrality. The FCC voted in December to overturn the rule, a move which has been widely denounced by proponents of a free and open internet. In terms of global technological threats North Korea has been flexing its growing nuclear muscle—and Trump’s itchy Twitter finger has fueled the international tension. Pyongyang announced last August it possessed a miniaturized warhead, and threatened to fire it at the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam. In November North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that flew higher than any of its previous launches to date—and which the North claimed could reach anywhere in the continental U.S. Last week a warning of an incoming missile—which later proved to be a false alarm —was text-messaged to residents of Hawaii, terrifying the island state and underscoring the country’s nuclear jitters. The U.S. Supreme Court—after it was joined by Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch—in November heard what some say could be its most important electronic privacy case to date. It hinges on whether the Fourth Amendment right to privacy extends to cell phone data, which the FBI in this case obtained with merely a court order instead of the usual warrant. The data was used to show a suspect had been near several crime scenes. The court will announce its decision by the end of its current term in June. Space and Physics The Trump administration has not veered far from existing space exploration policy. Perhaps the biggest news in this arena was the decision to refocus NASA’s human exploration efforts on returning to the moon (which three former presidents have pledged and failed to achieve) as a stepping-stone to an eventual journey to Mars, turning away from the Obama administration’s plan to capture and visit an asteroid. Trump also revived the National Space Council, a group that coordinates space policy among government agencies, and appointed Scott Pace to lead its day-to-day operations. NASA itself still has no administrator, however. Last September Trump finally nominated Oklahoma Rep. James Bridenstine (R), a strong proponent of lunar exploration and commercial spaceflight. The full Senate has yet to confirm his appointment. Trump’s 2018 budget request proposed deep cuts to several research agencies including the Energy Department’s Office of Science, which funds the largest percentage of physical sciences research in the U.S. If Congress approves these cuts, they would eliminate much of the DoE’s climate research and also effectively withdraw the U.S. from the ITER international fusion experiment, Science reported last May. Education and Research In a presidency that has often seemed to be an attack on scientific expertise and facts themselves, public and higher education have come under threat. Few of Trump’s presidential appointments were as widely opposed as that of Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, an ardent supporter of voucher programs that give money to private religious schools at the expense of public ones. An early form of the GOP tax bill would have greatly increased the tax burden on graduate students by removing tuition income waivers, which could have made graduate school prohibitively expensive for many who are not independently wealthy. The final version of the tax bill did not remove the tuition waivers, however. And then there is Trump’s travel ban, the most recent version of which bars entry to the U.S. for travelers from eight countries—six of them majority-Muslim. The ban could make it harder for scientists from the affected nations to attend U.S. conferences or perform research. In addition, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program—which protects some 800,000 people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children from being deported, is now in jeopardy.

Arturo Casadevall,"Last week, Duke University announced it would pay the US government US$112.5 million to settle claims that fraudulent data were used in dozens of research-grant applications. This is a communal punishment for an institution where the overwhelming majority of scientists are honest, hard-working individuals seeking knowledge for the good of humanity. 
The lesson is that scientific misconduct can carry severe institutional costs. (And scientific ones: more than a dozen papers connected to this case have been retracted.) Duke, in Durham, North Carolina, has promised to improve its practices and administration, including setting up an advisory panel on research integrity and excellence. 
These steps are laudable. But I worry that the seeds of misconduct, although they grow in only a very few individuals, are planted in the very heart of academic biomedical sciences. 
The Duke experience is unlikely to be replicated exactly elsewhere. Channelling Leo Tolstoy, every instance of research misconduct is unhappy in its own way. Still, one thing is common: researchers careers depend more on publishing results with impact than on publishing results that are correct. Pursuit of academic success generally means targeting particular journals, citations accrued and, occasionally, media attention. 
Although impactful science is often important, impact does not always track importance. Applied science tailored to local, practical problems such as mango wastage in India is unlikely to net an elite journal paper. Gregor Mendels pioneering genetic studies were ignored for decades. Conversely, some studies that had a big impact at first were later shown to be fraudulent, or just wrong. 
The problem is that impact has become a means to an end. Ethics training and severe punishments dont change incentives to cherry-pick results or worse. Misconduct will be difficult to eradicate without cultural changes to shift rewards and increase safeguards.
When did the culture of impact begin? I trained in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when biomedicine was transitioning from a firm grounding in biochemistry to dominance by molecular biology and genetics. The new experimental approaches quickly got attention: finding a mutation associated with a disease would make headlines in stories that often promised cures. The careful enzymatic dissection of a metabolic pathway was important, but did less to capture the imagination. 
Those years also saw major fraud scandals involving cancer, biochemical and cardiology research, all widely covered in the media, and following what is now a too-common plot: each individual wanted impact by whatever means available. Looking back, I remember the profusion of brightly coloured journal covers that made a stir in my graduate-student days, signalling a dangerous transition to flashy science. That journals began to look better did nothing for the reliability of the science within. 
Although most scientists continued to do careful and rigorous research, the zeitgeist changed as science moved towards and into the new century. Dizzying discoveries were predicted as new technologies and genetically modified organisms produced some dazzling therapies (such as recombinant insulin for diabetes and monoclonal antibodies to treat diseases such as cancer and arthritis). In our hubris, we assumed that definitive insights into how organisms work would be captured by the reductionism of mechanistic approaches such as breaking cellular functions down to individual genes. Meanwhile, the number of journals mushroomed; an infusion of government money meant that trained scientists outnumbered academic positions; and the use of metrics for evaluations boomed.
Next came another flurry of widely publicized misconduct cases, an epidemic of retracted articles and high-profile concerns about reproducibility. The biomedical sciences of the twenty-first century had a credibility crisis.
We should not be too gloomy: innovative responses to make publications more reliable are gaining traction. These include checklists, routine image checking and broader access to methods and data. But that has not dislodged the pathological focus on impact. 
We must change the culture of biomedical science to one that rewards greater rigour. Judging rigour is a lot harder than judging impact, so review and promotion committees must take a different approach in evaluations. 
Microbiologist Ferric Fang and I have proposed one method, based on the five pillars of logic, experimental redundancy, error recognition, intellectual honesty and quantitative analysis using probability and statistics (A. Casadevall and F. C. Fang mBio7, e01902-16, 2016). Used in combination, these should produce more robust and resilient scientific results.
Practically everyone in the system now, including me, is part of the impact culture, so changing it will be hard. Generating high-impact work is easier than doing important rigorous research, especially if it can be exaggerated, wrong or fraudulent. And low-impact but highly rigorous research should never be devalued, because it might be important in the future. After all, the mundane business of isolating organisms from hot springs and dissecting bacterial defences against viruses catalysed two revolutionary innovations: the use of PCR technology to copy DNA, and the CRISPRCas system to edit genes. 
A culture of greater rigour alone will not eliminate misconduct. However, rigorous science is more difficult to falsify because the five pillars are self-supporting: mischief in one arena can be checked and exposed by others. All research institutions, not just Duke, must build on these.","US$112.5-million settlement concerning fraudulent data is a casualty of a culture that prizes impact over robustness, says Arturo Casadevall.",2019-04-02T00:00:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Nature.com'}",Duke University’s huge misconduct fine is a reminder to reward rigour,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01032-w?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nature%2Frss%2Fcurrent+%28Nature+-+Issue%29,https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-019-01032-w/d41586-019-01032-w_16588310.jpg,,Nature.com,casualty,1
Tristan Greene,"Nvidia continues to pave a path towards the end of reality as we know it. The company recently made an AI capable of creating images of people out of thin air. Now, it’s made one that can change the weather, turn day into night, and change a leopard’s spots. AI researchers for the company developed an unsupervised learning method for computers which allows for sweeping changes to video content it’s fed. By using the new method, they were able to produce startling results. Previous methods required massive amounts of data by comparison. And the issue was made more difficult when trying to train the machines to find their own patterns, the basis of unsupervised learning. They considered the problem similar to teaching a machine to colorizing a photo, according to the researchers’ white paper : For example, super-resolution can be considered as a problem of mapping a low-resolution image to a corresponding high-resolution image; colorization can be considered as a problem of mapping a gray-scale image to a corresponding color image. Today the machines are mapping sunny days to rainy ones and creating the equivalent of a “snow plow” filter for videos. It’s a little unnerving to imagine what these things will be capable of in a decade. Computers around the world are being trained in the art of deception. Nvidia’s recent work in the field of artificial intelligence shows the leaps and bounds by which AI has attained a clear ability to imitate reality to a startling degree.

Jake Rossen,"Science has a lot to say about bogus hangover cures (coffee, hair of the dog, and saunas aren't doing you any favors), but not as much about which treatments are legitimate. That's not for a lack of trying: The quest to banish the headaches, nausea, and dizziness that follow a bout of heavy drinking has been going on for centuries. We still don't know how to prevent hangovers or how exactly they happen, but if you're feeling miserable after last night, there are a handful of science-based remedies that might ease your pain.
1. Asian Pear Juice
Have some extra Asian pears at home? Run them through your juicer before your next night out. According to researchers at Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, just 7.4 ounces of Asian pear juice is enough to soften the blow of a hangover. The scientists say that the juice interacts with enzymes that break down alcohol, speeding up your metabolism and leaving less surplus alcohol for your body to absorb. There's just one catch: The juice must be consumed before you drink anything else in order to be effective. Apologies to anyone currently reading this through heavy-duty sunglasses.
2. Music
Anyone who's ever suffered through a massive hangover knows that sound is the enemy. But while your roommate's 9 a.m. tap dancing practice might exacerbate your symptoms, music may have the opposite effect. Research has shown that listening to music can provide relief to migraines, which are similar to hangover headaches. As long as the music is pleasant and suits your taste, it should help to drown out the chorus of pain playing in your mind. Head sensitivity isn't the only symptom music helps with: According to researchers at the University of Edinburgh, listening to your favorite music also eases pain. There hasn't been research specifically on hangovers, but at the very least it should hide your pained cries.
3. Sprite
If you're looking for something to nurse your hangover, skip the Bloody Mary. A team of Chinese researchers found that Xue bi, the Chinese version of Sprite, is actually the best beverage to combat the lingering side-effects of alcohol. Of the 57 drinks tested, Sprite was the best at helping enzymes break down acetaldehyde, the metabolized version of ethanol that's blamed for some of the nastiest hangover symptoms. The scientists also identified which concoctions you should avoid: A drink containing herbs and hemp seeds was the worst offender, as it actually prolongs acetaldehyde metabolism instead of speeding it up. (We should also caution that this test was done in a lab and might not be applicable to actual drinking scenarios.)
4. Pedialyte
Although not the primary cause of your hangover, one of the many ways alcohol can leave you feeling worse for wear the morning after is dehydration. Alcohol is a diureticit makes you pee a lot more than you would otherwise. If your fluids are depleted when you go to bed, you can expect to wake up feeling groggy, achy, and all-around not your best. Water is the simplest fix for dehydration, but for more extreme cases, there's Pedialyte. The drink was originally developed to rehydrate kids sick from vomiting and diarrhea, but it's marketed as a hangover treatment for adults as well. It contains nutrients, sodium, and other electrolytesall things that can nurture your body when it's dehydrated. It won't cure the hangover, but it might help alleviate the worst of it.
5. Anti-inflammatory drugs
If your first move when you're hungover is to reach for a bottle of aspirin, you have the right idea. Anti-inflammatory drugs may not do much to stop the underlying causes of your condition, but they can suppress your symptoms long enough for you to get out of bed without feeling like your head's been replaced with an anvil. On top of easing headaches and muscle pain, there's another reason these pills are good for hangovers: They may directly combat alcohol's inflammatory effects. But there's one over-the-counter painkiller you should never take while or after consuming alcohol, and that's Tylenol. Any drug that uses acetaminophen will only further abuse your recovering liver.
6. Eggs
The best way to tackle a hangover with food is to eat while you drink. Chowing down after the damage has already been done may distract you from your turmoil for a short while, but it won't soothe your physical symptoms. There are a few exceptions: Eggs, for example, have hangover-fighting potential thanks to a special ingredient. The food is packed with cysteine, an amino acid that breaks down the drinking byproduct acetaldehyde. So whether you prefer to enjoy brunch out or at home, make sure your meal includes eggs in some form.
7. Honey on toast
While you're at it, put some honey on toast next to your omelet. According to Britain's Royal Society of Chemistry, while it won't cure a hangover, the breakfast can help alleviate the symptoms: ""The best breakfast is toast and honey (or golden syrup) which provides the body with the sodium, potassium, and fructose which it now needs."" The BBC talked to a junior doctor about this hangover remedy and he recommended adding banana. While he cautions it's an acquired taste, the doctor explained, ""Bananas are a high source of potassiuman electrolyte that gets depleted when you go out on the binge. The honey will give you that spike of sugar in your bloodstream and that energy rush to help you get back on your feet.""
Bonus: Drink less
While this is definitely the least helpful of all suggestions, in 2005 an article in the BMJ looked at 15 studies of hangover cures, noting that ""the paucity of randomized controlled trials is in stark contrast to the plethora of hangover cures' marketed on the internet."" Their conclusion? ""No compelling evidence exists to suggest that any conventional or complementary intervention is effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover. The most effective way to avoid the symptoms of alcohol induced hangover is to practice abstinence or moderation.""",Things are officially out of control.,2019-01-09T18:30:00Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Mentalfloss.com'}",Craft Beer is the Latest Casualty of the Government Shutdown,http://mentalfloss.com/article/570231/craft-beer-latest-government-shutdown-casualty,https://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/mf_image_16x9/public/570231-justinsullivan-gettyimages-467650213.jpg?itok=oivi8M0j,,Mentalfloss.com,casualty,1

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image caption Nappy price rises are forcing some parents to change their plans for families Babies' nappies have become the latest casualty of Iran's faltering economy, with huge price rises and shortages across the country. Fears over their availability have whipped up a storm of angry messages on social media blaming the authorities. The issue made national headlines days ago, when Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and his cabinet went to meet the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In the course of their conversation, Ayatollah Khamenei mentioned the shortage of nappies, blaming it on ""the enemy"" who ""wants people to make angry with the government"". He had, maybe unintentionally, touched a nerve and, soon after, nappies started trending on Iranian social media, with everyone pitching into the debate. Hardliners blamed government mismanagement, the government blamed US sanctions and businesses profiteering and those in favour of regime change blamed the Islamic Republic. Life-changing impact Since March, the Iranian currency has lost almost two-thirds of its value against the US dollar, hitting record lows amid concerns about the adverse effects of the Trump administration pulling out of the nuclear deal and re-imposing sanctions on Iran. This has resulted in a big rise in the price of imported goods. While a large chunk of the nappies sold in Iran are made domestically, manufacturers rely on imported raw material. This has resulted in the price of nappies soaring in the past few months. In one case, for example, the price of a pack of Iranian-made nappies rose from 380,000 rials ($9; £7) in late April to 850,000 rials in late August - a 137% increase in just four months. Image copyright EPA Image caption Iran's currency has plummeted These rises are not just putting pressure on family finances. In some cases they are beginning to impact on peoples lives and plans. Ali lives in the north-eastern city of Mashhad with his wife and their one-year old child. He told BBC Persian they had been planning to have a second child. But due to the soaring cost of nappies and other recent price rises they have given up on the idea. ""Raising just one child will be an achievement in itself,"" he says. Period poverty Apart from nappies, the prices of adult incontinence pads and sanitary towels have also increased, and they are also in short supply. Moslem's elderly father suffers from both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and he relies on incontinence pads. ""They were 200,000 rials a pack back in March,"" Moslem told the BBC. ""Now they are over 500,000 rials, if I manage to find any at all."" He says he may be forced to use cloths instead, ""like we used to the old days"". Sanitary towels are also getting more difficult to find. Image copyright EPA Image caption Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei (L) has blamed nappy shortages on ""the enemy"" ""They're not like expensive cars that you can live without,"" says Sama, from Tehran. ""Every woman, rich or poor, needs them every month."" And just as they did with the nappies, some Iranians on social media say they have recently bought pads in bulk, fearing price rises and shortages. Nappy hoarders While the price increases are largely due to the devaluation of currency, the shortages are also being caused by customs delays and businesses hoarding supplies. On Sunday local authorities in Savojbolagh, 80km (50 miles) west of Tehran, said they had raided a warehouse and discovered a million packs of nappies. They were imported several months ago when the price of the dollar was a third what it is now, the authorities said, and were kept with the intention of selling them at a much higher price, But there is also another reason why supplies of both imported nappies and the raw materials needed to manufacture them are not reaching end customers. When exchange rates started to rise, the government said it would allocate subsidised foreign currency to importers to keep prices down. But that decision had an unintended consequence. Image copyright Reuters Image caption The US says it wants to cut Iran's oil exports to zero Instead of using the currency to import goods, some businesses simply sold it on the black market to make a quick profit. In response, the Iranian central bank reversed the policy, and announced that businesses would now have to pay back the difference between the subsidised and actual exchange rates before they were allowed to import the goods. This has led to nappies and raw materials being stuck at customs, exacerbating the shortages. A trade body representing manufacturers said recently that 10 nappy factories had stopped production for lack of raw materials. Worse to come? A second wave of US sanctions affecting Iran's oil exports and the central bank is due to take effect on 4 November. The Trump administration says it wants to cut Iran's oil exports to zero - which would deprive the Iranian government of its biggest source of hard currency. If that happens, the Iranian currency may continue to fall, and the nappy crisis could be just the beginning.",The soaring cost of nappies is the latest consequence of renewed US sanctions.,2018-09-06T21:47:57Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",What babies' nappies tell us about Iran's economic woes,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-45411251,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1541F/production/_103317078_mediaitem103317077.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,casualty,1
JACK BOGER,"Suddenly the idyllic California afternoon was shattered by frantic radio chatter. “Break, break, this is not a cherrypicker,” the transmissions began. “Real world casualties. …” Initial reports suggested that an amphibious-assault vehicle carrying 14 Marines and a sailor from Charlie Company had spontaneously combusted. A pillar of smoke snaked into the sky. I climbed onto the hood of a Humvee and trained my scope on it. Flames consumed the black-and-green hull, a frightening testament to the power of fire, destroyer of worlds. I paced around our position, anxiously asking the radio operators for updates. Eventually it came out that there had been some guys from First Platoon in the vehicle, which had run over an exposed gas line, gotten stuck and then sparked the fumes with an engine backfire. My heart sank. I desperately asked who had been inside, for a casualty list. Looking at the fire made it hard to believe that anyone had made it out alive. Miraculously, though, everyone survived, albeit with varying degrees of burns. The platoon sergeant, mounted in the troop commander’s hatch up top, suffered the most severe wounds. He had been blown clear out of the vehicle from the force of the explosion. When the first responders ran in to drag him away from the blaze, his skin sloughed off, like a cicada molting. Sam Koontz, one of the team leaders who had been inside, was a Marine I knew well from our previous deployment. He was a Kiowa-Apache kid from Eastern Washington who looked like he was about 16 years old. I will never forget his cherubic face on the day I assumed command of my platoon. I had imagined that I would be leading a platoon of John Rambos who ate gunpowder for breakfast. Instead I was in charge of a ragtag bunch of boys who looked like my friends’ little brothers. But despite their tender appearances, most of them were more than capable enough to do the job of a Marine rifleman. Seeing Sam, who stood 5-feet-7 and never weighed more than 155 pounds, shoulder heavy loads and push on without complaint inspired me when my own strength flagged. Now I struggled to maintain focus knowing he was hurt. A few days later we finally finished our training exercise and began preparations to return to base. Our battalion executive officer drove a blacked-out S.U.V. to the range to bring me home early so that I could see Sam. I climbed into the passenger seat and stared at the executive officer’s sleeve. Something translucent and whitish was smeared all over the fabric, like crusted snot. “It’s burned skin,” he told me. He had been one of the first responders on the scene and helped pull Marines out of the blaze. He described lance corporals on fire, climbing out the top and rear hatches of the vehicle, camouflage uniforms and hair smoking up into the California sky. We arrived back at Camp Horno, and I went to visit Sam. He had been released from the hospital and was waiting for me outside the barracks. His face shined, like he had just gotten a chemical peel. Bandages mummified his hands. His lips snarled in a mustard-colored swirl, badly chapped and thick with petroleum jelly. We talked for a little while, mostly dancing around the subject of the fire and what had happened. I think we were each trying to put on a brave face for the other. I touched his shoulder and told him I would see him again soon. Afterward I sat in my car for a long time before turning my weapon in to the armory and driving home to San Clemente. I saw Sam again when I got back from my last deployment in April. He was working in the gym, waiting for his medical retirement papers to come through. Although his skin had healed, his lungs had been badly burned by smoke inhalation. He told me that anytime he tried to run, he would start coughing, and pieces of black and bloody lung tissue would come out. Two weeks after I got home from that last deployment I was talking to my mom on the phone, walking down Market Street in downtown San Francisco. It was a golden California day. I told her that I was thinking a lot about my friends who had gotten hurt and some of the guilt and confusion I felt because I had somehow escaped unscathed. I realized I had never told her about what had happened in Camp Pendleton last fall. Halfway through the story, I started sobbing and leaned against a tree planted in the sidewalk. A homeless guy stared at me, confused. “I’m not sure what’s wrong,” I told my mom, searching for air. “I think I’m just really grateful to be alive.”",A former Marine officer wrestles with his ambivalence for never having seen combat while serving.,2018-08-02T09:00:12Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",At War: Coming to Terms With Being a Marine Who Never Went to War,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/magazine/marine-combat.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/30/magazine/2MARINE_2/merlin_141024120_308d1604-1bd5-4a16-b0ea-f463e6bd2c51-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,casualty,1
Dominic Tarason,"Like the Ferengi, corporations can justify nearly anything in the name of potential profit. Today’s fan-casualty is Stage 9, a virtual recreation of Star Trek’s Enterprise-D to walk around – less a game, more a virtual Star Trek museum piece. After two years of work, it was issued a cease-and-desist by TV network CBS earlier this month, and lead developer Scragnog formally announced its demise yesterday, in a video below and on Twitter. We all know that making fan-games runs these risks, but Stage 9’s fate feels inconsistent with how Trek fan-works are normally handled. It’s no secret that Star Trek fans love building stuff, specially the Enterprise or parts of it. Sometimes, these fans even create films, so many of which are in circulation that CBS and Paramount even struck a truce of sorts. So long as fan-film makers remain within the neutral zone of their community guidelines (keep thing short, non-profit and non-professional), no projects get torpedoed and nobody’s lives get disrupted. Unfortunately, no such guidelines exist for digital works such as games. Perhaps it’s time there were. Here’s a comprehensive trip through Stage 9’s Enterprise-D courtesy of YouTuber “bcbotkillerpresents”, created after word of the cease-and-desist began circulating. It’s genuinely impressive stuff, and while the dead-eyed NPC crew milling around do seem a little sinister they help complete the bustling image of the Next Generation’s Enterprise that most us are familiar with. Stage 9 also boasted full VR support, and its detailed texture art meant you could lean in to ogle every detail on every control panel and read every last detail, even if most of it was just static images. Things like this have happened before, and will happen again, but they don’t need to. Sega have been famously chill with Sonic The Hedgehog fan-works, even hiring fan-game authors to produce Sonic Mania.

behley@politico.com (Brianna Ehley),"Among other administration priorities, the government shutdown is hampering efforts by agencies such as EPA and the Interior department to unwind Obama-era energy regulations. | Brennan Linsley, File/AP Photo
The government shutdown is threatening important pieces of President Donald Trumps agenda, escalating the political stakes as he and Congress vie to see who blinks first.
At EPA and the Interior Department, furloughs have frozen efforts to roll back Obama-era regulations and open new water to oil and gas drilling. The White House has sent home key staff coordinating its response to the opioid crisis. And if the partial shutdown drags on long enough, it could force Trump to cancel a late-January trip to Davos, Switzerland, and delay congressional action on the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal.
Story Continued Below
Trump shows no signs of backing off, telling reporters that the shutdown triggered by his demands that Congress fund a border wall has a higher purpose than next weeks pay. But the potential blowback to his own policy priorities shows that the closure is likely to inflict cascading harm as it continues, beyond its initial impact on parks, museums and federal workers paychecks.
The prospect of a long shutdown is already worrying people in some industries, who fear it could burn valuable time for agencies trying to unwind the Obama administrations regulations. A lengthy enough delay could even push the inevitable legal fights into the next presidency.
There is no question that an extended shutdown will harm the administrations regulatory reform agenda,"" Dan Byers, vice president for policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerces Global Energy Institute, said in a statement. ""They faced a challenging clock to begin with, so a delay of even just a few weeks could significantly impact their ability to advance rulemakings in a timely manner.""
To some Trump critics, those delays are the shutdowns bright silver lining.
""Since most of the regulatory activity that EPA is doing is of the deregulatory nature, to me, thats great for the health and the environment,"" said Mike Mikulka, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Chapter 704, which represents EPA employees in the Midwest.He is also a spokesperson for a union-backed campaign called Save the EPA.
Some of the administrations efforts are still moving ahead, of course: Trade talks with China are proceeding as scheduled this week, and the Interior Department said its continuing to process permit applications for oil and gas drilling. The White House also took one of the most politically sensitive issues off the table Monday when acting budget director Russell Vought said the IRS can still issue tax refunds defusing the threat of a public backlash that would have stepped on the GOP's victory in enacting a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul.
But new casualties keep cropping up. On Monday, for instance, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao canceled an appearance this week in Las Vegas where she had been expected to announce a rule allowing drones to fly over people.
These are the Trump-supported initiatives that are already feeling the shutdowns bite:
1. Stalled rule rollbacks
The shutdown is hampering one of Trumps proudest achievements, the effort by agencies such as EPA and Interior to unwind regulations and champion U.S. energy dominance. That includes a push by EPA to ease the Obama administrations limits on toxic pollution from power plants and greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks tailpipes, as well as sweeping protections for wetlands and waterways.
EPA has been especially aggressive in unwinding Obama-era rules, but much of its work is in the proposal stage and the employees in charge of holding hearings, reading comments and revising the text are on furlough.The agency used its final leftover funds on Dec. 28 to release one last major air pollution proposal an easing of limits on mercury and other toxic chemicals from power plants then promptly shut down. But it cant begin taking public comment on the proposal until the rule is published in the Federal Register, and the work of formatting, copy editing and tweaking will be a challenge without career staff on the job.
EPA has also been taking comments on a proposal to delay the effective date of Obama-era rules on wood-burning heaters, a major issue in rural states like Alaska and Maine. But now it has no staff to take meetings or answer industries questions on the issue.
""The shutdown doesnt necessarily slow this piece of the administrations work, but it doesnt improve the quality of the policymaking,"" said Miles Keogh, executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, which represents state-level regulators.
Similarly, Interior has long been expected to issue an offshore drilling plan this month that many expect will make wide stretches of Atlantic and Pacific waters available for oil and gas rigs. But the shutdown will delay that release, three people knowledgeable about the rulemaking process told POLITICO. 
My contacts at DOI are not going into the office for much, one person in the oil and gas industry said.
The Justice Department has also furloughed many of the lawyers who would represent the administration in court. They include lawyers fighting off legal challenges to Trumps approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a project that environmental groups have spent the past decade opposing.
We have a shoestring staff here (3) filing motions in our 100s of cases and we are trying not to let anything fall through the cracks, wrote Doris Coles-Huff, deputy chief of the Civil Division of the U.S. attorneys office in Washington, D.C., in a Friday email obtained by POLITICO.
Environmentalists cannot bring themselves to cheer the delays, saying the shutdown is also blocking routine environmental and conservation work. EPA has canceled hearings on Superfund sites and stopped cleanups and inspections, while accidents, trash pileups and other damage are occurring at national parks that Interior has allowed to remain open without supervision.
""Trump is endangering the public with his dangerous shutdown,"" Sierra Club Legislative Director Melinda Pierce said in a statement. 
2. Opioid strategy
Furloughs are slowing momentum on projects at the White Houses Office of National Drug Control Policy, including the anti-drug campaign that Trump has touted as one of his main strategies to tackle the opioid addiction crisis.
Addressing the drug epidemic that's killing 115 Americans a day has been a top priority for the president, but Democrats have criticized him for a lack of action. The Senate last week confirmed his first appointed drug czar, Jim Carroll but the work of Carrolls office is likely toremain on hold until the government reopens and its employees return.
If the government remains shuttered until the end of the month, funding for critical grant programs involving law enforcement and prevention activities could also be in jeopardy, some people involved in the effort worry. The drug policy office is expected to announce awards of money at the end of January for prevention programs and efforts to help law enforcement catch traffickers.
3. Trade paralysis
The Commerce Department has stopped processing companies requests to be excluded from Trumps aluminum and steel tariffs. It also has eliminated staffing for ongoing investigations into whether to impose trade penalties on foreign companies found to be selling their products in the United States at unfairly low or subsidized prices.
In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission will remain shuttered for the length of the shutdown. That could jeopardize its March 15 deadline for submitting a report on the economic impact of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement possibly delaying Congress action on the trade pact, because many lawmakers will look to the report to inform their positions on the deal.
The shutdown is also delaying the release of key Commerce Department economic data reports, such as one due Tuesday on the monthly trade deficit. And it could prompt Trump to cancel his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos from Jan. 22-25, which was supposed to include his economic team as well as his daughter Ivanka Trump and and son-in-law Jared Kushner.
The shutdown has also complicated the Agriculture Departments efforts to assist farmers and ranchers burned by Trumps retaliatory tariffs. Agricultural producers who havent yet certified their 2018 production must wait until local Farm Service Agency offices reopen before moving ahead with their applications for trade aid. 
Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue was considering extending the Jan. 15 deadline to apply for the program, Undersecretary Bill Northey said last week.
4. Stock offerings slowed
Trumps Treasury Department raised concerns in 2017 about the declining number of companies making initial public offerings, which often serve as a springboard for growth and jobs. Promoting these deals is a major priority for SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, a lawyer and Trump nominee best known for working on Chinese giant Alibabas IPO.
But now the SEC is shuttered, and companies preparing to go public cannot get the necessary registration statements approved by the agency.
At least a half-dozen companies had been expected to launch public offerings in January, according to Renaissance Capital, a Greenwich, Conn.-based firm that provides research to institutional investors. The impasse could also affect Lyft and other firms looking to go public in the first half of the year, lawyers working on the deals said.

Mark Kaufman,"The Trump administration is serious about sending robots and spacecraft back to the moon — although no NASA astronaut will set foot on the chalky lunar surface until after President Trump leaves office. The White House released its Fiscal Year 2019 NASA budget proposal on Monday, and it confirmed the administration's plans to prioritize space exploration while stepping away from supporting the International Space Station, which houses astronauts and science experiments in low-Earth orbit. ""It reflects the administration's confidence that America will lead the way back to the moon,"" said NASA's acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot, while detailing the budget proposal Monday afternoon from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama. SEE ALSO: The world banded together to heal the ozone layer, and now NASA says it's working In total, the Trump administration requested $19.6 billion from Congress for 2019. This is $500 million more than what was budgeted in 2018, but $61 million less than what Congress provided in 2017, under the Obama administration. The 2019 budget proposal is dominated by space exploration, with over $10 billion allocated to deep space endeavors, including a specific emphasis to ""pursue a campaign that would establish U.S. preeminence to, around, and on the Moon."" These lunar investments include building a ""power and propulsion space tug"" (whose cost and details remain unclear), a fleet of robotic moon rovers and landers, and a new technology program to engineer cheaper ways to get to the moon, and beyond. NASA's forthcoming mega-rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), also looms large in the budget. This is the rocket NASA will use to launch the Orion spacecraft, which is currently in development, to the moon and Mars. This hugely expensive program — which unlike SpaceX rockets, has no reusable parts — would receive $3.7 billion, close to 20 percent of NASA's entire budget. An artist's rendering of NASA's Space Launch System rocket taking flight. Image: NASA But even if all goes as planned with NASA's re-commitment to its lunar ambitions (NASA quit funding trips to the moon in 1972), NASA astronauts won't circle around the moon in the Orion spacecraft until 2023. So even if Trump is elected to a second term in 2020, astronauts won't actually visit the lunar surface until a new president has taken office. A casualty of NASA's redirection of funds toward lunar exploration, however, is its direct support of the International Space Station, which the Trump administration wants to cut funding to in 2024. Acting director Lightfoot said the budget includes $150 million to begin ""ramping up"" efforts to encourage commercial partners — like SpaceX and Orbital ATK — to take over U.S. space and science operations occurring in low-Earth orbit. Lightfoot noted this could mean a continued support of the Space Station or developing ""stand-alone platforms"" — presumably a new orbiting station developed and maintained by a private company. The SpaceX Dragon spacecraft connecting to the International Space Station in 2013. Image: nasa The budget proposal also includes more immediate eliminations of entire programs, some of which Congress refused to get rid of last year. “We did have to make some tough decisions in science,"" Lightfoot said. He specifically cited a cut in funding for the $3 billion WFIRST space telescope, which would have, according to NASA, helped ""settle essential questions in the areas of dark energy, exoplanets, and infrared astrophysics."" Also eliminated would be five Earth-science satellites set to study or continue studying the Earth's oceans, carbon emissions, and other areas. This would cut $133 million from the budget. One of these Earth-observing satellites, known as DISCOVR, is already in orbit, and the budget cuts funding for one of its sensors. Another proposed cut that Congress has previously rejected concerns NASA's Office of Education. At $100 million dollars this office would make up half of a percent of the budget, but the Trump administration proposes it be completely eliminated. This department offers grants to colleges, provides direct education in grammar school settings, and is generally designed to get kids interested in space and engineering sciences. Making a notable appearance in the budget, however, is a technology that won't leave Earth's atmosphere: Supersonic aircraft. NASA hopes to fund an ""X-Plane"" that can travel faster than the speed of sound while not rumbling the cities and towns below with sonic booms. If funded, this high-speed prototype would take flight in 2021, and according to the White House, would cut cross-country flight times in half.",The Trump administration is serious about sending robots and spacecraft back to the moon — although no NASA astronaut will set foot on the chalky lunar surface until after President Trump leaves office.

Sean Gallagher,"Enlarge / U-35 under construction at Kiel in 2013. The sub—like all the others in Germany's fleet—is currently in for repairs. reader comments 5 Germany has a submarine problem. During a test dive in October, the Deutsche Marine's U-35 struck something (probably a rock) with one of its four ""X-rudders,"" the steering planes on its rear fins. The damage required the submarine to be towed back to a shipyard in Kiel for repairs—where it joined three other German navy submarines currently drydocked. The U-35 was the Deutsche Marine's only working submarine prior to the collision. The remainder of the German submarine fleet is in port at the German naval base in Eckernförde—waiting for dry docks in Kiel to open up. Germany has a total of six submarines, all of the Type 212 class. These ""hybrid"" subs—also operated by the Italian navy—are powered by a combination of a diesel engine and nine proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. They are among the quietest, most advanced non-nuclear submarines in the world. Because their fuel cells are "" air independent propulsion "" (AIP), these subs can operate submerged for weeks without surfacing. And since the PEM cell ""engines"" have no moving parts other than the electrically powered screws, they're incredibly stealthy when submerged. They can also operate in waters as shallow as 17 meters deep (55 feet), making them ideal for patrolling the waters of the Baltic. But because of backlogs in repairs and a series of unfortunate events, only two of the Type 212 class are not currently under repairs—and they are not ready for active service: U-31, the class leader—launched in 2002—has just come out of major maintenance and has a year's worth of trials ahead of it before being returned to service. It has been out of service since 2014. U-32 had a battery casualty on a trip to Norway. U-33 is in the Kiel shipyard for maintenance until February of 2018 and will likely not be back in service until May or June. U-34 is due to start a yard period in Kiel in January, and it's not certain when it will return to service. U-36, the latest submarine built for the Deutsche Marine, was completed a year ago, but it is still in acceptance trials and is not expected to be fully active until May of 2018. The reason for the backlog: a spare-parts shortage that was exacerbated by cuts made to the Deutsche Marine's budget. To save money, the service stopped stockpiling spares for the complex systems of its subs, relying instead on either purchasing parts on demand or cannibalizing subs that were out of service—much like the US Navy has had to do as a result of budget sequestration over the past four years. As a result, Germany's entire submarine service is left essentially sitting on its hands through at least the first half of 2018.","Spare parts shortage, collision damage have sidelined entire sub fleet.",2017-12-19T20:25:33Z,"{'id': 'ars-technica', 'name': 'Ars Technica'}",Das boot ist kaputt: German navy has zero working subs,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/das-boot-ist-kaputt-german-navy-has-zero-working-subs/,https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kiel_HWDW_U35-760x380.jpg,ars-technica,Ars Technica,casualty,1
SHARON HOLBROOK,"We found the perfect street just across town — quieter than our old street, around the corner from parks, and a pleasant half-mile walk to the elementary school. The house, though, was simply too big. No family of five needs a six-bedroom house, especially a 92-year-old one with a leaky roof and a beehive in the porch floor. But we fell in love. It had the arched doorways and crown moldings and leaded glass of our dreams. It also had dated wallpaper and a 1980s kitchen and never-remodeled 1920s bathrooms. Modern it was not. But it was charming and surprisingly cozy in its tired, grand way and, after years on the market, the price finally fell into our range. I once read about a family of five that decided to keep only five dishes, five mugs, five bowls, and so on. In the name of simplicity and tidiness, they’d wash each dish immediately after using it and place it back on the shelf. Just think, though: No one could come over. Despite my infatuation with minimalism, mine is not that minimalist house. This is a house for gathering, and particularly so at Christmas. From the outside, electric candles in every window say “welcome” — and inside, our ancient wiring and a maze of extension cords and power strips probably say “fire hazard.” The big living room window begs for the fattest tree possible, and we oblige. The spacious dining room risks feeling lonely without extra chairs (and guests) pulled up to the table. I still crave simplicity and the contentment that apparently comes with decluttering. But there are some belongings I cling to: the tools of hospitality. I finally had to admit that some chaos — especially the chaos of bringing far-flung family members together — is worth it. And so we have rafts of sheets, towels, comforters, pillows and air mattresses, along with dozens of mismatched plates and bowls and glasses. At Christmas, we use them all. There’s an easy comfort to being under one roof with the people I love, especially at the holidays. I like my family putting their noses in the refrigerator and their boots in a giant pile by the door. I like the kids running together through the house, and the lazy all-day time with my siblings. Of course, having so many people in one house is not exactly compatible with Instagram-perfect holiday scenes. Just as with homes, not every family can be simple, small and tidy, and mine is no exception. In the family room, where we set up a long kids’ table, I try to avert my eyes from the inevitable spills and stains where a dozen unsupervised children leave their mark. I’m still finding pink spots from a particularly exuberant nail-polishing session among a crowd of cousins … a year ago. Once, water began pouring from the living room ceiling, a casualty of a sink left on upstairs by a kid who didn’t know its quirks. And there was the year my brother came down with a stomach bug, and we had to quarantine him in the only isolated space available: the concrete-floored basement. It’s messy. But so are we. We don’t all agree on religion or politics — some of my family members have unfriended others on Facebook after particularly heated exchanges. As in all families, spouses and children bicker. People get sick, sometimes seriously. And, of course, time ticks on, and we are all getting older. Somehow — and sometimes I’m not sure how — we manage to put all this aside at Christmas. Politics and religion are off the table. The children, maybe because there are so many of them, mostly find ways to play without retreading sibling rivalries. I thought this house would bring me order, a chance to escape everyday chaos. But a big house is an open place. Especially one like ours, built almost 100 years ago. Not all the windows shut tightly, and there are more (drafty) doors than strictly necessary. The winter wind — and mice — sneak in through invisible fissures. “Bring your sweaters and slippers,” I warn my visiting family. We are still chilly, but we do the jigsaw puzzles, we play the games, we eat, we open the gifts, we laugh. As it turns out, this drafty old house is more open and welcoming than it is perfect. But home, and family, were never about perfection. And so, for as long as we have the chance, we’ll tumble messily into this space, and savor the holidays. Together.

Associated Press,"(KABUL, Afghanistan) — A group of gunmen stormed a non-governmental children’s organization in eastern Nangarhar province, killing one person, said provincial officials. Attahullah Khogyani, spokesman for the provincial governor, said the Wednesday attack was against Save the Children’s provincial office in Jalalabad. Inamullah Miakhial, spokesman for Nangarhar regional hospital, said one person was killed and at least 14 wounded were brought to the hospital. The casualty count might rise as a gun battle was still underway, he said. The attack started with a suicide bomber and was followed by gunfire, said Khogyani. Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said the Taliban was not involved in the attack; both Taliban insurgents as well as Islamic State group fighters are active in eastern Nangarhar province. The attack follows a deadly weekend siege of the Intercontinental Hotel in the capital Kabul in which 22 people were killed, including 14 foreigners. Multiple U.S. citizens were killed and injured in the Taliban’s 13-hour siege of the hotel, the State Department said Tuesday. No exact figures were immediately available for either the U.S. fatalities or injuries. Eleven of the 14 foreigners had been previously identified as working for the private Afghan airline KamAir. During a ceremony at Kabul’s airport Wednesday the bodies of seven Ukrainian citizens were handed over to officials for transfer to Ukraine. Mirwais Samadi, head of the consulate department of the Afghanistan Foreign Ministry, said the attack was launched by “terrorists” and their supporters. “Some of our countrymen were martyred and some foreign nationals also were killed,” he said. “We express our condolences and thoughts to the victims and families. ” In eastern Ghazni province, meanwhile, four Afghan police were killed after their checkpoint came under an attack by insurgents, said Arif Noori, spokesman for the provincial governor.

Will Martin,"A deepening political crisis in the eurozone's third largest economy, Italy, is wreaking havoc in global markets Tuesday as assets across the board take a pounding on fears of renewed turmoil in the single currency area. Italian government bonds — known as BTPs — are the most obvious casualty of the political uncertainty, selling off sharply as investors look to move their money away from the troubled nation and into safer assets. The benchmark 10-year BTP has seen its yield increase 16% to 3.118% on Tuesday. That's a high not seen since 2014. Remember bond yields move inversely to prices, so yields increase during sell-offs as investors are offered more return for the extra risk they are taking on. Yields on Italy's 2-year debt rose by almost 50 basis points overnight — the biggest one-day move since 2012, at the height of the Eurozone crisis. They have continued to rise, and by 8.00 a.m. ET are at 2.274%, the highest level since 2013. Outside Italy, US treasuries — the world's deepest and most liquid bond market — have seen yields drop sharply as investors look to put their money somewhere a little safer. The benchmark US 10-year yield is down to around 2.87%. Safe haven European bonds are also seeing yields tumble, with the 10-year German Bund down 14% to 0.29%. Bond markets are not the only place where there is big negative action, with stocks also taking a pounding on Tuesday. Major European bourses are all down more than 1%, while Italy's FTSE MIB is almost 3% lower. Of particular note is the European banking sector, where lenders are getting hammered. The Euro Stoxx banking index has fallen 4.6%, with numerous individual banks major losses. Here's the scoreboard: Markets do tend to be highly sensitive to euro-exit related developments, so some of Tuesday's moves may be a knee jerk reaction, but it certainly feels like a crisis is now brewing both politically and economically. Analysts at Australian investment bank Macquarie, however, urged calm for the time being. ""While we see near term market pressure, we do not think that events today are sufficient to derail the economic recovery (activity has been desensitised to political shocks in the past decade), suggesting that markets will soon present a buying opportunity,"" a team led by Ric Deverell wrote. However, Deverell and co. were clear that things could escalate. ""A victory for the populist parties in a new election, while far from assured, could trigger a substantial risk-off event,"" they wrote.","Global markets shaken by deepening political crisis in Italy.

The Conversation,"Facebook is closing its doors to researchers in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The latest casualty is the app Netvizz, a research tool used by hundreds of academics to gather public Facebook data, that the social network has recently banned. The app has gathered more than 300 academic citations and has been used to produce studies on everything from Norwegian political party videos, to public opinion about the London 2012 Olympic Games, to Asian American student conferences. But now this fruitful source of data has been shut down. Blockchain and cryptocurrency news minus the bullshit. Visit Hard Fork. More significantly, Facebook’s action sounds a death knell for civic access to public Facebook data. Inevitably, all apps like Netvizz will be wiped from the platform. The Cambridge Analytica scandal, which saw Facebook user data gathered supposedly for academic purposes but instead used by a private firm for political campaigning, created an opportunity for positive change. But Facebook sadly appears to be making its platform more opaque, unknown and unaccountable to the public. Once apps like Netvizz are gone, there will be no accessible way of gathering large amounts of public page Facebook data. Facebook offers only highly restrictive search options for normal users. It has started new initiatives to offer access to its data for scholarly research, but these are dependent on a “hand-picked” group of scholars who “define the research agenda”. Without broader access for other researchers, the social, academic and political consequences are dark. Netvizz offers users the ability to extract basic data from public Facebook pages, such as the content and frequency of posts, likes, shares and comments. This can be used to analyze what users are discussing, how they feel about certain things, or how they respond to certain content. And this can feed into studies on a huge range of important topics, such as how fake news spreads or how social media can affect young people’s mental health. Netvizz is an internal app within Facebook that uses the social network’s Graph API (application programming interface), a piece of software that provides access to data. Netvizz then organizes this data into a spreadsheet format that can be easily read by anyone. Importantly, it doesn’t gather personal data on users. But Facebook’s API is becoming a closed system, meaning that this basic public data is becoming impossible to access, threatening our knowledge of the world. Without access to user data in this way, it will be a lot harder to spot patterns in what users are doing and saying on Facebook. In response, Netvizz’s creator, Bernhard Rieder of the University of Amsterdam, said : “academic research is set to be funneled into new institutional forms that offer (Facebook) more control than API-based data access.” He added: “independent research of a 2+ billion user platform just got a lot harder.” This isn’t just a headache for thousands of academics worldwide. Given the growing influence Facebook has over political debate and behavioural trends, it means that the public could be denied important information that is vital to protecting democracy, social relationships and even public health. For example, my own research into British political parties’ campaigns on Facebook is set to become much more difficult. Without apps like Netvizz offering a gateway to extract public political content, messages sent to voters during elections will be too discrete to investigate. In this way, society’s capacity to question what political parties are doing is being curtailed by Facebook, undermining democratic accountability and our power to understand politics on social media. User data can reveal things about political parties. (Image credit: https://www.facebook.com/labourparty/) The questionable use of Facebook data by academic researchers and political campaigners in the Cambridge Analytica scandal highlights the need for new privacy and security measures. But Facebook has already successfully altered API access over the last few years, preventing further personal data from being gathered in the manner of Cambridge Analytica, while allowing research with public data to continue. Facebook had struck the perfect balance between privacy and access. But the company now appears to be building a wall around its data, not to just to protect users but also to protect itself. And in doing so, Facebook is also protecting the powerful, curtailing our ability to scrutinize and question the influence of politicians, corporations and others with the money to spend on large advertising campaigns. By prioritizing privacy over transparency, Facebook is setting up a potential ban on this knowledge. A legal framework is needed to guarantee Facebook users and researchers at least some access to API data for public pages, especially for those of national interest such as political parties, media organizations and government bodies. Facebook must go further than its current restrictive plans and open its data to help promote research and democratic accountability. Several petitions have been started, including one I have launched, to encourage Facebook to do this. But a bigger “#openfacebook” campaign is needed that could work in conjunction with similar campaigns to make targeted advertising more transparent. It’s still possible for Facebook to rethink its data policy in a way that respects individual privacy and limits the potential for data misuse, but also promotes transparency, accountability and independent research. If Facebook does not alter course, it will catastrophically undermine our ability not only to understand the social network machine and its millions of pages, but also the entire political and social order that the internet has created.

This weekend, FX announced that its sister network FXX wouldn’t be moving forward with an animated “Deadpool” series Glover had been working on. On Wednesday, Glover addressed the matter via Twitter. Glover was working on the series about the foulmouthed Marvel antihero with his younger brother Stephen. The two also work together on FX’s “Atlanta.” “Due to creative differences, FX, Donald Glover, Stephen Glover and Marvel Television have agreed to part ways on Marvel’s Deadpool animated series,” FX said Saturday in a statement. It was reported that no scripts may have been delivered for the show. At least one report speculated that “‘Deadpool’ may have been a casualty of Donald Glover’s packed schedule.” Glover himself weighed in on Wednesday, tweeting a mock script ― evidently written sometime in the past two days, since it mentions the Beyonce Bite ― where Deadpool addresses the issue in typically self-referential, fourth-wall-demolishing fashion.

Reuters Editorial,"SAADA, Yemen (Reuters) - Thousands of mourners gathered on Monday to bury dozens of children killed in a Saudi-led coalition air strike on a bus in northern Yemen. At least 40 children were killed in Thursday’s raid which hit the bus as it drove through a market of Dahyan, a town in Saada, the armed Houthi group which controls the province said. Cars bearing the logo of the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement transported the bodies, wrapped in white shrouds, from the hospital to a large square for prayers before heading to the graveyard, where rows of graves were dug on Friday. People carried pictures of those killed as armed Houthi fighters managed the crowd attending the funeral. “My son went to the market to run house errands and then the enemy air strike happened and he was hit by shrapnel and died,” said Fares al-Razhi, mourning his 14-year-old son. “For my son, I will take revenge on Salman and Mohammed Bin Zayed,” he said, referring to leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The Gulf Arab states are leading the alliance of Sunni Muslim countries that intervened in Yemen’s war in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government that was expelled from the capital Sanaa by the Houthis in 2014. The coalition said on Friday it would investigate the strike after U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the attack and called for an independent probe. But on Saturday, the Saudi state news agency SPA said Saudi Arabia’s mission to the world body had delivered a message to Guterres reiterating that the military action was “legitimate” and had targeted Houthi leaders responsible for “recruiting and training young children”. TALKS PLANNED The coalition initially said after the attack that the strike had targeted missile launchers that were used by the Houthis to attack the southern Saudi province of Jizan. The Houthis’ health minister Taha Mutawakil said last week that the estimated number of casualties stood at 51 killed including 40 children, and at least 79 people wounded, of which 56 were children. The International Committee of the Red Cross reported the same toll on Friday, citing authorities in Saada. The head of the Houthis’ supreme revolutionary committee, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, attended the funeral and blamed the United States “for this crime and all the crimes that have been committed against Yemen”, the Houthi-held al-Masirah TV said. The United States and other Western powers provide arms and intelligence to the alliance, and human rights groups have criticized them over coalition air strikes that have killed hundreds of civilians at hospitals, schools and markets. A U.S. military spokeswoman said U.S. forces were not involved in Thursday’s air strike. The U.S. State Department urged the Saudi-led coalition to “conduct a thorough and transparent investigation”. The coalition says it does not intentionally target civilians and has set up a committee to probe alleged mass casualty air strikes, which has mostly cleared it of any blame. The Houthis have also been criticized by rights groups. The U.N. special envoy to Yemen has been shuffling between the warring parties ahead of holding consultations in Geneva on Sept. 6 in an effort to end the conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people and pushed the impoverished Arab country to the verge of starvation, according to the United Nations.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption WATCH THE DOCUMENTARY: What are we going to do about Tyler? The scandal of a US teenager locked up for almost four years without trial revealed serious failings in Mississippi's criminal justice system. But Sarah Smith, the reporter on the BBC News-ProPublica investigation, says America's mental health crisis goes much deeper. When I arrived, the sheriff was wary of me. I was a visitor to his rural Mississippi county; worse, I was a reporter from New York City. He summed up his scepticism this way: Every time Mississippi made national news, it seemed like the reporters managed to find the one toothless person in the vicinity and shove him or her in front of the camera. The sheriff had a point. And I had a challenge to conquer. The story I was onto was not going to flatter Mississippi. But I did promise him I would not go searching for the toothless. Read ProPublica's in-depth investigation I had come to write about the mentally ill in Mississippi, in particular those who wound up in jail, accused of often serious crimes but denied - for months and even years - the basic legal requirement that they receive a mental evaluation. Such evaluations - whether the defendants were sane at the time of the alleged crime and now competent to stand trial for those crimes - would profoundly shape the rest of their lives. Image copyright Calhoun County jail Image caption Tyler Haire, 16, after his arrest Tyler Haire was one of those I wanted to write about. He was 16 when he was arrested for stabbing his father's girlfriend. She survived, but Tyler, with a mental health case file thick with diagnoses, went to jail. He waited nearly four years for the evaluation a judge ordered be done as soon as possible. Neither the sheriff in Calhoun County nor Tyler's family knew I was coming. But they let me into their homes, their jail, their lives. Then they let me come back, again and again. They and others in Mississippi - families, sheriffs, mental health professional, politicians - wanted their stories of deep frustration told. It was, they felt, a Mississippi embarrassment that would be helped by greater, even national attention. Mental health care a national problem, says sheriff Image copyright ProPublica/Mike Belleme Image caption Calhoun County Sheriff Greg Pollan: ""This is a national problem"" I soon learned that it wasn't only the accused who sat waiting in jail. The state's mental health resources were so scarce that families saw troubled loved ones who needed hospitalisation wind up behind bars simply for want of an available bed in a treatment facility. One sheriff had a military veteran in his jail a few years back. The veteran hadn't committed any crime. He was in jail waiting for a bed at a state hospital or a crisis centre. The Veteran's Administration hospital let him walk out. His family had had him involuntarily committed. The man hanged himself in the jail cell. It was the first time the jail staff had ever lost someone like that. The mentally ill have lost lots in the last decade in Mississippi. Hospital beds. State employees devoted to care. Local crisis centres. Options of all kinds as state budgets have shrunk - first by the national financial crisis, then in a sustained series of state scale-backs. Image copyright ProPublica/Mike Belleme Image caption Mississippi State Hospital at Whitfield has only 15 mental health beds for defendants awaiting trial The daughter-in-law of the woman Tyler stabbed had lost a brother to suicide. She had walked up to his house and saw him hanging there. He had a history of mental illness and self-harm. She had tried to get him help, trying to get him committed and begging local police officers to go check on him. She had a voicemail of him threatening suicide. He was 33 when he went ahead and did it. So, today, she mourns him, and helps care for her mother-in-law, a casualty of a struggling system of care and justice. It didn't shock me, then, when Bridgett, the camera-shy mother of Tyler, told me she too had been hospitalised for her own mental health problems. Image copyright ProPublica/Mike Belleme Image caption Bridgett Haire, Tyler's mother, also suffered mental health problems ""It's too late for me and Tyler,"" she said to me more than once. I couldn't honestly tell her otherwise. But maybe it's not too late for others. Mississippi, the Calhoun County sheriff knows, is not alone in its problems. States across the country are failing the mentally ill, including those in their jails and prisons. It's a shared shame. My story is an attempt to make better care a shared obligation.

Eric Mack,"A few of the favorites to win the Game of Thrones
HBO
If you're the gambling sort, this might be the perfect time to place your bet on who will win the Game of Thrones since we now know when the final season of the HBO hit series will premiere. 
While season 8 starts April 14, betting has already been taking place for some time. At the conclusion of season 7 all the way back in 2017, the odds at one betting website favored Westeros' most desirable bastard, Jon Snow.  
Since the below teaser dropped Sunday, featuring heir Snow and his Stark half-sisters, he remains the odds-on favorite at online sportsbooks like MyBookie and BetOnline as of midday Monday. 
But the UK's BoyleSports is rating Bran Stark as the most likely future king, with even (50/50) odds. 
""We now know the date that Game of Thrones will be back on our screens and that alone has triggered a renewed interest in our betting on who will rule Westeros,"" said BoyleSports spokesperson Lawrence Lyons in an emailed statement. 
At No. 2 on BoyleSports' list of most likely monarchs is the presumably soon-to-be-introduced child of Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen, then it's Jon and Dany themselves in a tie for third most likely victor. 
Lyons also notes that the odds have been moving to favor a possible reign of Tyrion Lannister, who is now an 8-to-1 bet. 
Interestingly, MyBookie has the Night King and Arya Stark tied for fourth most likely to sit on the throne, behind Jon, Dany and Bran. 
MyBookie and BetOnline also offer wagers on who will be the first to die this season. There's agreement that odds are on poor Yara Greyjoy to be the initial casualty of the season. 
If you want a prediction market that's more for fun than profit, the free access Game of Predictions site and its several hundred or so users overwhelming believe that ""there won't be an Iron Throne"" at the end of the series. That's the choice of over 51 percent of users, followed by Sansa Stark, Jon and Dany as potential throne-sitters.
Of course, the overall winner of this several year odyssey seems completely obvious to me: HBO was always the only house (box office) guaranteed to survive and thrive since the show started. All the rest are mere pawns in the network's game... as are we.

Eric Mack,"An artist's visualization of the Mars One base on the Red Planet.
Mars One
The greatest journey in human history won't be financed by the most ambitious reality show ever. That's because the for-profit arm of the audacious venture known as Mars One has been dissolved by a civil court in Switzerland.
The brain child of Dutch engineer and entrepreneur Bas Lansdorp, Mars One initially hoped to send test missions to Mars in 2018 to pave the way for human visitors in 2025. The whole adventure was to involve volunteer astronauts selected from the public via an ""American Idol""-style public elimination process. The project's ever-growing mix of funding sources included advertising from the television show that would follow the process, crowdfunding and more traditional investments.
Almost from the start, Mars One struggled to raise funds and astronaut candidates reported the selection process was anything but rigorous.
The craziest part of the plan was that selected Mars colonists would have no way of returning home. Mars One astronauts would be explicitly agreeing to live out their remaining days on Mars. And according to some students at MIT who took a close, critical look at the venture's mission plans, Mars One volunteers would be lucky to make it more than two months once they arrived.
Lansdorp and Mars One refuted the criticism, but over the past four and a half years the initiative seemed to flail, making no visible progress toward a test mission of any kind. 
The bankruptcy ruling came on Jan. 15, according to a Swiss commercial register entry spotted by a Redditor. However, the social media accounts for Mars One remain active and Lansdorp told Engadget the non-profit Mars One Foundation remains open but in need of funds and he is working ""to find a solution.""
Mars One and Lansdorp did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.
Meanwhile, Mars One looks to be the first official casualty of the mid-2010s craze to get to the Red Planet, which Elon Musk and NASA, among others, are still pursuing in earnest.
Cartoonist Matthew Inman summed up the scheme's demise best with the apt and timely comparison on Twitter that ""Mars One Project = Interplanetary Fyre Festival.""

John Walcott,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States hopes North Korea will return the remains of about 50 American Korean War dead within two weeks, the first of thousands President Donald Trump says Pyongyang has promised to hand over, a senior U.S. defense official said on Tuesday. However, the timing of the handover and the number of sets remains to be returned is still uncertain, in spite of two days of talks between U.S. and North Korean officials on Sunday and Monday, said the official, who did not want to be identified. U.S. President Donald Trump announced after an unprecedented June 12 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un aimed at persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons that Kim had agreed to return the remains of “thousands and thousands” of Americans killed in the 1950-53 Korean War. Trump subsequently said the remains of 200 American servicemen had already been sent back, but so far none have been handed over. U.S. and North Korean officials met on the inter-Korean border on Sunday to discuss the issue and again on Monday. The first meeting had initially been scheduled for July 12, but the North Koreans failed to show up, the senior U.S. official said, saying this was “a reminder that this process is off to a slow start and isn’t likely to get any faster or easier as we try to repatriate thousands more of our people.” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo unveiled the plan for talks on the remains issue after visiting Pyongyang this month to press North Korea to agree to a specific time line for giving up its nuclear weapons. He touted it as one of the key issues on which the two sides had made progress, though North Korea accused his delegation of making “gangster-like” demands in connection with denuclearization during the trip, adding to doubts about Pyongyang’s intentions. According to South Korean media, U.S. forces brought about 100 wooden coffins into the Demilitarized Zone between the Koreas last month to prepare for the handover of remains. The Pentagon declined official comment but said the talks on Monday were to “continue coordination on the transfer of remains already collected in (North Korea) and the recommencing of field operations in (North Korea).” About 7,700 U.S. military personnel remain unaccounted for from the Korean War, in which the United States fought alongside South Korea against the North. The Pentagon has said North Korean officials have indicated in the past they have the remains of as many as 200 U.S. troops, but if and when they are handed over, their identities will have to be confirmed at the U.S. casualty identification facility in Hawaii before families can be notified. The United States conducted joint operations in North Korea to recover remains from 1996 to 2005, but the program was halted amid rising tensions over Pyongyang’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. The program helped bring in vital hard currency to North Korea, which has been under U.S.-led sanctions for decades. According to the Pentagon’s Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, the United States conducted 33 joint field activities in North Korea between 1996 and 2005. A Congressional Research Service report said the missions recovered over 220 sets of remains, while the United States paid $28 million to North Korea for assistance in the effort.

Heather Alexandra,"Far off in the distance, beyond the murky arctic waters, the vague silhouette of a tower can be seen through the mist. You raise your sniper rifle for a closer look. A solitary island is nestled away from all the chaos. What secrets does it hold? This piece originally appeared 3/21/17. GoldenEye 007 is one of the most formative first person shooters in gaming history. The Nintendo 64 classic helped solidify objective based shooters on consoles, asking players to navigate a web of tasks in order to complete a level. The first level was the Dam. It was full of alarms to disable and data to steal. But there was a single curiosity that grabbed gamers’ attention. A lone island on the other side of the dam. Surely, there was a special gun awaiting across the water. Perhaps there was a hidden objective to complete. GoldenEye came at a time when internet rumor mongering mixed with the hacking tools like the Game Shark. Whereas rumors about Ocarina of Time ’s Triforce led to massive hoaxes, GoldenEye players opted for a more empirical approach to their mysteries. If the island could be reached and examined, secrets might be unlocked. The use of a No-Clipping code allowed amateur sleuths to saunter over the the island. What they found was underwhelming. The island was empty. The gun turret lay dormant. The guard tower was unmanned. There were no special guns. There was no hidden NPCs. You couldn’t even climb the ladder in the tower. A decade after release Rare fan site MundoRare spoke to GoldenEye team members Mark Edmonds and Duncan Botwood, who offered some closure for curious fans. “I think the original plan was to have a building over there to go and investigate, with armor as a reward,” Botwood said. “That would have meant a boat ride needed to be coded in” “We never got around to implementing the boat,” Edmonds added. The island remained, an unreachable casualty of design prioritization. The story of GoldenEye ’s island is a story of disappointment. It is a moment where myth crumbled to reveal the realities of game development to a new generation of gamers. But hey, there might have been body armor out there!","Far off in the distance, beyond the murky arctic waters, the vague silhouette of a tower can be seen through the mist.

"James A. Gagliano, opinion contributor","Just a month following the worst mass shooting in United States history, a depraved gunman burst through the doors of a small church in rural Sutherland Springs, Texas, and with cold-blooded precision, slaughtered 26 innocent souls. The carnage left in his wake was astonishing to digest, as the church routinely captured video of its services ; last Sunday’s having just been released. The Texas church gunman, an Air Force veteran separated from the service via a Bad Conduct Discharge (BCD), exhibited astonishing indifference as he casually walked the aisles, executing congregants who cowered under pews, even taking the time to single out crying children and dispatching many of his victims with a rifle round to the head. His weapon of choice was a Ruger AR-556 MPR (Multi-Purpose Rifle), a most deadly effective “weapon of war” that can be chambered to fire rounds typically utilized by the military, and classified as 5.56 NATO and.223 Remington. In possession of two additional handguns, and fifteen 30-round magazines for his semi-automatic rifle, the murderer emptied all 450 rounds of rifle ammunition into the church and its congregants. They never had a chance. As I sat on the New York City set of CNN last Sunday afternoon, I numbly took in the horrifying news and updates in real time with the host of CNN Newsroom, Ana Cabrera. As the casualty count steadily climbed with updated news dispatches, I couldn’t help but be mentally and emotionally transported back those thirty-five days to Las Vegas, Nevada, and that other mind-numbingly horrific slaughter of innocents. It was there, on location in Las Vegas, that I spent some four days for CNN, in my role as a law enforcement analyst. The shooter in the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino had selected a multitude of semi-automatic rifles for his deadly mission. He outfitted a number of them with bump fire stocks. This aftermarket gimmick — a workaround designed to circumvent the federal ban on automatic weapons sales — aided the murderer in rapidly increasing his casualty count, which currently stands at 58 dead and over 500 wounded. That’s roughly equivalent of the casualty count resulting from America’s bloodiest engagement in the Iraq War, the Battle of Fallujah in 2004. In just under ten minutes, the Las Vegas killer was nearly able to replicate the 82 servicemen killed and 600 wounded during the nearly two-month long engagement in Fallujah. Allow that to sink in for just a minute. My job as a television analyst is to provide the X’s and O’s related to law enforcement matters. Analysts are often asked to attempt to provide context, and the make sense of the often seemingly senseless. Following both of the incomprehensibly senseless tragedies, I gamely attempted to provide that clarity and explanation. The “tactical response” piece from law enforcement’s perspective was simple. I’ve led the FBI’s New York Office SWAT Team and been assigned to the FBI’s elite counterterror unit, the Hostage Rescue Team. I understand the X’s and O’s well enough. However, making sense of this senselessness, well, that’s what I’m currently struggling with. Over the course of the past week, I made a number of appearances on CNN, and attempted to explain causality in these two recent massacres. With numerous hosts, we fleshed out mental health issues, glitches and loopholes in current firearms laws, and pondered whether law enforcement — or anyone else for that matter — had missed any obvious signs. And then, I began to explore a different route in my post-shooting calculus and analysis on-air. I openly questioned the recent proliferation of these incidents. And whether politically motivated, or perpetrated by an evil person or a sociopath seeking to ratchet up a body count, or in the case of Las Vegas, a still unidentified motivation, the concordant thread seemed to be an “assault rifle” in the hands of someone who shouldn’t be in possession of one. The “assault rifle” can be defined differently by various jurisdictions, but it generally means: semi-automatic rifle with a pistol grip, detachable magazines, shrouded barrel, and flash suppressor. In the hands of the “triggered,” aggrieved, evil, politically motivated (terrorist), or mentally unbalanced human being, the “assault rifle” becomes a “weapon of war.” Monday evening, the day following the Texas massacre, my father-in-law, a voracious consumer of FOX News, called to tell me he had just seen a clip segment of me on “Hannity.” Apparently, one of Sean Hannity’s producers had culled the internet for clips of what they determined to be the unhinged calling for gun control for a segment entitled “The Left and Members of the Media Call for Gun Control after Deadly Texas Church Shooting.” The selectively edited clip, airing on his show at the 37:40 mark, contained video of me on CNN’s New Day that morning, speaking with host Christopher Cuomo about what needed to happen in order to prevent more “senseless tragedies” in the future. I described the conditions of gridlock and special interest group interference that stymie any efforts to honestly review the conditions of our Second Amendment rights and legislative action that may or may not have changed anything in any particular “mass shooting” —generally defined as four or more casualties. I lamented the fact that rigid ideological adherence was making it impossible to break free from the bondage of insanity — doing the same thing over and over again and yet, expecting a different set of results. The next day, folks weighed in on social media as to what my actual position on gun control might be. And I decided to make it clear: I am a registered Republican. My views generally hew to the conservative side. I am a West Point graduate and an U.S. Army veteran. I am a retired FBI Special Agent and credentialed as an FBI Firearms Instructor. I am a gun owner. As a retired law enforcement officer, via H.R. 218, I have a concealed weapons carry permit. And finally, I am a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment. All the above makes me an unlikely adherent to what Hannity often refers to as the “unhinged Left” or “gun-grabber” attempting to shamelessly politicize the Texas church shooting. So what exactly do I and numerous current and retired law enforcement colleagues —want to see in the wake of Texas? It’s fairly simple actually and shouldn’t mean we’re advocating for “gun control”— which some on the Right view as the first steps in the government’s slippery slope advancement to disarming America. 1. We desperately need sensible measures to limit the availability of assault rifles to those who shouldn’t own them. And after we sew up the holes that sometimes allow someone like the Texas shooter to access a weapon of war, let’s ask ourselves this question: Why does any civilian need to own an assault rifle? For hunting? Baloney. There are far better rifles for that pursuit. Target practice/Gun enthusiast? Hogwash. Join the Military or the FBI, serve our great nation, as many of us have. You can get your fill of the thrill of automatic weapons fire and high capacity magazines. And then those weapons get returned to an arms room, until needed for war or law enforcement or training. They’re safe there, and it’s damned difficult to fathom how they’d find their way into the wrong hands. Home defense? Sorry, but a good shotgun meets that need much better, unless you’re expecting an invasion along the shores of Long Island by a battalion of enemy combatants anytime soon. 2. And how about all states require that lost or stolen firearms be reported to the authorities. Only twelve states currently require a lost or stolen firearm to be reported. Researchers estimate that more than half a million firearms are lost or stolen from private residences every year. This is unconscionable. Is it really unreasonable to require responsible gun owners to report that one of their weapons might have fallen into the wrong hands? 3. Tell me again why we don’t have a federal ban on bump fire stocks? In the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, everyone seemed in concert with the notion of banning this circumvention of federal law. How silly: you can own one, but it is illegal to use one. Yet, in spite of the immediate aftermath apparent solidarity, the venerable NRA has just come out against new legislation restricting the sales of same. Really? 4. And finally, make it a requirement that firearms procured through straw purchases be registered. Maybe you are ineligible to own a firearm because you’re a felon, or have been committed to a sanitarium, but your buddy is eligible to purchase one. He buys the gun, registers it and then sells it to you. And he never breaks the law? Isn’t this yet another frustrating means for firearms to fall into the wrong hands? So, there you have it. That’s what I’m for. And many who are similarly aligned with me from the ranks of law enforcement, the Military, and the GOP, feel the same. Call me/us part of the “unhinged Left” all you’d like. Mutter that we’re advocating for gun control and depriving you of your Second Amendment rights. And then, explain to me why any of the four suggested improvements to our current laws that I have listed above are nonsensical. I’ll wait. James A.

Mahita Gajanan,"More than 20 people are suffering from drug overdoses Wednesday in New Haven, Conn., according to city emergency officials. A total of 15 people overdosed on the New Haven Green starting Wednesday morning, authorities said at a press conference. Officials had received three more reports of overdoses by the time the news conference ended on Wednesday. New Haven fire chief John Alston told NBC Connecticut more than 20 overdose cases have been reported citywide. Alston said responders received calls just after 8 a.m. reporting multiple individuals experiencing overdose symptoms, including unconsciousness, vomiting and nausea. After responding to six reports, Alston said he realized it was a “multi-casualty” incident. Alston said initial reports indicate people overdosed on K2, a synthetic marijuana that contains a variety of chemicals and has been linked to prior large-scale overdoses. It’s unclear whether all the patients took the same drug or what exactly it contained. Patients were taken to the Yale-New Haven Hospital and the Hospital of Saint Raphael. EMS medical director Sandy Bogucki said it’s possible the drug was laced with PCP. “We heard from people on the green this morning that it potentially included PCP,” she said at the news conference. “Some of the reactions of the patients in the emergency department would suggest that there’s an opioid involved as well.” Those transferred to the hospital have responded well to high doses of narcan — a brand name for the drug naloxone, which reverses the effects of opioid overdoses — after smaller doses administered on the green had no effect, Bogucki said. New Haven city officials ended the press conference Wednesday to respond to another report of an overdose.

"Ula Chrobak, Ula Chrobak","Photos of felled Joshua trees went viral last week, a casualty of the government shutdown and the related lack of oversight in the eponymous national park. Other arid lands have been similarly abused. At Death Valley National Park, also in California, officials have also observed illegal off-roading, driving in donuts, and camping, according to National Parks Traveler, a non-profit media organization. But some of the longest-lasting impacts of unregulated trampling, driving, and camping might be the least obvious.
As the partial government shutdown continues into its 28th day, many national parks remain open but minimally staffed. On January 6, the National Parks Service decided to dip into entrance fee funds to help restore trash pick up and toilet cleaning in some areas. And hundreds of volunteers have been picking up trash at parks nationwide. Still, the actions of just a few can cause long-term harm to sensitive areas like deserts. When it comes to visitors misusing parks, the impacts occur very quickly, and they take a long time to recover, says Robert Manning, a professor emeritus at the University of Vermont who studies outdoor recreation.
Desert ecosystems are slow-growing, starved of nutrients and water. Trampled desert plants take much longer to recover than forest vegetation. Desert soil may look sandy, dry, and uninhabitablea lifeless rock dust. But a large part of it is covered by a living layer, called a biological soil crust, made up of some combination of cyanobacteria, fungi, algae, and mosses. Its a consortium of different organismstogether they make a living skin on top of the soil, says Matthew Bowker, soil ecologist at Northern Arizona Universitys school of forestry. (They are also sometimes called cryptogamic crusts, referring to the secret marriage of the crust organisms).
In the Colorado Plateau and Great Basin, you can clearly see crusts as clumps with dark blotches on the soil surface. In hot deserts like southern Californias Joshua Tree National Park, theyre much more cryptic, but still cover an estimated 13 percent of the soil surface. These organisms bind soil particles together, preventing erosion, and also help feed plants by adding carbon to the soil and by taking nitrogen from the air and converting into a nutrient form.
As Ive been hearing reports of people walking off trail [during the shutdown], I was certainly thinking of the soil communities, says Rebecca Drenovsky, plant ecologist at John Carroll University who has surveyed soil crusts in Joshua Tree. She adds that the Mojave National Preserve, the Grand Canyon, and White Sands National Monument also house these sensitive crusts. (People have been scaling fences to access the closed monument.)
Soil crustsand their benefits to their neighboring plantsstart to crumble away with just a single ill-placed step. Hiking off-trail can do it. Car tires, unsurprisingly, are especially troublesome. Its really easy to damage a dryland soil, you can basically do it in seconds with your Jeep, Bowker says. And then the damage may persist on a scale of years to decades, maybe even centuries. And once a new path, also called a desire line, is established, it can become permanent because other people follow, according to Bowker, leading to continued damage.
How long does it take for the crusts to recover? Anywhere from tens of years, to hundreds of years, a lot of that depends on climate, says Drenovsky. In drier and hotter desert areas, like Joshua Tree, it takes especially long, she adds.
In addition to disturbing soils, plants, and wildlife, Manning adds that unregulated use of parks might also harm historical and archaeological artifacts at parks, which are non-renewableonce theyre damaged, theyre gone.
Anytime we engage in activities where [human] use is in new areas, thats an element of concern in maintaining their ecological conditionthe rate of change in new places is the highest, says Christopher Monz, a professor of recreation resources management at Utah State University. As long as visitors stay in designated areas, theres really no issues.
Monz says visitors to parks during the shutdown should stick to designated areas and be diligent about minimizing their impacts. Parks are Americas best idea, and we all have to accept our role as responsible users, says Monz. We can honor that role by engaging in responsible use of our parks.","Photos of felled Joshua trees went viral last week, a casualty of the government shutdown and the related lack of oversight in the eponymous national park.

Eli Meixler,"An American service member was killed in Afghanistan Thursday. The deceased service member was in Afghanistan as part of the NATO Resolute Support mission, and the incident that led to the service member’s death is under investigation. In accordance with military policy, no further details on the deceased will be available until the next of kin has been notified. “We mourn and honor the sacrifice of our service member,” NATO Resolute Support and U.S. Forces-Afghanistan Commanding General Scott Miller said in a statement, adding that the mission remains “committed.” Eight American military service members have been killed and 76 others wounded in Afghanistan this year, according to an analysis by the Defense Casualty Analysis System. The NATO mission was launched in December 2014 as the U.S. began to scale back its commitment to the war in Afghanistan. The mission focuses on providing training and support to Afghan national security forces, and involves efforts from dozens of NATO allies and partner countries. One U.S. service member was killed and another wounded in an apparent insider attack on the mission forces last month in eastern Afghanistan, the Associated Press reported.","An American service member was killed in Afghanistan, according to the NATO Resolute Support mission",2018-10-05T02:46:38Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",A U.S. Service Member Has Been Killed in Afghanistan,http://time.com/5416329/u-s-military-killed-afghanistan-nato/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/gettyimages-1026091816.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,casualty,1
Eli Meixler,"A pilot whale died last week in southern Thailand after eating more than 80 plastic bags and other debris, Agence France-Presse reports. The distressed whale was found last Monday a canal in southern Thailand near the border with Malaysia, according to officials from Thailand’s Department of Marine and Coastal Resources. A veterinary team rescued the whale and attempted to “stabilize its illness,” according to AFP, but it died Friday after vomiting five plastic bags. An autopsy exhumed 8 kg (more than 17 lb) of additional plastic rubbish from the whale’s stomach, the department said in a Facebook post. The department’s chief theorized that the whale had mistaken the plastic bags for food, but after eating them had become “sick and unable to hunt for food,” Reuters reports. The pilot whale wasn’t the only recent casualty of ocean pollution; in April, a 33-foot sperm whale found dead on a Spanish beach had more than 60 lb of garbage in its digestive system. Around the world, 8 million tonnes of plastic waste ends up in oceans every year, comprising 80% of all ocean litter, according to the U.N. Environment Programme. A March study found that a collection of 1.8 trillion pieces of trash in the Pacific Ocean known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch could amount to 16 times more waste than previously thought. Thailand is one of the largest consumers of plastic bags, which are believed to kill hundreds of marine creatures off its coasts every year. In May, the Thai government said it was considering a introducing a tax on disposable plastic shopping bags or introducing biodegradable alternatives to cut down on plastic waste, according to the Bangkok Post.","A pilot whale died last week in southern Thailand after eating more than 80 plastic bags and other debris, Agence France-Presse reports.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption US and Russia ambassadors to the UN clashed over Syria at the UN Security Council The UN's secretary general has said the Cold War is ""back with a vengeance"". Antonio Guterres also warned about the dangers of escalation over Syria. The US and its allies are considering launching missile strikes against Syria after a suspected chemical attack, an action which Russia - whose forces are there supporting the government- has said would risk starting a war. Russia has accused the UK of faking an attack, an allegation Britain dismissed as a ""grotesque, blatant lie"". The Cold War, which followed the Allied victory in World War Two, saw the US and its allies facing off for decades with the Soviet Union, of which Russia is the main successor state. What exactly did Guterres say? Mr Guterres delivered his warnings at the opening of a bad-tempered UN Security Council meeting. Image copyright Reuters Image caption The USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier is on its way to the Middle East ""The Cold War is back with a vengeance, but with a difference,"" he said. ""The mechanisms and the safeguards to manage the risks of escalation that existed in the past no longer seem to be present."" He urged countries to ""act responsibly in these dangerous circumstances"". During the meeting: The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, accused the US of using the suspected chemical attack as a pretext to overthrow the Assad government and ""contain"" Russia The US ambassador accused Syrian President Bashar al-Assad of using chemical weapons at least 50 times in seven years France's ambassador said Syria had gone ""beyond the point of no return"" and France would ""shoulder its responsibility to end an intolerable threat to our collective security"" What proof is there of a chemical attack? The suspected attack, denied by President Assad's government, was carried out in the Eastern Ghouta town of Douma on Saturday, reportedly killing dozens of people. Control over the town has since passed from rebels to the Syrian and Russian military authorities. The Violations Documentation Center (VDC), a Syrian opposition network which records alleged violations of international law in Syria, said bodies were found foaming at the mouth, and with discoloured skin and cornea burns. Media caption Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack On Thursday, unnamed US officials told NBC News they had obtained blood and urine samples from victims which had tested positive for chlorine and a nerve agent. The US and France both say they have proof that the Syrian government has attacked Douma with chemical weapons. A UN report last year found the Syrian government responsible for a deadly chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun, in which more than 80 people died. That attack was followed by a US cruise missile attack on a Syrian airbase. A delegation from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will arrive in the area of the suspected attack on Saturday. What are the Russians alleging? General Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for Russia's defence ministry, said: ""We have... evidence that proves Britain was directly involved in organising this provocation."" In a video produced by the Russian defence ministry two men speaking Arabic say they were working in the casualty ward of Douma's central hospital when they assisted people brought in after the bombing of a multi-storey building. While they are clearly talking about the suspected chemical attack, both say the bombing occurred on Sunday 8 April when it actually occurred on Saturday 7 April. The two men say people were suffering from smoke inhalation, not chemical poisoning, but a panic began when one man said they were victims of a chemical attack. What are Western leaders planning? In the UK, cabinet ministers agreed it was ""highly likely"" the Syrian government was responsible for the alleged attack and said the use of chemical weapons must not ""go unchallenged"". During a phone call on Thursday, UK Prime Minister Theresa May and US President Donald Trump had agreed to ""keep working closely"" on the issue, Mrs May's office said. Media caption Trump: Decisions on Syria will be made ""fairly soon"" The US president has said Russian President Vladimir Putin bears responsibility for the alleged attack in Douma because of his support for the Syrian government. On Wednesday he warned Russia that missiles were ""coming"" but later tweeted that he had ""never said when"". It ""could be very soon or not so soon at all"", Mr Trump said. What is Russia saying about the risk of war? Before the Security Council meeting, Mr Nebenzia accused Washington of putting international peace at risk. ""The immediate priority is to avert the danger of war,"" he said on Thursday. Senior Russian figures, including the head of the military, have warned that US missiles will be shot down and their launch sites targeted if Russian personnel come under threat. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich criticised Mr Trump's rhetoric. ""We cannot depend on the mood of someone on the other side of the ocean when he wakes up,"" the Tass news agency quoted him as saying.

ASHRAF KHALIL / AP,"(WASHINGTON) — Gerard Murphy never met his uncle Richard. But the Potomac, Maryland, native grew up hearing stories of the former journalist who enlisted in the Marines during World War II and disappeared during the June 15, 1944, amphibious assault on the Pacific island of Saipan. “This was a mystery in our family for basically my entire life,” said Gerard Murphy, a lawyer. “It’s bad enough to lose someone in a war. Having them missing in action is an added burden and grief to carry.” That all changed in 2015, when Gerard Murphy was contacted by Ted Darcy, an independent researcher specializing in identifying World War II-era military remains. Darcy, a retired Marine gunnery sergeant, believed he had made a match between Richard Murphy’s dental records and the remains of an unidentified Saipan casualty buried in the Philippines as unknown soldier X-15. Three years and many steps later Richard Murphy’s remains are finally coming home. Darcy’s efforts resulted in the military disinterring the remains in the X-15 grave and bringing them to Hawaii for genetic testing. Gerard Murphy and one of his cousins provided DNA samples — “basically we spit in a bag” — and the military was able to make a positive match. Richard Murphy’s remains are expected to arrive in late November, where they will be reburied in a cemetery in Silver Spring, Maryland, “right next to his mother,” Gerard Murphy said. A native of Washington, D.C., Richard Murphy graduated from Georgetown University and worked for several years for the Washington Evening Star, an afternoon newspaper that ceased publication in 1981. When the U.S. entered World War II, Murphy enlisted in the Marines as a combat correspondent, island hopping through the Pacific with American troops. “He carried his M-1 rifle and his typewriter,” Gerard Murphy said. “All my life we heard about Uncle Richard. Having his remains brought home feels really amazing — very spiritual.” Working from his home in Florida, Darcy was able to make the match by comparing dental records from Richard Murphy’s enlistment with those of unknown soldier X-15, all supplied for a fee by the National Archives and Records Administration. Darcy said he has dealt with dozens of such cases and often ends up dealing directly with family members — sometimes with divergent reactions to news of a long-dead relative. “Some are very, very grateful,” he said. “Some don’t want to be bothered.” Darcy said he has personally helped complete 15 such unknown soldier cases from World War II, a small fraction of the nearly 9,000 unknown soldier cases from that conflict. His work frequently brings him in contact with the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, or DPAA. Darcy expressed some frustration with the pace of the process on the military’s end. “It took three years for them to decide to disinter (Murphy), go get the body and ship it to Hawaii for DNA testing,” Darcy said. “I’ve got 48 more on my desk right now. How long is it going to take to get them through those?” Hattie Johnson, a service casualty officer for the Marine Corps, has been handling the Murphy case and said there’s a renewed sense of urgency surrounding the World War II cases because “the family members of these soldiers are starting to die off.” The situation is complicated by the relatively primitive nature of the medical and dental records back then, Johnson said. For example, the dental records on file for each American soldier and Marine were essentially done by hand instead of with an X-ray machine. “Back then, the dentist would literally look into your mouth and manually fill out a chart,” she said. Still, Darcy was able to make that connection using the same records. “The military said they tried but they couldn’t figure it out,” he said. “I think they’re just overwhelmed.”",World War II Veteran Richard Murphy's remains are finally coming home next month after being discovered in the Philippines,2018-10-10T15:16:17Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",It ‘Feels Really Amazing.’ A WWII Soldier’s Remains Are Finally Coming Home Thanks to DNA Testing,http://time.com/5420449/wwii-soldier-remains-return-home-dna-testing/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/american-cemetery-philippines.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,casualty,1

Will Martin,"Global stock markets are selling off on Tuesday, as the tech slump which gripped US equities on Monday spreads around the world. Monday's biggest casualty was the Nasdaq, which closed more than 3% lower, dragged down by mega-cap technology companies, as Wall Street worries about global growth and trade tensions amid a quiet week for economic data. Monday's sell-off on Wall Street appears to have been largely triggered by a report from the Wall Street Journal that Apple has slashed production orders in recent weeks for all three of its new iPhones unveiled in September. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1.6%, or nearly 400 points. Wall Street's sell-off spread into Asia overnight, with benchmark indexes in Japan and China falling substantially. China's most-watched index, the Shanghai Composite, fell 2.1%, while Japan's Nikkei was 1.1% lower at the close. As the morning began in Europe, stocks on the continent also fell, and after around an hour of trading, Germany's DAX has dropped 1.2%, while the Euro Stoxx 50 index is just shy of 1% lower.

""So, as things stand, the outlook for global equity indices appears bleak and we could easily witness further falls,"" he added. That suggestion looks likely to be correct, with futures pointing to another day in the red for US stocks. As of 9.00 a.m. GMT (4.00 a.m. ET), futures for all three US indexes are at least 0.6% lower. Here's the scoreboard: Nasdaq futures down 1%; S&amp;P 500 down 0.7%; Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.6% Shanghai Composite Index closed down 2.1%, while the Shenzhen Composite was 2.8% lower Benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 down 1%; Germany's DAX is 1.1% lower; Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 is down 0.6%. Indexes in Spain, Italy, and France are all more than 1% lower. Both major oil benchmarks, Brent and WTI, are down more than 1%, with Brent trading at $66.02 per barrel, and WTI at $56.64. Lower production by Apple tends to suggest falling demand for its products, which in turn acts as a bellwether for general sentiment surrounding the tech sector.

Sven Gustafson,"The arrest and detention of its former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, prompted Nissan at the last minute to pull the plug on plans to debut a longer-range version of its Leaf battery- electric car at the Los Angeles auto show, The Wall Street Journal reports. Nissan instead showed two mild-refresh models for 2019 — the Maxima sedan and the Murano crossover. It had reportedly hoped to make a bigger splash by unveiling the upgraded Leaf with actress and brand ambassador Margot Robbie at a media event at the Japanese American National Museum. It went ahead with an event at the venue, showing current models of the Leaf and holding the Nissan Futures event, the first time the series of panel discussion and keynote addresses had been staged in the U.S., with Robbie sitting down for a brief interview about owning an EV and sustainability issues. ""The official announcement regarding details of the 2019 Nissan Leaf with additional performance capabilities is postponed to a later date,"" the company said in a statement. A spokesman told the Journal the postponement was ""to ensure that this important product unveiling could receive the coverage it merits."" Ghosn was arrested Nov. 19 in Japan on allegations of financial misconduct, including what Nissan has said was personal use of company money and deliberately under-reporting what he had been paid. Both Nissan and alliance partner Mitsubishi have ousted Ghosn as chairman, though his status remains unchanged for now at Renault, the third member of the partnership where he is both chairman and CEO. Renault has appointed a stand-in replacement while Ghosn remains in custody. Reuters reports that Tokyo authorities extended Ghosn's detention a second time Friday and have until Dec. 10 to file charges or release him. The auto world has been widely anticipating a longer-range version believed to be called the Leaf E-Plus, with a 60-kWh battery pack and an expected driving range of around 225 miles, up from the 40-kWh battery and 151-mile driving range of the current model. A recent report suggests that its starting price will be about $5,500 more than the 40-kWh version, meaning around $36,385 before federal EV tax credits. A spokesman tells Autoblog the postponement doesn't affect the new Leaf's on-sale date but added that date has yet to be announced. Nissan last week revealed the racing version of the Leaf, called the Leaf Nismo RC, in Japan, with dual electric motors, a whopping 478 pound-feet of torque, a 0-62 mph launch in 3.4 seconds. It said the twin 120-kW electric motors ""more than double the maximum power,"" though it did not give a figure for the Leaf Nismo RC's peak horsepower (and it's not always just the sum of the two motors' output). Nissan's design chief, Alfonso Albaisa, also confirmed that that both Nissan and Infiniti will bring concept EVs to the Detroit auto show in January that are evolutions of the Infiniti Q Inspiration concept unveiled earlier this year. Separately, Nissan said Monday that its total U.S. sales in November fell 18.7 percent from the previous year. Year-to-date, its sales are off 7.6 percent from the same period in 2017, though year-to-date Leaf sales were up 17 percent.

Special Correspondent,"The disagreement between the ruling and Opposition benches over which agency should probe the audio clip could mar this budget session, which will come to an end on Friday. 
The session, which began with the boycott of the Governors address by the BJP, was disrupted on Monday too over the audio clip controversy. Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamys second budget on Friday had been boycotted by the BJP.
A senior BJP leader felt the session could be a washout as the BJP would insist on a judicial or a House probe instead of SIT as suggested by the Speaker. In such a scenario, discussions on budget and Governor speech may be affected. The discussion could continue in July too when the session meets after passing it without discussion now, a former BJP Minister said. The BJP leader also pointed out that mentally, legislators across political spectrum are not ready for a debate in the House since they are already in election mode with the Lok Sabha poll date announcement round the corner.","The disagreement between the ruling and Opposition benches over which agency should probe the audio clip could mar this budget session, which will come to an end on Friday.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The wildly unpopular GOP tax bill, which is expected to pass through Congress along party lines imminently, includes a number of provisions that have big ramifications for the climate and the environment. These range from mostly good (preserving solar and wind tax credits) to actually the worst (drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge). RL Miller, co-founder of Climate Hawks Vote, told Earther that some of the worst attacks on renewables have been “neutered.” For example, the $7500 tax credit for buying an electric vehicle has been restored. “But it doesn’t begin to make up for the assault on the environment envisioned in this bill,” she said. Here’s a look at what’s going on in the bill from a climate and energy perspective. Drilling the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge This might just be the biggest environmental catastrophe in the GOP tax bill. It’s also insanely unpopular, with 70 percent of Americans in opposition, but then that’s par for the course with this bill. The provision was essentially a deal sweetener for Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) who has long coveted drilling in the Arctic wildlife refuge, the country’s largest. Doing so would imperil fragile ecosystems and wildlife, like the Porcupine Caribou herd, which use the area as a calving site. That in turn would impact the food security of Alaska Natives. Environmental groups are also highly skeptical it will raise the $1 billion Republicans are promising. “They’re not going to come anywhere close to that,” Alex Taurel, the deputy director for legislative affairs at the League of Conservation Voters, told Earther. “It’s a penny on the dollar compared to the $1.5 trillion tax cut.” Renewable energy The bill the House passed stripped tax credits for renewable energy. Those credits survived in the Senate bill, and are in the final bill Congress is voting on. Those credits aren’t permanent—they’ll phase out in 2020 for wind, and 2022 for solar, as planned in a 2015 tax bill. By sticking to that timeline, renewable companies will have time to cut costs and plan for the phase out rather than preparing for the abrupt changes the House bill would’ve wrought. “We are grateful for the elimination of provisions that would have decimated future renewable energy growth and even penalized past investment in wind and solar power,” Gregory Wetstone, the president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, said in a statement. The Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) is another piece of the renewable energy puzzle in the bill. The tax is designed to keep corporations from reducing their tax liability through overseas payments. The New York Times has a great explanation of how it applies to wind and solar projects: Many companies building wind and solar farms sell their tax credits to multinational banks and other investors who can use them to lower their own tax burdens. Roughly two-thirds of wind projects and three-fourths of solar projects in the United States are supported by such tax-equity financing. By imposing a minimum tax on multinational investors under certain conditions, the initial Senate bill could have drastically reduced demand for such credits. The final bill includes language that would still allow investors to offset up to 80 percent of the minimum tax using solar and wind credits, which ensures those credits still remain valuable. But the bill also includes more firms that will now fall under the BEAT, which adds a layer of uncertainty to the market. Electrical vehicles Car manufacturers from Chevy to Tesla are also breathing a sigh of relief after it was announced the tax bill would keep the electrical vehicle tax credit. It’s a consumer-side credit worth up to $7,500, with the goal of encouraging more people to buy electric cars. “Keeping the plug-in vehicle credit in place is the right policy for consumers and for the nation,” Genevieve Cullen, the president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, said in a statement. “We appreciate the conferees’ support and will continue to work with Congress to advance U.S. competitiveness through electric mobility.”﻿ Grad students The House bill included a provision that would’ve taxed graduate students on the tuition waivers they currently receive from universities, dramatically increasing their tax burden. It was, to put it lightly, “truly horrifying” and roundly denounced as elitist and unhealthy for American competitiveness in STEM and other fields. It has also, thankfully, been killed in the final bill. Disaster sufferers The tax bill is setup to kick people while they’re down. While people who have lost everything (or close to it) from wildfires and hurricanes this year will be able to write off those losses on taxes, future disaster victims won’t be in the same boat. The personal casualty loss deduction allows victims to write off losses that are greater than 10 percent of a person’s adjusted gross income. Taxpayers were able to deduct $1.6 billion in losses from natural disasters in 2015. The House bill canned it entirely, but the Senate bill kept the deduction in place if a federal disaster is declared, which is how the final bill reads. For people who suffer from tornadoes, hurricanes or large fires, that’s (relatively) good news. But smaller fires or weather disasters may slip through the cracks. There’s a host of other things going on in the tax bill, which clocks in at 1,097 pages with all the notes reconciling the House and Senate versions. It was unveiled on Friday and over the weekend, and senators have copped to not even reading the whole thing before today’s planned vote. That includes Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who was a no until a timely provision was added that would be a huge windfall for him. Among casualties lost in the bill, Republicans decided not to renew expired credits for small-scale renewable energy. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) also added a sneaky amendment that would benefit pipeline companies, and the 16 members of Congress who have stakes in them. And regardless of any windfalls for renewables, this is far from a progressive bill. In the long-term, it will take money away from the middle and lower class in favor of paying off the rich. Miller said she’s already thinking of how the bill’s environmental shortcomings could be used against Republicans who vote for it in the midterm elections next year. “Generally we try to tie climate campaigning to voters’ everyday lives. And this bill gives us a great opportunity to do so. We’re obviously still working on messaging, but I could easily see a message along these lines: ‘The same tax bill that wrecked Obamacare and is taking a bite out of your paycheck has giveaways to Exxon—because Republicans care about Exxon, not you. Time to vote them out!’”","The wildly unpopular GOP tax bill, which is expected to pass through Congress along party lines imminently, includes a number of provisions that have big ramifications for the climate and the environment.

,"Yes, we licensed the original stock photo Antonio Guillem/Shutterstock By Frank Swain New rules passed by the European Union on Wednesday aim to force big platforms like Google and Facebook to share their profits with publishers, but critics are warning that the legislation could spell the end of memes, remixes and other user-generated content. The Copyright Directive is the first update to the EU’s media sharing rules in 17 years, and the vast majority of changes are simple technical fixes. However, two amendments are attracting particular ire. Article 11 proposes a “link tax” that would force anyone using even small snippets of published text to obtain a licence from the publisher first, while Article 13 would make platforms responsible for installing automated content filters to ensure that material uploaded by their users does not infringe copyright. No more memes If companies cannot afford either of these, they will likely have to cease hosting user content altogether. Memes, generally being unlicensed remixes of other people’s content, would be caught in the cross fire. Media companies have seen their bottom lines eroded by the arrival of the internet and an accompanying shift in how people find and consume content. Now the EU is attempting to redress the balance. “The real target is for Google, Twitter, and Facebook to share profits with media companies, and everything else has become the collateral damage,” says Cory Doctorow, special adviser to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group that defends civil liberties online. Yet instead of directly challenging this power, he says, the EU is accommodating it. “This legislations accepts tech giants as permanent overlords of the internet. We’re legislating for a constitutional monarchy.” Google is king This, he says, will be a self-fulfilling prophecy. “I don’t know how we beat Google, but I know it’s not by giving them a permanent advantage. Putting smaller companies out of business won’t help us beat Google.” It’s not just memes that are at risk. Jim Killock, executive officer of the Open Rights Group, a UK digital rights campaign group says content filter erode the long-standing EU principle against “general monitoring” – where platforms are obliged to inspect what users post on their sites. Demands for general monitoring are already forbidden by the EU’s Ecommerce act, because of the risk that autocratic governments would use such technology to suppress free speech. The bill must now pass the EU plenary, a body of all 751 members of the European Parliament, before it becomes law. Legal challenges are inevitable, says Doctorow, but the European Court of Justice is not a fast-moving institution. “It’s going to take years and years, and in the meantime Article 13 will be the law of the land. The idea we’re going to sit out the third decade of the millennium without a functional internet is nightmarish.” More on these topics:","The European Union is attempting to stand up to the might of Google, Facebook and Twitter with a new copyright law, but it could just kill off memes",2018-06-22T10:03:00Z,"{'id': 'new-scientist', 'name': 'New Scientist'}",Why memes are the latest casualty in EU’s war on Silicon Valley,https://www.newscientist.com/article/2172373-why-memes-are-the-latest-casualty-in-eus-war-on-silicon-valley/,https://d1o50x50snmhul.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/22102135/memes.png,new-scientist,New Scientist,casualty,1
Associated Press,"(MOUNT ARAFAT, Saudi Arabia) — Some 2 million Muslim pilgrims gathered on Monday in the valley of Mount Arafat in Saudi Arabia for a day of prayer that marks the pinnacle of the annual hajj. Pilgrims stood shoulder to shoulder for an emotional day of repentance and supplication at the site Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad delivered his final sermon, calling for equality and for Muslims to unite. According to the hadiths, traditional collections of the prophet’s sayings and anecdotes about his life, Muhammad also reminded his followers of women’s rights and that every Muslim life and property is sacred. Muslims believe prayer on this day at Mount Arafat, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of the holy city of Mecca, is their best chance to erase past sins and start anew. Around sunset, pilgrims will head to an area called Muzdalifa, which is 9 kilometers (5.5 miles) west of Arafat. Many walk, while others use buses. They spend the night there and pick up pebbles along the way that will be used in a symbolic stoning of the devil back in the city of Mina, where Muslims believe the devil tried to talk Ibrahim out of submitting to God’s will. The kingdom has spent billions of dollars of its vast oil revenues on security and safety measures, particularly in Mina, where some of the hajj’s deadliest incidents have occurred. The worst in recorded history took place only three years ago. On Sept. 24, 2015, a stampede and crush of pilgrims in Mina killed at least 2,426 people, according to an Associated Press count. The official Saudi toll of 769 people killed and 934 injured has not changed since only two days after the tragedy. The kingdom has never addressed the discrepancy in the casualty toll, nor has it released any results of an investigation that authorities had promised to conduct over the disaster. The five-day hajj pilgrimage represents one of the world’s biggest gatherings every year, and is required of all able-bodied Muslims once in their life. At the hajj’s end, male pilgrims will shave their hair and women will cut a lock of hair in a sign of renewal for completing the pilgrimage. Around the world, Muslims will mark the end of hajj with a celebration called Eid al-Adha. The holiday, remembering Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son, sees Muslims slaughter sheep and cattle, distributing the meat to the poor. Overnight, a sandstorm packing strong winds and thunderstorms roared through Mecca. Officials say the severe weather slightly damaged some tents housing pilgrims, but caused no injuries. They said further severe weather was possible through Monday.",Islam's Prophet Muhammad is said to have delivered his final sermon at the site,2018-08-20T05:48:50Z,"{'id': 'time', 'name': 'Time'}",Millions of Muslim Pilgrims Gather at Mount Arafat to Mark Pinnacle of Hajj,http://time.com/5371420/mount-arafat-hajj-2018/,https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/gettyimages-1019158326.jpg?quality=85,time,Time,casualty,1
Rachel Kaser,"Elon Musk has jumped on the #deletefacebook train, deleting the pages for SpaceX and Tesla from the disgraced social media site and erasing their millions-strong followings. In case you’ve been living in seclusion for the last week or so, Facebook has found itself embroiled in a scandal involving a data analysis firm that is quickly becoming one of the messiest kerfuffles in the site’s history. If you want to know the essential details and how it effects you, read Bryan’s breakdown. In response, the hashtag #deletefacebook has started trending on Twitter. Musk originally joined the conversation with a snarky response to WhatsApp founder Brian Acton: What’s Facebook? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 23, 2018 After that, multiple users justifiably asked him why he was allowing Facebook pages for his companies to remain up. In response, he pleaded ignorance of their existence — though I’m pretty sure he’s got staff that handle that stuff for both companies. I didn’t realize there was one. Will do. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 23, 2018 Then he apparently followed through, as the SpaceX and Tesla pages on Facebook no longer appear to be there. He declined to delete his Instagram, though. When asked, he said he believed it was independent enough to be “ probably ok.” It should be noted Musk is far more active on Instagram than he ever was on Facebook. During all this, Mashable reporter Kerry Flynn brought up an issue between Musk and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg — namely that a SpaceX rocket once destroyed a Facebook satellite. Yeah, my fault for being an idiot. We did give them a free launch to make up for it and I think they had some insurance. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 23, 2018 The two have also clashed in a more passive aggressive manner, when Zuckerberg was asked about Musk’s reservations about AI and responded by calling him a naysayer. Musk responded by saying Zuckerberg’s understanding of AI was “ limited. ” It’s possible the pages will eventually be reinstated, if this current scandal ever blows over. If not, they’ll be the most high-profile casualty of the #deletefacebook movement thus far.

Rhett Jones,"There are many reasons that AT&amp;T’s merger with Time Warner presented the clear possibility of harming consumers. Somewhere on the list is the possibility of turning the carefully curated, profitable, and beloved HBO into a big-data monster like Netflix. To hear AT&amp;T’s executive in charge of the cable channel tell it, that’s exactly what’s planned for the future. Last month, AT&amp;T won its legal battle with the Department of Justice and promptly completed its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. It’s now the proud owner of DC Comics, CNN, and many other popular media properties. HBO is one of the most prestigious and successful facets of the division that has now been renamed as WarnerMedia —leave it to corporate America to look at something that works well and immediately decide it needs to change. The New York Times has reportedly obtained audio of a recent conversation between HBO’s longtime CEO, Richard Pepler, and his new boss, John Stankey, that was privately conducted for employees of the network—it is equal parts uncomfortable and ominous. It was only a few weeks ago that Stankey was painting a picture of AT&amp;T taking a hands-off approach to HBO, but behind closed doors, he’s ringing alarm bells that the company needs to catch up with the ‘throw anything at the wall’ approach of Netflix. Stankey warned employees that “it’s going to be a tough year,” as AT&amp;T retools as operations. Plepler, meanwhile, tried to maintain a cheery disposition and pushback on some of the more unsettling remarks his boss made. Part of AT&amp;T’s argument for the merger was it needed more content to compete with the rising giants of streaming. HBO manages to hold its own pretty well in the TV streaming market despite having a wildly different approach than rivals like Netflix and Prime Video. The 45-year-old network sticks with what works: maintaining a rotating library of feature film offerings and mostly focusing on producing high-quality content for its big Sunday night audience. For Stankey, that idea is dead. It’s not enough to make money anymore, greedy executives demand “engagement.” From the Times report: “We need hours a day,” Mr. Stankey said, referring to the time viewers spend watching HBO programs. “It’s not hours a week, and it’s not hours a month. We need hours a day. You are competing with devices that sit in people’s hands that capture their attention every 15 minutes.” Continuing the theme, he added: “I want more hours of engagement. Why are more hours of engagement important? Because you get more data and information about a customer that then allows you to do things like monetize through alternate models of advertising as well as subscriptions, which I think is very important to play in tomorrow’s world.” One can imagine Pepler grinning and nodding as he thinks about the record-setting number of Emmys HBO has won and the huge profits it pulls in while Stankey says that the network needs “more depth.” And just as a vein on Pepler’s forehead threatens to explode, Stankey says something any network exec likes to hear: “I do believe there needs to be stepped-up investment.” More money to make quality television sounds great, but then Stankey made it clear that there’s no amount of profit that will ever be enough. This exchange is heartbreaking: “Also,” Mr. Stankey said, “we’ve got to make money at the end of the day, right?” “We do that,” Mr. Plepler responded, to scattered applause. “Yes, you do,” Mr. Stankey said. “Just not enough.” “Oh, now, now, be careful,” Mr. Plepler said. You see, despite HBO turning a $2 billion annual budget into $6 billion in profits, it’s competing with Netflix, a company that plans to spend $2 billion on marketing alone this year and runs at a loss. Hulu, another direct competitor, managed to lose close to a billion dollars last year. And in Stankey’s maniacal mind, HBO must be more like these losers. And the fact is, Stankey probably has a point. When you live in a system in which venture capitalism and public investment push a company to gobble up the market until all competitors are vanquished without regard for profits, this is the mindset we end up with. In what sane world does a man say “35 to 40 percent” market penetration just isn’t enough and that the definition of success is strapping as many eyeballs to a service for as many hours of the day as possible? No sane world, but this is Stankey’s world. It’s one in which consumer preferences must be chopped and screwed into endless charts that are monetized across endless platforms. And hey, if some people like the show with the dragons, that’s fine, too. Netflix has made some highly praised and popular shows with its data-driven approach to programming, but if its name was ever automatically associated with quality original content, that time is over. The streaming service does enjoy a reputation for giving artists a lot of freedom after it’s data model crunches the numbers and decides the right keywords are all present in a pitch. It also has a reputation for making a lot of bullshit. So many shows on HBO wouldn’t get the slightest bit of interest, much less mainstream success if they didn’t include the HBO brand. People know that they’re going to get something worthwhile—maybe even genius—when they watch HBO. Stankey knows this, and he says its now time to “figure out how to expand the aperture of it without losing the quality.” Unfortunately, that’s like saying it’s now time to defy the laws of gravity. A profit-driven creative approach will push away the good artists that work in the godforsaken industry of television. And the even if some stick around, there aren’t enough of them to fill out every moment of the day. The U.S. regulatory environment has allowed this growth-at-all-costs attitude to flourish, and it’s not enough to make money hand over fist while pleasing millions of people. No company is allowed to just win, everyone else has to lose. Unfortunately, lovers of HBO might be a casualty in that battle. In exchange, we can look forward to the network’s iconic static logo appearing before a reboot of Charles in Charge.

Nasser Karimi and Mohammad Nasiri / AP,"(SARPOL-E-ZAHAB) — Rescuers on Tuesday used backhoes and heavy equipment to dig through the debris of buildings toppled by a powerful earthquake on the border between Iran and Iraq, with weeping women crying out to God as aid workers found new bodies. The grim work began in earnest again at dawn in the Kurdish town of Sarpol-e-Zahab in the western Iranian province of Kermanshah, which appears to be the hardest hit in the magnitude 7.3 earthquake that struck Sunday night. Both rescuers and local residents alike stood atop the remains of apartment complexes, looking through the rubble. They used heavy blankets to carry away corpses. The hospital in Sarpol-e-Zahab was heavily damaged, and the army set up field hospitals, although many of the injured were moved to other cities, including Tehran. The quake also damaged an army garrison and buildings in the border city and killed an unspecified number of soldiers, according to reports. President Hassan Rouhani arrived in Kermanshah province on Tuesday to see the damage for himself and offer his support to those affected. “This was a pain for all Iranians,” Rouhani said, according to a statement on the presidency’s website. “Representing the nation of Iran, I offer my condolences to the people of Kermanshah, and tell them that all of us are behind Kermanshah.” Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif offered his thanks to foreign countries offering to help but wrote on Twitter: “For now, we are able to manage with our own resources.” Cleric Abdolhossein Moezi, a representative of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who also is touring the area, said there was a need for more relief material and “security.” Many of the heavily damaged complexes in Sarpol-e-Zahab were part of construction projects under former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The newly homeless slept outside in cold, huddled around makeshift fires for warmth. The quake killed 430 people in Iran and injured 7,460, state media reported Tuesday. Most of the injuries were minor with fewer than 1,000 still hospitalized, Iran’s crisis management headquarters spokesman Behnam Saeedi told state TV. The official death toll came from provincial forensic authorities based on death certificates issued. Some reports said unauthorized burials without certification could mean the death toll was actually higher. The quake was centered about 19 miles (31 kilometers) outside the eastern Iraqi city of Halabja, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and struck 14.4 miles (23.2 kilometers) below the surface, a somewhat shallow depth that can cause broader damage. The quake caused Dubai’s skyscrapers to sway and could be felt 1,060 kilometers (660 miles) away on the Mediterranean coast. Seven deaths occurred in Iraq and 535 people were injured, all in the country’s northern, semiautonomous Kurdish region, according to its Interior Ministry. The disparity in casualty tolls immediately drew questions from Iranians, especially because so much of the town was new. Sarpol-e-Zahab fell to the troops of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein during his 1980 invasion of Iran, which sparked the eight-year war between the two countries that killed 1 million people. Though clawed back by Iran seven months later, the area remained a war zone that suffered through Saddam’s missile attacks and chemical weapons. After the war, Iran began rebuilding the town. It also was part of Ahmadinejad’s low-income housing project, which aided the Holocaust-questioning hard-liner’s populist credentials but also saw cheap construction. Under the plan dubbed as Mehr or “kindness” in Farsi, some 2 million units were built in Iran, including hundreds in Sarpol-e Zahab. Many criticized the plan, warning that the low-quality construction could lead to a disaster.— “Before its 10-year anniversary, Mehr buildings have turned into coffins for its inhabitants,” the reformist Fararu news website wrote Monday. Iran sits on many major fault lines and is prone to near-daily quakes. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. In 2012, a major casualty earthquake killed over 300. ___ Karimi reported from Tehran, Iran.

Finlay Greig,"*Spoilers for seasons 1-7 of Game of Thrones follow*
According to one Game of Thrones fan’s estimate, 174,373 characters have died in the first seven seasons of the blood-drenched fantasy epic (that’s roughly the population of Oxford for anyone who’s asking).
From Ned Stark’s beheading to the mass slaughter of wildlings at Hardhome, author George R. R. Martin and show runners David Benioff and Daniel Brett Weiss haven’t been afraid to quite literally drop the axe on characters, be they expendable extras or central protagonists.
The first casualty in this seven-year-long carnival of slaughter was Waymar Royce played by actor Rob Ostlere.
Riding through the Haunted Forest beyond the Wall with Night’s Watch comrades Gared and Will, the cocksure rider was sliced in two – lengthways – by a white walker in the opening breaths of the show’s debut episode.
The significance of the grisly, tone-setting death is not lost on Ostlere.
Speaking to i Ostlere says: “One of the most interesting aspects of the show is how willing they are to kill off characters and catch you by surprise.
“After a while I realised how it was significant that I was the first to die.”
And, seven years on from Royce’s offing, Ostlere’s Twitter bio ironically boasts “First one to die in @GameOfThrones”.
Auditioning for Jon Snow and Theon Greyjoy
Ostlere took on the role of Waymar Royce as a green-behind-the-ears drama school graduate.
However, Ostlere originally had his eyes on a different prize.
“I auditioned for Jon and Theon and all sorts of main parts,” he reveals.
This actor’s free-for-all could be hectic, notes Ostlere.
“They’d ask me if Id like to audition for, say Theon. Theyd say, ‘Oh do you want to have a look at this part?’ and you would come in the next day and have a look and study every reference of the given character in the original books, highlight it, make notes.”
“With Jon I just had to give it my best and sometimes you dont quite get the essence of them – some of them stick well with you, some of them dont.
“I always liked auditioning for the characters who were kind of arrogant, a little bit of attitude.”
With Jon Snow assigned to Kit Harington and Theon Greyjoy to Alfie Allen, Ostlere was given the role of Waymar Royce, whose father Yohn of House Arryn still plays an integral role in the series.

Despite limited screen time, his stint under the stewardship of Weiss and Benioff left an impression on the then-27-year-old actor.
Ostlere, to his surprise, found the atmosphere to be “laid-back”, despite the pressures on the production team following the disastrous pilot episode.
“You’d think it would be quite high stakes and stressful, but everything was really relaxed and calm,” he says. “Id never been in a room with that level of people and they were all absolutely lovely and kind.
“It was nice to know early in our careers that these people arent always intimidating.”
“[Benioff and Weiss] were always really caring, sending me an email after filming to say thanks.”
Too violent for the show
Two of the three human characters who feature in the Game of Thrones’ season one opening sequence bloodbath are struck dead, while the third is beheaded a scene later by King in the North, Ned Stark.
The same scene serves as the prologue to the first book of George RR Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series.
Ostlere highlights the significance of this standalone sequence.
“It felt like a short film because we were slightly separate from the Starks and everything going on in that area. The scene itself has its own beginning, middle and end and it almost comes across as a short horror film. 
“Us three, other than Bronson who goes on to get his head chopped off, had our own storyline and it’s really important for the rest of the show ongoing.”
As Ostlere alluded to, the show’s opening salvo does differ in tone from the rest of the show. Though blood and gore have become par for the course, the introduction of the white walkers is chilling.
Waymar Royce’s death scene for instance, features the sudden rise of a blue-eyed and white skinned walker, behind the unknowing Night’s Watchman, followed by the swing of a sword and the sudden cut of a scene.
The Night’s Watchman’s death scene was chilling (photo: HBO).
Ostlere reveals that this opening could have been even more chilling had his death taken place on screen.
“We filmed a couple of things that werent used. I get sliced in half for instance, but it was too graphic.”
Ostlere detailed the fascinating making of his off-screen death.
“They get a bit of green tape which they put across your body and then theres that horror movie type scenario where one half of your body goes one way and one half goes the other.
“You fall right first and then you fall the other way and then they put those two together in the studio. It was very fun filming it.”
Returning as a White Walker
Eight years on from Royce’s violent splitting, Game of Thrones has grown into arguably the most successful TV series of all time.
And Ostlere explains that even in its infancy there was a feeling among the acting community that the show would evolve into something special.
“People always say you never know if a show is going to blow up, but you did with Game of Thrones.
“When we were auditioning, it was apparent it was going to be one of the biggest shows on TV.
“There hadnt been anything of that genre or that scale on TV at that point and there was such a terrific story. There was this feeling that they werent scrimping and they were really taking care of everything.”
Despite his fleeting appearance, the actor still receives fan mail and memorabilia for signing, so hardcore is the show’s dedicated fan base.
And as the saying goes in Game of Thrones, “what is dead may never die” – so could fans expect Ostlere to make a return in the show’s approaching final season?
“I wish,” says Ostlere. “My agent probably said eight or nine years ago, ‘Maybe you can come back as a White Walker’ and obviously when I heard about the prequels I was like, ‘Oh my god maybe theyll do something immediately before Game of Thrones’but they havent opted for that.
“I will just be watching as a fan, which is also really nice.”

Daniel Tencer,"The diplomatic spat between Canada and China that broke out in the wake of the arrest of Huawei's CFO, Meng Wanzhou, could have an unexpected casualty: Vancouver's already struggling housing market. The tensions between the two countries could empty Vancouver of Chinese real estate investors, putting further downward pressure on the market, according to a recent research note at SmartKarma Insights. Existing Chinese migrants could ""reconsider their overall commitment to a Canada move for the extended family, as well as encouraging potential new China migrants to consider shifting migration patterns to more friendly climates,"" the report stated. Watch: This is Canada's most expensive condo. Story continues below. This could mean that ""Canada property price corrections in key markets might gain momentum,"" report author Charles De Trenck wrote. Many Chinese businesspeople are warned not to travel through the United States, and ""you might end up with guidelines that they shouldn't go through Canada either,"" De Trenck, a former China strategist for UBS Securities, told HuffPost Canada. Many Chinese nationals in Canada who work for Chinese firms may be worried that they could find themselves under arrest in the midst of the growing confrontation between the two countries, De Trenck added. Earlier on HuffPost Canada: Chinese investors have largely been seen as a major (though not the only) force driving up Vancouver's house prices in the past several decades. The city has had the dubious honour of being North America's least affordable housing market in recent years. But over the past two years Vancouver's housing market has seen a pronounced decline in interest from Chinese migrants, due to the foreign buyers tax the province introduced in 2016, and efforts by China's government to slow the flow of money out of the country. Home sales collapse With demand dwindling and mortgage rates on the rise, Greater Vancouver's housing market slumped to historic lows this year. Home sales dropped 42.5 per cent in November, compared to the same month a year earlier, the region's real estate board reported. It's the lowest sale count for a November since 2008. At just above $1.5 million, the benchmark price for a detached home was 6.5 per cent lower than a year earlier. Condo prices kept growing, however, up 2.3 per cent in a year to $667,800. Huawei's Meng and her family are investors in Vancouver real estate. In court hearings last week, it was revealed Meng's family owns two homes in the city, one in the ritzy Shaughnessy Heights neighbourhood and another on West 28th Ave. on the city's west side. The homes are estimated to have a combined value of $30 million.

Pallavi Ghosh,"The Congress will make the guarantee of national security its fulcrum for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections and the issue will find a mention in the partys manifesto as well.Top Congress sources have told News18 that ensuring speedy response to terror acts and providing martyr status for paramilitary forces who take the maximum and first hit during terror strikes such as Pulwama are some of the points expected to be incorporated in the manifesto.
The move comes after the Congress, within its quarters, admitted that the BJP had walked away with the edge post the Indian Air Force strikes on terror camps in Pakistans Balakot. Before the action, the Opposition was confident that the electorate was angry with unemployment. The Congress decided not to politicise the issue and back the government on the strikes but the moment it cited international media reports and began to ask for exact casualty figures, the BJP seized the opportunity and labelled the grand old party anti-national for questioning the armed forces. Many within the Congress feel that they had walked straight into the BJPs trap. 
 This is why the party did a rethink and Rahul Gandhi addressed a press conference over the Rafale issue, deciding that like the rest of the Opposition, it should focus on peoples issues. 
The Congress, however, is aware that national security as an issue cannot be ignored which is why Rahul has tried to turn the tables on the BJP by questioning the release of terrorist Masood Azhar.Sushmita Deb of the Congress said, When it comes to national security, our track record is better than that of the BJP. Parliament attack happened during their tenure. Whenever they are in power, attacks happen. We will always offer better security to people of India.
But is the promise of national security and swift response to terror an acknowledgment that the Congress was slow to act after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks? No, says former home minister and Congress leader RPN Singh. We had put all systems in place. We announced a bounty on Azhar and action against those involved.
Its clear that in election season, the Congress cannot run away from taking an anti-terror stand. Hence, they too are rushing in to project a muscular position.","As BJP Gains Edge With Post-Pulwama Action, Congress Strategy for 2019 Polls to Focus on National Securit...

"The Indianapolis Star, Shari Rudavsky, The Indianapolis Star","Why was it so important to find the wreckage of the ship sunk near the end of World War II, and why was it so hard to find? Channing King/IndyStar USS Indianapolis (CA-35), a Portland class heavy cruiser of the United States Navy. The ship was sunk by Japanese torpedoes on July 30, 1945. (U.S. Navy) (Photo: IndyStar file photo) INDIANAPOLIS — Accounts of how many people died in the sinking of the USS Indianapolis during World War II have long varied by one. Were there 1,195 sailors and Marines aboard the ill-fated ship — or 1,196? Did 879 men perish in the attack, in the water, or after rescue — or 880? Now two historians have collaborated on a paper that helps explain the discrepancy: One young man, sometimes included on the ship’s roster, did not actually sail on that fateful journey in July 1945, because of a last-minute change of plans. However, the paper finds, a record-keeping error led his name to appear on some versions of the passenger roster but not on the list of survivors, leading history to erroneously add a name to the roll of those whose lives were lost. More: Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen finds lost WWII ship USS Indianapolis More: Finally, some closure for USS Indianapolis survivor Co-authors Richard Hulver, a Naval History and Heritage Command historian, and Sara Vladic, a filmmaker and historian, cross-checked all the names associated with the Indianapolis to sort out the misunderstanding. They published their findings on March 20 in an issue of the U.S. Naval Institute’s Proceedings Today. In the paper, the two report that a Michigan couple was among the heartbroken who received news in mid-August 1945 that they had lost a son in the Japanese torpedo attack on the heavy cruiser on July 30. “To an outside observer, this small casualty discrepancy might seem insignificant. To survivors, descendants, friends and the Navy, it is not.” Historians Richard Hulver and Sara Vladic But Charles and Ruth Donnor had spoken with their son, Clarence, since that date and knew that he was actually alive, well, and in training in the United States. While they informed the Navy of its mistake immediately, the paper recounts, the clerical error persisted in some accounts, resulting in the confusion. Hulver and Vladic’s work will help set the record straight for posterity. They explain in their paper why they undertook their painstaking research. “To an outside observer, this small casualty discrepancy might seem insignificant,” they write. “To survivors, descendants, friends and the Navy, it is not.... This entire event shows the inherent difficulties in accounting for casualties in the fog of war.” So what did happen to young Donnor more than seven decades ago? Turns out that the radio technician second class had reported to duty on the ship before it sailed. He had been on board for about half an hour when his Pacific deployment was canceled and he was sent to an officer training program in New York. Donnor’s Navy career continued until a year after the war ended while he was stationed aboard the USS Chimariko. While the paper does not discuss the rest of his life, it does note that Clarence Donnor died on Feb. 1, 2002.

MARGARET COKER,"Three officials involved in the informal talks say they are discussing temporary arrangements to the most pressing issue for both sides: Control of Iraq’s Fish Khabbour border crossings with Turkey and Syria, where about one-fifth of Iraq’s oil exports pass through. The officials were granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic matter. This stab at conflict resolution illustrates the diffuse nature of Iraqi politics, where key power brokers sometimes have no formal or elected authority. It also highlights a dangerously fractured political spectrum in which elected officials can be eclipsed, sometimes by rival factions from within their party or even family. Photo Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi plants the national flag in the city of Qaim, on the Syrian border, on Nov. 5 after it was recaptured from the Islamic State. Credit Moadh Al-Dulaimi/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images While back-channel discussions have helped keep the border trade of oil, food, consumer goods between Turkey and Syria flowing — along with humanitarian aid from Iraq bound for Syria — over the last two weeks, they are far from any breakthrough. Diplomats say that Iraq’s tradition of carrying out delicate negotiations in secret, often by people acting well outside their official roles, can be baffling to outsiders. Graphic After Kurds voted overwhelming for independence in a referendum in September, Iraqi government forces have seized territory previously under Kurdish control. Riding a wave of victories over the Islamic State, Mr. Abadi ordered his troops in October to re-establish government control throughout the country. The independence referendum prompted him to include many areas long under Kurdish control. While no official casualty statistics have been released, about 65 men died in clashes sparked by these advances, according to two military commanders familiar with the situation. Beyond the loss of life, the Kurdistan Regional Government lost face over the rapid withdrawals by their pesh merga security forces. It also lost much of its oil fields to federal troops, and with them the economic self-sufficiency that has underpinned the region’s de facto autonomy since 2005. In late October, after advancing northward amid several short skirmishes, federal forces dug in about 10 miles from the Fish Khabbour oil terminal and the nearby cargo crossing with Turkey, one of the largest trading partners for both Iraq and the Kurdish region. With tensions boiling, Baghdad on Oct. 28 announced a cease-fire and a round of negotiations between Iraqi and Kurdish military commanders, ostensibly to allow federal forces to take over the border without further bloodshed. On Oct. 29, however, talks broke down, amid intransigence by the Kurds about the altered balance of power. “The talks mixed security and politics,” according to Sheikh Jafar Moustafa, a veteran pesh merga commander and one of four Kurdish negotiators, who added that his side did not have the political authority to approve any agreement with the Iraqis. Photo Fruits are loaded onto a truck for transport from Syria’s Kurdish area into Iraq’s Kurdish region last week. Credit Delil Souleiman/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images “We had to get political approval for any deal,” he said, “and no political decision was forthcoming.” At that point, the phone diplomacy increased among leaders like the Kurdish regional deputy prime minister, Qubad Talabani; Mr. Abadi’s deputy chief of staff; and Iraq’s intelligence chief. These relationships have helped avert any new clashes near the border, despite a buildup of Iraqi forces, and helped keep the trade corridor open and oil exports flowing, albeit at a reduced rate, according to Turkish and Iraqi officials. However, not all political factions in Baghdad or Kurdistan support de-escalation or a border deal. Those include Iraqi Shiite politicians close to the Popular Mobilization Forces, a paramilitary organization made up of dozens of militias recognized by the Iraqi state in 2014 as an auxiliary force to fight the Islamic State. Although the militias are under the formal command of Mr. Abadi, some of their leaders are his parliamentary rivals and profess close allegiance to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. On the Kurdish side, it is unclear who, exactly, could enforce any potential border compromise. Mansour Barzani, the son of the longtime Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani, commands an elite Kurdish security force that is defending a ridge between an Iraqi artillery unit and the Fish Khabbour border. Last week, he said he would fight to the death rather than allow the Iraqi federal troops to control the crossings. But a cousin, the regional prime minister Nerchivan Barzani, supports a negotiated deal. “Naturally when there is tension in the field and military confrontations take place, there are always needs to defuse such tensions,” said Safin Dizayee, a spokesman for Mr. Barzani. “The prime minister has, through various channels, maintained such contacts with the federal government,” he said, adding that the conversations “have helped create more understanding and build confidence.” Meanwhile, in the second largest Kurdish city, Sulimaniyah, relatives of the former Iraqi president Jalal Talabani, who died last month, are immersed in their own feuds over control of Mr. Talabani’s party and the security force loyal to it. Photo Mansour Barzani, a son of the longtime Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani, has vowed to fight to the death to prevent Iraqi troops from seizing the vital border crossings at Fish Khabbour. Credit Emrah Yorulmaz/Anadolu Agency, via Getty Images Such divisions have already scuttled one attempt to stave off military conflict between Baghdad and the Kurds. In the aftermath of the independence referendum, Mr. Talabani’s eldest son, Bafel, began unilateral negotiations with Mr. Abadi. (Qubad Talabani is Bafel’s brother.) Bafel Talabani, a British-educated Kurdish security commander who holds neither elected office nor a formal political role, said he took the initiative to counter what he saw as a firm determination by Baghdad to clip Iraqi Kurdistan’s autonomy. He proposed a plan that would have federal forces and troops from the American-led coalition against the Islamic State take over a large military base near the oil-rich town of Kirkuk, along with federal forces and Kurdish forces loyal to his father’s party. The Kurds had controlled the base since 2014, when Iraq’s army retreated during the Islamic State onslaught. Bafel Talabani said the base deal would have given Mr. Abadi a political win amid the nationalist fervor in Baghdad, as well as allow Kurds to keep a toehold in what to many leaders is an essential piece to their independence plans. Kirkuk is coveted by both Baghdad and the Kurds because of its strategic oil reserves. “It was a true compromise that would have saved lives,” Mr. Talabani said in a recent interview. An aide to Mr. Abadi, and two Western diplomats, confirmed that such a deal had been proposed. Mr. Abadi gave Mr. Talabani until Oct. 16 to get a green light from the Kurdish leadership to implement the plan, or he would launch the operation to seize the area from Kurdish control. Mr. Talabani said he could not build consensus among his father’s political party and the region’s ruling party, controlled by the Barzani family. With the deadline past, Mr. Abadi instead ordered the federal forces to push into Kirkuk, and then farther north toward the Turkish border. Follow Margaret Coker on Twitter: @nytmargaret.

Al Jazeera,"The US-backed Afghan government has lost control of a number of districts to the Taliban, while casualties among security forces have reached record levels, a US watchdog agency has said. The latest quarterly report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) underlines the heavy pressure on the government in Kabul even as the United States has opened initial contacts with the Taliban on possible peace talks. ""The control of Afghanistan's districts, population, and territory overall became more contested this quarter,"" the agency said in its report. The Taliban have still not succeeded in taking a major provincial centre despite assaults on Farah in western Afghanistan and Ghazni in the centre this year but they control large stretches of the countryside. Data from Afghanistan's NATO-led Resolute Support mission showed that government forces had ""failed to gain greater control or influence over districts, population, and territory this quarter"", the agency said. As of September, it said the government controlled or influenced territory with about 65 percent of the population, stable since October 2017, after a year of heavy fighting in Farah and Ghazni as well as other provinces like Faryab and Baghlan in the north. However, it reported that only 55.5 percent of the total 407 districts were under government control or influence - the lowest level since SIGAR began tracking district control in 2015. ""While the districts, territory, and population under insurgent control or influence also decreased slightly, the districts, territory, and population 'contested' - meaning under neither Afghan government nor insurgent control or influence - increased,"" it said. Six months before presidential elections, the figures are a sign of the degraded security situation in Afghanistan, even as the US special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, has met Taliban officials to map out possible peace talks. As the Taliban have kept up pressure on the government, SIGAR quoted the Resolute Support mission as saying the average number of casualties among Afghan security forces between May 1 and October 1 was ""the greatest it has ever been during like periods"". The Afghan government no longer releases exact casualty figures but this month General Joseph Votel, head of US Central Command, said Afghan casualties were increasing from last year and were an issue ""we are paying very, very close attention to"". The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), which has documented civilian casualties in Afghanistan since 2009, said in its latest October report that there were 8,050 civilian casualties during the first nine months of the year, including 313 deaths and 336 injuries caused by US and Afghan air attacks. The Taliban, who were removed from power by US-led forces in 2001, has been waging a bloody armed rebellion to defeat the Western-backed government in Kabul.","Government control falls to 55 percent of districts amid record casualty levels for Afghan forces, says US watchdog.",2018-11-01T10:42:31Z,"{'id': 'al-jazeera-english', 'name': 'Al Jazeera English'}",Afghan government continues to lose ground to Taliban: SIGAR,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/afghan-government-continues-lose-ground-taliban-sigar-181101082721510.html,https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/11/1/34d973f3b9f241b09ed507d2f1e988b5_18.jpg,al-jazeera-english,Al Jazeera English,casualty,1
Ashley Collman,"More than 30 people overdosed in New Haven, Connecticut on Wednesday, mostly on the city's green. WTNH A rash of overdoses swept New Haven, Connecticut on Wednesday morning, sending more than 30 people to the hospital. The majority of the calls came from the New Haven Green, where scores of people were found passed out on the ground or vomiting. Police believe that the synthetic marijuana K2 may be to blame. They say the K2 was likely laced with an opioid such as Fentanyl, since patients responded to larger-than-usual doses of the anti-overdose medication Narcan at the hospital. Others in the park told police that the K2 may have been laced with the hallucinogenic PCP. But investigators won't know for sure what sparked the overdoses until toxicology tests come back. Police believe the overdoses were caused by synthetic marijuana laced with Fentanyl. WTNH None of the patients have died. But one to two patients are in life-threatening condition, according to reports from WFSB and CNN. As of Wednesday afternoon, police told the Register that they had arrested a 37-year-old man in connection with the mass overdose incident. The ""person of interest"" — who is not being named yet — was known to police, had drugs on him, and was out on parole. The overdose outbreak started Tuesday night, when three people overdosed on the New Haven Green. But the bulk of calls started coming in just before 8 a.m. on Wednesday morning and continued for an hour. Throughout the rest of the day, there was a steady stream of patients, both in the park and other parts of the city. The Drug Enforcement Administration has been informed of the rash of overdoses. WFSB When ambulances were responding to the scene, they passed other passed-out victims on the ground. Some of the patients ended up overdosing twice. ""As we were trying to pick up from the upper green, we ended up with two additional victims on the lower green, one of which was a victim we had from this morning, so we're not sure if he used another substance of if there is a lingering effect of what he used earlier on,"" New Haven Fire Chief John Alston said, according to WFSB. YNNH Center for EMS Medical Director Sandy Bogucki told the New Haven Register that paramedics were having ""to run and then resuscitate and then having to transport faster than they might normally to turn around and get the cars back out."" According to the Register, as many as 39 overdoses happened in total. Of those, 34 were taken to the hospital and five refused treatment. One of the overdose calls actually came in as New Haven Police Chief Anthony Campbell was giving a press conference to update the public on the mass casualty incident.

Andy Kiersz,"Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. Frank Micelotta/Getty Images The internet has dramatically changed in the few decades of its existence, and a remark from an early Amazon shareholder letter provides an interesting view of just how many winners and losers the early tech boom created. In Amazon's first letter to shareholders after going public in 1997, among the many accomplishments CEO Jeff Bezos touted was that the company ""established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America Online, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy."" Twenty-one years later, Amazon stands tall as one of the largest companies in the world, with a market capitalization of around $900 billion dollars as of Wednesday evening. Meanwhile, the eight strategic partners on Bezos' list — all major players in the late 90s tech boom — no longer exist as independent entities, either going defunct in the years after the bubble burst or being acquired by other tech and telecommunications companies. Here's what happened to each of those companies: America Online, the king of the dial-up internet era, famously bought Time Warner at the height of the tech bubble in 2000, then the largest merger in history, according to a retrospective from The New York Times. Nine years later, the struggling company spun off AOL. In 2015, Verizon bought AOL and now operates AOL under its Oath subsidiary. Yahoo was one of the biggest web portals in the 90s. In 2017, Yahoo joined AOL when Verizon acquired the company's internet business for $4.5 billion and placed it under the Oath subsidiary. Excite was another popular web portal in the mid-90s. In 1999, Excite merged with another member of Bezos' list, the high-speed internet provider @home. Unfortunately, the combined company was a casualty of the dot-com bubble's popping, and the company filed for bankruptcy in 2001. Netscape published one of the most popular web browsers of the 1990s, and the predecessor to the Mozilla Firefox browser. In 2002, the company was purchased by America Online, and subsequently became a part of Verizon's Oath subsidiary, where it remains today. GeoCities was a popular early web-hosting service. GeoCities was purchased by Yahoo in 1999, and then shut down a decade later. AltaVista was an early search engine. After a series of deals during and after the dot-com bubble, AltaVista ended up being purchased by Yahoo in 2003. Yahoo shut the service down in 2013. @Home was a high-speed internet service provider in the 1990s. As mentioned above, the company merged with Excite, but then went bankrupt amid the dot-com bubble popping in 2001. Prodigy was an early internet service provider and competitor with America Online. In 2001, Prodigy was acquired by SBC Communications (now AT&amp;T).","Jeff Bezos ' first letter to Amazon shareholders after the company went public in 1997 included a list of ""important strategic partners"" for the nascent online bookseller.

Rachel Kraus,"The latest battle between arch-enemies Nancy Pelosi and Donald Trump could be the internet.
On Wednesday, Democratic legislators introduced a new bill in both the House and the Senate that would reinstate net neutrality. It's called the ""Save the Internet Act of 2019."" And, as articulated in the bill's just three pages, it would overturn the Trump FCC's rules that overturned the Obama-era FCC's net neutrality protections. And, it would task the FCC with protecting net neutrality across the country. 
Thanks to shifting tides of power in Congress, and the popularity of net neutrality amongst constituents of both parties, the bill could actually have a chance to pass through congress. But ultimately, Trump could be the one to pull the internet's plug.
SEE ALSO: Net neutrality rises from the dead, and the Trump administration isnt happy
First, let's talk about this bill's chances in Congress. In May 2018, three Senate Republicans crossed the aisle to vote with Democrats to overturn the FCC's ruling. After passing the Senate, that bill died in the House, where then speaker Paul Ryan refused to bring it to a vote. 
Last year, after the Senate voted to #SaveTheNet, Paul Ryan ran out the clock on #NetNeutrality in the House. This time, its our House. Today, Democrats in both the Senate and House are announcing the Save The Internet Act, and were going to send it to Donald Trumps desk.
 Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) March 6, 2019
But things are different now. The Democrats control the House of Representatives by a wide margin, so the bill should be able to pass there. But political demographics have changed in the Senate, too: the Republicans hold a stronger majority of 57-43, since Democrats lost two seats in the midterm elections.
The three Republican Senators who voted for the last net neutrality bill Susan Collins of Maine, John N. Kennedy of Louisiana, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are still in office. But there's no guarantee that they'll side with the Dems again. And, assuming all Senate democrats vote for the bill, they'll have to pick up another Republican to pass it. 
In Washington, the net neutrality issue often plays out along party lines, with Democrats seeking to codify net neutrality as the law of the land, so that ISPs can't charge different rates to access websites at certain speeds. Republicans have largely sided with ISPs, giving them more freedom to charge whatever they want. 
But amongst citizens, net neutrality is an issue that actually has a lot of popularity across party lines; according to a 2017 poll from the University of Maryland, 75 percent of Republicans, 89 percent of Democrats and 86 percent of independents were in favor of keeping the Obama-era net neutrality regulations in place. If Republican senators listen to their constituents, perhaps the bill could actually pass through Congress.
But that's where the big, orange obstacle that is President Trump comes in.
Trump weighed in on net neutrality before, displaying a very limited grasp of what the concept actually means but generally taking a stance against it. 
In 2014, he tweeted that the Obama-era FCC rules that protected net neutrality would ""target conservative media,"" and equated it with an unrelated concept. At a rally in 2015, he said he would ask Bill Gates, re ""the internet,"" about ""closing it up."" 
Obamas attack on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media.
 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2014
But his most definitive action came as president, when he appointed Ajit Pai, a known opponent of net neutrality, to the role of FCC chairman. In March 2017, Trump's administration clarified its stance on net neutrality: then Press Secretary Sean Spicer (miss u bb) announced the administration's ambition to overturn the Obama FCC's net neutrality rules. He said that Trump had pledged to reverse this overreach, characterizing the Obama-era rules as unnecessarily bureaucratic regulation that ""stifles American innovation, job creation and economic growth."" These are common arguments against net neutrality perpetuated by ISPs that have been shown to hold no water.
Trump has been no special friend to ISPs: a recent report divulged Trump's blatant attempt to block AT&amp;T from merging with Time Warner. But that was in retaliation for his anger at CNN, a Time Warner subsidiary not because he necessarily cares about ISPs. What's more likely guiding Trump is his good ol' strategy of If Obama Was For It, I'm Against It. Opposing his enemies has always been more meaningful for Trump than the actual issues.
And unfortunately, net neutrality could become a casualty in this petty war, if Trump lets his dismal understanding of tech issues, and his general hatred for Obama and Nancy Pelosi, guide his veto pen. Let's not let it.","The latest battle between arch-enemies Nancy Pelosi and Donald Trump could be the internet.

Daniel Chang,"Maddy Wilford, 17, is grateful to be alive after surviving three gunshot wounds from an AR-15 assault style rifle during the worst school shooting in Florida history at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland. The high school junior was shot in the stomach, right elbow and chest, and still carries pieces of metal in her body from the Feb. 14 mass shooting. Trauma surgeons at Broward Health North in Deerfield Beach performed three operations on her. She went home on Thursday, although she has weeks more of recovery ahead. She spoke publicly Monday for the first time. “I’m Madeline Wilford,” she said, then paused to compose herself. “I would just like to say that I’m so grateful to be here, and it wouldn’t be possible without those officers and first responders and these amazing doctors and especially all the love that everyone has sent.” She sat at a table at the hospital, flanked by her parents, Missy and David Wilford, along with surgeons from Broward Health North and the Coral Springs Fire Department paramedic who treated her at the scene. Maddy thanked the many well-wishers who have sent letters and gifts, “and just all the love that’s been passed around. I definitely wouldn’t be here without it,” she said. Doctors said the teenager’s recovery has been speedy: “Young people have a tendency to heal very fast,” said Dr. Igor Nichiporenko of Broward Health North, who operated on Maddy. She will still need four to six weeks to heal before she can begin occupational therapy to regain use of her right arm, which has tendon damage, the doctor said. He does not know whether she will be able to rejoin her teammates on the Stoneman Douglas basketball team, but Nichiporenko said Maddy should be well enough to return to school in about a week. The Wilfords did not take questions from media; it’s unknown whether Maddy plans to return to Stoneman Douglas. Broward school officials plan to re-open the school to students on Wednesday. In the nearly two weeks since 17 people were killed and at least 15 were wounded by the shooter on the Stoneman Douglas campus, the school’s students have reignited a national debate on gun control, speaking on TV news broadcasts, at funerals and at large rallies to spread their message that they do not feel safe in school. Maddy said she is proud of the way her classmates have stepped forward after the shooting. “Like my mom says, it’s times like these when we all need to stay together,” she said. “I’ve seen a lot of positive posts about what’s going on at school. I just love the fact that we’re sticking together after this.” To hear the paramedics and doctors tell their story of saving Maddy’s life, it was not always clear to them that the high school student would survive her injuries. The Coral Springs Fire Department had trained for mass casualty incidents in the past. But when the 911 call came in on Valentine’s Day that a mass shooting was unfolding at Stoneman Douglas, Lt. Laz Ojeda said he had a difficult time processing the information. “We were dumbfounded,” Ojeda said Monday. “We couldn’t believe it.” Ojeda and his team of five firefighter paramedics were the third rescue squad to arrive at the school in response to the shooting. He described the scene as “organized chaos” as police and other first responders flooded the school. Soon after Ojeda arrived, a policeman led him to Maddy, who lay on the ground bleeding. At first glance, Ojeda said, he could see that she had been shot through the side of her stomach and in the right elbow. She had a sucking chest wound. One of the bullets had pierced her lung. “At first sight it was believed that Maddy had deceased,” Ojeda said. “She looked very pale.” But a police officer with Ojeda checked Maddy for signs of life, Ojeda said, “and I believe she gasped or she moved, but she made signs of life.” Ojeda said a Broward Sheriff’s Office SWAT Team officer applied a chest seal and bandage to Maddy to stop the bleeding and apply pressure to the chest wound. “I’m not a doctor,” Ojeda said, “but in my estimation that chest seal prevented [the gunshot wound] from progressing and perhaps killing her.” But Ojeda’s quick thinking also may have saved Maddy’s life. Ojeda said the department's mass casualty incident plan called for Maddy to be taken to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, which is a Level I trauma center capable of dealing with more severe injuries than the Level II trauma center in Deerfield Beach. The hospital in Fort Lauderdale is about 30 miles from Stoneman Douglas. Broward Health North is about 12 miles away. “If we had gone 30 miles perhaps she wouldn’t have made it,” he said. Ojeda said he rubbed Maddy’s chest as she lay in the back of the ambulance and asked her age. She did not respond. He rubbed her chest again and repeated the question. Then she answered. “She said, ‘I’m 17,’” Ojeda said. That’s when the Coral Springs paramedics decided to take Maddy to Broward Health North in Deerfield Beach, which is closer to the school. “It might have saved her life,” Ojeda said. Nichiporenko, the trauma surgeon, said the teenager was in shock from losing so much blood when she arrived at the ER. “She was pale, not responsive,” Nichiporenko said. Surgeons performed damage control surgeries to drain fluid from her abdomen and to stem internal bleeding. Some of Maddy’s ribs also had been shattered from the gunshots, Nichiporenko said. Doctors performed three surgeries in a 40-hour period, he said. Maddy was hospitalized for about a week. Nichiporenko said the trauma team at Broward Health North sees gunshot victims “almost every other day,” but that the injuries Maddy sustained from an assault style weapon were much more severe than doctors are accustomed to seeing. An assault style weapon, Nichiporenko said, causes much more severe damage because the high-speed bullets cause waves that ripple and tear apart nearby soft tissue as they travel through the body. “We see more tissue damage” with assault style weapons, he said, “soft tissue and organ. She’s very, very lucky.” Nichiporenko said that when Maddy arrived in the emergency room, trauma surgeons were already working on three other patients who had been shot at Stoneman Douglas and were considered critical. In all, eight victims and the alleged shooter were taken to Broward Health North. Two died of their injuries, and one remains hospitalized in fair condition, said Jennifer Smith, communications director for Broward Health. Seven patients were transported to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, and two remain hospitalized in fair condition. Maddy’s speedy recovery has been a blessing for her family, said her father, David Wilford, who said he knew how lucky he was to have his daughter next to him when other parents had lost their children. He thanked the first responders and doctors for “the miracle that’s happened with her and the way that she’s been blessed.” Missy Wilford said Maddy is determined to recover and that she has been buoyed by her classmates, who have helped her “feel normal” after the shooting. “She knows who she is,” Missy Wilford said of Maddy. “She knows where she wants to go in life. That strength helps you heal.”","Miami Herald Stoneman Douglas teen shot three times: 'I'm so grateful to be here' Miami Herald Maddy Wilford, 17, is grateful to be alive after surviving three gunshot wounds from an AR-15 assault style rifle during the worst school shooting in Florida histor…",2018-02-26T18:15:58Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Miamiherald.com'}",Stoneman Douglas teen shot three times: 'I'm so grateful to be here' - Miami Herald,http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article202178544.html,http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/ip2y88-BrowHEalthsurvivor07EKM.JPG/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Brow+HEalth+survivor+07+EKM.JPG,,Miamiherald.com,casualty,1
Reuters,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Air strikes by a Saudi-led military coalition killed at least 20 people attending a wedding in a village in northwestern Yemen late on Sunday, residents and medical sources said. The head of Al Jumhouri hospital in Hajjah told Reuters by telephone that the hospital had received 40 bodies, most of them torn to pieces, and that 46 people had been injured, including 30 children, in air strikes that hit a wedding gathering. Residents and medics told Reuters that 20 people attending the celebration were killed and at least 30 injured. “We take this report very seriously and it will be fully investigated as all reports of this nature are,” a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition told Reuters. Residents of a village called Taiba elsewhere in the province told Reuters that a separate air strike killed a family of four in their house on Sunday night. The Western-backed alliance has been fighting a war for three years against the armed Houthi movement which controls the area and much of northern Yemen. It has launched thousands of air strikes in a campaign to restore the internationally recognized government. Errant strikes have killed hundreds of civilians at hospitals, schools and markets. Al-Masirah, the TV station of the armed Houthi movement which controls the area and much of northern Yemen, said on its Twitter account that 33 people had been killed and 55 wounded. The coalition says it does not target civilians and has set up an investigation committee into alleged mass casualty air strikes which have mostly cleared the coalition of any blame. The Yemen war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 2 million and driven the country to the verge of famine, according to the United Nations.

US Army US Army A day after assuming command in Afghanistan, Army Gen. Scott Miller issued condolences Monday for the death of a U.S. service member killed in what was believed to be yet another ""insider attack"" by Afghan security personnel or insurgents wearing their uniforms. ""Our duty now is to honor him, care for his family and continue our mission,"" Miller said in a statement issued by NATO's Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan. ""The sacrifice of our service member, who volunteered for a mission to Afghanistan to protect his country, is a tragic loss for all who knew and all who will now never know him."" The statement did not describe the circumstances of the attack or give a location beyond saying that it occurred in eastern Afghanistan on Sept. 3. A second U.S. service member was wounded in the incident and was in stable condition, NATO said. The identity of the fallen service member, the sixth killed in Afghanistan this year, will not be released until at least 24 hours after notification to next of kin, NATO said. The death of the U.S. service member came a day after the ceremony in Kabul on Sunday in which Miller assumed command of U.S. Forces-Afghanistan and the NATO Resolute Support mission from Army Gen. John Nicholson, who was leaving after 30 months as commander and is expected to retire. The death of the service member Monday was the second this year from an insider attack for U.S. forces. In July, 20-year-old Cpl. Joseph Maciel of South Gate, California, was killed and two other U.S. service members were wounded in an apparent insider attack in the Tarin Kowt district of Afghanistan's southcentral Uruzgan province. Maciel was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, at Fort Benning, Georgia. Coalition forces were targeted in four insider attacks last year, including one that killed three U.S soldiers in eastern Afghanistan, according to the Defense Department. According to the Modern War Institute at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, ""green on blue"" insider attacks since 2007 have resulted in the deaths of at least 157 coalition personnel, and the ""green on green"" deaths of at least 557 members of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF). The insider attacks peaked in 2012 with the beginning of major withdrawals of U.S. and coalition troops. From 2007-2012, insider attacks killed 52 U.S. troops and wounded 48, according to the Brookings Institution's Afghanistan Index. A total of more than 2,200 U.S. service members have died in Afghanistan since 2001. At the change of command ceremony Sunday, Miller, 57, a career Special Operations officer and West Point graduate, pledged to continue with the ""conditions-based"" strategy with no time limits emphasizing air power approved by President Donald Trump in August of 2017. Currently, there are about 15,000 U.S. and 6,400 NATO troops in Afghanistan. ""The world recognizes Afghanistan cannot be a safe haven for terrorism, the world recognizes that we cannot fail. I know this has been a long fight, and it has been generations for us, for the Afghan people,"" said Miller, who most recently led Joint Special Operations Command, upon taking command in Afghanistan. Miller was taking command amid renewed attacks by a resurgent Taliban and the continuing threat from the ISIS offshoot known as Islamic State-Khorasan Province, or ISIS-K. The Taliban recently rejected the offer of an extended ceasefire from Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. Ghani did not attend the change of command ceremony but met with Miller later Sunday at the presidential offices, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News. Ghani ""thanked Gen.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Paradise resident Sorrell Bobrink describes 'apocalyptic' scenes California's latest catastrophic wildfire, the Camp Fire, was impossible to outrun when it first began burning. Officials say winds caused the blaze to burn through 80 miles (128km) of Northern California's hillside in just one hour. So how can you escape such a blaze, and why is the western US state so susceptible to these deadly fires? What's the best way to escape a wildfire? Once evacuation orders are issued by local law enforcement, residents generally have hours to leave, Kathleen Schori, information officer for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) told the BBC. ""But in those initial stages of a fire, you may have minutes,"" she added. Fleeing in a vehicle is ideal as most wildfires cannot be outrun. But the Camp Fire's especially rapid spread, fuelled by high winds, made the situation even more dangerous. ""This fire moved so fast - I don't think anybody did anything wrong,"" Ms Schori says when asked whether those forced to abandon vehicles and escape on foot could have acted differently. ""During the initial phases, it was burning 80 miles in an hour."" She stressed the importance of following evacuation orders immediately, especially with fast-moving blazes. ""If you don't evacuate and it becomes a rescue situation, then our firefighters are taken away from the firefight and moved to the rescue."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Environmental conditions in California in recent years have made wildfires deadlier How do you fight a wildfire? Sometimes, you do fight fire with fire. In addition to old-fashioned water and flame retardant (delivered from ground-level and above the flames by aircraft), sometimes firefighters have to burn more to quell the flames. Intentionally burning areas around a wildfire can help starve the blaze and control its direction. Clearing out brush and flammable material from an area to create ""firebreaks"" is another way to achieve the same. ""Ninety-eight percent of fires are small and/or suppressed quickly,"" Prof David Peterson of the University of Washington, a former senior researcher with the US Forest Service told the BBC. ""The other 2% are very challenging when they get large, and are almost impossible to put out, at least until it rains."" Ms Schori of Cal Fire said that with wind-driven blazes like the Camp Fire, officials often have no choice but to wait for conditions to improve. ""There are never enough firefighters to combat a fire that's moving as fast as this was moving,"" she says. ""You have to deploy your resources on each side [of the fire] and continue to construct lines. And when that wind stops, then you can safely get in front it."" H ow do wildfires start? Officials define wildfires, or wildland fires, as any fire occurring on undeveloped land. Forest fires are uncontrolled wildfires burning in lands covered at least in part by timber or flammable vegetation. In nature, two things can spark wildfires: lava and lightning. According to the National Park Service, 90% of wildfires in the US are caused by humans - whether by unattended campfires, burning debris, cigarettes, or arson. About 2% of California's 2,816 wildfires in 2016 were caused by lightning, according to data from Cal Fire. The majority could be attributed to humans, though only 8% were caused by arson.

According to Prof Peterson, fires in the region have not necessarily increased in frequency in the last 100 years - but the area affected has. ""The area burned annually has been higher during the past 30 years or so,"" he told the BBC. ""It should be noted that 2% of fires burn 98% of the area."" In California, recent years have seen a combination of extremely high temperatures, strong winds, a long drought, and population growth causing lethal, fast-moving blazes. Last year, the state had over 9,500 wildfires that burned over a million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, and had the highest number of homes and buildings lost in one state. And straying away from natural burning cycles has also contributed to the lethality of recent fires, Prof Peterson says. Keeping fires from starting in Western forests has caused fuel to accumulate ""far beyond"" historical levels. ""Therefore, when fires occur they can burn hotter,"" he says. ""These high-intensity fires can cause rapid and in some cases long-term changes in vegetation, making it more difficult for the ecosystem to recover."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Many Californians have had to abandon vehicles and escape the flames on foot What about climate change? Prof Peterson says there is no hard evidence that climate change has affected US wildfires - yet. ""We expect that there will be significant effects in future decades as the climate continues to warm,"" he told the BBC. A warming climate, Prof Peterson explained, would increase the duration of the fire season, and more droughts would in turn create more wildfire fuel. Globally, the length of the wildfire season has already increased by nearly 19% between 1978 and 2013. ""By around 2050, fires may burn two to three times more area than they have historically."" How do homeowners pay for the damage? According to 2017 data from Verisk Analytics, 4.5 million US homes were in areas of high or extreme wildfire risk - and over 2 million of those homes were in California. Damage caused by wildfires has cost $5.1bn in the last decade, Verisk found. In California, homeowners who do not qualify for private insurance coverage can opt into a statewide pool, called the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plan. FAIR is comprised of all property and casualty insurers in California and is not run by a state agency.",Fires have claimed dozens of lives in California.

Christopher Simpson,"Stu Forster/Getty Images The line-up for the knockout phase of the 2018 World Cup is now complete, with Germany the biggest casualty to miss out. Some of the other traditional contenders failed to top their groups, though, so the draw has thrown up some tantalising fixtures for the next round. Here is the complete schedule for the Round of 16, including predictions for each game: Saturday 30 June 3 p.m. BST/10 a.m. ET France vs. Argentina: 2-1 7 p.m. BST/2 p.m. ET Uruguay vs. Portugal: 2-1 aet Sunday 1 July 3 p.m. BST/10 a.m. ET Spain vs. Russia: 3-1 7 p.m. BST/2 p.m. ET Croatia vs. Denmark: 2-0 Monday 2 July 3 p.m. BST/10 a.m. ET Brazil vs. Mexico: 2-1 7 p.m. BST/2 p.m. ET Belgium vs. Japan: 3-1 Tuesday 3 July 3 p.m. BST/10 a.m. ET Sweden vs. Switzerland: 1-1 aet, Sweden on penalties 7 p.m. BST/2 p.m. ET Colombia vs. England: 1-2 aet Spain vs. Russia Spain topped Group B, but the sacking of manager Julen Lopetegui looks to have taken its toll on La Roja. They repeatedly looked vulnerable at the back, so it was little surprise they shipped three goals against Portugal and two against Morocco. ESPN's David Cartlidge has not been impressed with them so far: David Cartlidge @davidjaca Every bit of vibrancy, versatility and end product that Lopetegui found has seemingly disintegrated. The Spain players managed the off-field situation but on it they're incapable of doing so. They need a leader. #ESP By contrast, the hosts surprised with wins in their first two matches having looked poor in the run-up to the tournament. Nevertheless, Spain —even with their problems — should have enough to win. Russia may have beaten Saudi Arabia and Egypt, but they failed to trouble Uruguay in their first real test. While they played for almost an hour with 10 men in that game, they were already 2-0 down before Igor Smolnikov left the pitch, so it's difficult to imagine them keeping Spain out. Brazil vs. Mexico Brazil secured their spot in the knockout phase with a 2-0 win over Serbia, having beaten Costa Rica by the same scoreline after drawing 1-1 with Switzerland in their opener. As Bleacher Report's Sam Tighe noted, they have looked stronger as the tournament has gone on: Sam Tighe @stighefootball FT: #SRB 0-2 #BRA. Brazil are growing into this #WorldCup. Neymar and Coutinho dazzled tonight, but Casemiro, Silva and Miranda very sturdy defensively. Brazil wobbled for a period but held on. Tadic looked dangerous, Mitrovic had his chances. After opening the scoring in Brazil's first two matches and setting up Paulinho to break the deadlock in the third, Philippe Coutinho has shown himself to be a key player for the Selecao: OptaJohan @OptaJohan 3 - Philippe Coutinho is the first player with a goal or assist in all 3 group stage games at the 2018 #WorldCup. Essential. https://t.co/iuwMG4Gh5w Neymar has struggled to show his best, but while he has often been wasteful in possession, he has also laid on plenty of opportunities for his team-mates, per football writer Rupert Fryer: Rupert Fryer @Rupert_Fryer Neymar lost possession 29 times tonight - 10 more than anyone else on the pitch. He has now lost it almost 20 times more than anyone else at the #WorldCup. Only Messi (20) has completed more than Neymar's 17 dribbles &amp;amp; nobody more than Neymar's 11 chances created. #HeWhoDares? https://t.co/Q1LvI7jf5H Mexico are deadly on the break thanks to the triple threat of Hirving Lozano, Javier Hernandez and Carlos Vela and they should have plenty of space in behind against Brazil, so they're not to be underestimated. The Selecao look able to win the tournament if they continue on their current trajectory, though. It's likely to be a close game and winning is hardly beyond El Tri, but the South American side should have the edge.","The line-up for the knockout phase of the 2018 World Cup is now complete, with Germany the biggest casualty to miss out...",2018-06-28T21:19:32Z,"{'id': 'bleacher-report', 'name': 'Bleacher Report'}",World Cup 2018 Knockout Stage: 2nd-Round Schedule and Bracket Predictions,https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2783367-world-cup-2018-knockout-stage-2nd-round-schedule-and-bracket-predictions,https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/749/845/hi-res-dfd5bf2314085caee70248728ab555b9_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75,bleacher-report,Bleacher Report,casualty,1
Zack Whittaker,"For ten days in March, millions were caught in the same massive spam campaign.
Each email looked like it came from someone the recipient knew: the spammer took stolen email addresses and passwords, quietly logged into their email account, scraped their recently sent emails and pushed out personalized emails to the recipient of that sent email with a link to a fake site pushing a weight loss pill or a bitcoin scam.
The emails were so convincing more than 100,000 people clicked through.
We know this because a security researcher found the server leaking the entire operation. The spammer had forgotten to set a password.
Security researcher Bob Diachenko found the leaking data and with help from TechCrunch analyzed the server. At the time of the discovery, the spammer’s rig was no longer running. It had done its job, and the spammer had likely moved onto another server likely in an effort to avoid getting blacklisted by anti-spam providers. But the server was primed to start spamming again.
Given there were more than three million unique exposed credentials sitting on this spammer’s server, we wanted to secure the data as soon as possible. With no contact information for the spammer surprise, surprise we asked the hosting provider, Awknet, to pull the server offline. Within a few hours of making contact, the provider nullrouted the server, forcing all its network traffic into a sinkhole.
TechCrunch provided a copy of the database to Troy Hunt. Anyone can now check breach notification site Have I Been Pwned to see if their email was misused.
But the dormant server while it was still active offered a rare opportunity to understand how a spam operation works.
The one thing we didn’t have was the spam email itself. We reached out to dozens of people to ask about the email they received. Two replied but only one still had a copy of the email.
The email sent by the spammer. (Image: supplied)
“The same mail appeared on three occasions,” said one of the recipients in an email to TechCrunch. “The subject was related to an email I had sent previously to that person so the attacker had clearly got access to his mailbox or the mail server,” the victim said.
The email, when clicked, would direct the recipient through several websites in quick succession to determine where they were located, based off their IP address. If the recipient was in the U.S., they’d be pushed to a fake CNN site promoting a bogus health remedy. In this case, the spammer was targeting U.K. residents and most were directed to a fake BBC page promoting a bitcoin scam.
One of the fake page.s (Screenshot: TechCrunch)
The spammer had other servers that we had no visibility into, but the exposed server revealed many of the cogs and machinery to the operation. The server, running an Elasticsearch database, was well-documented enough that we found one of the three spam emails sent to our recipient.
This entry alone tells us a lot about how the spam operation worked.
A database record of one email sent by the spammer. (Screenshot: TechCrunch)
Here’s how it works. The spammer logs into a victim’s @btinternet.com email account using their stolen email address and password. The scammer pulls a recently sent email from their victim’s email server, which feeds into another server like inbox87.host and viewmsgcs.live tasked with generating the personalized spam email. That email incorporates the subject line of the sent email and the target recipient’s email address to make it look like it’s being sent from the real person.
Once the message is ready to send, it’s pushed through a proxy connection, designed to mask where the email has come from. The proxy server is made up of several cell phones, each connecting to the internet over their cellular connection.
Each spam message is routed through one of the phones, which occasionally rotates its IP address to prevent detection or being flagged as a spammer.
Here’s what that proxy server looks like.
The proxy server comprised of several cell phones with rotating IP addresses. (Screenshot: TechCrunch)
Once the spam message leaves the proxy server, the spam message is pushed through the victim’s own email provider using their email address and password, making it look like a genuine email to both the email provider and the recipient.
Now imagine that hundreds of times a second.
Not only was the spammer’s Elasticsearch database leaking, its Kibana user interface was also exposed. That gave the spammer a detailed at-a-glance look at the operation in action. It was so granular that you could see which spam-sending domains were the most efficient in tricking a recipient into clicking the link in the spam email.
The spammer’s Kibana dashboard, displaying the operation at a glance. (Screenshot: TechCrunch)
Each spam email includes a tracker in the link that fed information back to the spammer. In bulk, that allows the spammer to figure out which email domain like outlook.com or yahoo.com users is more likely to click on a spam email. That can also indicate how an email provider’s spam filter acts. The greater number of clicks, the more likelihood of its spam going through allowing the spammer to target specific email domains in the future.
The dashboard also contained other information related to the spam campaign, such as how many emails were successfully sent and how many bounced. That helps the spammer home in on the most valuable logins in the future, allowing them to send more spam for lower bandwidth and server costs.
In all, some 5.1 million emails were sent during the 10-day campaign between March 8 and March 18, with some 162,980 people clicking on the spam email, according to the data on the dashboard.
It’s not the first time we’ve seen a spam operation in action, but it’s rare to see how successful it is.
“This case reminds me on several other occasions I reported at some points in the past when malicious actors create a sophisticated system of proxying and logging, leaving so much tracks to identify their patterns for authorities in the investigations to come,” Diachenko told TechCrunch. “This shows us again! how important a proper cyber hygiene should be.”
What’s clear is that the spammer knows how to cover their tracks.
The language settings in the Kibana instance suggested the spammer may be based in Belgium. We found several other associated spamming domains using data collected by RiskIQ, a cyberthreat intelligence firm, which scours the web for information. Of the domains we found, all were registered with fake names and addresses.
As for the server itself, the provider said it was possibly hacked.
“This was a resold box and the customer already responded to the abuse forward saying it was supposed to have been terminated long ago,” said Awknet’s Justin Robertson in an email to TechCrunch.
Since the hosting provider pulled the spammer’s server offline, several of their fake sites and domains associated with the spam campaign no longer load.
But given the spread of domains and servers propping up the campaign, we suspect the sunken server is only a single casualty in an otherwise ongoing spam campaign.

Kieran Corcoran,"Grenfell Tower. Natalie Oxford/PA Wire London's Met Police have a final death toll for the devastating fire in west London. They say they found 70 bodies, and are also counting a stillborn baby. It has taken almost five months for officers to reach the figure. Police investigating the Grenfell Tower fire have announced what they believe is a final death toll from the disaster — 71. In a press release published Thursday morning, the Metropolitan Police said they have scoured every flat on every floor of the 24-storey high rise in west London. After sifting through 15.5 tonnes of debris, officers are ""confident"" they have found all the human remains they are likely to find in the tower, which caught fire five months ago in the early hours of June 14. Coroners — the officials charged with handling unusual deaths — have formally identified the remains of 70 people presented to them by the police. A baby who was delivered stillborn shortly after its mother escaped the building is also being counted as a casualty from the fire. Shifting totals Officers say they initially thought the toll was higher — around 80 — but later discovered that some people who they feared were inside when the building caught fire were actually not at home. Police say they used video footage from CCTV and police body-worn cameras to count people out of the burning building. Officers verified 223 people leaving Grenfell Tower, and therefore believe that there were 293 people inside when the fire began. An investigator searches a burnt-out Grenfell apartment. Reuters The Met described an extensive process of elimination which allowed them to whittle down a list of around 400 potential missing people to the 223 escapees and 71 dead. Duplicates, typos and frauds Many reports were duplicates, they said, including one person who had been reported missing 46 separate times. Some reports were of people who were away from home, while some reports were duplicates which used minor variations in spelling names, which could be eliminated. They also said some people lied to them about having relatives who had vanished in the fire, in the hope of claiming relief money. One man has already pleaded guilty to fraud, while police say several more cases are being investigated. The release concluded that ""Police are now confident [those reported missing] have all been traced and accounted for."" In June, just two weeks after the fire, police warned that it would take them many months to reach a total. At a media briefing attended by Business Insider, a senior officer said there might not be a final figure until 2018. Today's statement shows that the work appears to have been completed slightly faster than anticipated. Five months on, Grenfell Tower itself still stands as a stark monument in west London, visible for miles around. Last month scaffolding was erected around it to cover up some evidence of the fire damage. A crane helps erect scaffolding around Grenfell Tower in October.

Kirsten Acuna,"Bertie has low-key been killing it on ""The Walking Dead."" AMC Warning: There are spoilers ahead for Sunday's episode of ""The Walking Dead,"" ""Do Not Send Us Astray."" We need to talk about Bertie on "" The Walking Dead."" If that name doesn't ring a bell, the character is one of the Hilltop survivors who has been lurking in the background since the end of season six. Bertie (Karen Ceesay) almost met her end on Sunday's episode when a zombified Tobin went on the attack. If she bit the dust, most viewers probably wouldn't have blinked an eye. She would have looked like another background casualty. But there's a reason Bertie was saved at the last minute by Carol. The first time we saw Bertie was on season six, episode 11. Since then, she's become one of the most important background characters on the show. AMC While Morgan is out here losing his mind and Rick and Negan are brawling in a zombie-infested den like children, Bertie has played a small, but significant role in seven episodes of the series. Sometimes she speaks. Sometimes she just shows up for a brief few moments in the background. But every time Bertie shows up, she's keeping the Hilltop in line with Maggie. If you go back and follow her story arc, you'd see how important she's been in the fight against Negan's Saviors. The first time we saw Bertie was on season six when she and a few members of the Hilltop were being saved by Rick's crew. They were then brought back to their community. The next time we saw Bertie on season seven, she spoke up for the community and told Maggie they wanted to help in the fight against Negan. Several episodes later, we saw her learning how to throw a knife and protect and defend the community. We assume there was some other training Bertie excelled at because the next time we see her on the season seven finale, she's at the front of the line with Maggie and Enid firing at Saviors. Bertie is at the front of the Hilltop survivors learning how to throw a knife. AMC This season, Bertie helped armor vehicles heading to the Sanctuary on the show's premiere. Though we didn't see her, we learn she has been keeping track of the food inventory at the Hilltop. Maggie's alerted that she needs to cut rations by a third before Georgie shows up to bless the group with a generous donation of her food supply. Sunday's episode shows more of Bertie than we have seen in a long time. She's among the survivors sent out to give a warning for when the Saviors are about to approach the Hilltop. It would probably be less than five minutes long, but if someone put together every scene with Bertie in it, you'd see a clip of a woman helping lead and protect a community. Here she is on the season seven finale fighting alongside Maggie. AMC We almost lost Bertie Sunday and it would have been a hit to the Hilltop. She's one of Maggie's right-hand women. And from the looks of it, Maggie can use a few more level-headed women like her and Dianne by her side. So let's get some more time with Bertie. She seems to have it more together than Rick, Daryl, and Tara, and certainly moreso than Morgan who's too busy seeing things.

JONATHAN WOLFE,"New York Today The scene at the Port Authority on Monday. Credit Jeenah Moon for The New York Times Good morning on this frigid Wednesday. It’s becoming a familiar procedure in New York: Prosecutors file charges against an accused terrorist with local ties days, or even hours, after an attack. Yesterday, it happened in the case of Akayed Ullah, who told investigators that he had built a bomb, strapped it to his chest and detonated it in a subway corridor on Monday. “I did it for the Islamic State,” he told them. It was the city’s second attack in six weeks. In an era when attacks often spawn not from inside terrorist groups, but from people inspired or guided by them from afar, how can law enforcement keep the city safe? We asked Mike O’Neil, a former commanding officer of the New York Police Department’s counterterrorism division and the chief executive of MSA Security. How can we prevent lone-wolf attacks in New York City? “The scary part about a homegrown, lone-wolf radical threat is that it’s hard to deal with,” Mr. O’Neil said. Because attacks are increasingly carried out with vehicles and homemade bombs, preventing them calls for a collective effort between law enforcement and the community, he added. “The only way you can really attack it is by having an informed public who sees and reports suspicious behavior, and law enforcement that’s present on location that hopefully can engage attacks before they happen.” What is a realistic goal? Mr. O’Neil said that “I’d be lying to you if I said they’re going to stop every single attack,” especially ones using simple improvised explosive devices. “What are you going to do, outlaw match heads?” The best option, he repeated, was citizens working together with the police to keep an eye out. “We’re doing everything in our power to stop this, but we need you to help us with this.” How can members of law enforcement improve their counterterrorism operations? A common theme in recent attacks, Mr. O’Neil said, was the internet’s role in radicalizing attackers and teaching them to make bombs. “We need to work with online companies to try and pull this material off the internet,” he said. “And that should be an effort by the national government. Those are the things, from a law-enforcement standpoint, that they really need to attack aggressively that in my opinion they probably haven’t done in the last decade or so.” Is there a danger in overreacting to a terrorist attack? Mr. O’Neil lauded the decision not to close the subways after Monday’s attack, but said that evacuating the Port Authority, while necessary, created a new risk. “What you saw happen on Monday was thousands of people crowding into Penn Station. If you want to talk about a target of opportunity, you have a mass casualty target right there.” The challenge for law enforcement, he added, is making life-or-death decisions in mere minutes. “The real simple answer,” he said, “is you don’t act out of emotion.” Here’s what else is happening: It’s f-f-f-freezing cold today. The high will barely crawl above 32, but it’s going to feel more like a hair-raisingly chilly 10 to 20 with the wind. Layer on a warm sweater and jacket, and hang on to your earmuffs — it’s going to be very gusty. • Akayed Ullah, the suspect in Monday’s subway bombing, lived a life divided between Bangladesh and Brooklyn.
