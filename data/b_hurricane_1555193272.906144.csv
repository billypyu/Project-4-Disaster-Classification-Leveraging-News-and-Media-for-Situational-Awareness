Adam Rogers,"It wasnt a whodunnit. Last years unprecedented rainfall and flooding in Houston were the proximate result of Hurricane Harvey, a massive storm born northeast of Venezuela and reborn in the Gulf of Mexico, where it rapidly intensified, made landfall over Houston, and then stayedparked, as it were, for five days. Harvey was, however, something of a why dunnit. Why did the storm drop more than four feet of rain on the city? Hurricane-climate-change-planet-on-fire, yes, stipulated. But new research suggests that the fault was not only in our meteorology, but ourselves. The citythe fact of its city-ness, of its raw Houstonosity, may well have made Harveys rainfall worse. And the implications for coastal cities in a Burning World are, at minimum, very wet. Hurricane Harveys hardly ever happen over Houston, one might sayin the late 20th century it wouldve been a 2,000-year storm. In 2017, Harvey was six times more likely. Climate change theory also predicts more rapidly intensifying hurricanes that move more slowly and drop more rainjust like you-know-who. This is thanks to humans burning carbon-based fuel and coughing the leftovers into the atmosphere. Very bad! Look at what you did! Bad! No more treats. Cities around the world are getting bigger, especially along the coasts. Just a shade more than one percent of the continental United States is city, but its where a vastly greater proportion of people live, and the land dedicated to cities is only going to expand. That land use has a disproportionate effect on climate and ecosystems. Paved ground is mostly impervious to water, an impermeable surface between earth and sky, which means water that falls on it as rain or snow has to run off and away, somehowcities are, in their deep souls, machines for moving fresh water in and used water out. Something like 35 percent of precipitated water turns into runoff in a city, versus 15 percent over unpaved land. Thats why flash floods are more likely in cities. Another consequence of city building is the so-called urban heat island effect. The air over cities is hotter than over not-cities, changing atmospheric circulation patterns. It seems like urban heat islands have even caused or worsened thunderstorms over cities, including a particularly bad cluster in Beijing in 2006. Still, though, Harvey was so extreme that it warrants more running of the numbers. There was nothing looking at how the urban area interacts with a tropical cyclone or a hurricanethe role of the city, not just from a hydrologic or meteorological perspective, but both, says Gabriele Villarini, a civil engineer at the University of Iowa. We said, what if we replaced the urban area of Houston with cropland? Using a system called the Weather Research and Forecasting model to simulate climate and its changes over a region (as opposed to models with lower resolution but wider geographic scope), thats actually possible. The WRF includes a parameter for land use; in a paper in Nature today, Villarinis team tweaks that knob between cropland and Houston, and runs Harvey again and again. More specifically, they ran the model with all of Harveys observed initial conditions, to see if their simulated cyber-Harvey acted like the real deal over a Houston modeled with low- and high-density residential areas along with denser commercial spaces. The digital storm broadly did what the real one did; it rained hard. Then Villarinis team razed the digital city and replaced it with sylvan cropland, and let Harvey unfold again. Total rainfall went down by almost two feet in some parts of town, or what wouldve been town. We were able to quantify the enhancement due to the urban areas. Then the question was, OK, why? Villarini says. What we found is that there is a role due to urban roughness. As the flow from the storm approaches the city, it becomes rougher, the buildings and overall footprint. That roughness, an increase in drag, grabs the storm from the sky, like a person in socks skidding across a hardwood floor suddenly meeting a shag carpet. Coupled with the urban heat island effect, that slowdown pushes the bottom of the boundary layerthe part of the atmosphere in contact with the groundupward. Updrafts increase. Airflow converged more upstream of the city, in this case Houstons east side. These are all ingredients for heavy precipitation, Villarini says. What you might then ask is, thats fine for a simulated city and simulated crops, but what exactly is it about a city thats increasing the roughness? Tall buildings or sprawly, low strip malls and housing developments? Nobodys sure. Its true that forested landtall treeshave an overall drag coefficient somewhere between city and farm. Buildings with different shapes, at different angles versus the oncoming wind, change a citys overall drag coefficient. Was it a special combination of Houston and Harvey? Was it about Houston? Was it about Harvey? Villarini says. I dont know how these results translate to other areas. It would also depend on where a storm made landfall and its intensity. Cities, then, affect their own weather in complicated ways. Last year, researchers correlated rainfall and air pollution across China for the last seven decades, and found that urban pollution particularly made for more rain. So the Villarini group's finding came as something of a validation to Xuemei Bai, an urban sustainability researcher at Australian National University who worked on that China study. ""This is an important study that uses a physical model to establish urbanization can exacerbate heavy rainfall,"" she says. ""The fact that this [new paper] is dealing with one of the most well-known flooding episodes really strengthens its communication power."" Its also a new way to think about cities and hurricanes, specifically. This is, as far as I know, a new result and, as the authors point out, has important implications for urban planning, says Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at MIT who specializes in hurricanes. Teasing those implications out will have to come next. Climate theory takes as fairly certain, now, that denser, taller cities emit less carbon than sprawling, flat ones. But what if they also exacerbate rainfall? Urban planners are already trying to account for sea level rise and the kind of flooding that happens when storm surges meet runoff in aging city sewer systems; Villarinis finding says that the literal shape of the city itself is a factor in the weather it encounters. Climate scientists are already mounting the evidence that human behavior has exacerbated hurricanes. In another article in the same issue of Nature, researchers used the same WRF model as Villarinis team to tease out the anthropogenic influence on a few big hurricanesthe degree to which the carbon we humans emitted made the storms worse. Hurricane season last year killed at least 251 peopleprobably more, but its hard to know because of the Puerto Rico undercountand caused $265 billion in damages. The question remains: Why? Why did it get so bad? The scientists took three iconic hurricanesKatrina, Irma, and Mariaand ran simulated versions of them against two sets of conditions: a pre-industrial, non-globally warmed climate (for comparison to what actually happened) and three post-globally warmed futures of varying severity. And as theory said it would, climate change increased all three storms rainfall, and the effect increased with future warming. The same thing happened with 12 other modeled hurricanes as well. We see the majority of the 15 events becoming stronger in terms of wind speed and producing substantial increases in rainfall, says Christina Patricola, an atmospheric scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Its not great news. That bad news does help solve the mysteries remaining. Scientists are pretty sure whos responsible for making hurricanes worseits you, me, and the governments and corporations around us. Theyre learning the why and the how, even if it might feel improbable that people will be able to reimagine a society to stave off the worst impacts of climate change. Theyll have to. As a great detective once said, when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remainshowever improbablemust be the truth.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"There is only so much time for forecasters and emergency managers to prepare for the next hurricane season that begins in June, said Eric Blake, a hurricane specialist and union steward at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
You cant change the date of hurricane season. Thats what were running up against, said Mr. Blake, who has been working without pay during the shutdown. You lose those weeks.
Day-to-day weather forecasting has not stopped during the shutdown. But instead of spending time integrating new data sources into existing forecasting models, to try to improve their accuracy in measuring a storms track and intensity, most researchers have been furloughed, Mr. Blake said. A significant upgrade to the Global Forecast System model scheduled for completion by the end of March appears likely to be delayed.
Julie Kay Roberts, a spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which houses the National Hurricane Center and other government agencies involved in weather forecasting, said the upgrade required about 50 more days of work.
NOAA will resume implementation work on this upgrade when appropriations are restored, she said in a statement, adding that the existing model will continue to run operationally with no degradation to performance or skill.
As we near the beginning of hurricane season in May, we will ensure all necessary preparation has taken place, Ms. Roberts said.
But before hurricane season, Mr. Reaves said, spring floods and tornadoes can wreak destruction in other regions of the country. Mr. Reaves, who is based in Fort Worth, Tex., also said that rescheduling training sessions and certification courses for emergency workers may be difficult. In some cases, as for firefighters, national certification is tied to particular federal funding for local agencies.","Damage caused by Hurricane Michael in Lynn Haven, Fla., in October.

Devin Coldewey,"That most famous characterization of the complexity causality, a butterfly beating its wings and causing a hurricane on the other side of the world, is thought-provoking but ultimately not helpful. What we really need is to look at a hurricane and figure out which butterfly caused it or perhaps stop it before it takes flight in the first place. DARPA thinks AI should be able to do just that.
A new program at the research agency is aimed at creating a machine learning system that can sift through the innumerable events and pieces of media generated every day and identify any threads of connection or narrative in them. It’s called KAIROS: Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence Reasoning Over Schemas.
“Schema” in this case has a very specific meaning. It’s the idea of a basic process humans use to understand the world around them by creating little stories of interlinked events. For instance when you buy something at a store, you know that you generally walk into the store, select an item, bring it to the cashier, who scans it, then you pay in some way, and then leave the store. This “buying something” process is a schema we all recognize, and could of course have schemas within it (selecting a product; payment process) or be part of another schema (gift giving; home cooking).
Although these are easily imagined inside our heads, they’re surprisingly difficult to define formally in such a way that a computer system would be able to understand. They’re familiar to us from long use and understanding, but they’re not immediately obvious or rule-bound, like how an apple will fall downwards from a tree at a constant acceleration.
And the more data there are, the more difficult it is to define. Buying something is comparatively simple, but how do you create a schema for recognizing a cold war, or a bear market? That’s what DARPA wants to look into.
“The process of uncovering relevant connections across mountains of information and the static elements that they underlie requires temporal information and event patterns, which can be difficult to capture at scale with currently available tools and systems, said DARPA program manager Boyan Onyshkevych in a news release.
KAIROS, the agency said, “aims to develop a semi-automated system capable of identifying and drawing correlations between seemingly unrelated events or data, helping to inform or create broad narratives about the world around us.”
How? Well, they have a general idea but they’re looking for expertise. The problem, they note, is that schemas currently have to be laboriously defined and checked by humans. At that point you might as well inspect the information yourself. So the KAIROS program aims to have the AI teach itself.
At first the system will be limited to ingesting data in massive quantities to build a library of basic schemas. By reading books, watching news reports, and so on it should be able to create a laundry list of suspected schemas, like those mentioned above. It might even get a hint of larger, more hazy schemas that it can’t quite put its virtual finger on love, racism, income disparity, etc and how others might fit into them and each other.
Next it will be allowed to look at complex real-world data and attempt to extract events and narratives based on the schemas it has created.
The military and defense applications are fairly obvious: imagine a system that took in all news and social media posts and informed its administrators that it seemed likely there would be a run on banks, or a coup, or a new faction emerging from a declining one. Intelligence officers do their best to perform this task now, and human involvement will almost certainly never cease, but they would likely appreciate a computer companion saying, “there are multiple reports of stockpiling, and these articles on chemical warfare are being shared widely, this could point to rumors of terrorist attack” or the like.
Of course at this point it is all purely theoretical, but that’s why DARPA is looking into it: the agency’s raison d’etre is to turn the theoretical into the practical, or failing that, at least find out why they can’t. Given the extreme simplicity of most AI systems these days it’s hard to imagine one as sophisticated as they clearly want to create. Clearly we have a long way to go.","That most famous characterization of the complexity causality, a butterfly beating its wings and causing a hurricane on the other side of the world, is thought-provoking but ultimately not helpful.

Chris Jones,"On August 24 at 8:20 pm, a 44-year-old moonlighting meteorologist named Eric Berger was nearly finished writing a post for his Houston-centric blog, Space City Weather, titled “ Harvey Late Night: Some Final Thursday Thoughts.” He was in his home office. He had just poured himself a glass of cabernet. He had been looking at the online forecasts from the National Hurricane Center and agreed with their essential conclusions: Harvey was a well-­organized storm that would land with hurricane force on the Texas Gulf Coast somewhere between Corpus Christi and Port O’Connor. Berger also backed the center’s belief that the winds would be strong in Houston that weekend, perhaps more than 40 miles per hour. But he was far more worried about the rain. The unanswered question is what happens to Harvey once it reaches the coast, Berger wrote. Where will it go, and will it go fast enough? Houston’s rainfall totals over the next five days depend on this, and we just don’t know. The considerable majority of modern weather forecasting is aided by computer algorithm. Most hurricane tracking relies on data crunched by various public and private computer models, and the models, which take different variables (temperature, moisture, mass) and consider them in different ways, are not always in agreement. The National Hurricane Center takes input from several models to make its predictions, averaging out their differences, in part because it faces the tallest order in hurricane forecasting: It must say that the hurricane will go here. So must television meteorologists, one of the center’s principal conduits to a concerned public. TV, too, demands a singular answer. Berger doesn’t have to draw a line. He is a certified meteorologist, but the weather is just a particularly absorbing hobby of his; his primary paying gig is writing about aerospace for Ars Technica (a site owned by WIRED Media Group), and he blogs about the weather in his free time. That gives him two luxuries that most front-line meteorologists don’t have: He can value certain models and their ensembles much more heavily than others, untangling as many as 50 different versions of each forecast, and he can also admit doubt. He can explore the subtlety of the weather, marveling at its mysteries, the way he has for his small but loyal community of readers for years, but especially since he established his site in October 2015. Berger does not generate his forecasts from scratch, pointing his licked finger into the wind and taking readings from the Galileo thermometer on his windowsill. He really does have a Galileo thermometer on his windowsill, but he works out of a home office that he hasn’t otherwise bothered to decorate, with a basic PC and a single monitor on which he toggles between tabs, from forecast to conflicting forecast. In Houston that evening, the US government forecast called for about 15 inches of rain. By then Berger had already begun to wonder. There is one model he has come to trust and rely on more than any other: the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts’ Integrated Forecasting System, more popularly known in the US as the European model. Funded by 22 EU members and 12 cooperating states, the European model is sometimes shockingly accurate, in part because it’s so well financed and its computing power is stronger than most. With Harvey, it suggested that the storm would stall over Houston, dumping 25 inches of rain or more before eventually moving on. That synced with Berger’s own analysis of the weather patterns in the atmosphere. He detected a troublesome absence of steering currents, the forces that push hurricanes to wherever they’re headed next, and without those currents, the European model’s forecast of a stall made a lot of sense. Given the sum of the evidence before him, Berger felt confident in one fearsome prediction, and he wrote as much: Big-time floods are coming to Texas. It was, at its essence, an informed gut call, and Berger thought carefully about what he would write next. He had made his reputation, such as it was for a leisure-­time meteorologist with a city-specific weather blog, by refusing to submit to the hysterical frenzies that competent weather observers dismiss as “storm porn.” He is by nature a fairly skeptical person. His twin passions, space and the weather, share long histories of broken promises and unmet expectations. His site’s motto is “Hype-free forecasts for greater Houston,” mindful of the chaotic and ultimately unnecessary evacuations prompted by Hurricane Rita in 2005. I am not going to sugar-coat this, my friends, he had written in advance of that storm. As a Houston resident and property owner, I am truly mortified right now. Rita and Berger had both missed. But underplaying weather of dire consequences could lead to a different kind of calamity for his readers. James Spann, Alabama’s longtime weather forecaster of choice, had infamously botched that state’s ice storms of January 2014. Spann had predicted a “dusting” of snow, and unworried commuters headed out on the roads; when that dusting turned out to be a thick layer of ice, Spann shouldered much of the blame for the thousands of people who ended up stranded in their cars, schools, and workplaces overnight. Berger despises alarmism in all its forms. He also didn’t want to bear responsibility for children drowning in their attics. Berger’s wife, Amanda, was getting their own two daughters ready for bed in their League City apartment, temporary accommodations while the family builds their dream home in nearby Clear Creek. His dog, Bonnie, a Maltese-­poodle cross who dislikes all men but him, kept her usual vigilant watch. Berger can be painfully shy. Now he felt possessed by an unusual authority, exercised remotely through the digitally transmitted written word. He took another sip of his wine and returned to his keyboard. Certainly the Corpus Christi area and points immediately north and west of there will get too much rain, he wrote. Flooding will spread to other parts of Texas too, quite possibly Houston. But right now we can’t say that for certain. As I’ve said, it’s either going to be pretty bad, or really really bad here. He posted his piece. His site normally averaged somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 views a day. That particular entry received 207,334 over the next 24 hours. A shocked Berger surmised that his core readers were recommending him to their suddenly weather-concerned friends. He had become the center of a kind of storm within the storm. In the comments, one reader asked what Berger thought the rainfall totals might be in San Antonio, 200 miles to the west. Someone else asked about Colorado County, and another about the neighborhoods near Ellington Field. Another reader wondered whether her husband’s flight out of Hobby Airport on Saturday morning might be delayed. A man named Petey James pointed out that Saturday night was the night of the big fight between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor, and he wanted to know whether he should risk going to the local bar or pay to watch it at home. A woman named Deb Walters asked whether she should still have the party she had planned to host near Dacus on Saturday afternoon. I’d press ahead at this point, Berger wrote to her. Obviously if things turn ugly Saturday morning, you’ll have to cancel. The following morning, Friday, August 25, it started to rain, a few drops at first, and then a fairly steady shower. Harvey’s leading edge had come to town, and the models, constantly updated, began to align: Harvey was nearly laser-precise in its construction and massive, and it was also a slow mover. The rain was going to be measured in feet, not inches. Berger sat down at his desk, no wine this time, and wrote another post. “ A very serious flooding situation is coming, ” he wrote. He wrote it two more times for emphasis. “ A very serious flooding situation is coming. A very serious flooding situation is coming. ” It was 3:15 pm. He hoped Deb Walters had canceled her party. Millions turned to Berger’s Space City Weather blog during the storm. Since 1980, there have been more than 200 weather and climate events in the United States that have each caused more than $1 billion in damage. Three principal national bodies are charged with predicting their arrivals and effects. The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, keeps watch for tornadoes. The Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, monitors heavy rains. And the National Hurricane Center in Miami minds hurricanes. They have been busy. In the case of Harvey, all three were involved, funneling their best information to the Houston branch of the National Weather Service, one of its 122 field offices across the country. Each helps turn national forecasts into finely tuned local ones. The Houston office is the only one that shares space with its home county’s Office of Emergency Management—Galveston County in its case—better to coordinate their shared response. It is no accident that their building sits atop a mound and that their offices are on the upper floor. Over the past few decades, greater Houston has grown exponentially from a mosquito-­plagued oil port into the fifth-largest metro area in the United States, home to nearly 7 million people. That population explosion, combined with a certain regional antipathy toward civic oversight, has seen former swamps turned into sprawling, unregulated developments. Houston has been built to flood. Dan Reilly, 52, is the local Warning Coordination Meteorologist, part of the National Weather Service’s round-the-clock professional staff. In a catastrophe-prone city like his, the job is twofold. The first is the forecast. “When something bad is coming, that’s really when we need to be at the top of our game,” he says. Of the three most damaging effects of hurricanes—wind, storm surge, and rain—rain is one of the most difficult to quantify in advance. The heaviest rain typically falls in small pockets, and that level of precision is difficult to attain more than six to 12 hours ahead of its arrival. Houston’s physical size also makes rain forecasts challenging: Each side of the I-10, for instance—one of several highways that serve as boundaries in an otherwise endless city—might receive a substantially different amount. A good meteorologist is almost always, by definition, skilled at pattern recognition. Weather, like the law, is built on a foundation of similar cases. Veteran meteorologists—Reilly has been in the job for 24 years—mine their memories for analogues. In the early hours of Harvey, Reilly’s team began upping the National Weather Service’s rain forecast to amounts that no one had ever seen: 25 inches, 30, and eventually 50, over a widespread swath of Houston. Reilly set aside everything he knew about the weather and decided to obey the combination of awe and dread he felt in his chest: A killing flood was on its way. Somehow the warnings sounded different coming from him. The next part of the job, and perhaps the more important one, is getting the word out. At a time when the weather can be more extreme than ever, and trust in government is low, convincing people to heed your warnings, especially the most severe of them, might now be the weather forecaster’s harder task. The most serious warning when it comes to rain is called a Flash Flood Emergency, and before Harvey, the Houston office had issued that warning on only three occasions. It would soon be used for a fourth. Berger, sitting behind his Spartan desk that afternoon, anxiety beginning to weigh on him like heat, was first among those who might listen—and to whom others might listen about the coming storm. He wasn’t the government; he was a human being, and somehow the warnings sounded different to their ears coming from him, the kind of measured voice that shines through in a crisis. After he had written his ominous flood forecast three times, he looked out his office window at one of the two garages he keeps. One of them was bursting with new things for his new house, and he began ferrying boxes upstairs to his office, filling the space in front of his desk with new light fixtures, a microwave, and a tub. In between trips, he heard Amanda making arrangements to take shelter, with their daughters, at her sister’s house, built on pilings and tucked away from the wind. Berger would stay. He would hunker down behind his wall of boxes with his PC and his readers, now numbering in the hundreds of thousands, for the duration of the storm. He knew that his city was in serious trouble, and he felt an almost spiritual need to convince his neighbors that it was time for them to share his fears. The weather started making an impression on Berger in 2001, when Tropical Storm Allison came to town. Berger is from Michigan but had gone to the University of Texas to earn his astronomy degree. He moved to Houston for a girl, first working weekends at the Houston Chronicle before becoming the paper’s designated “SciGuy,” writing mostly about physics, chemistry, and astronomy. He also wrote a little about the weather. He had just bought his first house near White Oak Bayou. On June 8, a Friday night—what was it about storms and Friday nights?—he went out with some friends to see a Bob Schneider concert. Allison had passed through Houston once already, but now it returned to take a second run at the city. Berger remembers that the sound of the rain on the roof drowned out Schneider, as though there was too much percussion in the mix. After the concert, he and his friends left to wander around midtown, gawking at the water rising on the empty streets. Berger wrote about the storm. One of his stories, about the drowning deaths of tens of thousands of research animals in the basement of the Texas Medical Center, drew massive national readership. He began having visions—he saw a place for thoughtful written analysis of the weather online. His discussions could be more timely and interactive than the forecasts printed in the paper itself. And unlike TV meteorologists, he needn’t worry about ratings or being available to viewers only at certain designated times. In June 2005, he started his own blog on the Chronicle ’s site. He didn’t yet have any meteorological training; he was just someone who liked talking about the weather. (His colleagues called him “Weather Boy.” It was not a compliment.) Three months later came Katrina. Then came Rita. And three years later, Hurricane Ike. Berger’s life could seem governed by storms; even his first meeting with Amanda, whom he married in 2002, came only a few weeks after Allison’s transformative rains. He convinced the newspaper to put him through a distance learning program at Mississippi State to earn his certification as a professional meteorologist. Modern technology and information dissemination have led to a democratization of weather forecasting, and that could mean compounding disaster in the wrong hands. Berger wanted to make sure his hands were the right ones. When he left the Chronicle to join Ars Technica in October of 2015, he started Space City Weather. The day after he opened up shop, the remnants of Hurricane Patricia began clouding the skies of Houston. He was supposed to go out for dinner with Amanda. He worried his readers would feel he’d abandoned them in a time of need, and he couldn’t help writing a post. His first forecast on Space City Weather was for a flood. Now in August 2017, the rains on Harvey’s opening night shocked even him. They were biblical. Rain falling at a rate of 2 inches an hour would force most drivers to pull over. Harvey would sometimes drop 5. It didn’t look like water; it looked like milk. Worse, Berger studied the models and the satellite imagery, and if he knew anything in that moment, listening to the rain against his window, he knew that there was so much more to come. On Saturday, August 26, an hour after sunset, the evening’s first band of precipitation, which on radar resembled the longest tentacles of an angry squid, opened up over Houston, slowly crossing the city from west to east. As predicted by the European model, it stalled. Additional bands trailing behind it intensified and merged with the first. This created what meteorologists properly call a seething nexus of hate, Berger later wrote. The now-combined band extended more than 400 miles over Galveston and deep into the too-warm waters of the Gulf, creating a superhighway for rain to be delivered directly to Houston. By very early Sunday morning, Harvey’s enormous size began to tell, and another band prepared to make its assault on the already flooded southern suburbs. The Houston branch of the NWS had issued its special emergency bulletin, and in the adjacent Office of Emergency Management, the walls were being papered with calls for water rescues. People were drowning in the rain. A sleepless Berger sat down at his desk and began writing a new post. Amanda and their daughters had been at her sister’s house for several hours, and she texted him to ask if he thought the latest band would be the end of it. He inserted the scene into his piece, which went up at 2:10 am on Sunday morning. I wanted nothing more than to fall in her arms and tell her yes, this was it. By God, yes. Let’s go to bed and forget this ever happened. It had to be it, surely. It would not be it. Harvey would make true Berger’s most pessimistic projections and refuse to leave. He would tell his readers that the rain would continue, especially at night. He would later hear that administrators at the Houston Methodist Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine were among those looking to him for guidance. He would harbor a guilt for delivering bad news for so many. At 12:03 pm on Sunday, Berger finished writing a post that he titled: “Houston, We Will Get Through This.” With the prospect of more rain, you may feel hopeless or helpless, or both. From a mental health standpoint, the uncertainty this brings adds a considerable amount of stress to an already stressful situation. I wish we could tell you when the rains will end, but we can’t. Here’s one thing we are sure of, however. The rains will end. After that the sun will come out. More than a million people would visit Space City Weather on Sunday alone. Hurricane Harvey already had a name. Now it had its face. Harvey’s unrelenting rain left so much underwater—like these orchards in Pecan Grove. On Tuesday evening, more than four days after the rain first started to fall, Berger would finally write: It’s over. He had been nearly perfect in his forecast. It hadn’t been all that windy, so there weren’t many roofs blown off or trees toppled, except in those few cursed places that were also visited by tornadoes. And there wasn’t much local storm surge. The water didn’t come rushing through Houston. It didn’t arrive in walls the way it did in New Orleans with Katrina, one of the reasons Harvey directly killed 68 people, many in their cars, instead of an estimated 1,833 people, many in their beds. Harvey was a cataclysmic rain event, just as Berger had feared. He could have been wrong and his readers would have moved their furniture back downstairs and grumbled about the wasted effort. But he had been right, and thousands of his readers didn’t have a downstairs anymore. A month after the storm, Berger dropped into his Hyundai hybrid and went for a drive. He wanted to see the terrible reality that had accompanied his forecasts, as though he could use the reminder that Harvey really did do what it did, to Houston and to him. By then the last part of weather analysis, the accounting of the aftermath, was nearly complete. It had rained so hard for so long that Houston’s swamps and reservoirs and drainage canals filled up, which meant that the city’s kitchens and living rooms and dens filled up next. Then the water drained away. In the time in between it made an estimated $75 billion in property irreparably wet. He headed south toward Dickinson, one of the worst-hit areas. On some streets, every house had an enormous pile of debris out front—everything that had been inside the house was now outside of it, rotting in the sun. Other streets had been picked clean, and they looked almost normal, except that through their windows, Berger could see that the otherwise pristine-­seeming houses had been stripped down to the studs. There was a photograph that had made the rounds during the storm. It was of the flood-soaked residents of a nursing home, sitting on their loungers and walkers, water up to their chests. It seemed like a macabre piece of surrealist art. On his tour, Berger decided to visit that nursing home, La Vita Bella. Nearly everything that wasn’t human in that photograph was now sitting out in the yard. The lamps, the chairs, and the popcorn machine from that haunting image melted in the piles of sodden sheetrock and carpet, relics of a viral infamy. They were joined by smaller but perhaps more significant losses: a stuffed animal, a deck of playing cards, a broken mirror, a lipstick and a rouge, a large-print copy of Marley &amp; Me. At 12:03 pm on Sunday, Berger finished writing a post titled: ""Houston, We Will Get Through This."" Berger had also lost a book in the flood. Before dawn on Sunday, lightning had lit up the sky, and he could see that water had reached his garages. He had mostly emptied one but not the other—not the one that contained his old things, his diplomas and his Appetite for Destruction poster and his boxes of books. He raced down and lifted up a box from the floor and its bottom fell out. A book titled From Dawn to Decadence by Jacques Barzun dropped into the water and disappeared. Berger had treasured that book, a massive 500-year history of Western civilization. Its French-born author had died in Texas in 2012. Barzun was 104 years old, and the book had been his life’s work. Something about losing that particular book hit Berger harder than it might have. It was a metaphor for how easily even our monuments can be erased. He had written about the loss of that book and other things in a post that went up on Ars Technica early in the morning on August 30, the Wednesday after the storm. The post was titled “This Is Probably the Worst US Flood Storm Ever, and I’ll Never Be the Same.” The cardboard box had failed, he wrote, and the book had dropped into the murk. Almost immediately, a current from the rushing water beyond the garage door pulled the tome away, forever. Damn, I loved that book. An indescribably bad night had just gotten that little bit worse. Berger started receiving emails and notes from his grateful readers. They had saved some of their own treasures because of his warnings, and they felt they had a debt to settle. A copy of From Dawn to Decadence was eventually put into his hands by a stranger, a woman who had attended a talk he had overcome his nerves to give after the storm. That book now sits high and dry on a shelf in his office, a tiny reminder of the things that Harvey had taken, but also a reminder of the things it had delivered. The National Weather Service is part of a necessary and effective meteorological bureaucracy. It is staffed by thousands of people—by good and competent forecasters who care deeply about the weather and its effects on their communities. The NWS can offer its best daily guess, informed by their forecasters’ computer models and professional experiences. It can give warnings and sound alarms. But the NWS can’t talk about the weather the way human beings talk about the weather. It can’t explore each of its uncertainties, almost reveling in the sweeping possibilities of hurricanes and their animal behaviors. It can’t riff. More important, when the weather is at its worst: The National Weather Service can’t comfort. Even though Dan Reilly and his colleagues live and work in greater Houston, even though they were plenty concerned during Harvey for their own families and homes, they can’t issue a bulletin that says, We’re sick and tired of the rain, just like everyone else. They can’t write: The rains will end. After that the sun will come out. Only someone like Eric Berger can do that, providing a weather forecast that includes words like hope or sorry or maybe. Only someone like Eric Berger can employ our best technology in a way that still feels intimate and human-scale, applying the wisdom of satellites to Deb Walters and her doomed party. Only someone like Eric Berger, looking out his window at the rain and willing for it to stop even though he knows that it won’t be stopping anytime soon, can speak to a family watching the water on its torturous rise to their door, the winds threatening the entirety of their lives, and make them feel a little less alone in the storm. Update: After this article went to press, we heard from Deb Walters, one of the many people who sought Berger’s advice just before Hurricane Harvey. Thanks to Berger’s forecasts, Walters decided to cancel a house party she hosts every year for some members of Alcoholics Anonymous and ex-cons. It turned out to be a good call. Although Walters’ house was spared, the surrounding streets flooded, which would have stranded the guests there for three days. “These folks are hysterical,” she said (as in funny and lovable), “but the type of people you invite to a party aren’t necessarily the type of people you want to spend three days with.” She finally hosted the shindig three weeks later, for a smaller crowd. —The Editors Chris Jones is a longtime magazine writer.

Aimée Lutkin,"On Wednesday afternoon, the Florida panhandle was hit with Hurricane Michael. It began as a Category 4 hurricane, and was placed in Category 3 by the time it reached Georgiaunprecedented for the area. Powerful winds and rains are expected throughout Thursday and Friday through North Carolina. One thing you can do to help in the long term is vote out climate change deniers this November. But for immediate aid, here are some places you can donate who are supporting people on the ground. GlobalGiving supports local and grassroots that work to restore areas hit by disasters, and their Hurricane Michael Relief Fund can be found here. They have a current goal of two million dollars, some of which will be directed toward immediate needs, and they also direct money to rebuilding efforts. World Vision works with local groups as well, though many of them seem to be churches in the area. This might be an effective strategy, as houses of worship often serve as shelters during storms. World Vision is putting together food, clean water, personal hygiene items, flood cleanup kits and more for families. They are not based in Florida, but seem to run programs worldwide. You can donate here. Volunteer Florida is urging people to register as volunteers in Florida with them to support Hurricane Michael victims, and suggesting the Disaster Fund as a place to donate money. The Fund is Floridas official private fund for helping communities recover from disasters. Team Rubicon is a group of military veterans who mobilize for rescue efforts in disasters. They already have a number of members in North Carolina who are still helping with recovery efforts after Hurricane Florence. You can help them out here. Recommended by Charity Navigator, this group is a network of non-denominational evangelical Christian churches that has a long history of responding to disasters. They have equipment stationed and ready to move in along the Gulf Coast and in Albany, GA, according to their website. Direct Relief is also noted on Charity Navigator for their commitment to financial transparency. They are also firmly unaffiliated with any religion or political group and say they provide aid to anyone in need without regard to politics, religion, ethnic identities or ability to pay. They support in part almost 200 health facilities in Michaels path, and have outfitted ten of them with emergency medical packs in anticipation of the storm. You can donate here. Americares is a health-focused humanitarian organization. They announced on Twitter that they have deployed an emergency response to team to Florida.

DAVID LEONHARDT,"This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Community journalism is the lifeblood of democracy, Diane McFarlin, the dean of the journalism school at the University of Florida, told me this week, and very much at risk these days. Shes right. The number of reporters covering statehouses has dropped by more than one-third since 2000, for example. And academic studies have found a raft of problems to be associated with a decline of local journalism, as The Columbia Journalism Review has detailed. The problems include less informed voters, lower voter turnout and higher borrowing costs for local governments because, without anyone to hold them accountable, those governments become less responsible. It is something of a Thanksgiving tradition for this newsletter to celebrate some of the fantastic local journalism that is still being done. This week, I asked people on Twitter and the deans of several journalism schools to recommend great local work from 2018. Much of it involves what David Kurpius, the University of Missouris journalism dean, calls the watchdog function. The list is not comprehensive, of course, and I invite you to send me other examples, at leonhardt@nytimes.com.

Swapna Krishna,"The telescope's fate had previously been uncertain. Back in 2016, the National Science Foundation announced that it was exploring different options in regard to Arecibo. There wasn't enough funding to continue supporting the telescope, so the NSF was looking at partnering with other organizations, scaling back or shutting down Arecibo entirely. That same year, the observatory was the first to capture repeating cosmic radio bursts, which have helped us understand the nature of our galaxy and the universe around it. This murky situation was made much worse by the events of Hurricane Maria. The hurricane decimated the region of Puerto Rico in which the telescope is located, also called Arecibo. The telescope was damaged as well, but repairs were quickly made and the observatory was back up and running a week after the storm, albeit on generator power. (Almost one-third of Puerto Rico's residents are still without power, five months after Hurricane Maria hit). While the NSF decided not to shut down the telescope, it wasn't clear what would happen. But now, this new agreement ensures that Arecibo Observatory will remain open. It is scheduled to take effect on April 1st. UCF and its partners, Universidad Metropolitana in San Juan and Yang Enterprises, Inc. in Oviedo, also plan to expand the operations of the telescope. It's good news for the scientific community, and also for Puerto Rico.","Arecibo Observatory, which is the second-largest radio telescope in the world, is under new management.

JOSEPH B. TREASTER,"Two University of Puerto Rico art museums lost chunks of their roofs: Casa Roig, a Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired two-story house 45 minutes south of San Juan, and the Museum of Art at the Mayagüez campus on the west coast. Casa Roig’s paneled ceilings partially collapsed. The wind blew out windows and broke a set of stained glass interior doors. It ripped tiles off mosaics. Putting Casa Roig back together is expected to cost nearly $400,000. In Mayagüez, Zorali De Feria, the museum director, found mold on a mural and a handful of paintings. She gave them first aid and alternated putting the paintings briefly in the sunlight and in the shade of a breezeway. Photo Tile mosaics in the home at the Casa Roig Museum were already fragile and damaged, but suffered more loss with hurricane Maria. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times Right after the storm, in her unlit office, Ms. De Feria wrote out a plea for help in longhand. The National Endowment for the Humanities sent her $30,000. Ms. Ramírez, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, also received $30,000 from the Endowment. She is putting her money toward the purchase of a generator that, with installation, is going to cost $110,000. “We need a generator, too,” Ms. De Feria said. The electricity came back sooner for both museums than in most of the island, but generators would have greatly reduced the risk and the stress. Ms. Pérez, who is also president of the Association of Puerto Rican Art Museums, and her colleagues have begun to rethink almost everything about their museums and hurricanes. Many museums did not have emergency operations plans. Some did not have home addresses for staff members. Cellphones and landlines were knocked out. Gasoline and diesel fuel were scarce. The museums became isolated. With help from the Smithsonian and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Ms. Pérez has been organizing conferences and workshops. At the top of the agenda: satellite telephones, generators and extra fuel tanks. Solar panels have been mentioned, and some art specialists are enthusiastic about creating emergency art storage vaults around the island, perhaps by converting buildings at abandoned but well-maintained military bases.

At the moment, Florence, Hurricane Isaac, and Hurricane Helene are all swirling in different parts of the ocean at the peak of hurricane season.

Florence, the most intense of the three has reached Category 4 status and will likely continue to strengthen as it moves over the warm waters heading for landfall on the East Coast later this week. The hurricane is expected to reach the coast of North Carolina Thursday night into Friday morning. Multiple states have already declared a state of emergency in preparation for the damaging flooding that Florence is likely to bring. ""Meteorologists don’t see any environmental factors that would help to weaken the storm,"" Weather Channel meteorologist Dale Eck said in an interview today. Since the hurricane has already amassed wind speeds of 130 mph, the coast could see life-threatening wind, rain, and storm surges. Hurricane Isaac has seriously weakened recently due to the wind shear in the Atlantic.

Andrew Freedman,"A disastrous hurricane season combined with wildfires and other extreme weather events inflicted a record-setting toll on the U.S. in 2017, with 16 billion-dollar weather and climate events costing a total of $306 billion in damage. These events caused 362 direct deaths. These figures come from a new report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), released on Monday morning. The previous costliest year for the U.S. was 2005, when losses totaled $215 billion, largely due to the three major hurricane strikes of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. SEE ALSO: Disastrous 2017 Atlantic hurricane season ends, with hard-hit areas still reeling The number of billion-dollar events tied 2011 for the most such disasters in a single year. The Western wildfire season alone, which scorched California in particular, cost at least $18 billion, NOAA said, tripling the previous record annual wildfire cost. Hurricane Harvey, which caused the most extreme rainstorm ever observed in the U.S., had total costs of $125 billion, just behind Hurricane Katrina in the 38-year period of record for billion-dollar disasters. Insurance companies are still tallying the damage for some of these events, so these costs may yet rise further. Hurricanes Maria and Irma had total costs of $90 billion and $50 billion, respectively, and Hurricane Maria, which demolished Puerto Rico's power grid, ranks as the third-costliest weather and climate disaster on record for the nation. The spike in costs for 2017 isn't directly tied to global warming, but numerous recent studies have found that extreme heat, wildfire, and rainfall events are becoming more likely and more severe due to climate change. This could, in turn, make such disasters more expensive, depending on how vulnerable the impacted areas. In deluging Houston with up to 60 inches of rain in just a few days time, Hurricane Harvey, for example, hit one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the U.S., where rampant urban development did not take into account the threat of heavy rainfall. Third-warmest year for the U.S. The NOAA report also found that 2017 was the third-warmest year on record for the lower 48 states, with an average annual temperature that was 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th Century average. This was slightly cooler than 2012 and 2016, but it marks the 21st straight warmer-than-average year for the country. In other words, if you were born in the U.S. in 1997 and remained here since, you've never experienced a cooler-than-average year in the U.S. In fact, the globe has not experienced a cooler-than-average month since December of 1984. Strikingly, the five warmest years on record for the contiguous U.S. have all occurred since 2006, NOAA found. This year, every state across the lower 48 and Alaska had an above-average annual temperature, and five states — Arizona, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, and South Carolina — had their warmest year on record. Thirty-two additional states, including Alaska, had a top-10 warmest year. One way that NOAA measures extreme weather is via the Climate Extremes Index, which takes into account temperatures, precipitation, tropical storms and hurricanes, and other factors. In 2017 it had the second-highest value in the 108-year period of record, which was more than double the average. Only 2012 had a higher value on this index, NOAA said. Extremes in warm maximum and minimum temperatures, one-day precipitation totals, days with precipitation and landfalling tropical cyclones contributed to the elevated extremes index, NOAA found. According to NOAA, during the past 38 years, the U.S. has sustained 219 weather and climate disasters where the overall damage costs reached or exceeded $1 billion. The cumulative costs for these 219 events exceed $1.5 trillion.","A disastrous hurricane season combined with wildfires and other extreme weather events inflicted a record-setting toll on the U.S. in 2017, with 16 billion-dollar weather and climate events costing a total of $306 billion in damage.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The Atlantic hurricane season has suddenly found its legs. Following some summer doldrums, a number of factors have come together to fuel a run of tropical weather. That includes Hurricane Florence, which just became the first major hurricane of the season. The storm reached Category 3 status—the threshold for major hurricanes—on Wednesday morning. The storm was packing winds of 120 mph and the National Hurricane Center said it was “still strengthening.” The storm is still out in the middle of the Atlantic, which is good news. Hurricane-force winds extend only 15 miles from its center, making it only slightly bigger than Hurricane Beryl, this season’s first hurricane (though that said, tropical storm-force winds extend 90 miles from the storm’s its core). The bad news, though, is that Florence strengthened faster than predicted. It’s also now likely to maintain hurricane strength through the weekend as opposed to yesterday’s forecast indicating it would dip back into tropical storm status. All of this is a concern because recent weather model runs take it near Bermuda by the middle of next week, with a possible U.S. landfall after that. This is not say landfall in either location is by any means a given, but it does mean that Florence is worth watching if you live in either locale. September is usually the most active time of Atlantic hurricane season, and this year has proven to be no exception. Colorado State hurricane guru Philip Klotzbach tweeted that on average, one major hurricane has formed by September 5, so we’re pretty on schedule. The tropics are expected to stay active for the next few weeks as a parade of potential storms could form. That includes an area of low pressure currently sitting to the west of Africa that’s likely to become a tropical depression by the end of this week.","The Atlantic hurricane season has suddenly found its legs.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Its the perfect science-fiction device: a hurricane of dark matter. Recent, real-life research has demonstrated that our Sun is currently engulfed in a so-called a stellar stream. Some publications have seized on this ominous-sounding idea, reporting that Earth is about to be walloped by a dark matter stormbut in fact, if it exists, were already inside the storm. The reality of the situation isnt quite so dire, but its interesting nonetheless. Stellar streams are populations of related stars that could have once been pieces of a dwarf galaxy or globular cluster, but have now been shredded apart by gravitational forces and pass through parts of our galaxy. Since astronomers are pretty sure that stuff called dark matter serves as the gravitational scaffolding for dwarf galaxies, then presumably a stellar stream should also contain some percentage of dark matter. Maybe a dark matter experiment could detect dark matter particles from the recently discovered stream running through our cosmic neighborhood. Theres supposed to be a stream that were inside of right now, Ciaran OHare, postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Theoretical Physics at the University of Zaragoza, told Gizmodo. It immediately made me think about the consequences for dark matter. The most successful models to describe the universe are based on experiments showing that that the cosmos is made up of 4 percent regular matter, perhaps 70 percent dark energy that is driving the universe apart, and the rest, around 25 percent, dark matter. Scientists have reason to believe that dark matter consists of particles, the same way that everything we can see is made of particles, and that its the scaffolding for the universes large-scale structure. But this dark matter has only ever been observed based on its gravitational effects. Scientists are in the midst of hunting for a dark matter particle. But meanwhile, surveys such as the European Space Agencys Gaia telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey have created enormous maps of the sky, complete with positions, velocity, and other data points for our region of the Milky Way galaxy. The data revealed substantial structures, such as this stream and accompanying dark matter hurricane, called S1, hitting the Solar System head-on. Perhaps this dark matter hurricane could be detectable by todays existing dark matter detection experiments, and would have a distinguishable signal from the Milky Ways background dark matter. It would move much fastera hurricane, compared to the background dark matter wind, according to the paper published last week in Physical Review D. The researchers then analyzed whether theyd be able to spot the stream with upcoming dark matter detectors. If dark matter comprised of a weakly interacting massive particle or WIMP, a particle with a mass similar to the other particles but that interacts weakly (imagine a light breeze interacting with a skyscraper), then the hurricane would only be detectable if the particles had a specific mass range, according to the paper. Experiments like the XENON NT detector in Italy wouldnt be able to pick out the direction of a potential dark matter particle, explained Laura Baudis, physics professor at the University of Zürich who was not involved in the new paper. Doing so would take a much larger detector, given the kinds of WIMPs that have already been ruled out. And if dark matter is instead comprised of much lighter particles called axions, the hurricanes effects would perhaps be more noticeable, according to the papers calculations. I think its quite an interesting idea, Sownak Bose, postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told Gizmodo. All these experiments trying to detect dark matter have a possibility to have their signals boosted by this extra flux. Bose pointed out that the amount of dark matter in the stream might vary based on the specific dwarf galaxy that created the streamor if the dark matter is something more exotic than the theoretical WIMPs and axions. But he was excited about what the incredible amount of Gaia data could do for studies of these streams. So, if there is a dark matter hurricane, were literally inside of it right now. But were safe (from the dark matter, at least). This so-called storm is most exciting for its scientific prospects. Said OHare: We know so little about dark matter that any sort of better knowledge about its structure adds up to help us understand it.

"Brandon Miller, CNN Meteorologist","(CNN)Though hurricane season runs from June through November, it is during the ""off-season"" when forecasters and researchers refine and improve their forecasting models, methods and techniques, allowing forecasters to enhance the accuracy of storm predictions.
With the partial government shutdown in its third week, and no end in sight, much of the research and development the National Hurricane Center relies on to improve hurricane forecasts is in jeopardy, along with badly needed upgrades to the main American weather model. 
""It's a tight schedule,"" Eric Blake, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center (NHC) told CNN, ""we try to fit in as many improvements as possible before the next hurricane season.""
While there is no good time for a government shutdown to bring the work of so many federal workers to a halt, according to Blake,""it is much worse for this to happen during the off-season."" Blake is the NHC's Union Steward to the National Weather Service's Employee Organization and spoke to CNN on its behalf.
During the hurricane season, the forecasters, which are working during the shutdown, would be doing their mission-critical work forecasting active storms in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Oceans. Because of this, research and development is frozen during the hurricane season.
From December through early May, however, the center's forecasters work with researchers and scientists at other governmental agencies to tweak and upgrade the models that are used to project the storms -- and many of these workers are currently furloughed. 
One of these agencies is the Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), which, like the NHC, is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).
The EMC develops and improves weather and climate predictions through numerical models, and right now should be working with Blake and other hurricane forecasters to make adjustments to the models based upon new research and lessons learned from the previous hurricane season.
And considering the forecast challenges presented by Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Michael last year, these months are critical to improving the forecast models and implementing new research and techniques.
But of the 200 people that work on these and other NOAA forecast models at the EMC, and their various government contractors, only one of them is currently working through the shutdown. The other 199 are deemed ""non-critical"" and are furloughed, unable to access their computers to even check on the progress of their models until the government shutdown ends.
According to Suru Saha, one of the furloughed computer modelers at the EMC, the longer the shutdown goes on, the less prepared we will be when the next hurricane season begins.
""This is lost time that cannot be made up,"" Saha told CNN. Saha also serves as the center's union steward to the NWS Employee Organization. ""It's gone and it will effect future operations.""
But it isn't just hurricane model upgrades that are being neglected during the partial government shutdown.
The EMC oversees NCEP's entire suite of global forecast models, including the Global Forecast System model, or GFS model, which is often referred to as the ""American model,"" and is used to forecast everything from nor'easters to tornado outbreaks.
The American model has come under fire in recent years after falling notably behind the European's model, the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model, in high profile events such as Hurricane Sandy. 
But the GFS was due to get a significant makeover over the next month, known as the FV3 upgrade.
The update promises to better utilize advances in computing technology and data processing to ""deliver better, more timely forecasts to serve the growing needs of our forecasters and the weather enterprise,"" according to NOAA's website.
""We're banking on it to do great things,"" Saha told CNN of the upgraded GFS-FV3, ""every system we have have is dependent on the quality of the GFS forecast.""
""But all of that is on hold,"" she said. ""I don't see that happening in February."" NOAA confirmed to CNN that these upgrades are likely to be delayed due to the shutdown.
""There are improvements scheduled in the next upgrade window that may be delayed due to the shutdown,"" a NOAA spokesperson said, though no time table was given as to how long that delay might be once the shutdown has ended.
In addition to delays in upgrades, there have been concerns that the shutdown could be resulting in a degradation of the current American GFS model, and thus the forecasts millions of people receive through apps and other forecast systems that rely upon the model's data. 
But the NOAA spokesperson pushed back on these reports, claiming that ""the accuracy of the nation's forecast model is maintained to the same standards as normal ... and the resources [the forecasters] need to perform essential operations are being provided.""
But even if the forecast models are maintained during the shutdown, it is clear they are not getting better. And that could mean the forecast for a major hurricane in September or October of this year isn't as good as it could be.
The National Hurricane Center has reduced their average forecast track error for tropical systems in the Atlantic from 220 miles to 70 miles since the year 2000, with almost steady improvement year over year. But Blake is afraid that same improvement won't be possible this year.
""It's going to be more status quo next year,"" Blake said, referring to the lack of research and development and new initiatives that the shutdown is causing.
And the shutdown threatens to reduce our country's preparedness for hurricanes in other ways beyond just the forecast.
The National Hurricane Center is set to host a series of meetings over the next several weeks with FEMA for emergency managers and key decision makers along the Gulf Coast and East Coast, that Blake said are designed to familiarize them with important products and services so they can make the best informed decision for their regions.
""If the shutdown continues and we have to cancel the meetings with FEMA, then that will hurt America's hurricane readiness,"" Blake said, which could potentially place American lives and property at risk.

Rayne Ellis,"Well folks, we officially have our first major Atlantic hurricane of the 2018 season. Early Wednesday afternoon the National Hurricane Center announced that Hurricane Florence, a storm brewing 2,205 miles off the coast of Bermuda, has intensified into a major storm. A hurricane is considered “major” or intense when wind speeds exceed 111 mph, which means it's at least a Category 3 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). SEE ALSO: Hurricane Maria is the deadliest storm of the 21st century “This is almost exactly on target,"" NOAA representative Dennis Feltgen said in an interview. ""The typical day to see the first major hurricane is September 4. It’s September 5."" “Tropical Storm Gordon just hit the south, so we’ve seen seven storms already. On average, we see seven storms by September 16, so we are actually above the average,” Feltgen said. There's also a lot of uncertainty about what track Florence will take or if it will impact land at all. But there's no reason to panic, at least not yet. Models predicting the storm's path vary by 1,000 miles and meteorologists aren’t even sure if the hurricane will go north, south, turn out to the east or keep barrelling toward the west. Careful proclaiming #Florence will go west. Lots to figure out here, as short-term motion may ultimately determine long-term track. Red dot below shows where Florence crossed 45W this morning relative to 0Z EPS (from @Weathernerds ). It's way on north side of guidance for now. pic.twitter.com/7RGLMhjpjM — Levi Cowan (@TropicalTidbits) September 5, 2018 “This is certainly a storm to watch, but it’s too early to know if we’re in danger if it’s just a fish storm,” meteorologist Philip Klotzbach said in an interview. “If every model that predicted that a hurricane would hit the U.S., actually hit the U.S., the east coast would be uninhabitable.” Any prediction made this far in advance is made with uncertainty, Klotzbach explained. “If the National Hurricane Center could do 10 day forecasts with skill, they would,"" Klotzbach said. ""In 50 years, with even better models, you still won’t have certainty nine days out."" But no one should turn a blind eye to the storm. Florence has been fairly difficult to forecast already. Klotzbach said himself that earlier this week he thought Florence wouldn’t amount to more than a medium level tropical storm, but by this morning it was a major hurricane. “Hurricane Florence is certainly an overachiever. It’s been stronger than what most of the forecasters thought,” he said. “But It’s important to dial down the hype and check again in a few days.” The tropical Atlantic is now quite active. Tropical Depression Gordon is moving across Mississippi. Hurricane Florence in the central Atlantic is now a Cat 3 storm with 125 mph max winds. A tropical wave behind Florence could become a tropical depression by the end of the week. pic.twitter.com/QivVGnCjQ9 — NWS Eastern Region (@NWSEastern) September 5, 2018 This weekend, tracking models will be substantially more accurate as the number of factors determining the path of the storm will be made clear. Both Feltgen and Klotzbach said Hurricane Florence is an important reminder that we're approaching the peak of the hurricane season, and it's time to start planning. “Be ready, but don’t get too amped up over a nine-day forecast,” Klotzbach said.","Well folks, we officially have our first major Atlantic hurricane of the 2018 season.

MICHELLE GOLDBERG,"Hurricane Maria has been the one real test of presidential leadership Trump has faced. We can see the results. In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, Trump was busy tweeting insults from his New Jersey golf club and campaigning in a special election in Alabama. When he did engage, he praised his administration’s response and complained that Puerto Ricans weren’t doing enough to help themselves. Experts acknowledge that Hurricane Maria would have challenged any president. “The basic model for a FEMA response is that the state and local authorities lead, and FEMA comes in to support their recovery effort,” Jeremy Konyndyk, who headed U.S.A.I.D.’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance under Barack Obama, told me. In Puerto Rico, where the whole island had been devastated, that was impossible. But it’s precisely because FEMA isn’t set up to handle situations like Puerto Rico that we needed a capable president. “When a government agency needs to do something it is not designed to do, it takes a lot of very disciplined, rigorous White House leadership” to make it happen, Konyndyk said. As an example, he mentions the Obama administration’s successful response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014. Neither U.S.A.I.D., the Centers for Disease Control, nor the military was equipped to address it alone. “It’s very easy in that instance for a government agency to just default to doing things the normal way,” Konyndyk said. In such circumstances, someone with a big picture view needs to figure out innovative ways to marshal America’s resources. Trump will never be that someone. And Hurricane Maria is highly unlikely to be the last grave emergency to happen on his watch. Experts are predicting another bad hurricane season this year, though not as terrible as 2017. As Konyndyk points out, every president since Ronald Reagan has had to deal with some sort of novel disease outbreak, including H.I.V., SARS and avian flu. Other, unforeseen calamities will take us by surprise. And we have a president that cannot sit through a briefing or do serious preparation of any kind, who has hollowed out the government and filled key posts with lackeys and grifters. Puerto Ricans have been the first American citizens to really feel what it means to have a president who is so wildly unable to fulfill his responsibilities. It’s hard to imagine they’ll be the last.","Shoes representing Hurricane Maria's victims on display in San Juan, Puerto Rico.",2018-06-08T10:00:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Op-Ed Columnist: The Price of an Incompetent President,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/opinion/trump-fema-speech.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/08/opinion/08goldbergWeb/08goldbergWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane,1
"Michael Waters on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Jose Herrada, an inmate at Floridas Gulf Correctional Institution, first heard news about Hurricane Michael on the radio. Initially, Herrada thought little of it. Although the state of Florida had issued a mandatory evacuation order for nearby Panama City and surrounding areas, officials at Gulf CI hadnt brought up the possibility of evacuating the prisons 1,500 inmates. Herrada assumed that meant he would be safe. We thought [the hurricane] was not coming close when they did not evacuate us, Herrada told Earther by email. If officials at Gulf CI reached a similar conclusion, they were dead wrong. The prison took a direct hit from Hurricane Michael as the historically-powerful storm surged across the Florida Panhandle on October 10th. The damage to was immediate: The facility lost power, and phone lines stopped working. Water started flooding in through cracks along the windows. The wind was so strong that it cleaved off several dormitory roofs and a section of the perimeter fence, according to Herrada and The Miami Herald, and inmates had to rush to keep their belongings dry as water flooded in. Buzzfeed reported that many dorm rooms were destroyed and that some windows were entirely blown off. We were scared, Herrada told Earther. Most of us are scarred emotionally. I myself have nightmares. Although the Florida Department of Corrections evacuated six prisons prior to Hurricane Michaels arrival, Gulf CI is one of a number in the path of the storm were not evacuated in advance. Four days after the storm, on October 14th, Gulf CI and other hard-hit prisons were fully evacuated until further damage assessment can be completed, per the department. Michelle Glady, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Corrections, told Earther the department makes determinations about what facilities should be evacuated in the best interest of public, staff and inmate safety based on wind speed, flooding history, building age, road safety, and other factors. Glady added that much like many North Florida communities, our facilities sustained damage but, in all prisons, our staff and inmates were safe, and no one was injured during the storm. Herrada takes a different view. They took a gamble with our lives, he told Earther. In recent years, a spate of mishandled hurricanes has exposed the failures of the U.S. prison system to account for those it incarcerates during natural disasters. The problem was on full display during the two most destructive hurricanes of 2018. A month before Michael, in September, Hurricane Florence bore down on the Carolinas. While North Carolina and Virginia evacuated prisons under threat, the South Carolina Department of Corrections refused to evacuate facilities that lay within high-risk zones. And climate change, which expected to produce bigger and deadlier storms, could place already-vulnerable incarcerated people in even greater danger. Thats not only because their personal safety is consistently ignored during storms, but also because prisons themselves are often at greater risk from hurricanes than other housing structures. According to Yale researcher Hannah Hauptman, who mapped out prison geographies in a recent paper, prisons are disproportionately located on low-lying land that remains vulnerable to storm impacts, in part because many U.S. prisons are former slave plantations. The state approves of and constructs prisons significantly closer to dangerous floodplains than it does for other forms of settlement, Hauptman notes. Even today, private companies sometimes fail to consider storm risks when choosing the locations for new prisons. Washingtons Northwest Detention Center, which opened in 2004, houses up to 1,575 immigrants in one of the nations riskiest tsunami zones. In the event of a tsunami, according to The Seattle Globalist, the prison will fill with as much as two meters of water in less than eight minutes. (Northwest Detention Center did not immediately return Earthers request for comment.) We tend not to prioritize the needs of people who are incarcerated, Keramet Reiter, a professor of criminology at the University of California Irvine School of Social Ecology, told Earther. In a disaster they are maybe the last priority. The problem is deeply entrenched, beginning with the fact that many prisons do not even have clearly stated emergency evacuation plans during natural disasters, and there is no state or national requirement that they do, as noted in a recent paper by Columbia Law student William Omorogieva. (Some states require other forms of emergency planning, but none mandates plans specific to natural disasters.) Shaundra Young Scott, director of the ACLU in South Carolina, told Earther that part of the issue is funding. Evacuations are expensive, and in South Carolina, where the state has already slashed mental health programs in its prisons in the last eight years, its pretty clear the state legislature is loath to spend money on prisoners, and quite frankly, they arent worried about evacuation because they dont care about prisoners. When voters also tend to lack empathy for people in prison, there is no political will to change the system. Reports of inmates stranded by devastating hurricanes date back to at least 1937, when the Kentucky state reformatory broke into riots after days without drinking water. Following Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans prisoners who were not evacuated smashed windows to let air in as the floodwaters rose, and they lit their shirts on fire so aid workers would know they were trapped. Last year, during Hurricane Harvey, Houston inmates in multiple prisons were left in cells flooded knee-high with water contaminated by urine and feces without enough food or drinking water, according to The Nation. Texas inmate Deidre McDonald wrote for The Marshall Project about waking up to the sound of thunder cracking and officers screaming for everyone to get to the second floor the morning that Harvey made landfall. Though the state had issued an evacuation warning for Dickinson, Texas, where she was held, the prison did not relocate the group of predominantly disabled inmates living there. McDonald noted that her prisonlike so many otherswas structurally unequipped for a dangerous hurricane: Given the way the Texas Department of Criminal Justice built this place, the sidewalks overflow during even the lightest rain, creating a constant slip-and-fall hazard for the predominantly disabled offender population here, McDonald wrote. We tend not to prioritize the needs of people who are incarcerated. In a disaster they are maybe the last priority. Last year, after Hurricane Irma struck her 700-person Miami prison, Homestead Correctional Institute, inmate Natalie Price went two weeks without power. Around her, people were crammed three to a room. Two inches of water lined the floors, Price told Earther, and more leaked in through the walls. All things considered, Price feels the prison administration handled things well for our state emergencymost of the problems, she said, came not from the administration but from the old age of the buildings, which were prone to leaks. Most of the families of inmates around her also didnt understand what was happening, according to Price. Although the state notified them that the Homestead Correctional Institute would be evacuated, it never was. This fall, even Florida prisons located further from the shore than Gulf CIlike Apalachee Correctional Institution, which houses up to 1,300 peoplefelt the effects of Hurricane Michael. Michael Henderson, an inmate at Apalachee CI, told Earther that the prison is so old that even before Hurricane Michael, some windows were broken or outright missing. When the storm arrived, rain rushed in through the open windows, and inmates scrambled to salvage their belongings. For some of us, like myself that meant vital legal work that if destroyed would have left me at a major disadvantage, Henderson said. Yet the worst part was not the flooding itself but the unrest after. Inmates were stuck in lockdown and unable to leave their dorms, Henderson said, recalling that they ate only cold sandwiches served at odd hours. On October 14th, four days after Hurricane Michael, the dorm across from Hendersons broke into a full on free for all that resulted in officers armed with tactical gear detaining inmates. About thirty men were removed and taken to confinement or transferred, Henderson said. (Apalachee CI did not respond to Earthers request for comment on this incident, but verified a near riot over food to the Florida Times Union in October.) The officials knew this hurricane was coming and did little to prepare, Henderson added. The systemic failures of the prison system to account for the people it incarcerates during major storms has not escaped the notice of inmates. Before a hurricane, more experienced inmates often warn newer ones about the unique dangers they face. Back at Gulf CI, Shamar McCullum, another inmate, calls this the talk. McCullum told Earther that a group of older inmates sat him and others down before the storm and warned them that officers may leave to save themselves; that after the hurricane, each person should eat light; and that each inmate should save his most valuable property because it may get flooded out. (According to McCullum, the last two concerns proved to be true.) McCullum also told Earther that, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Michael, he had little access to drinking water because the pipes burst. Food came infrequentlyon the third day, he was fed only one meal. McCullum recalls that when an inmate asked an officer when their meal was coming, the officer responded, Better hope you even get feed at all. Thats when I knew it was not looking good for us, McCullum said. Inmates who asked to be seen by nurses were refused and threatened with disciplinary reports because of the lockdown, according to McCullum. He and the other inmates had no way of communicating with their families, though Gulf CI did relay a message that everyone was OK, McCullum said. They spent long days sitting in their cells without possibility of leaving. When presented with these allegations the Florida Department of Corrections told Earther that although it could not confirm or deny individual claims, all inmates had access to food and drinkable water and medical needs were addressed and prioritized, and inmates have access to routine care. Only two days after Hurricane Michael made landfall, Gulf CI was reduced to such disrepair that the first set of inmates were finally evacuated. Adam Baird, a Gulf CI inmate, said that when the evacuation order finally came, many inmates had gone a day without food. 50 or 60 officers came in around 10:30 pm and told everyone to grab their toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, and deodorant, and tie the rest of our property in a sheet and leave it in the cell, Baird told Earther, recalling the evacuation. McCullum, for one, was relieved. Now that it is all over I still find myself day dreaming about just how bad things could have been if I stayed one more day at that place, he said. What I and the others went through is a experience I dont want anybody thats locked up to go through because officers dont care about inmates, especially at the time of a hurricane. McCullum and the other Gulf CI inmates have been moved to a patchwork of neighboring prisons, including Mayo CI and the Northwest Florida Reception Center. They do not know whenor ifthey will return to Gulf, but because of the damage, they dont expect it will be anytime soon. (Maintenance crews are currently working on repairs, according to the Florida Department of Corrections.) Whether their experiences will propel policy changes remains to be seen. Some researchers, like Omorogieva of Columbia Law, have proposed that FEMA create a special coordinator for incarcerated populations who could craft new requirements to evacuate inmates during natural disasters. There is even a mechanism for doing this: Congress could expand the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, which created a Disability Coordinator within FEMA, to also address the needs of incarcerated people. But that requires political will. And although during this years National Prison Strike incarcerated activists highlighted the importance of environmental issues, and a disparate group of protesters convened outside the South Carolina State House to demand evacuations during Hurricane Florence, few lawmakers have even acknowledged the risks that incarcerated populations face during major storms.

Mark Kaufman,"The National Hurricane Center has named the first storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, precisely one week before the season is expected to begin on June 1. Currently spinning off of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, forecasters named the subtropical storm ""Alberto,"" which is the first of 21 names the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has on its list of possible storm names for the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. On Friday, Alberto met the minimum requirements for earning a name, having reached sustained winds of 40 miles per hour. SEE ALSO: 2018's hurricane season will be active, but probably not as bad as last year The storm, while projected to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to areas in Florida and some Gulf Coast states both this weekend and into early next week, will not become a hurricane, according to NOAA. A storm needs to hit sustained wind speeds of at least 74 miles per hour to be considered a Category 1 storm, the least intense hurricane classification. Yesterday, the National Hurricane Center released its 2018 hurricane forecast, and they expect 2018 to be an ""active season,"" with between 10 to 16 named storms, five to nine of which being hurricanes. ""This is a fair amount of activity we’re expecting."" Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said in an interview. Tropical Storm conditions associated with #Alberto are possible across the Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba through Saturday. Tropical Storm conditions could reach the northern Gulf Coast as early as Sunday morning. pic.twitter.com/MImTcKhB2z — NHC Atlantic Ops (@NHC_Atlantic) May 25, 2018 Last hurricane season — which produced the immensely destructive hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria — was exceptionally active, said Bell, who doesn't currently expect this season to produce such intense activity. Hurricane forecasters analyze a combination of short and long-term climate trends, along with sophisticated computer models when making their predictions for a hurricane season. Since 1995, the Atlantic and Caribbean have seen ""very active"" seasons, said Bell, as a decades-long climate trend in the Atlantic Ocean has kept water temperatures warmer, contributing to a higher number of storms. In addition to this effect, NASA says that modern storm research shows hurricanes are getting stronger, lasting longer, and dumping significantly more rain. Rising sea levels, an indisputable result of human-induced climate change, exacerbates the effect of already damaging storms by producing higher surges of water. As for Alberto, the National Hurricane Service recommends that Gulf Coast residents watch for the agency's regular updates, found easily on either their homepage or Twitter account.","The National Hurricane Center has named the first storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, precisely one week before the season is expected to begin on June 1.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Well that escalated quickly. Hurricane Aletta became the first tropical storm of the eastern Pacific hurricane season on Thursday, and by Friday morning it had spun up into a Category 4 monster. The storm might not be done ramping up, either. The meteorological marvel is thankfully not forecast to make landfall (though rip currents and swells are possible along Mexico’s west coast this weekend), which means we can safely gawk at its beastly nature. The storm’s rise has been a swift one. It became a tropical storm on Wednesday and puttered around throughout the day. But things changed in a big way on Thursday into Friday. At 3 p.m. local time on Thursday, the storm became the first hurricane of the eastern Pacific season as a Category 1 storm with 75 mph winds. The storm’s location—in the open ocean with no interference from land—and warm waters for fuel are what caused Aletta to blow up. By 9 a.m. local time on Friday, it had ballooned into a Category 4 storm with 140 mph winds. That 65 mph increase in less than 24 hours more than meets the criteria for rapid intensification, a meteorological term for when a storm’s windspeed increases at least 35 mph in a day. Even the National Hurricane Center (NHC) seems a bit agog at what happened with Aletta. “The remarkable intensification of Aletta has continued through this morning,” forecasters wrote in their most recent update about the storm. “The short-range intensity forecast is particularly difficult since there are no obvious reasons why Aletta should cease intensification.” The forecast calls for Aletta’s winds to pick up a little more speed to 145 mph before it hits rough steering winds that will tear it back down to a tropical storm by the end of the weekend. Aletta may be a beast, but the eastern Pacific is no stranger to explosively powerful storms. You may remember that this same region spawned Hurricane Patricia—the most intense hurricane ever recorded—back in 2015. That storm rapidly intensified, peaking with winds at a mind boggling 215 mph (well above the 155 mph Category 5 threshold). Rapid intensification was also a hot topic last year during Atlantic hurricane season. Four storms blew up in the Atlantic last year, including Maria. How climate change affects rapid intensification is an active area of research. Some studies indicate the most intense storms are becoming, well, more intense in parts of the Atlantic. Other findings suggest climate change could cause Atlantic hurricanes to rapidly intensify more often as they approach land. Eastern Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 and after three weeks of relative quiet, it appears to be waking up. Another storm is on the horizon. NHC has an eye on an area of clouds and thunderstorms currently sitting off the coast of Central America that has a 90 percent chance of organizing into a tropical system in the next 48 hours, which would be named Bud. Early signs indicate that the storm could pose more of a threat to land, potentially getting sucked into the Southwest.","Well that escalated quickly.

Mark Kaufman,"Hurricane Lane, which is currently bearing down on Hawaii, is ""not a well behaved storm,"" according to the state's governor David Ige. Spinning in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the hurricane has grown into a monstrous Category 5 storm, the most powerful type of hurricane with winds now reaching 160 mph. Tuesday evening, the National Hurricane Center called the cyclone ""an impressive hurricane,"" and forecast that the storm will ""move dangerously close to the main Hawaiian Islands as a hurricane Thursday through Saturday."" SEE ALSO: Why Trump's EPA wants to kill the nation's most ambitious climate change plan Hawaii's residents should ""prepare for a significant impact"" from Hurricane Lane, Ige said. National hurricane scientists emphasize that even if the center of the storm — where winds are strongest — doesn't pass directly over the islands, the state could still face serious problems from the storm. A storm this sprawling and powerful can bring threatening downpours and winds ""well away from the center of the hurricane, and impacts could be felt on any of the islands,"" the National Hurricane Center said. It's rare for powerful storms to veer near these well-populated tropical islands, in large part because hurricanes feed on warmer waters, and the oceans around Hawaii are often relatively cool for tropical seas. Yet, the National Hurricane Center notes that ocean waters along the storm's predicted track are currently ""warm enough to support a major hurricane."" Hurricane Lane is only the sixth Category 5 hurricane ever recorded in the central Pacific, Federal Emergency Management Agency atmospheric scientist Michael Lowry tweeted. But, Lane is the closest Category 5 storm to Hawaii that scientists have ever observed, he added. Although any year can bring warmer waters to a marine region, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and university scientists published research last year arguing that the tropical Pacific will likely see more ""extremely active"" hurricane seasons as human-caused global warming boosts ocean temperatures. As the planet continues an accelerated rate of warming due to human-caused climate change, around 95 percent of accumulated heat gets absorbed by the oceans, increasing the background levels of ocean warming and making warmer-than-normal temperatures more likely. ""Global warming is really ocean warming,"" Josh Willis, an oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, recently said in an interview. A classic hurricane killer is wind shear — winds that hit hurricanes on their sides and can tilt them or blow off their top. But as of Tuesday night, government forecasters didn't expect increasing wind shear around Hawaii until Thursday evening, after some major effects are likely already felt in the state. As the storm skims the islands, or perhaps even makes landfall, severe and potentially historic flooding is expected. According to the National Hurricane Center, there will certainly be battering waves on the coast and potentially ""life-threatening flash flooding from heavy rainfall"" as water pours down the famously mountainous Hawaiian terrain.","Hurricane Lane, which is currently bearing down on Hawaii, is ""not a well behaved storm,"" according to the state's governor David Ige.

MATT APUZZO and ADAM GOLDMAN,"The Pentagon’s high-profile military operations are more brand name than code name: Enduring Freedom, Desert Storm, Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn. Perhaps the most famous coded F.B.I. operation was Abscam, the late-1970s operation in which agents posed as Arab sheikhs working for a company called Abdul Enterprises and tried to bribe lawmakers. If it is not obvious, that code name was not chosen at random. Agents and analysts typically try to pick something clever, but being too cute can cause headaches. The investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server was labeled Midyear Exam (often shortened inside the F.B.I. to Midyear). Agents may have thought they were being tested, facing a politically charged investigation in a presidential campaign. But last year, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, questioned the F.B.I. director at the time, James B. Comey, about whether to read anything into the name. GRASSLEY: Was the Clinton investigation named Operation Midyear because it needed to be finished before the Democratic National Convention? If so, why the artificial deadline? If not, why was that the name? COMEY: Certainly not because it had to be finished by a particular date. There's an art and a science to how we come up with code names for cases. They assure me it’s done randomly. Sometimes I see ones that make me smile and so I'm not sure. But I can assure you that — it was called Midyear Exam, was the name of the case — I can assure you the name was not selected for any nefarious purpose or because of any timing on the investigation. Are there standard naming conventions? Not if past practice is any indication. Some agents seem to favor odd or obscure references. Take the federal gun case Tin Panda, for example. Others reach for the obvious, like the mortgage fraud investigation named Malicious Mortgage. Cyberinvestigators often nod at industry jargon ( E-Con or Fastlink ). Agents have chosen names that are descriptive ( Disarray ), misspelled ( Lemon-Aid ) and iterative ( Cross Country XI ). Perhaps the best guidance on the topic comes from Winston Churchill, whose opinions about World War II code names were so well regarded that in 1952, the deputy C.I.A. director, Allen W. Dulles, sent it to his covert action team. Mr. Churchill advised against choosing names that were boastful or grim or naming operations after living people. “After all, the world is wide, and intelligent thought will readily supply an unlimited number of well-sounding names,” he wrote. The full text can be read here, and it offers some suggestions: “Proper names are good in this field. The heroes of antiquity, figures from Greek and Roman mythology, the constellations and stars, famous racehorses, names of British or American war heroes, could be used, provided they fall within the rules above. There are no doubt many other themes that could be suggested.” Why does an F.B.I. investigation even need a code name? Convenience, mostly. It is not necessary for record-keeping because every F.B.I. case has a unique number. A code name, though, allows for a familiar shorthand that avoids sharing delicate information. Nobody is going to say, “Stay behind after this meeting so we can discuss the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election and whether the Trump campaign was involved.” “Stay behind after this meeting so we can discuss Crossfire Hurricane,” is easier and discreet. And, for brevity’s sake, it was often shortened to Crossfire.",The F.B.I. investigation into Russian election meddling and possible ties to Trump associates was originally called Crossfire Hurricane.,2018-05-16T17:10:11Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Here’s Your Unclassified Briefing on Secret Government Code Names,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/us/politics/fbi-code-names-investigations-crossfire-hurricane.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/17/us/politics/17dc-codename/17dc-codename-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane,1
Rebecca Ruiz,"The isolated coastal region of Patillas, Puerto Rico, lost power when Hurricane Maria slammed into the U.S. territory back in September. It took several months to restore electricity to most of the region — and then suddenly, on April 18, an island-wide blackout put residents back in the dark again. ""It’s like the hurricane came all over again,"" says Norma I. Melendez, 55, who's lived in Patillas since age 3. ""We have this feeling of desesperanza — no hope, a feeling of helplessness."" SEE ALSO: The power is out again in Puerto Rico, 7 months after Hurricane Maria Despite the sense of despair, local residents like Melendez are organizing to provide the community essential resources, such as clothes, food, medical supplies, and access to medical examinations. That story of improvisation and resilience is common across Puerto Rico, despite slow-moving recovery efforts. ""We have this feeling of desesperanza — no hope, a feeling of helplessness."" Though most of the island is back on the power grid, roughly 90,000 Puerto Ricans still don't have electricity, and those that do worry about and experience intermittent blackouts. The power outage last month, caused by accidental damage to a transmission line, left most of the island's 3.3 million residents without electricity for a day. While all customers are expected to have power by the end of May, that's around when hurricane season begins, and activists say the island's infrastructure is woefully unprepared for new storm-related threats. In Patillas, Melendez and her neighbors are still focused on recovery. She volunteers with and writes funding proposals for a nonprofit community organization called Guardarraya Unidos Por Un Patrimonio Educativo (GUPE), which partners with other groups like the Red Cross and Salvation Army to obtain supplies for local distribution. GUPE has handed out solar lanterns, medical equipment, food, and bottled water to residents, many of whom are 65 or older and have severe medical conditions or disabilities. The organization operates out of an abandoned school, and it doesn't have the funds to buy generators or water tanks. There are moments when the stakes and urgency of the situation feel daunting, Melendez says. But then neighbors will share medical equipment, food, or clothes with each other, often using GUPE as a conduit. “Puerto Rico's Senate has ordered government agencies to explain why tens of thousands of people in rural areas remain without power or appropriate shelter as anger grows about the lack of basic services more than 7 months after hurricanes Irma &amp; Maria.” https://t.co/xs5t2UtFtE — David Begnaud (@DavidBegnaud) April 25, 2018 ""That gave us the energy to continue because we know that GUPE is reaching people and the people are reaching GUPE,"" she says. GUPE is receiving logistical and material support from multiple nonprofit organizations, including the aid and relief group Mercy Corps. Karla Peña, emergency response program manager for Mercy Corps, says she frequently sees a spirit of cooperation and generosity across communities in Puerto Rico. Neighbors share refrigerators and keep an eye on people with few family members in the area as well as those who can't easily travel to get food, water, and gas. Yet, that individual and collective resilience can wear thin in the absence of external support from nonprofits and the government. Indeed, there's a battle over how Puerto Rico will be rebuilt given that it has $74 billion in municipal debt, and the island's governor has moved to privatize the power authority. Community and labor activists worry that privatization will put Puerto Rico's fate in the hands of unaccountable private corporations. ""There's an emotion, an anxiety, that we can go back to that anytime, back to not having water and no electricity for a long time."" As that fight unfolds, many Puerto Ricans feel like they're stuck in survival mode, says Peña. During the most recent power outage last month, Peña says lines for gas and water rivaled post-hurricane levels. Even when the power is on, Peña keeps ice in the refrigerator and her ""hurricane kit"" — a camping stove and emergency supplies — at the ready. After months of use, generators break down often. Meanwhile, families have exhausted their financial resources to buy fuel. Those still without power rely on solar lanterns or, if they have one, a working generator. ""There's an emotion, an anxiety, that we can go back to that anytime, back to not having water and no electricity for a long time,"" Peña says. Melissa Mark-Viverito, former New York City Council Speaker and campaign director to the advocacy coalition Power 4 Puerto Rico, lauds the recovery work happening in communities across the island, but says those efforts need more support. Mark-Viverito envisions new investments in community-led projects to develop sustainable power sources, which could generate jobs and help stem the number of Puerto Ricans leaving the island to live in the United States. (Power 4 Puerto Rico recently wrote a letter to members of Congress urging them to adopt a ""community-driven"" approach to rebuilding.) But Mark-Viverito says that without meaningful support for innovative solutions developed by local communities, ""we're not going to be able to take advantage of this moment. What happened with the blackout demonstrates how vulnerable we are."" Back in Patillas, Melendez is focused on one of GUPE's many projects: providing breakfast and lunch to dozens of elderly residents who are homebound. The need pre-existed Hurricane Maria but has become more urgent in the storm's wake. Though it'll take considerable local and outside resources to provide those meals, Melendez is confident the nonprofit — and its supporters — can make it happen. ""When we fall down, or something happens or someone comes to the facilities and we don’t think we have anything for them,"" she says, ""someone else will say, 'I want to give you something if you need it.'""","The isolated coastal region of Patillas, Puerto Rico, lost power when Hurricane Maria slammed into the U.S. territory back in September.

Morgan Sung,"Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate were so destructive, no other hurricanes will be given the same names. The World Meteorological Organization announced Thursday that it's retiring the names Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate from its rotation because of 2017's devastating season. It's replacing the names with Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel instead. SEE ALSO: Shell knew truth of global warming in 1980s; foresaw a Hurricane Sandy scenario WMO names each hurricane based on an alphabetical rotation of names, alternating between male and female names. The selection of names for each rotation is usually used every six years, so we won't see Harold, Idalia, Margot, and Nigel come into use until 2023. If a hurricane is especially fatal and causes significant damage, its name is taken off the rotation and replaced with a different one. According to the WMO's FAQ, this naming system makes it easier for news outlets to report on the storms and increases community preparedness. ""Experience shows that the use of short, distinctive given names in written as well as spoken communications is quicker and less subject to error than the older more cumbersome latitude-longitude identification methods,"" WMO's FAQ says. WMO says that the 2017 hurricane season was ""one of the most destructive on record,"" with damages in the United States alone costing $250 billion. The 2017 hurricane season was one of the most destructive on record. Image: world METEOROLOGICAL organization The hurricanes taken off the WMO's rotation of names caused 224 deaths during their tropical cyclone phases. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria were the first Category 4 storms to make landfall in the United States on record. Irma and Maria both reached Category 5 storms when they made landfall on the Caribbean islands. The damage caused in the Caribbean is likely to take years to recover, according to WMO. Seventeen tropical storms were named in 2017, and 10 of those storms became hurricanes. Six reached ""major hurricane strength"" and clocked in at Category 3 or higher. This is above the average for annual storms; from 1981-2010, the average was 12 tropical storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. Harvey made landfall over or near Texas last August as a Category 4 hurricane. It lasted for four days, devastating Houston and causing the deaths of 68 people. It was the costliest hurricane after Katrina, causing an estimated $125 billion in damages. Irma caused significant destruction in the Caribbean as a Category 5 hurricane, nearly wiping out Barbuda. It was the first hurricane to make landfall in Cuba since 1932, and it prompted the evacuation of about 6 million people in southern Florida. Maria ripped through Dominica and Puerto Rico in September. Dominica's damages are estimated at $1.3 billion, or about 224 percent of its GDP according to WMO. The entire island of Puerto Rico lost power, which one report concluded was the second largest blackout in history. Nate crossed from Nicaragua to Honduras as a tropical storm, but made landfall as a category 1 hurricane. The rainfall from Nate caused 44 deaths in Central America. 2017 retired almost as many names as 2005, when the severe hurricane season resulted in WMO removing Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan, and Wilma from the rotation.","Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate were so destructive, no other hurricanes will be given the same names.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","After a sluggish start to eastern Pacific hurricane season, the basin is making up for lost time. Hurricane Bud is the second of back-to-back major hurricanes to form in less than a week. The Category 3 storm is currently churning toward Baja California, though it’s thankfully forecast to weaken before likely landfall this weekend. As of 3 a.m. local time this morning, Bud was still picking up steam roughly 235 miles south of Manzanillo, Mexico. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) put Bud’s winds at 115 mph, making it a Category 3 storm. That’s the threshold for classifying storms as major hurricanes. Meteorologist Ryan Maue tweeted a more recent satellite image with data indicating Bud had reached Category 4 strength with winds around 132 mph. Either way, it’s quite a difference from how the storm looked yesterday. At 4 a.m. local time on Sunday, Bud had winds of just 50 mph, making it a moderate tropical storm. But just as Aletta before it, Bud underwent rapid intensification thanks to warm waters and low wind shear. Rapid intensification is a term used when a storm’s winds increase 65 mph in less than 24 hours. The outer bands of Bud’s winds could reach Mexico, prompting the NHC to issue tropical storm watches from Manzanillo north to the Puerto Vallarta area. The agency also forecast that up to 10 inches of rain could fall in isolated locations on Tuesday and “cause life-threatening flash floods and mud slides.” From there, Bud will continue to lumber northward. While the storm is expected to strengthen a bit more in the next day or two, it will then begin gradually decaying as it moves over cooler waters. It could reach Baja California near Los Cabos by Saturday as a tropical storm where floods and mudslides could again be a concern. From there, Bud or its remnants could push into the Southwest. While it’s too early to forecast what locations could be impacted or when they could get hit, it’s worth remembering that tropical systems can bring major flash flooding to the region, so keep an eye out as the forecast develops. The remnants of Hurricane Newton reached Arizona in September 2016, the last time a tropical system impacted the Southwest. Eastern Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 without much fanfare. But the season has since gotten much more active. Bud follows Hurricane Aletta last week. That storm whipped up into a Category 4 hurricane on Friday, thankfully posing no threat to land. Aletta has since been downgraded to a tropical storm and is meandering westward into the Pacific as it weakens.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"“We’re in a downward spiral,” Mr. Cofiño said. The tuition increase was ratified on Monday by the federal control board that oversees the finances of Puerto Rico’s bankrupt government, which is $72 billion in debt because of an economic recession that has lasted 11 years. Most of protesters’ wrath on Tuesday was directed at the unpopular board, which they view as undemocratic. Puerto Rico’s elected leaders are subject to the board and to a federal judge handling the island’s bankruptcy in court. “This is an entity that was not elected by the people of Puerto Rico,” said Edwin Morales Laboy, the vice president of a teachers’ union that organized its members to attend the protest. Participating meant losing a day’s pay, since the government did not declare Tuesday a holiday. But teachers said they had no choice but to protest, given the plan by Puerto Rico’s Department of Education to close 280 of about 1,100 public schools on the island this summer, citing low enrollment. That comes after 179 schools were shuttered last year by the Rosselló administration. “We found out from the press,” said Lourdes Torres Santos, 31, who teaches at República del Perú, a San Juan middle school scheduled to close. “A lot of the teachers cried.” In the coming weeks, Ms. Torres expects to lose her job.

BRAD PLUMER,"The Battery area of Charleston, S.C., after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. Companies are seeking better climate forecasts to assess the risks of operating in the area. Credit Sean Rayford for The New York Times In Charleston, S.C., where the ports have been expanding to accommodate larger ships sailing through the newly widened Panama Canal, a real-estate developer named Xebec Realty recently went looking for land to build new warehouses and logistics centers. But first, Xebec had a question: What were the odds that the sites it was considering might be underwater in 10 or 20 years? After all, Charleston has repeatedly suffered major floods that can paralyze cargo operations. And scientists warn that flooding will worsen as sea levels rise and storms strengthen with climate change. Yet detailed information about the city’s climate risks proved surprisingly hard to find. Federal flood maps are based on historical data, and won’t tell you how sea-level rise could exacerbate flooding in the years ahead. Scientific reports on global warming, such as the National Climate Assessment, can tell you that heavy rainstorms are expected to increase in the Southeast, but they won’t tell you whether specific roads leading to a given warehouse might be unusable during those storms. So Xebec turned to a Silicon Valley start-up called Jupiter, which offered to analyze local weather and hydrological data and combine it with climate model projections to assess the potential climate risks Xebec might face in Charleston over the next few decades from things like heavier rainfall, sea level rise or increased storm surge. Although Jupiter’s forecasting skill remains unproven, Xebec was eager to participate in a pilot project. “If we could have reliable predictive analytics in this area, that’s a huge impact for our business,” said Scott Hodgkins, an executive vice president at Xebec. As companies around the world grow concerned about the risks of climate change, they have started looking for clarity on how warming might disrupt their operations in the future. But governments in the United States and Europe have been slow to translate academic research on global warming into practical, timely advice for businesses or local city planners. Now some private companies, like Jupiter, are trying to fill the gap. This remains a young and untested field, and it’s unclear whether Jupiter or others can succeed as profitable enterprises. Scientists caution that predicting short-term climate effects in specific locations remains rife with uncertainty. Jupiter will have to persuade potential customers that its forecasts are reliable enough to give companies a competitive edge. “In economics, information has value if you would make a different decision based on that information,” said Matthew E. Kahn, an economist who studies climate adaptation at the University of Southern California. “Is that the case here?” Some insurance companies, such as FM Global, already study climate risks and consult with clients on how to make their buildings more resilient to hurricanes that may get stronger in the future. In 2014, a start-up called Coastal Risk Consulting opened in South Florida to offer flood assessments to homeowners nervous about rising seas. Jupiter, founded in 2017 by Rich Sorkin, a longtime tech entrepreneur, wants to go a step further. The start-up has received $10 million in venture capital so far and has been hiring climate scientists, weather modelers and data experts from places like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Its co-founders include Todd D. Stern, the lead climate envoy in the Obama administration, and Jeff Wecker, the chief data officer for Goldman Sachs. The company is developing a variety of predictive tools, some of which look much like Google Maps, that it hopes will allow paying customers to zoom down to the city block level to get a better sense of the potential risks they face from storms, heat waves, wildfires or other climate-change effects in the coming decades. A map of Charleston generated by Jupiter that forecasts flooding from storm surges that have a 1 percent probability of occurring annually by 2030 under a high-end emissions scenario. Credit Jupiter Intel “We know the planet’s getting warmer and sea levels are rising, but on a hyperlocal basis, the quality of those predictions can be much better than it is,” Mr. Sorkin said. To create its flood maps, for instance, Jupiter looks not just at public data like satellite-based observations of rainfall and ocean currents, but also how changes in the urban landscape affect how water flows through cities. It then aims to harness recent advances in cloud-based supercomputing to combine that data with the latest climate model projections. The company’s scientists plan to continually test their forecasts against observations — to see, for instance, how well they predict flooding from major storms — and publish their research in scientific journals. In theory, the United States government could cobble much of this information together and present it in a usable way. But federal agencies tend to focus their resources on shorter-term weather predictions, and Congress has generally underfunded initiatives such as those at the Federal Emergency Management Agency to incorporate climate change into its federal flood maps. “If you want a full picture of flooding risk, you need expertise in weather, but also climate and hydrology and engineering and running complex models on the latest computer hardware,” Mr. Sorkin said. “All of those specialized disciplines are usually heavily siloed within the public sector or the scientific community.” Jupiter’s scientists will have to grapple with a number of technical challenges. While current climate models can provide broad statistical projections of how average temperatures and rainfall patterns are likely to shift across large regions over the coming century, it remains difficult to predict such shifts precisely over shorter time scales — which is what companies are often most concerned about. “Forecasting at 10-20 year time periods is perhaps the most difficult period to forecast,” Simon Mason, a climate scientist at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society who is not involved with Jupiter, wrote in an email. “If that is not enough, trying to predict severe weather events rather than long-term averages is even harder still!” Past efforts to provide what are known as “climate services” have struggled with this issue. In 2009, the German government established the Climate Service Center to provide information about global warming risks to cities and businesses. But Guy P. Brasseur, a climate scientist who helped start the center, said potential clients were often disappointed with the uncertainty in the resulting forecasts. “One airline wanted to know how often the airport in Frankfurt would be closed because of snowstorms next year,” Dr. Brasseur said. “We were unable to answer a question like that.” Jupiter, which acknowledges the uncertainties in climate forecasting, will have to prove that a market exists. But at least one firm in the insurance industry sees potential value in the company’s approach, particularly after flooding and other disasters caused $306 billion in damages last year in the United States and record losses by insurers. “That certainly raised the stakes in terms of trying to get the best possible science on your side when you’re pricing risk,” said John Drzik, president of global risk at Marsh, one of the world’s largest commercial insurance brokers, which is currently in talks with Jupiter to explore what types of data and risk analyses might be most useful to its clients. Mr. Drzik noted that many of the traditional catastrophic risk models used by the insurance industry are rooted largely in historical data and don’t always grapple fully with how climate change could shift those risks in the future. While his company is still evaluating whether Jupiter’s climate-oriented models are useful enough to be worth paying for, “it grabbed us as something that had a lot of promise.” As global warming advances, experts say that governments will ultimately have to invest more in their own local climate prediction tools to help cities and industries adapt. But they also see a role for private climate forecasters, much as weather companies have sprung up to supplement the work the National Weather Service does. “The federal government could be doing a lot more,” said James L. Buizer, who studies climate adaptation at the University of Arizona. “But there’s still an important role for the private sector. If companies are going to benefit from this information, they ought to be paying for it. After all, it’s their infrastructure that’s going to get trashed.”","The Battery area of Charleston, S.C., after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016.

Interview by DAN AMIRA,"Some people have suggested that if Puerto Ricans weren’t Hispanic, the United States government would have responded more effectively. Do you think that’s true? No, I don’t agree with that assessment. We need to understand that what happened in Puerto Rico already was on the shoulders of two other big hurricanes. I think the federal resources were tired. I do agree with President Trump, however, that there’s a lot of red tape. Hunger cannot wait a month or two for a contract. José Andrés is a Michelin-starred chef and the owner of ThinkFoodGroup. He is also the chairman of World Central Kitchen, an organization that fights hunger. Age: 48 Occupation: Chef Hometown: Mieres, Spain His Top 5 Sandwiches: 1. Bocadillo de calamares 2. Bikini 3. Beefsteak tomato 4. Pastrami on rye 5. Tuna omelet You had plans to open a restaurant in Donald Trump’s Washington hotel but canceled them in 2015 after he made defamatory comments about Mexicans. Was that a business decision or a moral decision? In this case, I think my line has been: It was a business decision. But all the good business decisions in the 21st century are smart moral decisions. After you settled your breach-of-contract lawsuit with the Trumps, you said in a statement that you hoped to “move forward cooperatively as friends.” Do you feel like you’re friends with the president now? No. Obviously. I mean, a friend is somebody you invite over for dinner. On the other hand, I always respected Ivanka. I hope that the best of Ivanka is going to show up, because I think she could be a very important force in moderating certain views of this administration — in relation to immigrants, in relation to women, in relation to morals. That hasn’t panned out yet. But I will be patient. We’ve all been daughters and sons of our fathers and mothers. And we know that those relationships are never easy. At least mine was not easy. What bothers you more about Trump — his position on immigration or his position on what constitutes good food? You know, yesterday my daughter challenged me to eat fast food on the highway from New York to Washington. Does that make me a worse chef? That I ate at a Wendy’s in the middle of the highway? Did you like it? It was awesome. The chicken was crispy, the bacon was crispy. The bread looked like a photo from Wendy’s. I was very impressed. I was not expecting that. But what really bothers me about President Trump is the moral compass. I really hope we will see a maturing of this president. You think he just needs a little more time? I never give up on people.

JAMES WAGNER,"The league also reduced the players’ maximum stipend — essentially gas and extra spending money — to $100 from about $300 for a weekend. Some players with professional experience, like Cayey’s Fernando Cabrera, 36, the top starting pitcher in the league who once pitched for the Baltimore Orioles and Cleveland Indians, get tips from fans on the side for winning. “It’ll be a tougher season: doubleheaders, under the sun, the lower pay, the traveling,” said Richard González, 29, the Toritos second baseman. “But at the end of the day, we’re doing what we love to do, which is to play baseball and for the people of Cayey.” The extra cash would have helped González, who started his own baseball equipment business called Dux Sports after playing college baseball at Virginia Commonwealth University. When he wasn’t drafted by a major league team, he returned to Puerto Rico and is in his eighth season playing in the Doble A. After Hurricane Maria hit, González lost power in his home in Caguas, a city 30 minutes south of San Juan, for three months. He didn’t have a generator, cellphone service was dead, and orders for his baseball equipment went unfilled, so he spent two months with family and his business partner in Tampa. He returned in December. “If you play this league for the money, you don’t have a chance,” he said. “You play because of your love and passion for baseball.” The Toritos’ manager, Edgardo Lebrón, 35, a former Minnesota Twins minor leaguer who works at a baseball academy, said his home in Las Piedras, an hour from Cayey, sustained $70,000 worth of damage and the electricity still has not returned. He has spent thousands on gasoline to feed a generator. As Lebrón stopped his front door from being blown away by the hurricane winds, he said his 10-year-old son turned to him, crying, and said, “Dad, let’s pray; we’re going to die.” Continue reading the main story","Puerto Rico’s pre-eminent amateur league has played every season since 1940.

MICHAEL TACKETT,"Mr. Long said Peter Gaynor, the deputy administrator, would serve as acting administrator.
Mr. Long earned plaudits for FEMAs response to Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas and Louisiana in 2017. Assessing the damage in Texas, President Trump praised Mr. Long as a man who really has become very famous on television in the last couple of days.
But he came under withering criticism for FEMAs handling of relief efforts after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico later that year, including a call last month from Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts and a candidate for president, for Mr. Long to resign.
Hurricane Maria eventually caused almost 3,000 deaths and left thousands without electricity for months, and Hurricane Harvey killed nearly 70 people. Those storms combined with others in 2017 caused an estimated $300 billion in damage.
Mr. Long came to Washington with a strong reputation for skilled handling of disaster management, and White House officials often praised his professionalism. But that standing was undercut by the inspector generals report, which noted that Mr. Long had also used a government vehicle for personal purposes while on a family vacation in Hawaii.
The FEMA administrator is supposed to be focused on preparing for disasters like the devastating hurricanes that killed thousands of Americans in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands not using government vehicles to shuttle his family around Hawaii at taxpayer expense, Representative Elijah E.

RICK ROJAS and LUIS FERRÉ-SADURNÍ,"Where the families in the hotels will ultimately end up remains to be seen. In lobby of the Hartford hotel, one woman said that her daughter had gotten a nursing job and that her family was looking for an apartment. Among others, there was an air of weariness, as they anguished over what might come next. Job interviews had been unsuccessful or language barriers made it difficult to find work. Some were simply aimless as weeks went by with little to do. When Ms. Febres needed to go to the store, her family made the three-mile walk to a Walmart just because they wanted to burn energy. Many were still reeling from the trauma that has festered since the storm. Ms. Arroyo was flown to New York City on Nov. 15 and spent two weeks with an aunt before checking into a hotel in Corona, Queens. She suffers from a litany of medical conditions, including diabetes and depression. She needs a wheelchair and is blind in her left eye, which is covered by a patch of white gauze taped to her reading glasses. After the storm and before her evacuation to New York, she was largely confined to her bed in her home in Ponce, cared for by her father’s widow. Stuck in sweltering heat, she worried that wounds on her body would become infected. She was so fearful she even wrote a will and instructions to cremate her remains on the back of a photograph of her father and mother, which she clutched in her hands as she slept. “I don’t know how I survived,” she said. Yanitza Cruz, who is nearly eight months pregnant, was told when she checked into the hotel in Queens in December that she could stay until Feb. 14. She has become increasingly worried as the deadline approaches; her calls to FEMA yielded few answers. When she tried to check the status of her case online, the website said it had been “withdrawn.” “The clock is ticking,” she said. “Time is against us.” She traveled to Queens with her husband, Joel García, and 5-year-old daughter, Janesty, from the mountain town of Orocovis, southwest of San Juan. They had been drawn by the promise that New York appeared to offer, fueling hopes of getting an apartment and, for Mr. García, becoming a licensed barber in the city he saw as a “barbershop mecca.” It seemed different from home, where they struggled even before the hurricane. “We didn’t even have a car in Puerto Rico,” Mr. García said. “We would walk with our bags under the sun. Now we’re in a place where for $2.75 I can travel to Brooklyn. I see this as an opportunity. But the thing is, we haven’t found stability yet. I’m just looking for stability.” It is difficult to tell when that stability might ever come, but last week they did receive a measure of relief. FEMA called to let them know they could stay in the hotel another month. Rick Rojas reported from Hartford, and Luis Ferré-Sadurní from New York.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Its been more than a year since Hurricane Maria ran roughshod over Puerto Rico, but the island is still struggling to escape from under its long shadow. New imagery released on Monday at the American Geophysical Unions annual meeting shows the challenges of getting the light back on. The insights the researchers reveal could be used to help respond to the next disaster on the island or anywhere throughout the Caribbean. The images are what NASA calls its black marble. Its like the blue marblesatellite images of Earth in the daytimebut for nighttime viewing. To create them, NASA scientists looked at satellite images captured at night and weeded out fires, reflective surfaces like lakes that might catch the glimmer of the moon, and other natural sources of light. They took what was leftall the human sources of lightand overlaid it on a striking black map of Puerto Rico. The before-Maria image is vibrant, showing San Juan shining bright like a diamond, and the constellation of smaller cities like Ponce, Mayaguez, and Caguas lit up like Orions belt across the southern tier of the territory. But in images of Puerto Rico after Maria, which struck as a Category 5 monster in September 2017, the entire island is basically dark as only those with solar panels or generators were able to light up their houses. The lights slowly flickered back on, but NASA scientists found that, perhaps not surprisingly, rural areas struggled to power back up. More than 40 percent of long-lasting power outages occurred in rural locales despite being home to much smaller populations. By comparison, just 29 percent of the long-duration outages were in urban areas, places that are largely more wealthy. The lack of light in the countryside is what drove Puerto Rico to have the second-longest blackout ever recorded anywhere in the world. It also neatly illustrates that the poorest suffer the most from climate catastrophe and that inequality is likely to intensify as the planet warms and violent weather becomes more common. With the power out, it wasnt just a question of not being able to watch television, but a question of life and death. According to NASA, areas with prolonged power outages also lacked access to medical resources. A landmark study commissioned by the Puerto Rican government earlier this year found Hurricane Maria led to 2,975 excess deaths on the island, some of which were due to lack of medicine or care. But if the new research shows where governments and Puerto Ricos utility failed during Maria, it also points to opportunities for how to improve disaster response and preparedness for the next storm. By visualizing where the outages lasted the longest, utility crews could pre-position tools or develop plans for how to access and restore power quicker. Ditto for first responders. The maps also reveal where it may make sense to prioritize grid improvements or install community or rooftop solar and battery storage.

Aimée Lutkin,"Hurricane Florence has hit the North Carolina coast, already causing massive flooding in inland towns along rivers. Meteorologists are anticipating that Florence will linger and move further inland over the weekend, which means a lot of people are going to need rescue and relief. Here’s how you can help. Local Organizations Though it’s quite easy to donate to the American Red Cross via text, and they’re incredibly well-known across the country, they’re also an organization that’s been plagued with accusations of mismanagement and other mistakes. In general, it’s often best to contribute to local groups who have a better idea of what’s needed and a smaller internal infrastructure sucking up money. For the purposes of this article, we’re focusing on those. The North Carolina Community Foundation (NCCF) is a “highly-rated charity currently providing aid to the Carolinas ahead of Florence” according to ABC News, and it partners with local charities, so you know your money is being directed by people most familiar with the area. Here’s their website for donations. There are also South Carolina and Georgia state chapters of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster who each offer recommendations of which relief organizations they would choose, if you want to investigate where your money is headed. Finally, there’s The North Carolina Disaster Fund, which purports to assist with “unmet needs in the aftermath of a disaster.” These are the groups that will be in the Carolinas helping people get back on their feet long after the waters recede. Team Rubicon Team Rubicon is a group of military veterans who mobilize for rescue efforts in disasters. According to their website, they have 9,979 volunteers across VA, NC, SC, and GA and have already positioned equipment and boats along the coast to sweep in where they’re needed. Americares Americares focuses on health in disaster relief, and they currently have a response team ready for North Carolina: “The storm is on track to make a direct hit on the East Coast and impact much of the southern United States in the coming days,” Americares Director of Emergency Response Brian Scheel said in a statement Monday. “Our response team has been activated and is ready to meet the immediate health needs in affected communities.” Donations to Americares are directed to emergency medicine and other health supplies, and you can contribute here. GlobalGiving GlobalGiving supports local and grassroots groups working to restore areas hit by disasters, and they’ve already started their Hurricane Florence relief fund. Some of that money will be directed towards immediate needs, but much of it will go towards long term projects restoring the community once the storm has passed. Things are… not great now. Hurricane season is clobbering the Caribbean, earthquakes are plaguing… Read more Read American Humane and the Charleston Animal Society Don’t forget our furry friends. Vulnerable animals will need to be rescued from homes where they are abandoned and shelter animals will also be in need. National nonprofit organization American Human and the Charleston Animal Society are already helping move cats and bunnies around and above the water line in Virginia and the Carolinas. Finally, if you happen to be within range now or in the next few weeks (or possibly months), you can volunteer.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","It’s the statistical peak of Atlantic hurricane season today, and it appears the message has been received. The tropical Atlantic has spawned three hurricanes, but none is more worrisome than Hurricane Florence. The National Hurricane Center advisory at 11 a.m. listed Florence as a Category 3 storm, with winds of 115 mph. That’s the threshold for major hurricanes. A hurricane hunter aircraft passed through at noon, however, and found Florence had winds of 130 mph, making it a Category 4 storm. Forecasts indicate Florence will continue to undergo rapid intensification, a meteorological term for when a storm see sustained winds increase at least 35 mph over a 24-hour period. “Further strengthening is anticipated, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday,” the National Hurricane center wrote in its Monday morning update. The unfortunate forecast is due to a few factors. All weekend, Florence had strong upper level winds that kept it from really being able to wind up. But those winds have since slackened and Florence’s structure has become much more stable from Sunday night into Monday. Weekly sea surface temperature departure from normal in the Atlantic. Image: NOAA The second big factor favoring Florence’s rapid intensification is the remarkably warm ocean. The storm is cruising over an area where ocean surface temperatures are up to 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), providing more fuel to turbocharge the hurricane. Those temperatures are about 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal for this time of year. “Now that Florence has these ingredients, and is developing a ring of intense storms around its eye, it will likely continue to strengthen to a major hurricane, likely a Category 4 storm soon,” Brian Tang, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Albany, told Earther shortly before the Category 3 and Category 4 updates came in. Tang pointed to Harvey, Irma, and Maria last year as examples of other rapidly intensifying hurricanes in the Atlantic. But Florence still stands out in how much it’s expected to intensify. University of Oklahoma meteorology PhD student Sam Lillo tweeted that Sunday’s Florence forecast from the National Hurricane Center called for it to be the most rapidly intensifying Atlantic storm in the past 20 years. It’s a shockingly high-confidence forecast, but one that’s based on all available lines of evidence. “Given that these models have been unanimous, cycle after cycle, in predicting Florence undergoing rapid intensification, it has given forecasters at the NHC confidence to also forecast rapid intensification,” Tang said. Research published earlier this year indicates the magnitude of rapidly intensifying Atlantic storms is on the rise. Using satellite data from 1986-2015, the researchers found that rapidly intensifying storms saw wind speeds increase 4.4 mph per decade in the eastern and central Atlantic (there was no trend in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico). The researchers attribute this to the positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), which is marked by warm waters in the Atlantic. But they also don’t rule out a climate change, which has warmed oceans the world over. Whatever the role the AMO and climate change play in influencing Florence, the impacts of the storm will likely be acute and potentially deadly. The storm is expected to smash into the East Coast by late Thursday delivering powerful surge, winds, and torrential rains. If you live anywhere between Georgia and New Jersey, pay very close attention to the forecast in the coming days.","It’s the statistical peak of Atlantic hurricane season today, and it appears the message has been received.

The category five storm also wreaked havoc on the habitat of the tiny island's world-famous frigatebird colony. Codrington Lagoon is said to be the second-largest nesting area outside the Galapagos and has attracted tourists for decades. Image copyright Courtesy of Antigua &amp; Barbuda Tourism Authority Image caption Tourists and bird watchers were drawn to the lagoon because of its rich birdlife But most of the erstwhile 10,000-strong frigatebird population disappeared in the immediate aftermath of the disaster when the catastrophic winds destroyed the mangroves in which they nest and breed. The aptly named magnificent frigatebirds are famed for their colossal 7ft (2.1m) wingspan and the males' spectacular show of flirting by puffing out their throats into a bright red balloon during mating season. Frigatebirds: Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Earned the nickname ""man o' war birds"" due to their habit of aggressively stealing food from other birds Females select mates and form monogamous pairs for the duration of the breeding season Females lay just one egg, every other year Juvenile frigatebirds stay with the mother for up to two years Graceful in flight, they are clumsy on land because of their short legs and small feet They have called this pristine, peaceful area on Antigua's sister island home for as long as residents can remember. Happily, the birds have started to return and even build nests in the fragile, decaying stumps of the once luscious trees. Numbers are now set to rise further thanks to an imminent mangrove restoration project being funded by a team of four transatlantic rowers who are also ardent local environmentalists. Tough challenge In January, Team Antigua completed the gruelling 3,000-mile (4,800km) Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge race from the Canary Islands to Antigua in just 30 days, taking second place. John Watt, Scott Potter, Nico Psihoyos and Eli Fuller raised more than $150,000 (£112,000) towards their goal of creating a marine park in Antigua. Image copyright Courtesy of Atlantic Campaigns Image caption Team Antigua rowed 3,000 miles from the Canary Island of La Gomera to Antigua ""We decided to give a third of the money to Barbuda and we were keen for it to be an environmental project,"" Mr Fuller explains. ""The bird sanctuary is critically important for Codrington economically. And ecologically, you won't find many places as crucial as Barbuda. It's not just birds - it's a vital nesting ground for critically endangered hawksbill turtles too."" The sanctuary has long been a significant source of revenue for Barbudans, several of whom earn a living as tour guides. ""Some people do as many as three trips a day in high season,"" says part-time guide Devon Warner. 'Great relief' Seeing the area stripped of vegetation and devoid of birds in the first days after the storm was ""horrifying"", park manager Kelly Burton tells the BBC. Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Image caption Before Hurricane Irma hit, the mangroves were healthy and full of frigatebirds Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Image caption After Irma, the picture was bleak ""The first thing going through my mind was, would they ever come back?"" Mr Burton recalls. ""Seeing the birds return and nest was a great relief. Many have chicks right now so they will be here at least another year or two. The restoration will be a huge help."" Many of the birds live year round in Barbuda. Others travel between the Caribbean and the Galapagos and there are a handful of other known nesting sites in the region, Mr Burton says. Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Image caption Frigatebirds nest in the mangroves so restoring them is key ""But the healthiest place is Barbuda. Scientists once took blood samples from the birds to see why ours were so healthy. They think it's due to the low levels of mercury in the fish they eat."" The non-profit Waitt Institute will oversee the mangrove project as part of its marine conservation partnership with the Barbuda Council, known as Blue Halo Barbuda. The process involves collecting several thousand seeds - or propagules - from coastal areas and planting them in a new purpose-built nursery, says science and field manager Andy Estep. ""They will soak in little pots for six months to a year before being planted at the sanctuary,"" he explains. 'Full of life' The $50,000 donated by the rowers will be spent on equipment and supplies for the nursery and a salary for its manager, plus travel expenses for visiting experts from the University of the West Indies. Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Image caption The frigatebirds on Barbuda are particularly healthy, experts say Barbudans will be trained to run the nursery and grow propagules for future programmes. Preliminary assessments to gauge the quality of the water in the lagoon, along with salinity, acidity and oxygen levels to help predict how well the young mangroves will thrive, are now poised to begin. ""More than half of the tree mass was lost to Irma,"" Mr Estep continues. ""If we can return it to its former state, that would be fantastic. It's a beautiful place normally and so full of life as one of the two biggest reproductive hotspots for frigatebirds."" Image copyright Shayna Brody, Waitt Institute Image caption Environmentalists were worried the birds would not return Nine months after the storm ripped Barbuda apart, causing damage estimated at $220m, islanders are battling on to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives. Just like the birds, Barbudans too are slowly coming home. Around 500 of the former 1,800 residents have so far returned from Antigua to rebuild homes and businesses. Reviving the touristic offerings will be key, argues Mr Burton. ""The frigates are also our national bird and something unique to Barbuda. They're been part of the landscape forever,"" he says. ""They choose to make this place their home; it's up to us, as stewards of the land, to look after it for them.""",Frigatebirds almost disappeared from Barbuda after Hurricane Irma hit but now they are back.,2018-06-25T00:35:04Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Barbuda sees a comeback of national bird after Hurricane Irma,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-44547090,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13472/production/_102126987_f31af90f-515e-4bfc-bd28-a6733fc82fdf.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Hurricane,1
Rachel Becker,"After intensifying overnight, Hurricane Michael is now pummeling the Florida Panhandle as a Category 4 storm — the strongest hurricane on record to ever strike the region. Hundreds of thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate as Michael’s winds top speeds of 145 miles per hour, NBC News reports. Storm surge is expected to bring flood waters reaching 14 feet high — and already, there are “life threatening storm surge and catastrophic winds moving on shore,” the National Hurricane Center says. For those who stayed put, it’s time to seek shelter out of the way of waves and wind, Florida Governor Rick Scott warned on Twitter: “The time for evacuating along the coast has come and gone.” An extreme wind warning is currently in effect for locations between Laguna Beach and Eastpoint until 2:15PM ET. Wind gusts in excess of 130 mph are expected. Shelter in place IMMEDIATELY! #HurricaneMichael pic.twitter.com/jogpNWMwTv — NWS Tallahassee (@NWSTallahassee) October 10, 2018 The storm is unusually strong because of a few things: warm water in the Gulf, favorable wind conditions, and humidity. “Those are the perfect ingredients for a storm like this to really blossom,” says Marshall Shepherd, director of the University of Georgia’s atmospheric sciences program and former president of the American Meteorological Society. It’s possible the storm could get stronger still before landfall, the National Hurricane Center says. And after Hurricane Michael hits, Shepherd doubts we’ll see a hurricane with the same name again. “It’s a life-altering, society-altering situation,” he says. “Storms of this magnitude and impact, the name is typically retired. And I fully expect this to be the case for Michael.” The Verge spoke with Shepherd about Hurricane Michael’s unprecedented strength. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. How did Hurricane Michael get so strong? Overnight it’s really blossomed into a Category 4, and the primary reasons are that it was moving into very warm water, which is somewhat unusual for this late in October. It moved into a very favorable upper wind situation where there was not very much wind shear, and there’s a lot of moisture in the eastern United States out ahead of a cold front that’s coming from the west. When Michael was further south, it was in a very difficult wind shear environment. As you know, hurricanes don’t like wind shear — when the winds change direction or speed as you go up in altitude. One of the things that’s really interesting about Hurricane Michael is that it was very resilient. It was actually still intensifying even in an environment with a lot of wind shear, which was odd. So I knew once it got into an environment with less wind shear and over warm Gulf waters, the thing was going to just explode — and that’s what we’re seeing. From space, satellites from @NASAEarth + @NOAA see #HurricaneMichael as a major hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. Our latest space views: https://t.co/BvWmva7yU8 Latest storm weather from @NWS : https://t.co/Qk1x9RNd0k Be prepared + @FEMA resources: https://t.co/q2cgBnVW3h pic.twitter.com/wFhoVKGbU2 — NASA (@NASA) October 10, 2018 Is there anything else that can explain how Michael intensified so rapidly? We’ve been seeing these hot towers — these tall thunderstorms that form in the eyewall of the hurricane. I’ve been talking about these since my days as a scientist at NASA, because there are studies that show that when you have these hot towers, they’re more likely to indicate that the storm will go through a rapid intensification phase because they’re releasing so much heat that all that water vapor is condensing into cloud water in the storm. When water vapor condenses to form cloud water, it releases this burst of heat called latent heat — that’s really the fuel supply for these hurricane heat engines. When you have these hot towers, they’re like the supercharged pistons in the engine, if you will. You’ve got this ample warm water, you’ve got not a lot of wind shear overnight when the storm really intensified, so you can have a very efficient engine where all this water vapor is being converted to energy. What sort of hazards can we expect from the hurricane? If it stays at this intensity, and there’s evidence that it’s even still intensifying at this moment, this is going to be the strongest storm, at least on record, to ever hit this part of Florida. I think a lot of times we can overemphasize, or over play, the wind threat in a hurricane. I don’t think that’s the case with this one. There’s going to be significant wind impacts, not only at the landfall point and around the Panhandle of Florida because the storm is so large, it’s so strong. And because of the pace that it’s moving, even inland in parts of Alabama and Georgia there are going to be hurricane strength winds. So the winds are going to be a significant impact. The storm surge could be record-breaking in the coastal regions to the right of the storm. We could be seeing record eight to 13, perhaps more, feet of storm surge. [We] can’t downplay the rain. It’s not going to be a situation like Harvey and Florence where the thing stalls out and dumps three or four feet of rain. But there still could be half a foot to a foot of rainfall. And then, of course, to the right of the storm as it moves into Georgia and the Carolinas, you’ll get the tornado threats, too. It’s a horrible situation. Is it late in the year to be seeing a hurricane in the Gulf? I thought we were past the peak of hurricane season. Keep in mind with water, it takes several months for the transition from cold to warm and warm to cold. Even though air temperatures are starting to cool down, the heat characteristics of water means that the water has residual warmth for a while. That’s why the peak of the hurricane season is typically in September even though the actual hurricane season starts in June. So there’s this lag. So the waters are gradually starting to cool down from that peak in September, but they’re still typically warm enough to support hurricanes. We get hurricanes all of the time in October, that’s not unprecedented. And frankly when we do get October hurricanes, they form exactly where Michael formed, which is down in the southern Caribbean and moving into the Gulf. This is exactly what we expect from an October hurricane. I’m just cautioning that there is nothing particularly unique about a hurricane in October that takes this particular track. But yes, it certainly is interesting that it has tapped into enough warm water to explosively develop. How is climate change contributing to Hurricane Michael’s intensification? Storms like this are undoubtedly pushing more water into the coast because sea levels are higher. So when we have these types of storms and storm surge, the storm will be pushing a higher level of water than it would 50 or 70 years ago. That is something that I’m very comfortable saying, but I think only the studies over time will play out whether the warmer oceans — because of our broader, background climate change — are fueling more higher-octane storms. Physically, we understand that that should be the case, I want to clarify that. We understand from a scientific standpoint that a warming climate is causing warmer oceans, and you would think from a physics understanding of how these storms work that would lead to more intense storms. Whether I can say conclusively that that’s why this particular storm is more intense, I just think it would be irresponsible for me to speculate on that. What’s your advice to people in the area? It’s almost too late if you’re in Florida to do anything. People should have been gone a day or two ago. If they stayed in, all we can do is pray and hope that they’re okay. As the storm moves further inland, I am concerned that people further inland in my state of Georgia, for example, may not be really aware of the fact that they’re going to experience strong tropical storm to weak hurricane force winds in some parts well inland. I think that might catch a few people off guard. So hopefully they’re prepared for long power outages, perhaps trees falling down on their homes or in their yards. And for Georgia, I’m even worried about crop damage. That part of Georgia is a very agriculturally intense region of our state. It’s harvest time for some crops, so I even worry about that. How fast are we expecting this storm to move through the region? This storm is going to move quickly, which won’t mean four feet of rain like we saw in Florence or Harvey. But the downside of a quick-moving storm is that places further inland still feel the impact of a pretty powerful punch from the hurricane, because it takes a while to weaken. This is a very different storm than a Florence and a Harvey, but it carries its own unique threats because of the fact that places inland will see hurricane force winds or strong tropical storm force winds.","After intensifying overnight, Hurricane Michael is on track to pummel the Florida Panhandle on October 10th as a Category 4 storm.

THE NEW YORK TIMES,"Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations for the National Weather Service, called the storm a “mid-latitude cyclone” — as opposed to a hurricane, which is a tropical cyclone. “If it comes close enough to the coast, you can get a walloping snowfall,” Mr. Carbin said Tuesday afternoon. Tuesday was already cold, with high temperatures ranging from 0 degrees in the Northeast to the low 40s in parts of North Florida. It was in the 20s and 30s in parts of Texas, where much of the state was under a freeze warning. A shot of Arctic air will reinforce that cold and feed the storm, according to Mr. Carbin, who noted that a stretch from Louisiana to Georgia had already seen snow a few weeks ago. “We are,” he said, “in the depths of winter.” Southern governors encourage residents to stay aware. Mr. Deal was among the Georgia politicians who received criticism after a winter storm paralyzed Atlanta in 2014. In a statement on Tuesday evening, he noted that the state Department of Transportation had sent all of its brine trucks, as well as 75 plows, to southeast Georgia. “I encourage all Georgians in the potentially impacted areas to stay informed, get prepared and be safe,” he said. In North Carolina on Tuesday afternoon, Gov. Roy Cooper warned that the forecast for his state — up to five inches of snow in eastern counties — could change quickly. “A small change in a storm’s track can make a big difference in how much snow falls and where,” Mr. Cooper said. The state’s emergency management director, Mike Sprayberry, said counties were preparing to open warming centers if they were needed, and state officials said workers were already dumping brine onto roadways, overpasses and bridges from Raleigh eastward. The conditions also led to the shutdown, or planned closure, of ports in Savannah, Ga., and Charleston. Officials at other major ports said Wednesday morning that they were monitoring conditions and could close them later in the week.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Atlantic hurricane season begins on June 1, but preparedness season is in full swing. Or at least, it would be if the federal government wasnt shut down. 
Of all the trouble the shutdown has brought upon the weather community, this might be the most impactful. Putting the off-season on hold over Trumps imaginary border emergency could result in real life-and-death consequences if a hurricane strikes U.S. shores this year.
Last year saw two multi-billion dollar hurricanes hit the U.S.. The year before was the costliest hurricane season in history. Yet losses wouldve been much worse if not for National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the U.S. hurricane programimprovements, ranging from narrowing the cone of uncertainty that shows a storms projected path to refining response plans. The bulk of those improvements happen at this time of year, when the odds of hurricanes are low and scientists and program managers can turn to long-term projects. The NHC, along with a host of other federal agencies from the Environmental Monitoring Center to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) analyze data, tweak forecasts and models, and provide training to local emergency managers, all so every American can get better forecasts and evacuation warnings. 
All that has come to a grinding halt as the shutdown has dragged on.
We had a ton of projects we want to do, Eric Blake, the union steward for the NHC, told Earther. They keep getting whittled down one by one by one.
One of those projects is an annual training organized by FEMA in the winter and spring around the countrythat brings in people from local and state government responsible for creating and executing hurricane plans. They could be fire marshals, emergency managers, or politicians. The NHC assists with those trainings by providing some basic meteorological knowledge, including how its forecasts and products work and where to find them. The first training wouldve been last week, but it didnt happen due to the shutdown.
These people wear many hats, and now theyre missing one, Blake said of the emergency planners who are normally at the trainings. 
The loss of projects could be equally problematic for hurricane preparedness. The NHC added storm surge warnings to the suite of ways it communicates risk to the public in 2014. Those warnings arent yet operational for Puerto Rico, which was lashed by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Blake said the agency had plans to extend storm surge warnings to the island in time for the 2019 season, but that efforts now on hold and could be scrapped completely.
The NHC cant even advertise jobs for the eight positions it currently has open,including lead marine forecaster, executive officer, and a handful of interns. For a chief scientist position it did have posted, the NHC cant hire anyone. 
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the NHC, said in a statement to Earther that the hurricane models werent slated for a major upgrade this year. But any slight tweaks and talks between the modelers and NHC staff, conversations that could inadvertently yield breakthroughs, are on hold while the shutdown wears on.
Projects like the Puerto Rico storm surge warnings could still happen depending on when the shutdown ends and job postings are still likely to go up, but theyll happen as federal workers face a backlog of work.
Not everyone is off the job, however. Blake and fellow employees deemed essential are working without pay to put out maritime forecasts for U.S. coasts and keeping an eye out for any oddball tropical storms that may form in the offseason. But theyre cut off from all their partners that would normally be working to prepare for hurricane season and putting American lives at risk. Blake likened it to a football game, which seems fitting given this weekends conference championships.
Lets say in the U.S. hurricane program, the National Hurricane Center would be a quarterback, he said. Youre not sending out rest of team. So what are you doing? Were basically standing still.
Blake and everyone else working on hurricanes will work like hell to be ready once the shutdown ends. But the longer it draws, the more likely theyll be using last years game plan. And even then, players could still be running around the locker room looking for their equipment when the lights go up on Atlantic hurricane season on June 1.

CHRIS DIXON and CAMPBELL ROBERTSON,"In a bad wind, a pile can quickly become an arsenal or at least clog storm drains. So far, though, the brunt of the storm has missed the areas with the most flood debris. Still, recovery efforts will be slow, officials said, as some flood-prone areas that had begun to rebuild now have to wait for waters to recede again. Theres people who had their homes damaged during Florence and now theres going to be some winds that could further damage their homes and property, said Mike Sprayberry, the director of the North Carolina Emergency Management agency, describing how a 50-mile-an-hour gust could rip the tarp off a house that was in the midst of repairs, sending rain pouring back inside. Federal disaster recovery centers set up in the Carolinas after Florence were closed on Thursday because of Michael. Schools in many parts of North Carolina have yet to reopen after Florence close to 90,000 students have been out of school for weeks. As Michael came into the state, there were more than 575 people still in shelters from the last storm and many others who would have likely needed them but are living in hotel rooms paid for with temporary disaster aid. In an era of climate change, the reality of the last few disasters just means a head start on this one. It almost just feels like another day at the office now, said Harrison Cahill, the spokesman for Lexington County, S.C., talking of a neighborhood with flooded homes in the county. He knew the homes firsthand, having visited in his previous job as a newspaper reporter, when they flooded in 2015.","Communities in the Carolinas already battered by Hurricane Florence faced a new onslaught: Hurricane Michael, downgraded to a tropical storm, but still packing a punch.",2018-10-11T22:52:23Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",They Were Still Recovering from Hurricane Florence.

MICHAEL KIMMELMAN and CHRISTOPHER GREGORY,"People usually opt to preserve their communities and ties to the land, even if it means living in harms way, points out Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist at N.Y.U. whose specialty is social resilience. They have seen enough projects go wrong to suspect that theyre better off risking the next big storm and staying home, where at least they have friends and family nearby.
Carmen Ayendez, who lived in Vietnam much of her life, said her father four years ago took up the governments offer of a new home in Sunset Harbor, one of three housing projects built by the municipality of Guaynabo Vietnam straddles Guaynabo, a mostly prosperous district outside San Juan, and the adjacent municipality of Cataño with the purpose of relocating Vietnams residents.
When her father died two days after signing the new lease, Ms. Ayendez took over the house. But shortly after moving, she started waking in the night, unable to breathe.
It turned out the new house was plagued by mold. Ms. Ayendez hasnt been able to get rid of it. When Maria hit, her roof cracked. She was supposed to be safer in Sunset Harbor.
I preferred living in Vietnam, she said. I built my own house there on a piece of land that my dad gave me when I was 19. It was a wooden house. It had bats and worms, but not mold. I had my friends and neighbors. The roof wasnt very secure, but it was home.
To protect its residents from evictions and gentrification, San Juans largest barrio, on the banks of the Martín Peña canal, has been operating as a community land trust for some years. It ensures everyone in the barrio has rights, a stake and a say. The trust has negotiated voluntary relocations where the clogged, polluted and frequently overflowing canal needs to be dredged or widened and homes get in the way.
Evelyn Quiñones, 63, one of the communitys leaders, showed me the house she agreed to move to a few years ago, on a street just outside the barrio. The decision to leave wasnt easy, she said. It made all the difference that the choice to move was hers, the new house was in good shape and that her relocation improved conditions for people inside the barrio.",Hurricane Maria led to a host of new plans to fix island barrios plagued by chronic flooding.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by AJ Dellinger to Gizmodo","Just an extremely normal radar loop of a tropical cyclone over Indiana. GIF: National Weather Service The early start to hurricane season continues with what could be the first landfalling tropical cyclone to make it to Lake Michigan on record. Tropical Depression Alberto has been the weird storm that could, improbably moving from the Gulf of Mexico to Indiana. The last advisory the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued for the storm, which came at 4 p.m. Central Time, noted that flash flood watches associated with the storm extend across the Appalachians from Georgia to Virginia. The storm already triggered flooding in North Carolina earlier on Wednesday. But the real weird part is where Alberto is centered, 70 miles south of South Bend, Indiana where the outer bands are already bringing rain to the city. South Bend itself is about 25 miles southeast of Lake Michigan, and the storm’s current track could clip or even make it all the way to the lake. That would make Alberto the first tropical system to ever hit Lake Michigan’s shores (h/t hurricane expert Brian McNoldy ). Beyond Lake Michigan, only seven tropical systems have ever made it to the Great Lakes according to data on historical hurricane tracks maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. All have struck Lakes Huron, Erie or Ontario, the three easternmost lakes. Of the tropical systems that have made it that far north, three even managed to hit the lakes as full blown hurricanes. In comparison, Alberto is quite a bit weaker. It’s currently a tropical depression with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph. But its present status just adds to Alberto’s strange tale. The storm has been a meteorological oddity since its inception in the Gulf of Mexico. It spun up there as a subtropical storm, borrowing elements from tropical weather like hurricanes and extratropical weather like nor’easters. The storm made landfall along the Gulf Coast over the weekend in its subtropical form. But rather than petering out or going full extratropical, the storm made a bizarre transition to a tropical system over land. On Tuesday, the NHC began calling the storm Tropical Depression Alberto. Since then, it has chugged through the Midwest with heavy rain bands swirling around its center. The storm could be maintaining its tropical nature through “brown ocean effect,” a gross-sounding meteorological phenomenon where waterlogged soil can mimic the ocean and provide fuel to storms (Marshall Shepherd, the atmospheric scientist who helped coin the term, has a great primer on it if you want to geek out). Regardless of whether it makes landfall ( or is it waterfall ?) on the shores of Lake Michigan, Alberto has been a whacky kickoff to hurricane season.",The early start to hurricane season continues with what could be the first landfalling tropical cyclone to make it to Lake Michigan on record.

The US territory's power authority, known as Prepa, said it was working to restore service to almost 3.4 million people within 24 to 36 hours. Prepa said an excavator operated by a contractor in the southern region of the island caused the blackout. It is the latest and largest disruption to hit the island's recovery efforts. A Prepa spokesperson said it was prioritising returning power to hospitals, San Juan's airport, water pumping systems and financial systems.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright NASA/NOAA The past year has been a busy one for hurricanes. There were 17 named storms in 2017, 10 hurricanes and six major hurricanes (category 3 or higher) - an above average year in each respect. The 10 hurricanes formed consecutively, without weaker tropical storms interrupting the sequence. The only other time this has been recorded was in 1893. Are these storms getting worse? And does climate change have anything to do with it? A year of records This Atlantic hurricane season has been particularly bad. There was Harvey, which pummelled the United States in August. It brought the largest amount of rain on record from any tropical system - 1,539mm. It caused the sort of flooding you'd expect to see once every 500 years, causing $200bn of damage to Houston, Texas. Ironically, this was the third such ""one every 500 years"" flood Houston had suffered in three years. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Usually hurricanes might last a day or two, but the torrential rain from Harvey lasted a week. September brought Irma, which devastated Caribbean communities. It was the joint second strongest Atlantic hurricane ever, with sustained winds of 185mph. Those winds were sustained for 37 hours - longer than any tropical system on record, anywhere in the world. Next came Hurricane Maria - another category 5 hurricane, with sustained winds of 175mph - which destroyed Puerto Rico's power grid. Finally, Hurricane Ophelia span past Portugal and Spain - the farthest east any major Atlantic hurricane has ever gone. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ophelia carried Saharan dust as far north as London, darkening the sky in the middle of the day Despite this, 2017 wasn't the worst year in some key respects. It didn't produce the strongest storm - that was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with sustained winds of 190mph. Nor did it have the greatest number of storms - that was 2005, which saw an incredible 28 named storms, including seven major hurricanes. One of them was the infamous Hurricane Katrina. But 2017 was probably the costliest. Estimates for the cost of the hurricane season vary and continue to be revised, ranging up to $385bn. By comparison, 2005 racked up $144bn in damage according to the National Hurricane Center - about $180bn today, adjusted for inflation. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey's persistent rain caused catastrophic flooding in parts of Texas It has certainly been a bad year. But over time, are hurricanes getting worse? There have been 33 of the strongest category 5 hurricanes since 1924. Eleven of these have occurred in the past 14 years. We know that hurricanes are powered by warm seas and over the past 100 years global average sea temperatures have risen by about 1C. But when you look at the total strength of storms in each year since records began, some years are more fearsome than others. Meteorologists use something called accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) to calculate the total wind power of all the storms in any given year. As you can see from the following chart, there's no clear upward trend. Why not? Even though seas are getting warmer, other factors can prevent hurricanes forming in particular years. Saharan dust can interfere with hurricane formation as can the close proximity of African storms to the equator. But one of the great weather ironies is that hurricanes hate strong winds. Strong winds in the Atlantic interfere with the circulation of air through a developing storm. This stops the storm growing into a hurricane. During a phenomenon called El Niño, the Pacific Ocean near the equator gets warmer than usual. This affects global wind patterns, leading to stronger winds in the Atlantic. That means El Niño years tend to be quiet years for hurricanes. But when the Pacific is cooler (known as La Niña), the reverse is true - making it easier for hurricanes to form. And 2017 is a La Niña year. In fact, the total storm strength in La Niña years has been rising decade by decade. Land drainage High winds are just part of the story. Climate change affects hurricane seasons in other ways, too. Rainfall during hurricanes can be devastating. Hurricane Harvey would have brought severe flooding to Houston regardless of climate change. But it is reasonable to assume that Harvey brought more rain than it would have done 100 years ago. Global air temperatures have also increased by about 1C in the past 100 years, and warmer air holds more water. That's likely to be behind the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events seen in the US in recent decades. Image copyright EPA Image caption Extreme rainfall events are becoming more common in the US, according to data from the EPA But the location of housing compounded the damage. Houston's population has more than doubled since 1960 to more than two million people. Housing developments are expanding into more marginal, poorly drained land. This puts more people in harm's way. Climate change is also causing seas to rise. Melting glaciers and land-based ice sheets contribute to higher sea levels. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Melting glaciers are causing sea levels to rise Also warmer water occupies a larger volume. So as seas warm up, sea levels rise. In the US, the largest sea-level rise is around the coast of the Gulf of Mexico - about 9.6mm each year at Eugene Island, Louisiana. All of this is increasing vulnerability to flooding when hurricanes and their associated storm surge reach land. A warmer world is bringing us a greater number of hurricanes and a greater risk of a hurricane becoming the most powerful category 5. There's an increased risk of flood damage - whether related to climate change, rising sea levels or more people moving into flood-prone areas. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Mark Kaufman,"On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its forecast for the looming 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, and it'll be an active one. Forecasters say that there's a 70 percent chance that the season will be active with hurricanes, but it's unlikely that we'll see the extremes of 2017, when six major storms (which have sustained destructive winds of at least 111 mph ) roared through the Atlantic. ""Last year was extremely active,"" Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said in an interview. ""It was one of the strongest seasons on record."" SEE ALSO: Fighting climate change could save the world trillions of dollars This coming year, NOAA's analysis of long-term climate trends in the Atlantic Ocean, the temperature of the ocean, and other factors, don't add up to conditions that would stoke an extreme hurricane season. ""Right now we're not seeing any strong climate signals that say the season would be as strong as last year,"" said Bell. But, NOAA is seeing the signal for a season that is either ""normal"" or ""above normal."" There's just a 25 percent chance that the season will be ""below normal."" Image: Noaa For perspective, the rare 2017 season saw 17 named storms (winds higher than 39 mph), six of which were major hurricanes of Category 3 or above, like hurricane Harvey and Irma last year. Bell said that a ""normal"" season would be 10 to 12 named storms, with five to six total hurricanes, one or two of which would be major, devastating cyclones (think Hurricane Harvey or Irma). There's a reasonable chance, about 35 percent, that these storm numbers and intensities could be punched up a little more, however, and enter the ""above normal"" spectrum. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30, though Bell notes the peak of the season is in August, September, and October. For this reason, NOAA will produce an updated forecast in early August. These are the names NOAA will use to name storms during this hurricane season. Image: NOAA The 2018 season begins as many areas are still reeling from the 2017 pummeling. Recovering from Hurricane Harvey alone has a price tag that exceeds $125 billion, according to NOAA. Puerto Rico is still in the process of recovering from Hurricane Maria, with more than 14,000 people still without power on the island, according to an ABC report. There are some 80 million Americans that live in hurricane territory, notes Bell, so he hopes people start preparing. This means getting flood insurance, having an evacuation plan, downloading the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) app, and heeding warnings. Since 1995, the Atlantic has experienced a high amount of hurricane activity said Bell, in large part due to a decades-long climate trend occurring in Atlantic, called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), in which warmer waters produce stronger storms. Some studies also suggest that as human-caused climate change worsens, extreme weather events could become more frequent and severe.","On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its forecast for the looming 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, and it'll be an active one.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Media caption Roads turned to rivers across Houston as Harvey hit Scientists have weighed the water that fell on Texas during the record-breaking Hurricane Harvey in August. They calculate, by measuring how much the Earth was compressed, that the Category 4 storm dropped 127 billion tonnes, or 34 trillion gallons. ""One person asked me how many stadia is that. It's 26,000 New Orleans Superdomes,"" said Adrian Borsa from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. His numbers were released as other scientists stated that the summer's big hurricanes had a clear human influence. Harvey, Irma and Maria ripped through the US Gulf states and the Caribbean, leading to widespread flooding and wind damage. Researchers told the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union here in New Orleans that the heavy rainfall seen in Harvey was very likely exacerbated by the extra warming associated with increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Sea surface temperatures were particularly high in the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico this hurricane season. Warm ocean water acts as a fuel for the storms. Media caption The BBC's James Cook found a scene of devastation in Rockport Harvey devastated parts of the Texas coastline because it stalled, concentrating its deluge in a very narrow region. It was one of the heaviest precipitation events in recorded hurricane history. Standard rain gauges recorded upwards of 1,270mm (50 inches) of precipitation in places. But these were point measurements and Dr Borsa attempted to get a much broader view by measuring how much the Earth moved in response to the weight of overlying water. This was detected by a network of high-precision GPS stations. ""It's like you sitting down on a mattress - it depresses; you stand up and it rebounds. The Earth behaves very similarly, like a rubber block. So the Earth is recording the effects of the loads acting on its surface."" The GPS network is dense enough that a broad picture of activity can be discerned. ""It gives us a holistic view, not just point measurements,” Dr Borsa told BBC News. What is smart is that the system can see the immediate change as water runs off the land through rivers, but also captures the much slower effect of water removal through evaporation, driven by the warmth of the Sun. This takes several weeks. ""One of the big deficiencies in our models is that evapotranspiration - that's the Sun and plants doing their things - is not currently directly observed, and it's half of the total water budget. I think this GPS is going to be able to provide very useful information about this."" At the same annual scientific gathering, the American Meteorological Association revealed that its annual report on extreme weather events had identified three that would “not have been not possible” without the influence of human-induced climate change. These were: the record-breaking global temperatures in 2016; the 2016 heat wave across Asia and the high ocean temperatures measured off the coast of Alaska. These were events that happened because “we have created a new climate,” said National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) climate scientist Stephanie Herring. The report also concluded that other heat waves around the world were made more intense by climate change and that Arctic warming was “most likely” not possible without it. The coral bleaching event in the Great Barrier Reef and other marine ecosystems in the Pacific Ocean were also amplified by “human-caused warming of the ocean”. The research is primarily based on comparing models, or simulations, of our climate. “We run a model that shows what the world looks like today and we can validate those models against what is actually happening,” explained Dr Herring. “Then we compare it to a model of an ‘alternative world’ in which - theoretically - climate change never happened. As if humans didn’t emit greenhouse gases since the industrial revolution. “So we can look at a world with climate change and a world without it.”",Scientists established how much rain fell by measuring how much the Earth compressed during the storm.,2017-12-14T00:57:26Z,"{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}",Hurricane Harvey rainfall 'weighed 127bn tonnes',http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-42347510,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p05dh54p.jpg,bbc-news,BBC News,Hurricane,1
THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"That absurd figure, and that condescension, are what make the study by independent researchers from Harvard and other institutions, published Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, so needed. After surveying random households across the island and comparing mortality rates they encountered to those before Maria, they came up with an estimated 4,645 additional deaths through the end of the year — a third of them people who died for lack of medical care. Puerto Rico has now commissioned its own study. But the very fact that the official toll was so obviously wrong reflects the disdain that has permeated the response to Maria. A death toll is a critical measure of the scale of a catastrophe, shaping both the public and official response. There is no telling how many lives could have been saved had the federal government been aware of the carnage rather than patting itself on the back. As Mayor Cruz, a sharp critic of the Trump administration’s response, said in an interview in March, Hurricane Maria opened Puerto Rican eyes “to our inequity — and our inequality.” The island, a commonwealth of the United States whose people are American citizens, remains in need of help. Parts of the island are still without electricity, thousands of residents lack shelter, and much remains in ruins. As many as 135,000 Puerto Ricans have left for the states. As reporters for The Times wrote in a major report in early May, after Maria and a preceding hurricane called Irma, “Puerto Rico all but slipped from the modern era.” When confronted with the Harvard study, the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, responded with more self-congratulation, claiming that the government had responded to Maria with the largest Federal Emergency Management Agency effort ever. Yet what Puerto Rico really needs to recover is the sort of generous, urgent and long-term assistance that would come with a recognition by the states that a great calamity has befallen their fellow Americans, that these people dying from a lack of the most basic services are their countrymen, their responsibility.","A new study points to a far higher death toll from Hurricane Maria, more evidence of the Trump administration’s neglect.",2018-06-03T23:45:07Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The Shame in Puerto Rico,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/03/opinion/puerto-rico-hurricane-deaths.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/04/opinion/04mon2sub/04mon2sub-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane,1
"John D. Sutter and Leyla Santiago, CNN","San Juan, Puerto Rico (CNN) An estimated 4,645 people died in Hurricane Maria and its aftermath in Puerto Rico, according to an academic report published Tuesday in a prestigious medical journal. That figure dwarfs Puerto Rico's official death toll of 64, which the article's authors called a ""substantial underestimate"" of Hurricane Maria's death toll. ""These numbers... underscore the inattention of the US government to the frail infrastructure of Puerto Rico,"" authors from Harvard University and other institutions wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. The official death toll in Puerto Rico has been the subject of substantial controversy since Hurricane Maria hit this island, a US territory, on September 20. CNN and other news outlets have used government statistics and extensive interviews with families of the deceased and funeral home directors to question the Puerto Rican government's official tally of deaths. Previous estimates suggested Maria contributed to about 1,000 deaths. The team from Harvard arrived at its much-higher estimate by surveying 3,299 randomly chosen households across the island earlier this year. Authors compared results of that survey -- which asked island residents about deaths in their homes, among other things -- with official mortality statistics from 2016. That allowed researchers to estimate the number of deaths that likely occurred as a result of Hurricane Maria between the date of the storm and December 31, 2017. ""The difference is that we went out and we had boots on the ground and we did the interviews,"" said Domingo Marqués, an associate professor of clinical psychology at Carlos Albizu University in Puerto Rico, who was among the report's authors. ""Statistically, it's like having interviewed the whole island,"" he said. Still, the exact death toll is likely to remain a mystery. Experts tell CNN it is difficult to say with certainty whether a hurricane ""caused"" certain deaths, especially those that occurred because of the chaotic and unsafe conditions that have lingered for months in Puerto Rico. Marqués and colleagues say 793 to 8,498 hurricane deaths occurred. In a news conference on Tuesday, Hector Pesquera, head of Puerto Rico's public safety department, said the government did not have reason to question the latest estimates, which come from researchers at Harvard University as well as Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the University of Colorado and universities in Puerto Rico. US territory officials stressed that the Puerto Rican government has hired George Washington University to conduct an assessment of Maria's death toll and that the results of that review are still forthcoming. Previously, officials had expected the George Washington University report to be released this spring, before the Atlantic hurricane season, which begins on June 1. ""The Government of Puerto Rico welcomes the newly released Harvard University survey and we look forward to analyzing it,"" Carlos R. Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, said in a press release. ""As the world knows, the magnitude of this tragic disaster caused by Hurricane Maria resulted in many fatalities. We have always expected the number to be higher than what was previously reported. That is why we commissioned The George Washington University to carry out a thorough study on the number of fatalities caused by Hurricane Maria which will be released soon. Both studies will help us better prepare for future natural disasters and prevent lives from being lost."" The Harvard study says the Puerto Rican and US governments did not provide adequate services -- including electrical power and medical assistance -- after the hurricane. It also notes that Puerto Rican officials have refused to make public basic mortality statistics. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees disaster recovery, has said it encountered unique logistical challenges on the island after the storm that make comparisons between the response to Maria and other storms problematic. CNN and the Center for Investigative Journalism (CPI) in Puerto Rico are suing the island's demographic registry for access to death records that have been withheld. In November, CNN surveyed 112 funeral homes -- about half the total -- across Puerto Rico, in a moment when many communication systems remained inoperable. At that time, funeral home directors identified 499 deaths they considered to be hurricane-related. Puerto Rico added at least two people to its official count following CNN's investigation. One was Quintín Vidal Rolón, 89, who died in a lantern fire that relatives said occurred because of the storm; Vidal was using the lantern because he didn't have electricity. Other uncounted deaths occurred in environments where people lacked electricity or other basic services, including communications. Many roads were blocked after the storm. And hurricane-related deaths appear to have continued for months after the September hurricane. Natalio Rodriguez Lebron, 77, for example, died in Maunabo, Puerto Rico, in January. His family says that's because they couldn't afford to power a breathing machine that helped keep him alive. While most power and water service has been restored, thousands of people here remain without electricity -- more than eight months after Hurricane Maria. The latest death-toll estimate could be seen as an indictment of the federal response to the storm, said Dr. Gregory J. Davis, director of the University of Kentucky's Forensic Pathology Consultation Service. ""This alone should make your readers and the readers of the New England Journal really stand up and take notice -- and frankly be asking our government 'Why?' "" he said. ""Our government is not doing what they should be doing down there. It's infuriating, that's the bottom line."" The New England Journal of Medicine article adds to ""a growing consensus that deaths have been undercounted by the Puerto Rican government,"" said Alexis Santos, a demographer at Penn State University who also has researched the death toll following Maria. ""This is a valid way of looking at it,"" he said of the research from Harvard. Still, ""The way this is done, by interviews with people in different barrios in Puerto Rico, it seems to me that someone could report a death as associated with the hurricane when it was not."" That could result in an overcounting of deaths, he said. The Harvard team, meanwhile, says that, if anything, its estimates are low.

A.A. Newton,"The National Hurricane Center expects Hurricane Florence to cause “ life-threatening, catastrophic flash flooding ” when it makes landfall later this week, and now there’s a tool that gives us an idea of just how catastrophic that impact will be. This tracker from ESRI Media takes the familiar prediction model and uses it to calculate some key demographic data for the area inside the error cone. ESRI’s tracker shows the total population, total households, and total educational organizations in Florence’s projected path: Clicking on the individual items in the legend pulls up more data, including the proportion of the total population that’s over age 65, and how many of the total households are below the poverty line. At the time of writing, 16% of the affected population is over 65, with 15% of affected households living in poverty; the median household income is $51,000. Whether you’re smack dab in the danger zone or watching the storm from afar, you should know how to correctly read an error cone projection. ESRI has an efficient summary in the description of their tracker (emphasis mine) that hits on the main points: “The Cone of Uncertainty...represents the probable track of the center of a tropical cyclone, and is formed by enclosing the area swept out by a set of circles along the forecast track (at 12, 24, 36 hours, etc). It is important to note that the area affected by a tropical cyclone can extend well beyond the confines of the cone enclosing the most likely track area of the center.” In other words, if your city—or your loved ones’—is outside the error cone, it just means that the center of the storm isn’t expected to pass over; areas outside the cone can still expect high winds and heavy rain, and should watch local forecasts extra-carefully in the days to come. That’s the most important thing to take away from error cone projections, but if you’d like a more in-depth explainer, this Wall Street Journal piece briefly explains how they’re calculated, how to correctly interpret them, and what the limitations are. Understanding the potential human cost of a storm—especially among vulnerable populations—is a crucial first step to mobilizing support for communities that’ll see the worst of it. Get your hurricane plan locked down, check in on your friends and family, and be prepared to do some vetting before making any donations to relief efforts.","The National Hurricane Center expects Hurricane Florence to cause “ life-threatening, catastrophic flash flooding ” when it makes landfall later this week, and now there’s a tool that gives us an idea of just how catastrophic that impact will be.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"When you think of an alien world, you might think of a strange, stormy place with an inhospitable environment, frequent lightning strikes, and extreme radiation. But who needs an imagination when the storms here on Earth already beam radiation, including antimatter, down toward the ground? Hurricane Patricia in 2015 was the second most intense tropical cyclone ever on record, traveling up the Pacific coast of Mexico with winds topping out at 215 miles-per-hour. Despite the fierce conditions, scientists still had science to do, and they flew in a plane through its eyewall on October 23, 2015. The plane’s instruments measured gamma-rays blasted from lightning inside the hurricane, as well as what seemed to be beam of positrons, the antimatter opposite of electrons. Events like these are probably more common than you’d think. “These terrestrial gamma-ray flashes can happen in any storm that makes lightning,” David Smith, one of the study’s authors from the University of California, Santa Cruz, told Gizmodo. The detector onboard the plane measured a phenomenon that scientists have been interested in for decades: terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. It’s unclear exactly how it happens, but lightning in storms seems to accelerate electrons to nearly light speed. These electrons collide with the particles in the atmosphere, resulting in high-energy x-rays and gamma rays that scientists have measured in satellites and on the ground. The rays could also result from collisions between electrons and their antimatter partners, positrons. The team behind the newest paper had a tool called the Airborne Detector for Energetic Lightning Emissions (ADELE) on board a hurricane-hunting WP-3D plane, according to the paper published recently in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres. It was a very simple radiation-detecting experiment: two pieces of plastic and one special kind of crystal, all called scintillators, that flash when a high-energy particle hits them. An instrument called a photomultiplier tube turns the flashes into signals that a computer or oscilloscope can read. There was also a radio-wave detector. The scintillators flashed 184 times in the split-second following a lightning bolt in Hurricane Patricia’s eyewall. Based on their modeling, the signal matched what a downward beam of positrons would look like—meaning they didn’t measure positrons directly. This is the first time such an effect has been measured in a hurricane’s eyewall, though it’s been known to happen in lots of different kinds of storms. And no, the positrons aren’t anything to worry about, since you’re probably already being struck by lightning. Positrons are a typical byproduct of certain radioactive sources, and their numbers drop off precipitously with distance. Still, said Smith, if you were in a plane at the exact unluckiest place at unluckiest time (higher than their experimental plane flew) you night receive a deadly dose of radiation. Most interesting to Smith was the mystery of why these wild events happen when and how they do. “From a scientific perspective, this is an exotic phenomenon and there’s a lot we don’t understand, like why it is as bright as it is and why it happens sometimes but not others,” he said. “We’re trying to understand whatever phenomenon nature throws at us.” [ JGR Atmospheres ]","When you think of an alien world, you might think of a strange, stormy place with an inhospitable environment, frequent lightning strikes, and extreme radiation.

SHERI FINK,"What seems like a small detail might resonate in unanticipated ways. For example, well into production on the Magazine story, the editor, Luke Mitchell, allowed me to add a sentence about innovations that included the fact that in Charleston County, S.C., people could provide information to 911 online.
I learned later that several 911 directors reached out to Charlestons 911 director for more information. One was John Dejung from Dane County, Wis. Hurricane Harvey had awakened him to the possibility that his 911 system, one of the largest in a state prone to ice storms, blizzards and tornadoes, might get so bogged down or debilitated that we might want to rely on alternatives to phones. Dane County set aside $10,000 in next years budget for the purchase of a system that will allow people to reach 911 online if necessary in a major disaster.
That alone would likely not have saved Caseys life, but it may save someones. There are myriad ways in which we and the infrastructure and systems we rely on remain unprepared to contend with the natural disasters that seem to arrive ever more frequently and catastrophically. 
All of us have a stake and arguably a role in fixing the most critical problems. But to justify making personal, professional or governmental investments, we need to understand what it looks like when we dont. Like Wayne, I want to trust that there is value in human empathy, in accountability, and in the practice, from time immemorial, of reconstructing our human tragedies in the form of narratives and sharing them.","Ronnie Dailey, then 10, wept while looking at the casket of his mother, Cassandra Dills-Dailey.

Adam Rogers,"Michael introduced itself to North America with 155-mile-per-hour gusts of wind and a barometric pressure of 919 millibars, the third-strongest hurricane to ever make continental US landfall. It was a monster, and it stayed a monster as it rolled through Georgia and then on toward the Carolinas. And monsters are made, not born. The most striking thing about Michael is that it was barely a tropical storm a couple of days ago, and all of a sudden it almost touched cat-5 intensity, says Karthik Balaguru, an oceanographer who studies hurricanes at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Typically hurricanes ramp up more slowly (if at all), and landfall reduces their intensity. The thing with Michael is, it just kept on intensifying, Balaguru says. Thats calledperhaps as youd expectrapid intensification, and it used to be a rare phenomenon among Atlantic hurricanes. Thats good, because rapidly intensifying hurricanes also tend to be the ones that are the most dangerous, the deadliest and the most expensive. Unfortunately, rapidly intensifying hurricanes seem to be a rarity no longer. Of the record-breaking hurricane season of 201717 named storms, 6 major hurricanesall four category-4 or 5 storms underwent rapid intensification. Thats Harvey, which drowned Houston, Irma, Jose, and Maria, which was so devastating to Puerto Rico. Now, to be fair, most Atlantic cat-4 and cat-5 storms go through rapid intensification; the dangerous ones do it near the coastline, just before landfall. More intense hurricanes are one of the central predictions scientists have made about Earths changing climate. Human beings pump more greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the air, and the air changes. The planets overall temperature goes up, and that means, in part, more energy in the top of the oceans. Thats a hurricanes engine. Advances like satellites and radar have made high accuracy possible in predicting a hurricanes eventual track, the path it takes across ocean and land. Intensity, though, is another story. Its hardas the hurricane researcher Kerry Emanuel wrote last year, a good intensity prediction would require better numerical models, better understanding of boundary layers between air and water, and a better model of how the upper ocean interacts with storms. Scientists dont have any of those. Forecasting rapid intensification is even harder. And again, perhaps as one might expect, a warmer climate makes rapid intensification more likely. Emanuels group calculated from observations of past storms that a hurricane with wind speeds that grew 68 miles per hour in the day before making landfall should only happen once in a century under the conditions of an unchanged climatebasically a hundred-year storm. And the vulnerable cities were just about where youd expect, too: Houston, New Orleans, Tampa, Miami. But, the researchers then calculated, in the post climate-change climate of our Burning World, those storms could happen once every five years. And the new hundred-year storm? Pre-landfall intensifications of 114 mph, so massive as to be essentially nonexistent in the late twentieth-century climate, Emanuel writes. People will have never seen anything that bad. Balagurus group found similarly grim news. Their calculations, based again on observed rapid intensification, say that climate change and variations in Atlantic conditions could drive up the magnitude of that intensification. Point is, climate change means more rapid intensification like what Michael did, and worse. How did Michael pull it off? If I had to guess, Id say it experienced perfect conditions for a hurricanea lot of heat available in the ocean and favorable atmospheric conditions, Balaguru says. Wind shear, the changes in magnitude and direction of winds from the oceans surface all the way up to the top of the troposphereabout six miles upmust have also subsided. High enough wind shear can disrupt convection at the storms center, weakening it overall. That didnt happen here. The result: yet another perfect storm in yet another season of perfect storms, crashing into a heavily populated coastline full of environmental disasters waiting to happen. As of Thursday, Michael has ramped back down. Its merely a powerful tropical storm now. And its tracking right over the towns where Hurricane Florence made landfall last month.

Rachel Becker,"Climate change is already making devastating hurricanes wetter — and similar storms are likely to unleash more rain and faster winds by the end of the century, new research says. When Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria struck the US in rapid succession in the fall of 2017, the storms and their aftermaths killed thousands of people and caused an estimated $265 billion in damage. Harvey became the second costliest storm after Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005. Now, new research published today in the journal Nature suggests that climate change made Irma, Maria, and Katrina drop more rain than they would have in a pre-industrial world. The study also predicts that in a warmer future, these storms would be even wetter and windier. A second paper (also published today in Nature) took a closer look at Hurricane Harvey. It shows another way people may have made the storm’s rain and flooding more severe: by building cities. Hurricanes should, theoretically, be more intense and wetter on a hotter planet. After all, warm ocean water fuels hurricanes, and warmer air holds more moisture — which means more rain. Recent studies back that up; analyses of Hurricane Harvey, for instance, reported that 15 percent or more of the rainfall could be attributed to global warming. “It’s a very important confirmation.” Today’s paper provides yet more evidence about the ways in which climate change shapes extreme weather events, says Dim Coumou, an atmospheric scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research who was not involved in the study. “It’s a very important confirmation of our understanding of how hurricanes change with global warming.” Climate scientist Michael Mann says that some of the results make perfect sense. “We expect greater rainfall and flooding from hurricanes as ocean surface temperatures and atmospheric moisture content increases in a warming world.” But he cautions that the papers use a single climate model, so “it is difficult to draw other general conclusions from these studies.” The study started because Christina Patricola, a climate scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, wanted to find out how exactly climate change fit into the recent spate of devastating storms. So she simulated more than a dozen hurricanes, including Hurricane Katrina. She and her co-author Michael Wehner plugged in ocean temperature, atmospheric conditions, and watched the simulated storms spin toward land. The models weren’t perfect, the study acknowledges: the simulations didn’t quite capture Hurricane Maria’s track, or the rapid intensifications of Katrina, Maria, and Irma. But the models were close — and that’s where the experiments could start. Patricola tweaked the conditions to watch what would happen if Katrina, Irma, and Maria had unfolded in a pre-industrial world, and found that global warming boosted the deluge by between 4 and 9 percent. The team also analyzed wind speeds, but didn’t see much of a contribution of global warming for the recent storms. That could change in the future. Patricola found that if we continue to burn fossil fuels unchecked through the year 2100, some of those same storms would drop 25 to 30 percent more rain, and the winds would blow up to 33 miles per hour faster. It’s a thorough, convincing study, Coumou says — but there are still some big questions left to answer. The study doesn’t examine how climate change might alter the speed at which hurricanes travel along their paths, for example, or how future hurricane rainfall and storm surge might combine to drive heavy flooding. The question of flooding is where today’s second study comes in. Hydrologist Gabriele Villarini at the University of Iowa and his colleagues at Princeton University took a close look at Hurricane Harvey, which dumped five feet of rain on Houston and killed at least 93 people. Previous studies analyzed at how much of that rainfall could be attributed to global warming, and found it was around 15 precent or more. And we’d expect that when developers slap down impermeable surfaces like concrete and asphalt, the amount of water slicking off those surfaces increases. “The skyline, the tall buildings, the city footprint — we don’t know which one is more important.” But Villarini’s team took a slightly different tack and looked at how the city’s footprint and skyline might have changed both runoff and the rain. They modeled how much rain the hurricane would have dropped on the city had the buildings been replaced with farm fields. And they found that the rough texture of the city with its buildings and complicated skyline snagged and slowed down the humid air flowing over it, boosting conditions for precipitation. To be clear, Hurricane Harvey would have dropped rain over Houston no matter what was there. But the presence of the city exacerbated the flooding across Houston by about 21 times, on average, the study says. The team doesn’t know precisely why. “The skyline, the tall buildings, the city footprint — we don’t know which one is more important,” Villarini says. They also don’t know if these findings are specific to Harvey, or whether they’d hold up when another storm hits a different city. “I don’t think there’s one single way of dealing with this problem.” Still, the findings suggest that urbanization could make the flooding impacts of hurricanes worse, and in multiple different ways. “This is, as far as I know, a new result and, as the authors point out, has important implications for urban planning,” Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at MIT who was not involved in the study, says in a statement emailed to The Verge. Together, the two studies show that we need to be ready for the complex ways a warmer world could change extreme weather events. And preparing for these events won’t be easy, according to Villarini. Politicians, urban developers, and engineers will all have to be involved, and will have to work together to figure out ways for their communities to survive future storms. “I don’t think there’s one single way of dealing with this problem,” he says.","New research published in the journal Nature suggests that climate change made Hurricanes Irma, Maria, and Katrina drop more rain than they would have in a pre-industrial world.

FRANCES ROBLES,"The bureaucracy around the housing repairs was so complex that the first repairs did not begin until more than five months after the hurricane. A full year after the September 2017 storm, a New York Times review found that thousands of Puerto Ricans were still living in ruined houses. For many of them, the FEMA money left over after trickling down through so many middlemen hardly made a dent in what they needed. Lisandra Oquendo, who lives in Punta Santiago on Puerto Ricos eastern coast, was told that her house had been approved for $18,000 in FEMA repair funds, and she was stunned at how little was accomplished with the money. The contractors patched up her roof, gave her a generator, replaced more than a dozen broken window crank operators, installed several appliances, two windows and a door, and cleaned mold off the walls. But because her roof is made of concrete, she said, they told her they could not repair it. They said, We dont do paint, we dont do floors, we dont work with cement, she said. So what do you do? Contractors have said that the rates they collect cover a variety of expenses, including shipping fees, workers compensation insurance, vehicle and warehouse rental, taxes and profit. But prices charged for equipment and appliances often bore little relation to what was charged on the retail market, even in storm-ravaged Puerto Rico. According to Department of Housing records, FEMA paid for about 12,400 people to receive generators at a cost of $3,700 each. The 5,500-watt portable devices and supplies they came with cost the contractors about $800 each, other documents show. FEMA paid $666 apiece for new bathroom sinks, but the contractors who actually bought and installed them paid $260 apiece. FEMA paid almost $4 a square foot to repair roofs; the work was done by subcontractors for $1.64 a foot. The deal the Department of Housing signed required smoke detectors in every sleeping area, so each of the 122,000 houses in the program was equipped with the devices, for which FEMA was billed $82 apiece. A receipt reviewed by The New York Times showed that one subcontractor ordered them in bulk from an Ace Hardware store in the city of Aguadilla for $6.99 each. Fifty-eight percent is being taken off the top as overhead and profit from the two contractors above us, said Brandon Padgett, owner of BVP Construction in Houston, which conducted repairs on 52 houses under the program. Is there 58 percent overhead and profit needed to implement this? No, because we are doing 90 percent of the work.","FEMA is spending more than $1 billion on emergency repairs to homes in Puerto Rico damaged by Hurricane Maria, but much of it is going to contractors charging steep markups and overhead.",2018-11-26T10:00:19Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","$3,700 Generators and $666 Sinks: FEMA Contractors Charged Steep Markups on Puerto Rico Repairs",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/us/fema-puerto-rico-housing-repairs-maria.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/us/prcontract-promo/prcontract-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane,1
FRANCES ROBLES,"FEMA did provide huge generators to power water-pumping stations on the island, and has been spending $20 million a month on generators for two electric power plants. In all, the report says, the agency has provided one million nights’ lodging in hotels and 130 million meals after the 2017 storms, a level of aid it considers “unprecedented.” The agency spent nearly $4 billion on aid and recovery efforts related to Puerto Rico. But many in Puerto Rico fault the agency’s efforts. “I don’t think anything provided by FEMA was a ‘meal,’” said Carlos J. Torres, 46, a resident of Guayanilla in the southern part of the island, referring to the military rations and boxes of candies and snacks that the agency often distributed. “You cannot call that food,” he said. Mr. Torres said he received a $500 emergency grant from FEMA, but has not been able to return to his apartment because the building was badly damaged and the landlord, his father, did not qualify for disaster assistance. His father was referred to the Small Business Administration to take out a low-interest loan for repairs, but “what I am expecting to see is a lot of people losing their property,” Mr. Torres said. “They are not going to be able to pay that off.” Thousands of Puerto Ricans left homeless by the storm took refuge on the mainland with FEMA’s help, but have still not been able to return home. Bethzaida Crespo, 36, moved her family to a hotel room in Orlando when her home in Dorado flooded. She received $3,000 for her losses and FEMA has paid for the hotel room.

We let education get away from us; our kids were being educated in awful buildings, and they werent learning very much. Although crime and the murder rate continue to go down, its still way too high. Income inequality continues to plague us. So if the citys going to succeed like all great cities Detroitll survive, Chicago, which was in a bad place in the 60s, has come back you need a good couple of generations of really good leadership. The citys got a long way to go. Its still one of the great cities of the world. But from an infrastructure perspective, were in a really bad situation. MR. BAQUET Are there places that shouldnt be rebuilt? Im not just talking about New Orleans. Ive spent six years in California there are places where the wildfires are that people once didnt live. Do you rebuild all of New Orleans East? Do you rebuild the parts of San Juan that are going to get whacked in the next storm? MR. LANDRIEU Were going to get hit by a lot of stuff. In the West, youre going to continue to get wildfires; youre going to get earthquakes. In the heartland, youre going to get tornadoes. In the East,youre going to get hurricanes. Eighty-five percent of the people in this country live in and around what we would call vulnerable areas. If climate change continues to do what it does, in 30 or 40 years New Orleans is going to be an island protected by the $14.6 billion levy barrier that we have, and everything south of I-10 is going to be compromised. If you back up a little bit and dont get too afraid within 100 years, the parallel where Austin and Atlanta are, is going to be the southern part of the country. That requires you to do a lot of thinking about prevention, about where people can live, where to put massive infrastructure investments.

Andrew Freedman,"The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, which officially ends on Thursday, will go down as one of the most expensive in American history. The notorious storms of 2017 — hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria — may have had innocuous names. However, they flooded America's fourth-largest metropolis, cut a swath of destruction across the Caribbean before hitting Florida, and cut off power to the entire island of Puerto Rico, respectively. The costs of the storms that hit the U.S. are still being tallied, with some analysts claiming that it was the most expensive hurricane season on record. Steve Bowen, a meteorologist with the insurance company AonBenfield, said that his company's calculations show that direct damage and business interruption losses from 2017's many storms will put 2017 in second place, behind 2005, once adjusted for inflation. SEE ALSO: San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz talks Puerto Rico's recovery with Stephen Colbert It's possible that ranking will change, however. ""There remains so much uncertainty with the three big storms (Harvey, Irma, Maria), and insurance claims continue to be filed and processed,"" Bowen said via Twitter message. ""A big component to the direct damage losses remains business interruption, and especially in the case of Maria in Puerto Rico, those direct impacts remain ongoing,"" Bowen said. ""The 2017 season is going to end near the top on an economic and insured loss basis once all is said and done. Regardless of what metric is used to determine 2017's ranking... the season was extraordinarily costly and will be used as one of the benchmark years against which future seasons are compared,"" Bowen said. Puerto Rico still has not woken up from the nightmare caused by Hurricane Maria. It's been 71 days since Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm, but residents there are still struggling without access to electricity, as well as other basic services. As of Thursday afternoon, electricity generation on Puerto Rico — which is not the same as the percentage of people who are receiving power — stood at 65 percent. About 7 percent of Puerto Rican residents are without access to safe drinking water, according to the territory's website. Repairs are still being made to electricity and transportation infrastructure in the U.S. Virgin Islands and other areas that in many cases were hit with two major hurricanes in a row. The Trump administration's response to Hurricane Maria, especially when compared to the mobilization mounted in the wake of other storms that struck the U.S. mainland, is widely viewed to be abysmal. A season of destructive hurricanes Even veteran hurricane forecasters were stunned by the beastly storms that prowled the Atlantic Ocean this season. Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall in southeast Texas on Aug. 25 as a Category 4 storm, resulted in the heaviest rainstorm ever recorded in the country. The storm inundated large swaths of the Houston metro area, dumping as much as 5 feet of rain over the course of a few days. Such unprecedented rainfall turned highways into raging rivers, flooded petrochemical plants, and destroyed tens of thousands of cars, homes, and businesses. Harvey was followed by another Category 4 storm, Hurricane Irma, marking the first time the U.S. has been hit by two Category 4 storms in the same season. Irma reserved it greatest ferocity for islands in the Caribbean, practically wiping out the island of Barbuda, and stripping the lush vegetation of the Virgin Islands bare. Hurricane Irma remained a Category 5 storm with maximum sustained winds of 185 miles per hour for a consecutive 37 hours, a new world record, and also broke the record for the strongest hurricane observed in the Atlantic outside the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Based on its windspeed, it also tied for second on the list of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes of all-time, behind Hurricane Allen in 1980. Then came Hurricane Maria, which rapidly intensified on September 18, and also raked parts of the Leeward Islands and Caribbean. Maria caused widespread damage when it hit the tiny island of Dominica as a Category 5 storm, and became the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico since 1928. The Atlantic season kept setting records into October, when Hurricane Ophelia became the strongest storm to form so far east in the North Atlantic. By reaching Category 3 intensity, Ophelia also became the sixth major hurricane of Category 3 or greater to form during the 2017 season. Hurricane Ophelia underwent a transition into a powerful hybrid, and then a non-tropical storm, that struck Ireland with winds as strong as 119 miles per hour. While the hurricanes of 2017 were fierce, none of the Category 4 or 5 storms hit without extremely accurate warnings. In fact, preliminary data from the National Hurricane Center show that storm track forecasts for hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria were about 25 percent more accurate than average. Storm intensity forecasts, however, remained a bigger challenge, as some of these storms underwent periods of astonishingly rapid intensification that defied expectations. For millions from Houston to St. Johns, the off season will be spent rebuilding and attempting to get their lives back to normalcy. Meanwhile, hurricane forecasters will work to improve their techniques and computer models in time for next year.","The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, which officially ends on Thursday, will go down as one of the most expensive in American history.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"Yesterday, the National Science Foundation announced that they’ll keep the storied Arecibo telescope running in the wake of the Hurricane Maria damage. The NSF concluded that the best way forward was to collaborate with “new stakeholders” who will both use and maintain the facility, according to the Record of Decision. There could be some potential demolitions of buildings on the site, but funding will continue. “This is great news,” said Abel Mendez, planetary astrobiologist at the University of Puerto Rico, Arecibo. “We hope to continue our science at the observatory.” The iconic Arecibo telescope has been struggling financially for many years now. September’s devastating strike from Hurricane Maria could have been the last straw, but the telescope received its repairs and began limited observations once again only a week later. The facility is still running on diesel generators and there’s millions more dollars of fixes required, according to a Nature report. Under this decision, the NSF will decrease funding from $8.2 to $2 million annually over the next five years as it looks for new partners, writes Nature. Arecibo is now the second largest single-dish filled telescope behind the FAST telescope in China, but it can still make observations of rotating neutron stars (a.k.a. pulsars), exoplanets, and even assist with gravitational wave astronomy. And having a second dish is important—scientists feel much more confident about discoveries when two different experiments independently spot the same thing. Mendez was just excited to continue doing science. He said: “I feel that this is a new life.” [via Nature ]","Yesterday, the National Science Foundation announced that they’ll keep the storied Arecibo telescope running in the wake of the Hurricane Maria damage.

Brett Williams,"It's been nearly two months since Hurricane Maria ripped through Puerto Rico, and the island is still in the midst of a long road to recovery. While most of its people have gained access to potable water, more than 25 percent of Puerto Rico is still without reliable telecommunications service, cutting them off from the outside world. Google's parent company Alphabet is trying to help return connection for the people of Puerto Rico. Project Loon, the aerial internet endeavor from the X innovation lab, was given FCC permission and began launching its LTE-beaming balloons over the island last month. After a few weeks of service, Alphabet says the efforts have paid off. Project Loon's reps claim the balloons have been able to bring basic internet connectivity to more than 100,000 people in Puerto Rico. SEE ALSO: Tesla installs Powerpack and Powerwall batteries at hospital in Puerto Rico The Loon team joined forces with AT&amp;T and T-Mobile for the efforts, which sends the balloons some 65,000 feet in the air to create a network that relays LTE signals to telecom partners on the ground below (in this case, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile). People on the ground can then access the internet using LTE-connected devices. This augmented connectivity is essential for those who haven't yet regained access to normal communications, so the project's effectiveness has been extremely important. There's still much work to begun to bring Puerto Rico back up to full strength, so hopefully, special projects like Loon can continue to serve as a temporary reprieve as larger recovery efforts are undertaken.","Read more... {""player"":{""description"":""A lofty idea becomes reality."",""image"":""https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/QTngSsCMz6ThXNcOTF7fLyie_qc=/https%3A%2F%2Fvdist.aws.mashable.com%2Fcms%2F2017%2F10%2F92c3c739-4c4b-2b31%2Fthumb%2F00001.jpg"",""mediaid"":""YxlJrBXl98"",""prelo…",2017-11-09T21:42:37Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}","Google: Project Loon has provided internet access to 100,000 people in Puerto Rico",http://mashable.com/2017/11/09/project-loon-puerto-rico-progress/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Msnq9tdHgYKLzZyxirrsev2L1OI=/1200x630/2017%2F11%2F09%2F5a%2Fb2578c6ea7904071804e80cf6ca540d4.d78f4.jpg,mashable,Mashable,Hurricane,1
PATRICIA MAZZEI,"For Mr. Rosselló, the funding fight is a question of fairness. For every long-term rebuilding project underway in Puerto Rico at this point after Hurricane Maria, there were 28 projects underway in Texas for damage from Hurricane Harvey, and 32 projects in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, the governor said. Puerto Rico is getting much fewer and much lower resources than any comparable jurisdiction in the United States.
A University of Michigan analysis published in the journal BMJ Global Health in January found it took twice as long four months for Hurricane Maria survivors in Puerto Rico to receive a comparable amount of individual aid (about $1 billion) as Hurricane Harvey survivors in Texas and Hurricane Irma survivors in Florida, though Maria was stronger and more devastating. Maria killed an estimated 2,975 people in Puerto Rico.
In addition to the slow disbursement of aid, a report last month from the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Housing and Urban Development lacked a robust plan to monitor disaster relief grants, including $20 billion approved for Puerto Rico.
In Vieques, with the hospital out of commission, dialysis patients had to travel to the big island three times a week to get treatment for more than a year after the storm. Several patients died. Finally, in November, a mobile dialysis unit in a shiny trailer arrived at the temporary clinic, allowing local treatments to resume.
It wasnt easy, said Edwin Alvarado Cordero, a 58-year-old diabetic. Standing across the street from the pharmacy in Isabel Segunda, the bigger of the islands two towns, Mr. Alvarado recounted his thrice-weekly trips from Vieques to Humacao, which began at 4 a.m. and ended at 5:30 p.m.
Last year, on the ferry to the big island, Mr. Alvarado suffered a heart attack. He had open-heart surgery and survived. Though he can now receive dialysis in Vieques, he still travels to San Juan periodically to see his cardiologist. Specialists visit Vieques infrequently.
Its far, but its better there, Mr. Alvarado said. Whats left of the hospital here is grass and horses.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","It’s the summer of apocalypse weather with wildfires, heat waves, and drought. But it looks like we could be granted a reprieve from the fourth horseman of the weather apocalypse—hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration updated its hurricane forecast on Thursday, and hey, good news. Due to a burgeoning El Niño, it’s likely that the rest of Atlantic hurricane season will be quieter than normal. It only takes one hurricane to do damage, though, and the peak of hurricane season is still ahead, so we’re not out of the woods yet. The forecast calls for 4-7 hurricanes, of which up to two could become major ones with winds of Category 3 or greater strength. All told, NOAA is forecasting there will be 9-13 named storms. That includes tropical storms, hurricanes’ weaker sibling (though they can still dump copious amounts of rain). Overall, forecasters give this season 60 percent odds of being less active than usual, a huge uptick from the 25 percent forecast issued in May. Saharan dust has played a role in tamping down activity, as have cooler-than-normal waters in the part of the Atlantic where tropical storms and hurricanes tend to form. But the biggest reason forecasters think this year could be quiet is the creeping presence of an El Niño, which is characterized by warm waters in the eastern tropical Pacific. Those warm waters kickstart a series of changes in the atmosphere, including powerful upper level winds that cut across the Atlantic hurricane basin and tear storms apart or prevent them from spinning up at all. Some storm systems will inevitably defy the odds, though, which is why forecasters continue to urge anyone living near the coast to stay vigilant. “There are still more storms to come—the hurricane season is far from being over,” Gerry Bell, NOAA’s lead seasonal hurricane forecaster, said in a statement. This Atlantic hurricane season has been a bit of a weird one so far. It started a few days early when a subtropical storm (yet another flavor of hurricane-like weather) formed in the Gulf of Mexico. Said storm then turned tropical as it passed over land and basically made landfall again on the Great Lakes, all of which is extremely not normal. Three other storms have formed including tiny ass Hurricane Beryl, the first hurricane of the season. The lower odds of a season of horrors like last year are a welcome forecast if ever there was one even with the statistical peak of hurricane season still ahead and the official end months away.","It’s the summer of apocalypse weather with wildfires, heat waves, and drought.

FRANCES ROBLES,"Mr. Ramos faced a skeptical Senate hearing on Tuesday. He told lawmakers that there had been no kickbacks, but acknowledged that the company had long been rife with political patronage, where up to half the employees got their job from an important connection. Mr. Ramos has given various contradictory explanations for why he chose Whitefish over mutual aid agreements with other utility companies, which are customary after disasters. He told The New York Times last month that he preferred Whitefish because he expected the United States Army Corps of Engineers to pay the company, which meant the bankrupt utility would not have to front any of the money for repairs. Under mutual aid agreements, Prepa would have to pay for the work and then seek reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But Mr. Ramos told legislators on Tuesday that he went with the private contractors because he did not have the resources to find lodging for workers borrowed from other utilities, even though emails released this week by the House Committee on Natural Resources show that Whitefish could not find housing, either. It has been a rough week for Mr. Ramos. On Monday, The New York Times reported that some of the subcontractors Whitefish had hired to do the work — people Prepa could have hired itself — were earning just $42 an hour. At the Senate hearing on Tuesday, Mr. Ramos fended off accusations of price gouging. On Wednesday, Mr. Ramos and the governor proudly hailed an important milestone: The company had finally reached 50 percent of its power capacity. Minutes later, a key line failed, again plunging the northern half of the island into darkness. Another line failed on Thursday. Some 58 days after the storm, the grid is generating power at 45 percent of capacity. On Friday, a local newspaper reported that Mr. Ramos had hired a friend who was once implicated in a federal criminal case to help advise the company. Mr. Ramos posted a cheerful technical update in a video on Facebook in which he defended the new hire, whom he described as an experienced electrical engineer. Mr. Ramos quit 20 minutes later.

Michael was 90 miles offshore from Panama Beach and is expected to make landfall late morning or early afternoon.

Florida is no stranger to hurricanes, but there has never been a storm like Michael to hit this part of the state. Atmospheric scientist Phil Klotzbach tweeted that Michaels 933 millibar central pressurea key meteorological measure of intensity where lower generally means strongeris the seventh lowest of any storm ever to reach Florida. The list of storms with lower pressures is an ignominious one, including last years Irma, Andrew in 1992, and the Lake Okeechobee and Great Miami hurricanes that decimated the state in the 1920s. This is not the type of company you want to keep. The National Weather Service Tallahassee office issued a stark graphic and warning late last night to underscore what the region is facing. The statement in part reads: We searched the historical database for category 4 hurricanes that have made landfall in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend. The map says it allits BLANK this situation has NEVER happened before... If you have been told to evacuate, LEAVE. Do not stay and risk your life or that of your family. Tropical storm-force winds have already been recorded at Apalachicola Regional Airport and rain bands are spiraling ashore. Conditions will deteriorate quickly over the coming hours. Florida Governor Rick Scott has announced that for those who didnt or couldnt afford to evacuate, the window to get out of Michaels way has closed. If you are in a coastal area, do not leave your house, he said at his morning briefing. Scroll down to see our liveblog below.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","Hurricane Lane continues to bear down on Hawaii, posing a catastrophic threat to residents and tourists alike. The storm could bring hurricane force winds to the Aloha State for the first time in 26 years, along with pounding surf and torrential rain. Hawaii has only seen three hurricanes reach its shores in the historical record. That could end up being both a blessing and a curse for residents living on the island as they prepare. “Risks that feel unknown to an individual can increase someone’s risk perception, and perhaps, increase their attention to messages,” Gina Eosco, a social scientist supporting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Office of Weather and Air Quality, told Earther. “On the other hand, given the rarity of such an event, some individuals may feel, ‘it won’t happen here.’ In other words, they’re using optimism bias.” As of Thursday at 2 a.m. local time, Hurricane Lane was packing winds of 130 mph, making it a very dangerous Category 4. Every island is under a hurricane watch or warning and forecasters are calling for 10-20 inches of rain over a large area. Some spots could pick up 30 inches—nearly double Honolulu’s yearly rainfall—with rainfall rates approaching 4 inches per hour. Hilo has already recorded nearly a foot of rain, and landslides have been reported. Lane is chugging along at just 7 mph, allowing it to stir up large swells, and storm surge could top out at four feet. To cap all this off, the strongest winds, rains, and surge impacts tend to occur on a hurricane’s northeast flank because of the way tropical cyclones rotate in the central Pacific. That’s right where the Hawaiian islands sit relative to Lane. This is the most dire forecast Hawaii has faced since Hurricane Iniki made landfall in Kauai in 1992. That storm caused $3.1 billion in damage and left an indelible mark on Hawaiians’ memories. Having it as a touchstone could help ensure Hawaiians take Lane seriously. “Hawaiians are pretty akamai, clued up,” John Marra, director of NOAA Pacific Regional Climate Services, told Earther. “The impacts [of Iniki] imprinted on a lot of folks.... We’re a little bit more aware than you might think.” That awareness already has Hawaiians following the same sorts of preparations you’d expect to see along the Gulf Coast: boarding up windows, filling up gas tanks, and stocking up on water and food. The state has requested and the federal government has already granted a disaster declaration, which could speed the response after the storm passes. All that being said, Karl Kim, the head of the University of Hawaii’s National Disaster Preparedness Training Center, pointed out that certain groups remain very vulnerable. “[P]oor people, homeless, persons with disabilities, seniors, and immigrant communities may be at-greater risk,” Kim told Earther. A May 2018 count estimates there are 6,530 homeless people across the islands. Police in Honolulu are canvassing tent communities urging homeless to seek shelter ahead of the storm, but there are a lot of people to reach and not a lot of time left. People living in poverty could also wind up homeless after the storm, something Houston saw in the wake of Harvey. Even the best preparations could still underestimate the impacts of Lane. Marra said the breadth of areas that will likely see massive rainfall totals could stretch resources thinner and leave people forced to fend for themselves for longer in flooded, muddy conditions. Then there’s the infrastructure on the ground. The state also upgraded its building codes in 2010 so that all new residential construction must withstand wind gusts of up to 130 mph. But older buildings don’t have to be up to that code and are at-risk from both winds and flooding. If those homes collapse or roofs rip off, the flying debris could put anyone in harm’s way. Marra also raised concerns about compound flooding from storm surge and rain that would have nowhere to go except into people’s basements. All of which is to say, Lane could test Hawaii in ways Iniki did as well as new ways. If you’re in Hawaii, pay attention to the forecast and stay safe.","Hurricane Lane continues to bear down on Hawaii, posing a catastrophic threat to residents and tourists alike.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"Several news organizations, including The New York Times, conducted independent analyses and found that the number of deaths traceable to the storm was probably far higher than the official count of 64. The Times’s review, based on daily mortality data from Puerto Rico’s vital statistics bureau, found that 1,052 more people than usual had died across the island in the 42 days after Maria struck. The analysis compared daily figures for 2017 with an average of figures for the corresponding days in 2015 and 2016. Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism reached a similar estimate, that 1,065 more people than usual had died in September and October. CNN compiled figures from half the island’s funeral homes to report that funeral directors believed that 499 more deaths than the official count were tied to the hurricane. Methods for counting storm deaths vary by state and locality. In some places, officials include only direct deaths, such as people who drown in storm floodwaters. Puerto Rico’s method is not that restrictive; the medical examiner includes some deaths indirectly caused by a storm, such as suicides. The leading causes of death on the island in September were diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease, Puerto Rican government data show. But there was a sharp spike — by 50 percent — in the number of recorded deaths from sepsis, a complication of severe infection that can be tied to delayed medical care or poor living conditions. Mr. Rosselló had previously said that his government would look into questionably attributed deaths reported by the news media. On Monday he said he welcomed the outside reviews of the death toll, but he cautioned that the government could not adjust its official mortality count based on “statistical analysis.” “Every life is more than a number, and every death must have a name and vital information attached to it, as well as an accurate accounting of the facts related to their passing,” he said. Reviewing the circumstances surrounding each death will require interviewing family members and doctors who signed death certificates to find out if, for example, the heart attack listed as the cause might have been brought on by stress related to the hurricane or might have been fatal because an ambulance could not get through debris-blocked streets to help in time. For weeks after the storm, top leaders of Puerto Rico’s government insisted that its count of the dead was accurate and not significantly low. On Sept. 29, nine days after Maria made landfall, Héctor M. Pesquera, Puerto Rico’s public safety secretary, said he did not think the count would rise by much. Four days later, President Trump visited the island and remarked that the death toll — which officially stood at 16 at the time — was much lower than the 1,833 people who died in 2005 because of Hurricane Katrina. Mr. Pesquera has repeatedly said that Puerto Rico hewed to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s protocols for counting storm-related deaths, and has urged families to share information with the authorities about any deaths that may be linked to the storm. “We always expected that the number of hurricane-related deaths would increase as we received more factual information — not hearsay — and this review will ensure we are correctly counting everybody,” Mr. Rosselló said on Monday.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"Photo Soldiers with the National Guard of Puerto Rico delivered water to residents in Utuado in October. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times The Federal Emergency Management Agency never intended to end food and water assistance to Puerto Rico on Wednesday, a spokesman said, and will continue providing it to Hurricane Maria survivors as needed. Reports this week that the agency had said it planned to cut off aid distribution to the storm-ravaged island had alarmed policymakers in Washington and Puerto Rico. The spokesman, William Booher, said the Jan. 31 date was mistakenly publicized by the agency in a National Public Radio interview published on Monday. According to Mr. Booher, Wednesday was not an actual cutoff, but rather an internal planning date to evaluate if Puerto Rico could still justify needing assistance. “This aid is not stopping,” Mr. Booher said in an interview. “There was no, and is no, current plan to stop providing these commodities, as long as there continues to be an identified need for them.” The confusion marks the latest blot in the federal government’s response to Maria, which was widely criticized as too small and too slow. More than four months after the storm, nearly a third of Puerto Rican power utility customers are still without electricity, and the island’s financial position remains shaky. Mr. Booher insisted on Wednesday that FEMA was not backtracking on its food and water aid plans in response to public criticism. Had the agency planned to end the assistance, it would have required giving notice to the Puerto Rican government, Mr. Booher noted, which said in a statement on Tuesday that it had been blindsided by the prospect of a cutoff. President Trump offered a brief moment of recognition for natural disaster victims in his State of the Union address on Tuesday, telling them, “We are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together.

SHERI FINK,"Those conditions, he said, made clearer why the government’s official death count was incomplete. “Even if they were really doing a good job, it was really hard unless you did something like we did — go talk to people on the ground,” he said. People, he added, “died alone in their houses. Nobody went there. Some of them were covered by a landslide, and months after they’ve not recovered the bodies.” Notably, abnormally high death rates continued at least through the end of December. “They didn’t show any sign of coming down in the several months following the hurricane that we were looking at,” said Caroline Buckee, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and the study’s other senior author. “There is clearly an excess mortality, and let’s not argue very specific numbers,” said Dr. Gilbert Burnham, a professor of international health and founder of the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved in the research, but has performed similar studies assessing deaths, including in Mosul, Iraq. Dr. Burnham said that despite the study’s limitations, including the difficulty of estimating Puerto Rico’s total population in light of migration, and the possible oversampling of smaller populations in more remote areas, such surveys “should become a standard activity in post-disaster situations,” because they help reveal vulnerabilities that can be addressed to save lives. Dr. Burnham and another expert unaffiliated with the study agreed with the researchers that the toll could be even higher than estimated if adjusted for the fact that people who died alone could not be surveyed. “It just is stunning how poor our information was as to what was happening in Puerto Rico,” said Leslie Roberts, a professor and director of the program on forced migration and health at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. The use of surveys to assess the extent of deaths and suffering in disasters, and to guide improvements, extends back decades. Particularly important were a series of studies in Bangladesh in 1970 and 1971, which revealed that women died at a higher rate than men from a massive cyclone that the researchers estimated killed at least 224,000 people. In Puerto Rico, the researchers visited 104 barrios across the island, selecting them to ensure that both urban and nonurban areas were represented. In the areas most remote from cities, about one in five residences were abandoned. The researchers chose households at random in each of the barrios, asking about deaths in the home, deaths in the neighborhood, and access to electricity, running water and phone service.",The number of people who died because of Hurricane Maria last year has been a matter of debate.

ERIKA P. RODRIGUEZ,"Credit Photographs by Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times A group of friends in Guaynabo, P.R., were singing by the light of their cellphones. Days before Christmas, and three months after Hurricane Maria made landfall, parts of the Puerto Rico are still without water, and over a million people are in the dark. Hundreds of residents remain in shelters, unable to return home. Schools that have been able to resume classes are still without power. But in towns around the island, residents are trying to keep holiday traditions alive, despite the circumstances. The group in Guaynabo had arrived at the home of Juan Pablo González for a parranda, a Puerto Rican Christmas tradition that brings friends together to sing carols, usually in the middle of the night. Mr. González’s home was still without power, so people used cellphones and flashlights to see one another and read song lyrics. In Old San Juan, Marta Cirino performed Christmas songs with Caiko y Los del Soberao, an Afro-Puerto Rican music group. The neighborhood is usually crowded with tourists, but on a recent night, it was full of locals who sang and danced to the music. The Eugenio María de Hostos School in Canóvanas has been used as a shelter for weeks, and is currently home to 94 people. Mildred Rodriguez, a resident at the shelter, brought an artificial Christmas tree salvaged from the debris at her home, and decorated it with what she could find. Workers cleaned and decorated the Escuela del Pueblo Trabajador, a Montessori institution near Trujillo Alto. The school decided to continue a decades-long tradition and hold a holiday celebration for the children after parents asked for it. The area has been without power since Hurricane Irma made landfall a few weeks before Maria swept over the island, but the school reopened in early October. In previous years, only one Puerto Rican flag would hang near the Three Kings altar at the school, but this year dozens of flags were integrated in the decoration. The academic director of the school, Marlyn Souffront, wanted to focus on reaffirming the island’s cultural identity.","Large parts of Puerto Rico still don’t have power after Hurricane Maria, but some residents are determined to celebrate Christmas one way or another.",2017-12-22T10:00:58Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","After Surviving Maria, Trying to Keep Holiday Traditions Alive",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/22/us/hurricane-maria-christmas-puerto-rico.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/21/us/00navidad-01/00navidad-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane,1
STEPHEN HILTNER,"To be sure, Village de l’Est is still home to a vibrant array of Vietnamese traditions, many of which revolve around three cultural pillars: religion, family and food. It’s hard to overstate the centrality of religious life. An overwhelming majority of the Vietnamese community here is Roman Catholic, and the local church, Mary Queen of Vietnam, serves the residents in ways that extend far beyond the liturgical. “All kinds of social issues come to the church, and to the pastor,” said Tony Tran, 54, a longtime parish coordinator. “Political, social, medical issues — the whole nine yards.” In its early days, he said, the church even helped to educate residents about, and translate, the state’s electrical codes. The church hosts the community’s annual Tet festival, a celebration of the Lunar New Year — an event that includes firework displays and dragon dances. The church was also instrumental in helping to begin a community development corporation, MQVN, that since 2006 has advocated a range of development programs, including those tied to health care, education, housing, social services and economic development.","Forty-three years after the fall of Saigon and almost 13 years after Hurricane Katrina, many residents wonder if their long-resilient community is nearing another — quieter — inflection point.",2018-05-05T09:00:09Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Surfacing: Vietnamese Forged a Community in New Orleans.

William Booher, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement that hotels would be notified of the judge’s continuation of the temporary restraining order, but he declined to comment on the case. In a separate statement, FEMA said it was extending until Aug. 1 the deadline for hurricane victims living in motels under the program to obtain free airfare to fly home, along with coverage for luggage and pet transportation fees. The original cutoff was July 1. In his order on Tuesday, Judge Hillman ordered the plaintiffs and FEMA to submit further briefings in writing. In particular, he asked them to address the implications of a refusal by Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico to request an extension of the temporary sheltering assistance. FEMA argued the plaintiffs’ lawsuit would not succeed because Mr. Rosselló agreed to the termination of the program, which had been extended three times before the June 30 deadline.","David Olmeda and Christine Gonzalez’s son Kahil, in the motel room in Kissimmee, Fla., where they have been living since Hurricane Maria forced them from their home in Puerto Rico.",2018-07-03T17:44:14Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Judge Orders Extension of FEMA Aid for Puerto Rican Storm Evacuees,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/us/fema-puerto-rico-housing.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/04/us/04puertorico/04puertorico-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane,1
"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","We’re still a few weeks out from the official start of hurricane season, but tropical cyclones don’t care much for regulation. That’s why there’s a small chance one could spin up off the Florida Panhandle this week. A large, low pressure area filled with clouds and thunderstorms has developed across the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, and it’s marching slowly northward toward the west coast of Florida. As it moves across warm Gulf waters and gathers strength over the next 48 hours, it has about a 30 percent chance of getting organized into a cyclone. Over the next five days, those odds rise to 40 percent, according to the National Weather Service. Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson told Earther that in all likelihood, any cyclone that does form would be classified a tropical or subtropical depression, with maximum sustained winds of 38 mph or less. But, he added, there’s a “small chance” of a named tropical or subtropical storm, one featuring wind speeds of 39—73 mph. “I wouldn’t rule it out, it’s just on the lower side of the probabilities,” Henson said, noting that water temperatures are a bit marginal right now. Regardless of how fierce the storm gets, Floridians are going to feel it. The entire Florida Peninsula could be in for heavy rainfall this week, with eastern Florida around Kennedy Space Center expected to see up to seven inches of precipitation. And that’s not necessarily a bad thing—central and South Florida are coming off a particularly dry dry season, with more than 30 percent of the state in moderate to severe drought as of May 8. “This will slowly alleviate some of the drought conditions,” Henson said, adding that there’s also some concern about localized flash flooding. Predicted rainfall totals for 7-day period ending on May 20. Image: National Weather Service The system has already brought record rainfall to the Florida Keys. By yesterday evening, Key West had notched 3.24 inches of precipitation—more than double the previous May 13 record in logs going back to 1871. On the off chance that the Gulf of Mexico does get a named storm this week, that’d be pretty special. Colorado State University meteorologist Phil Klotzbach told Earther via email that since 1851, only four named storms have formed in the Gulf of Mexico in May. The last one was in 1976.","We’re still a few weeks out from the official start of hurricane season, but tropical cyclones don’t care much for regulation.

Gliding over to the next planet, let us visit a unique set of dunes on Mars. The Hubble Space Telescope, for its part, goes for a wide shot of Saturn and its moons. The ringed planet sports its own massive storm, but unlike Florence, Saturn’s hexagon-shaped storm continues to be a scientific mystery. Both of these tempests do share something in common: Each looms above its respective atmosphere and is incredibly photogenic. Once we leave Saturn, we check out a bizarre galaxy called AM 0644-741. Huge amounts of x-rays emanate from AM 0644-741, and scientists think they are caused by either several black holes or neutron stars—both are known for glowing strongly in the x-ray spectrum. After we magically survive this experience, we’ll have time for one more galaxy, NGC 4036.

LIZETTE ALVAREZ,"Ms. Velez, and other residents of Bubao, a fleck of a town in mountainous Utuado that was cut off by damaged roads and bridges, had little choice but to rely on each other. Photo Residents of Bubao with food and supplies delivered by volunteers. After the storm, residents banded together to help one another. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times After the storm, they stepped out of their washed-out houses and began to shovel and sweep and mop even as they waited, forever it seemed, for help to arrive. They worked for days to try to make the town’s main road passable. “It took everyone two weeks,” Ms. Velez said. “They finally sent a tractor to help move all the dirt and debris.” The small kindnesses came daily. A neighbor with bottles of water always made a point of leaving a few at Ms. Velez’s doorstep. A relative with ice, a precious commodity, would give her a bag now and again. In turn, if someone needed a lantern, she handed over one of hers. Mothers cared for each other’s children and took turns waiting in lines at banks and gas stations. Teachers clambered into the bed of pickup trucks and traveled as far as they could along muddy, washed-out roads to check on their students. Ms. Torres had been saved by two neighbors as floodwaters filled her home. She was dazed and could not get out, so the men had lifted her through a window. Around the island, doctors have teamed to make forays into hard-to-reach towns in the interior, jumping in cars and sport utility vehicles with whatever supplies they could muster. In Humacao, a municipality on the eastern shore where Hurricane Maria snapped sturdy trees in half like pretzel rods and flooded entire neighborhoods, teachers showed up at school the next day, unbidden. Fallen trees covered the courtyard. Mud caked the hallways and classrooms. They put on gloves and started to haul away branches. Eventually, cafeteria workers served up thousands of meals for the homebound and others in Humacao. In the distance, several weeks after Maria, mountains that had looked brown and stripped of life after the hurricane now glowed green. “We will put fruit trees over there, and plants there,” said Carmen Gisela Rodriguez, a teacher in Humacao, envisioning a tableau of shade and plenty in the school courtyard. Her eyes welled up. “Amid all this grew a culture of sharing.” Photo Pirulo, a salsa musician who stayed on the island during the storm, handed out supplies in Bubao. “It’s my country,” he said. “If I leave, who stays to work — and there is a lot of work to be done.” Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times Ms. Velez said optimism had sometimes slipped away from her amid so many unsolvable questions: Where to find food. How to cook the food. Where to wash clothes. How to fix the gate, remove the mold, rebuild her back rooms. Suicidal thoughts came and went, she said. But she smiled and clasped her cheeks in astonishment when Tito El Bambino and a well-known salsa musician, Pirulo, his dreadlocks bouncing off his back, walked along the street and right up to her. Her son whipped out his iPhone, and she basked in their attention. “This helps us so much — so much,” Ms. Velez said. “To feel we are not abandoned.” Tito, who helped popularize reggaeton, which combines rap with Latin rhythms, and Pirulo made deliberate decisions to stay in Puerto Rico during and after the hurricane, knowing their visibility would draw attention and donations to some of the most desperate pockets of the island. Not long after the storm cleared the island, Pirulo left his apartment in Old San Juan and joined a brigade of doctors going house to house. He helped evacuate elderly residents. Then he started bringing food and water to other marginalized neighborhoods, something he did for weeks. “It’s my country,” he said. “If I leave, who stays to work — and there is a lot of work to be done.” Tito became the public face of the distribution caravans. He joined forces with Alberto E. de la Cruz, the chief executive of Coca-Cola Puerto Rico Bottlers who organized caravans of his company’s trucks to ferry food and water to some the island’s most neglected towns. Volunteers distributed the goods door-to-door as music boomed and people danced. Mr. de la Cruz helped persuade the Federal Emergency Management Agency and National Guard to join the line of trucks. Residents felt like Christmas had come when the caravans rumbled into their town. Tito and Pirulo posed for countless selfies. They hugged and cried and listened. Pirulo grabbed bags of food and headed up a hill to knock on doors. Tito handed money for milk to a young mother with a baby perched on her hip. The residents of Bubao said they had gotten little help from the government; the municipal mayor had yet to show up weeks after the hurricane, they said. As Pirulo and Tito walked by, one man held up a sign that said, “No Te Vayas. Puerto Rico Te Necesita,” meaning, “Don’t Leave. Puerto Rico Needs You.” “A hug is sometimes worth more than a can of sausages,” Pirulo said. “People go through a disaster like this and it’s the people — el pueblo — who end up helping each other. That’s how we get by.” Continue reading the main story","Since Hurricane Maria steamrollered Puerto Rico, the day-to-day job of digging out, sometimes block by block, has fallen largely to island residents.",2017-12-17T12:00:27Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Utuado Journal: Rebuilding Puerto Rico, One Small Gesture at a Time",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/17/us/puerto-rico-hurricane-tito-el-bambino.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/us/16prjournal1/16prjournal1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane,1
JONATHAN WOLFE,"I re-enter the fray of the largest city in the country: 8.5 million distinct beings who have days when they share, and days when they withhold. I am one of them. I was born December 3. — Nick Riccardo In this week in 1954, New York City was spared the worst from a devastating hurricane. Hurricane Edna, which was predicted to slam into the city and Long Island, instead moved north and “grazed New York City with her short left arm,” wrote The Times. Still, the storm plunged thousands of homes into darkness and killed at least 12 people. “Eccentric Edna,” The Times reported, “stripped the first autumn leaves from park trees, beat against skyscraper windows and setbacks, and plucked and tore at the great bridges.” “She created great pools in the sheep meadow of Central Park and around construction jobs at the Triborough Bridge approaches,” The Times added. The hurricane, which lashed the city with rain for 17 hours on Sept. 11, was the second hurricane to affect the city in two months. That August, Hurricane Carol passed along the East Coast, killing at least 68 people, some in New York City. Together, the “mean Hurricane Sisters” caused around half a billion dollars in damage, leading The Times to wonder in a headline in 1954: “Northeast Hurricanes: Freaks or Portents?”",Wednesday: Tracking Hurricane Florence and the “mean Hurricane Sisters” of 1954.,2018-09-12T10:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",New York Today: New York Today: Could Hurricane Florence Hit New York?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/nyregion/new-york-today-hurricane-florence.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/12/nyregion/12nytoday1/12nytoday1-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane,1
MANNY FERNANDEZ and ILANA PANICH-LINSMAN,"Local, state and federal officials expressed concern for low-income Harvey victims, but they were unable to explain why so many of them continue to struggle. City officials say there has been no shortage of resources and services for poor residents affected by the storm, including the 14 neighborhood restoration centers the city opened, mostly in low-income areas. FEMA said it has put $4.3 billion into the hands of affected Houstonians. “There are thousands of families who live in low-income communities, who already were operating at the margins before Harvey, and the storm pushed them down even further,” the mayor of Houston, Sylvester Turner, said in an interview. “We want to reassure them that they have not been forgotten.” Mr. Turner, who visited Kashmere Gardens and other neighborhoods to mark the anniversary of Harvey, described the problem as a federal and state issue, citing the $5 billion in federal Community Development Block Grant disaster-recovery funds that were approved for Texas, but that Houston has yet to receive. “We know that the city is going to receive $1.14 billion dollars in C.D.B.G. funding for housing,” Mr. Turner said. “But you can’t disperse what you don’t have.” Kurt H. Pickering, a spokesman for FEMA in Texas, said the agency had seen no evidence that low-income areas were receiving less support from the agency. He said that federal assistance was designed not to make a person whole after a disaster, but to help start the recovery process. “FEMA does everything possible to assist every family in every way,” within the bounds of its regulations, Mr. Pickering said. In Kashmere Gardens, Ms. Houston ended the tour of her house on Lufkin Street after a few minutes. “I can’t stay in here too long because I start coughing,” she said. She spoke of the past 12 months as a series of disputes and broken promises. She said she felt abandoned by FEMA, contractors, reporters and celebrities who visited the neighborhood and failed to follow up on repairs. “We’re no more than 15 minutes from River Oaks,” she said, referring to one of the wealthiest areas of Houston. “It’s not just the government. Don’t nobody care.”","Texas has made progress recuperating from Hurricane Harvey, but low-income and minority residents have had a much harder time.",2018-09-03T06:00:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","A Year After Hurricane Harvey, Houston’s Poorest Neighborhoods Are Slowest to Recover",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/us/hurricane-harvey-houston.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/31/us/00harvey1/merlin_142983849_2aec0b0c-ba1d-40aa-9127-db853d4ab48a-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane,1

A.A. Newton,"Natural disaster responses increasingly rely on electronic devices for communication. In the aftermath of a destructive storm, your phone or tablet can be a literal lifeline—so it needs to actually work. Losing the ability to communicate with the outside world makes it harder to coordinate relief efforts and downright impossible to let friends and family know you’re safe. Personal safety should always take top priority, but if your family disaster plan relies on smartphones or laptops in any way, it’s crucial that you take steps to prevent them from being damaged. Here are some ways to do just that. Waterproof Your Devices Obviously, keeping your electronics dry is crucial in a hurricane, and the easiest way to do this is to pack all of your tech in airtight, watertight plastic containers. If you have a vacuum sealer, perfect; seal your backup batteries, chargers, adapters, and cords in bags before packing them. If you don’t, Ziploc bags work well. In either case, silica gel packets provide extra dryness insurance, so long as they’re not already saturated with moisture. You can recharge saturated silica in a pinch by drying it out in a 200-250ºF oven for a few hours, but if you’re unsure how dry it is, buying fresh stuff from the hardware store is your best bet. Diversify Your Charger Portfolio A phone or laptop with a dead battery is completely useless, so be sure to pack lots of different battery-replenishing options in your go bag. Fully-charged external batteries are a must, and USB-compatible car chargers let you charge devices from any car with a working battery—just be sure to unplug the adapter when you’re done. Throw in a power strip or two to make the most of any functional power outlets you encounter, plus some extra connecting cables, and you should be fully covered. Get the Most Out of Your Smartphone The pocket-sized supercomputers we all carry around are lifesavers in an emergency situation, even when cell service or wifi is unavailable. Your smartphone can handle everything from first-aid apps to downloaded maps to quick-access document storage; figure out what information you need access to and download it to your phone. While you’re at it, take necessary precautions to maximize your phone’s battery life, which could make your life much easier in an extended power outage. Generally speaking you don't want to rely on technology at all in your disaster toolkit, but… Read more Read If you haven’t already, be sure to activate your phone’s emergency contact functions. Android users can add emergency contacts to their lock screen, and the Medical ID function of Apple’s Health app allows you to make relevant medical and contact information lock screen-accessible. Opt in to emergency notifications, too: Android settings are under the “Cell Broadcast” header, and iOs settings are in the “Government Alerts” section of the Notifications menu. Back Up Absolutely Everything If you rely on a physical hard drive for important file backups—or worse, don’t back anything up at all—get a cloud backup running ASAP. I use Backblaze, which is perfectly fine, but there are a ton of options out there. If you’re not sure where to start, Lifehacker has a few guides to online backup services that will help. Don’t forget to take photos and/or video of your house, yard, and any other property you have insured in case you need to file claims—and back those up, too. Use Social Media to Your Advantage A physical meeting place is crucial to an IRL emergency plan, but you should have a social media “meeting” plan too—especially if you have out-of-towners worrying about you. Consumer Reports recommends choosing one platform for check-ins and ensuring that every family member has the relevant app installed on their phone. As for far-flung family and friends, designate one person who lives out of the disaster zone as your liaison. Ask this person to be available for check-ins and do the work of updating other concerned parties so you can focus on more important things.","Natural disaster responses increasingly rely on electronic devices for communication.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Hurricane Michael, an unprecedented storm that slammed into the Florida Panhandle at Category 4 strength, may well be an arbiter of things to come in a world where climate change is poised to make such devastating hurricanes all the more likely. But it also gave us a look at the past in the form of destroyed vessels from 119 years ago that Michaels terrifying storm surge unearthed. According to a report this weekend in the Tallahassee Democrat, Michaels waters dredged up shipwrecks on Dog Island in Franklin County that are believed to be vessels beached during the 1899 Carrabelle hurricane. Photos posted to Facebook by the Carrabelle Boat Club and to Twitter by the Democrat show heavily damaged, but clearly recognizable, hulls completely exposed to the elements. The paper reported that the specific identities of the unearthed vessels has not yet been determined, since state officials are busy dealing with the immediate aftermath of the recent storm: They are well-documented wrecks, according to the Florida Department of State. Because state resources are being allocated to more urgent hurricane recovery efforts, there are no plans for state archaeologists to visit the site. Theyve been mostly stationary since 1899 when they were wrecked in a hurricane, wrote DOS spokeswoman Sarah Revell. From time to time, some parts of the site have become exposed. The 1899 Carrabelle Hurricane is so named, according to the Florida Historical Society, because after it was done dealing destruction in the Dominican Republic it barreled into the city of Carrabelle in Floridas Panhandle region at Category 2 strength, destroying an estimated 57 ships and wiping the town almost entirely off the map. That hurricane resulted in at least seven reported deaths and hundreds of injuries, the Florida Historical Society wrote, as well as did significant damage to other nearby coastal communities in Florida. Michael was far stronger, reaching the Panhandle at Category 4 strength and doing massive damage well beyond the coast. CNN reported Saturday that officials had raised the death toll to at least 36, with 26 deaths in Florida alone and others reported in Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia. (According to the Tampa Bay Times, the Florida death count was still being tallied in part due to damaged infrastructure and bad communication in Bay and Gulf counties as of Friday.) The city of Mexico Beach was so badly damaged, with a reported 85 percent destruction rate among homes subjected to 14-foot storm surge, that it is unclear whether the community can rebuild on its own or whether it will be taken over by developers that have long had eyes on its waterfront properties, the Palm Beach Post wrote. In Franklin County, storm surge wrecked homes and tore up roads close to the shore. As the nearly century-and-a-half old shipwrecks show, the damage done by massive storms like Michael can leave its mark for an incredible length of time. In Florida, many of the worst-hit regions were among the poorest in the state ; as the New York Times wrote on Sunday, locals are worried that they may be left without the support they need to rebuild their communities in the long run, not just now. We came here because we know people are going to start forgetting, 49-year-old volunteer Norma Ward of Plant City, who was helping distribute supplies in the city of Marianna, told the Times. You can only see so many pictures on TV of broken homes and trees. Then you start thinking, O.K., everythings all good again.

MIRIAM JORDAN,"Hondurans have been on tenterhooks since last year, when T.P.S. designation for their country was up for renewal. In November, the government allowed it to automatically extend for six months, citing a need for further assessment. It set the new expiration date of July 5, and the government must announce a decision six months in advance. T.P.S. holders carry a card that is similar to a driver’s license, which enables them to work legally. They also have Social Security numbers. However, they are not entitled to federal or state loans and other assistance. Catherine Sarmiento, 23, who has had protected status as a Honduran since age 8, finished four years of college last year and found a job as a nuclear medicine technician at a hospital in Florida. Her parents and sister, also living in Florida under protected status, face the loss of their legal resident status and work permits, too, she said. “We’re all worried,” she said. “The whole family is worried.” About 61 percent of Hondurans lived in poverty in 2016, according to the World Bank, and Honduras has the biggest gap between rich and poor of any country. Many facing the loss of their protected status said they would resort to living in the shadows, like the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, rather than return to their troubled homeland. Sonia Paz, 55, who arrived in Los Angeles when she was 22 and has three children and grandchildren, said she had no intention of leaving. “I have nothing in Honduras,” she said. “To go back would be the kiss of death.” Her hometown is San Pedro Sula, notorious for gangs that target people with relatives in the United States for extortion. “They find out that you were in America and take the little you have away from you, or kill you,” she added.","“I did everything right: I worked hard, started a company, had two children and made investments here,” said Samuel Contreras, a licensed contractor on Long Island who arrived in 1998, shortly after Hurricane Mitch struck Honduras.",2018-05-04T17:08:02Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Thousands of Hondurans to Lose Protected Status in the U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/honduras-temporary-protected-status.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/04/us/00hondurans-02/00hondurans-02-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane,1
JESS BIDGOOD,"• Hurricane Lane was expected to bring tropical storm and hurricane-force winds to parts of Hawaii, with up to 30 inches of rain in some areas, according to the National Weather Service. The storm was approaching Hawaii on Wednesday. • President Trump issued an emergency declaration for the State of Hawaii on Thursday morning, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts. • The state’s 15 airports were set to remain open during the storm, barring infrastructure damage. As of Thursday morning, flightaware.com reported some delays at airports across the islands. The approach of Hurricane Lane is the third time in less than a year that Hawaii has braced for potential disaster. In January, an errant emergency alert about an incoming ballistic missile triggered an island-wide panic. In May, the Kilauea Volcano began to erupt, sending lava rolling over roads and homes in the same area that is now under a flash flood watch. Photo Alex Krivoulian, right, stocked up on water in Honolulu. Residents have been advised to gather supplies of food and water that could last them as long as 14 days. Credit Kat Wade/Getty Images And yet, with strong hurricanes rare in this part of the world, the threat of Hurricane Lane felt new and deeply unsettling to some residents, who heeded the National Weather Service’s advice that preparations to safeguard life and property should be “rushed to completion.” “Maui has not faced anything like this before. It’s serious,” Audrey Reed, 76, a resident of that island, said on Wednesday. “We’ve got everything we need: batteries, water, canned and dry foods, medication, first-aid kit, flashlights. It’s just a matter now of hunkering down and trying to ride it out.” Hawaii’s remote geography and mountainous terrain could pose challenges for recovery in the event of widespread damage, and Gov. Ige urged people to have a 14-day supply of food before the storm. Hurricane Lane arrives as other parts of the nation are still recovering from the megastorms of 2017. Hurricane Harvey hit Houston almost exactly one year ago, causing dozens of deaths and catastrophic flooding, and it was followed by Hurricane Irma’s wallop to Florida. Then came Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, which may have killed more than 1,400 people, according to one analysis, and caused massive power outages. Some of the last customers were still getting their power back earlier this month.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","The U.S. government says 62 people in Puerto Rico have officially died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Not many people are buying that given the island’s lack of electricity, healthcare access, and clean drinking water. To account for this discrepancy, media outlets have been making an extra effort to uncover the true extent of death on the island. Their conclusion? That 62 should be closer to 1,000. Publications like Latino USA and The New York Times released their own analyses on Thursday and Friday, respectively, after looking at how mortality data in September and October from the Demographic Registry of Puerto Rico compares to 2015 and 2016. The Times found that 1,052 more people died than usual. The numbers are especially high on the days immediately following September 20, when Maria hit the U.S. territory. Cities like Manatí, Jayuya, and Aguadilla saw some of the highest death rates. In September, the island saw a major spike in deaths from sepsis, an extreme body response to infection that attacks tissue, which the Times attributes to delayed medical treatment or poor conditions in homes and hospitals. Puerto Rico has been dealing with a range of health care crises since the hurricane, and getting people proper, timely treatment has been a challenge. The leading causes of death were diabetes and Alzheimer’s. As Times reporter Frances Robles noted on Twitter, insulin is supposed to be refrigerated. According to the Food and Drug Administration, the drug can lose its effectiveness when exposed to extreme temperatures. And Puerto Rico was in the 90s after the storm. The Puerto Rican government can keep blaming this rise on coincidence, but advocates, lawyers, and physicians are taking matters into their own hands. A delegation of more than 30 people in Washington, D.C., on Thursday presented a petition before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to address the human rights issues on the island post-Maria. Among the requests? That the commission halt fiscal austerity measures the U.S. has imposed on Puerto Rico due to its debt crisis, as well as the repeal of a federal law— PROMESA —passed to aid with the crisis. The commission likely won’t respond for another few days, but Commission President Margarette May Macaulay did note the commission would send a formal request for the United States to conduct an on-site visit to Puerto Rico as soon as possible next year. This came after the commission heard testimony after testimony about life on the island. More than two months since the hurricane hit the island, things should be getting back to normal, right? However, many of these U.S. citizens are still struggling to find normalcy and the island isn’t even meeting 70 percent of its energy output. Those who testified talked about coal ash contamination in the South, which they’ve received no update about from the government. They don’t know for sure whether a five-story-high coal ash pile has leaked into their water supply— but they do know the government did nothing to prevent that. The pile was left uncovered during Hurricane Maria. They discussed the exacerbated poverty their pueblos are seeing after the hurricane, as well as the ongoing inability from local hospitals to help their sick relatives. “It would be good for us to wake up and smell the roses instead of smelling chemicals.” “We have a problem in Puerto Rico, and it’s one of discrimination,” said Annette Martínez Orabona, director of the Caribbean Institute for Human Rights, in Spanish, her voice breaking. “It’s about discrimination that stems from our colonial relationship because we haven’t been given the opportunity to practice our right to self-determine, and that should remain clear.” The commission heard what both sides had to say, but Puerto Rican officials didn’t send a representative to attend the meeting alongside other U.S. government reps. Maybe they’re too busy trying to update the official death toll? Macauley was obviously curious herself about this, asking why. Interim Permanent Representative at the U.S. Mission to the Organization of American States Kevin Sullivan, the only U.S. official to speak during the hearing, wouldn’t elaborate why not a single Puerto Rican official could attend this human rights hearing. He simply said they reached out to ask Puerto Rican officials for input and received a letter, which wasn’t read. “It is very unfortunate that these things are happening, which we call natural disasters, but which are, in fact, man-made because we’ve destroyed our world.

MICHAEL KIMMELMAN,"‘Don’t California My Texas’ Jim Blackburn, a planner, environmental lawyer and something of a lightning rod around here, has been warning for years about climate change, the decrepit state of Houston’s reservoirs and the perils of developing the Katy Prairie. He remembers escaping years ago to the prairie to bird watch. One recent morning he drove me out there along the Grand Parkway and pulled into an unfinished subdivision. A saleswoman in a model home boasted about $1 billion worth of box stores and malls being built nearby. The development, she said, adheres to county standards requiring that houses be raised above the 100-year floodplain. The woman handed Mr. Blackburn a glossy brochure and a disclaimer, which he scanned before climbing back into the car, shaking his head. The disclaimer explained that roads outside the development, linking it to the parkway, occupy the 10-year floodplain, meaning they would have about a 10 percent chance of flooding every year. “These days that means they’ll flood anytime you look at them funny,” Mr. Blackburn said. “It’s the new normal.” That’s not far-off. The number of “heavy precipitation” events in the United States has skyrocketed since the 1960s. Since 1980, instances of extreme weather — hurricanes, floods, heat waves — linked to climate change have cost the United States $1.1 trillion. Studies show that for every dollar spent upfront in preparedness, American taxpayers could save $4 in emergency relief and reconstruction — not counting health costs, the impact of lost jobs and business revenues and incalculable grief. But that requires politicians to agree. “We suffered nothing short of a catastrophic disaster,” a veteran Texas lobbyist, Bill Miller, said. “It happens at a time when the people in the governing class in this state don’t believe in taxes and government. But they also don’t want anybody discouraged from coming here, because that’s bad for business.” An upbeat narrative casts business-friendly Texas in the loner role of swashbuckling cowboy, disdainful of coastal elites. “Don’t California my Texas” has become a rallying cry for Republican state lawmakers and a theme repeated by the governor, Greg Abbott, who has complained about “a patchwork quilt of bans and rules and regulations that is eroding the Texas model.” He believes cities are the culprit. For years, Texas Republicans promoted local controls to push against federal court orders on issues like desegregation and same-sex marriage. Now state leaders have made a U-turn. Mr. Abbott has complained about “political demagogues using climate change as an excuse to remake the American economy.” At a Republican gathering in June, he talked about the experience of driving out of the state’s capital, Austin. “It starts smelling different,” he told the audience. “And you know what that fragrance is? Freedom.” Little wonder, post-Harvey, that state and local officials have anointed different flood and recovery czars. Texas is sounding these days like Russia under the Romanovs. The system ensures nobody is clearly in charge. Least of all in Houston. A bill that would have allowed Harris County merely to issue the equivalent of parking tickets to developers violating floodplain regulations — the sort of regulations that control flooding — was vetoed by the governor. Two other bills to study flooding in the Houston region, introduced in the last legislative session, died in committee. And not long ago, when Houston’s Democratic mayor, Sylvester Turner, petitioned the governor to tap into the state’s multibillion-dollar Rainy Day Fund for post-Harvey debris removal, Mr. Abbott said he would not authorize money before 2019, when the Legislature is next scheduled to meet. I met with the mayor in City Hall at the time. He noted that the Legislature had convened a special session to ban gender-neutral bathrooms. “If they can meet about toilets, why can’t they meet when the toilets overflow?” one frustrated city official said, before Mr. Abbott came up with $50 million from a separate fund to stem growing criticism. Another official, this one with the county, made the point that the area around Houston is a patchwork of counties and municipalities with different rules and no coordination because Texans believed the upside of what became, in essence, institutionalized entropy was that it allowed residents to avoid the encumbrances of city governments, regulations and taxes. The problem is that hurricanes and floods, worsened by climate change, do not recognize political borders or county lines. Their toll is shared by everyone. The latest estimate from Moody’s puts recovery from Harvey at $81 billion, much of which will end up paid by taxpayers across the United States. “The whole trans-Mississippi pioneer enterprise was in fact brought to you by the federal government,” says Steven Conn, a historian and author of “Americans Against the City.” The hypocrisy of Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, resisting federal aid to the New York region after Hurricane Sandy but then requesting it for Texas after Harvey, is in fact part of this same history. Houston’s unregulated sprawl, Mr. Conn added, gives physical form to this politics of “decentralization and anti-statism.” Photo Bruce Hooper, outside his home in Kashmere Gardens in Houston, would like to move but has no place to go.

Credit Josh Haner/The New York Times A Houston Selling Point: It’s Not New York At the same time, Houston is in many ways a forward-looking, progressive city. Before it elected Mr. Turner, it elected a mayor who was a lesbian. The city is in thrall to cars and highways and has precious little mass transit, but the municipality of Houston relies more on renewable energy than any other big city in America. Houston has more green space, relative to paved, than New York. And what many Houston residents like about it, its supporters say, is precisely that it isn’t New York or San Francisco or Boston. They insist that its business-friendly, light-on-regulations approach helps account for a big rise in employment since 2000. A report by the city’s Center for Opportunity Urbanism, a pro-development organization, which cautions against overreacting to Harvey, said: “The city emanates a conviction that people should have the freedom to determine their destiny.” Photo Houston’s sprawl, and its dependence on the automobile, contributed to the misery that Hurricane Harvey unleashed. Credit Josh Haner/The New York Times Thomas Cole, director of the McGovern Center for Humanities and Ethics at the Texas Medical School of Houston, recalled how, during the 1960s, business leaders and politicians conspired with media executives to desegregate Houston quietly, seeing the turmoil that desegregation was causing elsewhere in the South. Decades later, Houston boasts of becoming the most diverse big city in the country, with comparatively low housing costs that translate to higher levels of minority homeownership. But what does “affordable” really mean if residents have to pay hefty transportation costs and rebuild, time and again, after floods? Houston’s affordability leans on loosely regulated, low-cost immigrant labor providing an abundance of cheaply made, slab-on-grade, single-family houses that sprawl on all that open land, in areas like the Katy Prairie. And it relies heavily on American taxpayers providing government tax credits, mortgage interest deductions, gas subsidies, artificially low flood insurance rates, highway construction money — and emergency relief, including buying out homeowners to remove their properties from harm’s way. Harris County officials say they have received as many requests for buyouts since the hurricane (3,000) as there have been buyouts since the mid-1990s. Harvey turned out to be an equal opportunity disaster. In Meyerland, an affluent district where Brays Bayou burst its banks, Steve and Julie Sacks’s house flooded for the third time in three years. They are among the homeowners hoping for a buyout. “But I’m not counting on one,” Mr. Sacks told me. Buying out rich homes to repurpose vulnerable areas like Meyerland for flood detention, as Mr. Sacks notes, would require loads of money and remove valuable properties from tax rolls in a county that relies on property taxes. Bruce Hooper would move, too. During Harvey, he woke up to crackling sounds, when floodwaters started to seep into his appliances and electrical outlets. Mr. Hooper lives in a poor area called Kashmere Gardens. I found him sitting on a tattered lawn chair outside the shell of his tumbledown rental. An unemployed former parks employee, Mr. Hooper told me that he and his family of five had to be airlifted out by the Coast Guard after a detention pond overflowed and water inside the house rose from ankle to chest high in an hour. He would live elsewhere, he said, but like many others without flood insurance or savings, “we got nowhere else to go.” Photo Andy and Christine Kahan inside their damaged home in Bear Creek Village. “Welcome to the war zone,” Mr. Kahan said. Credit Josh Haner/The New York Times As for Andy and Christine Kahan, they were among thousands who had no inkling they were especially vulnerable before Harvey. The Kahans own a single-story home in a middle-class neighborhood, Bear Creek Village. “The damn dam did us in,” Mr. Kahan said. The Kahans’s home was among those houses flooded by the reservoirs, which Harvey for the first time filled and threatened to overflow. Christine Kahan and her husband had lived for 28 years in their house without a flood. Now Ms. Kahan said she would entertain a buyout. A part-time real-estate agent, she advises clients to think twice about buying any home that flooded. Hers is now one of them. But Mr. Kahan says they will stay, for the time being. “I’m not a skeptic about climate change,” he told me. “It defies logic not to believe something is going on.” I asked how that lined up with his desire not to leave Bear Creek. “Harvey was an exception, an act of God,” he said, then added, “I know it doesn’t make sense. But I’m an optimist. “At least, I am until the next flood.” Continue reading the main story","Houston is drained by several meandering rivers, or bayous, that move water from west to east.

LUIS FERRÉ-SADURNÍ and CHRISTOPHER GREGORY,"The last time Enrique and Emma were at the Rafael Hernández Airport, the lights were out, A.T.M.s were down and stragglers were trying to escape the island. Now, the terminal was lit and the windows were damp from the air-conditioning. But as the sun began to rise behind the tattered Puerto Rican flags on the winding road to their home, the lingering effects of the hurricane became clear. An airplane hangar was still missing part of its roof. A gas station was closed, its giant metal sign still on the ground. Tarps were strung over dozens of homes. On an island where about 100,000 households remain without power, progress is painfully slow. Engineers were still repairing a crucial dam near Aguadilla that had cracked during the hurricane. As part of the repairs, water service in the area would be rationed, but Enrique and Emma didn’t know that yet. Their two-story home sits just off the island’s longest highway, nestled in an unassuming neighborhood where dog barks and chicken clucks fill the air.

Rachel Becker,"When Hurricane Michael crashed into the Florida Panhandle on October 10th, the storm cut power to parts of Florida and Georgia in its path, new NASA images show. The pictures are a stark reminder of our energy infrastructure’s vulnerability to natural disasters. The pictures went up today on NASA’s Earth Observatory blog, but lights have started to turn back on since the “after” image was snapped on October 12th. At this point, the number of customers without power has dropped to 163,000 from the 2.6 million that lost power after the storm, according to the Edison Electric Institute. (To be clear, that count reflects the number of meters that aren’t getting electricity, not the number of people, which is probably higher.) Some areas may have to wait weeks or even months for the grid to be repaired enough for the power to turn back on, NASA’s Earth Observatory says. That’s a lot of time for people to be without electricity for things like powering refrigerators, charging up medical devices, and running AC units. So why don’t hurricane-prone regions like Florida bury their power lines instead of stringing them up just to be torn down by powerful winds? Last year, 6.7 million of Florida’s electricity customers lost power after Hurricane Irma hit, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That’s almost two-thirds of the customers in the state. It’s a question that Ted Kury, director of energy studies at the University of Florida, has been studying. And the answer is: it’s complicated, he writes in an article for The Conversation. Sure, burying power lines underground keeps them safe from wind, but it can also increase the risk that storm surge and flooding could damage the wires. Plus, putting wires underground is expensive, and it can make it more difficult to get at the power lines for repairs. Power companies have to weigh the pros and cons of undergrounding versus more mainstream strategies like making sure a stiff wind won’t topple trees onto power lines. And as climate change increases hurricane intensity, the stakes for that calculation will continue to rise.","When Hurricane Michael crashed into the Florida Panhandle on October 10th, the storm cut power to parts of Florida and Georgia that were in its path, new NASA images show.

"JOHN SCHWARTZ, JAMES GLANZ and ANDREW W. LEHREN","Shifting Terrain As early as 2006, The Woodlands filed a plan for a new subdivision on thousands of acres containing “wooded areas and a few rural home sites,” according to documents obtained from Harris County. But it was not until the years leading up to 2011, when the Hughes Corporation put together the final pieces of its purchase of The Woodlands, that the housing market caught up with the plan. Houston shook off the wreckage of the subprime mortgage crisis and encountered a very different problem: a shortage of housing on the high end of the market. Touching off the surge in demand was an announcement by Exxon that it was opening a new corporate campus in nearby Spring. Exxon was far from alone, as a growing list of companies relocated to the area. So did tens of thousands of workers, drawn by the boom in fracking technologies that none other than Mr. Mitchell and colleagues had coaxed, tweaked and perfected over nearly 20 years. That influx would have all but saturated the existing home market, said Bill Gilmer, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston. It drove a spike in land prices, allowing developers to consider new construction on relatively low-cost lots that previously would have been too costly to improve. “This would just give you the opportunity to make those extensive improvements and still come out ahead,” Mr. Gilmer said. FEMA maps of The Woodlands showed a tantalizing stretch of undeveloped land hard by a waterway called Spring Creek — including acreage in the 2006 plan. Building right along the creek would have been out of the question, but farther south, portions of the land were slightly above the 100-year flood plain, according to the maps. Those who knew the land and its history saw warning signs. Nick Rife, whose family owned land in the area, said he used to hunt there “when it wasn’t flooded.” By bringing in thousands of dump truck loads of dirt, it would be possible to expand the acreage above the flood plain, making the whole area suitable for construction. That is exactly what The Woodlands decided to do, documents show. The former edges of the flood plain run through what are now the lots of Ms. Martinez and Mr. Hickey, the longtime Woodlands resident who once worked for Mr. Mitchell and had built a new home in the neighborhood. On the strip of land containing Wood Drake Place — Ms. Martinez’s street — 60,907 cubic yards of dirt were laid down. FEMA approved a map change for that area on Feb. 8, 2011, documents show. The large extrusion of development around Lake Reverie Place — Mr. Hickey’s street — and the nearby Sundown Ridge Place got 19,890 cubic yards of dirt. On June 13, 2013, FEMA approved a map change for what would become lots for the 81 homes in those areas. The result: neighborhoods that seemed safe from flooding. When Esteban and Paola Seañez moved into their home next to Spring Creek in 2015, their mortgage company assured them that the plot was high and dry. When the couple asked about flood insurance, “They said, ‘You don’t even have to purchase it,’” Ms. Seañez recalled. Photo The view outside Ms. Martinez’s second-floor window this week. Credit Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times Last year, after water came within several feet of their door, Mr. Hickey’s neighbors James and Gayle Soeder inquired about flood insurance. Initially, the agent warned that the policy would be very expensive; the house was in a flood plain, she said. Mr. Soeder, who knew he had bought a home at the 500-year elevation, asked her to check again. “We see that the flood plain was revised recently,” the agent said. So, for a bargain rate of $450 per year, the Soeders became one of the families in the neighborhood to be covered by insurance when Harvey struck. A number of residents asked whether managers of The Woodlands since Mr. Mitchell had been as careful as its predecessors in designing the newer developments, and pointed to what they called more aggressive policies since the Howard Hughes Corporation — a brand revived in 2010 by the activist investor Bill Ackman — took over. Mr. Hickey dug into damage statistics and found that his recently constructed neighborhood flooded at far higher rates than others in The Woodlands. In older parts of the community, his research revealed, about 215 out of 33,000 homes flooded during Harvey, or less than 1 percent — a far smaller percentage than many other communities in the greater Houston area. Yet among homes built in more recent years in Harris County, 331 out of 4,993 flooded, or more than 6 percent. In the newest areas of that Harris County expansion, including those where the Soeder, the Hickey and the Seañez families live, 331 out of 1,450 homes were affected — a whopping 23 percent. Mr. Hickey questioned whether adequate measures had been taken in the fill project to provide water storage and drainage in big storms. Marc Crudgington, who bought his home the year after Ms. Martinez and her husband did, voiced similar concerns. “They’ve filled in lakes that have been around forever just so they can build on them, and clear-cut trees like nobody’s business,” he said. “Our name for it is not The Woodlands, it’s Concrete Land.” The company stated that “the senior development team is ‘essentially the same team’ that has worked on The Woodlands for 25 years.” Tim Welbes, co-president of The Woodlands Development Company, said the company had complied with FEMA standards for its homes, but that the neighborhood had been overwhelmed by the storm’s waters. “We met the standard,” he said. “This event exceeded the standard.” Still, at a recent meeting of The Woodlands Storm Drainage Task Force, residents expressed anger at local officials over the damage to homes from Hurricane Harvey — and, for many of them, from earlier floods. This task force was actually formed last year in response to previous flooding, and little had been done to improve the situation before Harvey.

Anticipated to make landfall on Monday, Alberto is the first storm ahead of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, which formally starts on 1 June. It will bring heavy rain and winds of 100kmh (65mph) across southern states, the US National Hurricane Center said. It was centred about 185km (115 miles) south-west of Florida's Panama City, at 01:00 CET (6:00GMT). Alberto had picked up strength as it headed north through the Gulf of Mexico, bringing with it the warning of life-threatening inundation, said the Miami-based hurricane centre. It is forecast to drop as much as 30cm (12in) of rain across Mississippi to western Georgia and to bring storm swells of about 60-120cm (2-4ft) to low-lying areas. Alberto comes during the Memorial Day weekend, and is expected to affect travel on Monday, when many people will return from their holidays. It is the first named storm of the season, with 21 other names still to be used, including Beryl, Ernesto, Kirk, Nadine and Rafael. Last year, a number of deadly hurricanes hit the US and Caribbean.

Mark Kaufman,"At the end of May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its 2018 hurricane forecast, predicting a likely active or above active season in the Atlantic Ocean — though certainly not on par with 2017's exceptionally stormy season. But almost a month later, conditions in the Atlantic are showing signs that the 2018 season might be quieter than forecasters initially thought. SEE ALSO: Hurricanes are slowing down, and that's very bad news for everyone Specifically, surface water temperatures in the tropical Atlantic are unusually cold. When these waters are cooler, it tends to damper the formation of powerful storms, Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University, said in an interview. ""This is very unusual,"" said Klotzbach. Back in March, the cooler water temperatures were pretty similar to those a year earlier, in March 2017. But since then, tropical waters have simply failed to warm. Tropical Atlantic sea surface temps (SSTs) (10-20°N, 60-20°W) remain at record cold levels (since 1982) for mid-June. About 0.2°C colder than prior coldest (1985) and nearly 1.7°C cooler than last year at this time. Colder SSTs typically mean quieter Atlantic #hurricane seasons pic.twitter.com/dcexoXkUJn — Philip Klotzbach (@philklotzbach) June 15, 2018 ""The water went from normal to the coldest since 1982,"" said Klotzbach. ""It's the coldest water temperature at this time over the last 35 years."" This is all the more strange, he said, because globally oceans have warmed. Most of the world's accumulating heat, due to climate change, collects in Earth's absorbent waters. ""To me, it's just fascinating given how much warmer the globe is,"" said Klotzbach. Of course, this is not to say a powerful, potentially destructive storm won't arise and pummel the Caribbean or the coastal U.S. ""It’s not an inactive season when the wind blows 100 mph in your backyard,"" Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane researcher at Florida International University, said in an interview. ""It doesn’t mean you can’t have bad luck."" Hurricane forecasts are never set in stone In late May, just before the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season on June 1, NOAA predicted just a 25 percent chance of a ""below normal"" season. A calmer season may look more likely now, but forecasting the weather months in advance is always challenging, and comes with inherent uncertainties. ""The ocean is as unpredictable as the atmosphere but on a longer timescale,"" said Willoughby. NOAA's 2018 Atlantic hurricane forecast as of May 24, 2018. Image: noaa And NOAA took this into account, months ago. The agency noted that although the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean waters, known as the ""main hurricane development"" region, had ""anomalously cool"" waters at the time, there was still considerable uncertainty about what would happen during August and September, the peak of the hurricane season, Jerry Bell, the lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, explained over email. When temperatures in the tropical waters remain cooler and don't warm, a few things can suppress hurricane activity, said Klotzbach. For one, hurricanes ""live off warm ocean water,"" he said, so these storms have less fuel when ocean temperatures are colder. Second, colder sea surfaces generally mean more dense air over large swathes of the ocean — and with denser air comes more overall stability. Lastly, colder tropical waters often mean stronger trade winds blowing from the east that can ""tears apart hurricanes,"" said Klotzbach. Hurricanes Katia, Irma, and Jose in September 2017. Image: Noaa If these tropical waters don't warm up soon, conditions will be mostly locked in for a milder storm season. ""There's still some time for it to change,"" said Klotzbach. ""But usually when you get to July things are set."" ""If it's going to change, it's got to change soon,"" he added. Hurricane forecasts are still quite important, despite any inherent uncertainty. ""A forecast — if you have a realistic idea of its credibility — is better than no forecast,"" said Willoughby. These forecasts can help slow-moving ocean tugs decide if they should take other oceanic routes, for instance. But most of all, ""It's good for getting people started thinking about hurricanes,"" said Willoughby. NOAA measures sea surface temperatures in a variety of ways, including ocean gliders. Image: noaa Last season brought three major storms to the United States, causing $265 billion in damages. In addition to cooler tropical waters, NOAA has raised the possibility of a 2018 El Niño event in the Pacific, which often brings stronger opposing winds to the Atlantic. ""That's very well understood,"" said Willoughby. ""It kills hurricanes."" Both hurricane scientists and the public alike will see how things ultimately take shape this season — though many won't find a quieter season too disappointing. ""I have to admit that an inactive season wouldn’t break my heart,"" said Willoughby.","At the end of May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its 2018 hurricane forecast, predicting a likely active or above active season in the Atlantic Ocean — though certainly not on par with 2017's exceptionally stormy season. …",2018-06-21T14:26:18Z,"{'id': 'mashable', 'name': 'Mashable'}","This Atlantic hurricane season may be quieter than expected, and no one's complaining",https://mashable.com/2018/06/21/quiet-2018-atlantic-hurricane-season/,https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PsA7nA6J0cp_tVTXNoUrdiZTFbc=/1200x630/2018%2F06%2F21%2F2f%2Febf7e8d3ba3348abbf3870b11f968047.24991.jpg,mashable,Mashable,Hurricane,1

Rayne Ellis,"On Wednesday, Hurricane Florence became the first major hurricane of the 2018 season in the Atlantic Ocean. On Thursday, astronauts saw the ominous storm swirling from space. NASA astronaut Ricky Arnold captured images of Florence as it strengthened on Thursday from his post on the International Space Station. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Florence is our first major hurricane of the 2018 season in the Atlantic. Where will it go? ""#HurricaneFlorence strengthens in the early morning hours over the Atlantic,"" Arnold said on Twitter. In the photos, Florence seems massive, albeit somewhat disorganized since the hurricane's eye isn’t immediately noticeable and the storm has lost some of it's symmetry. The hurricane — now teetering between Category 2 and Category 3 status — gained some momentum in the Atlantic on Wednesday night, reaching wind speeds above 130 mph, making it a Category 4, if only for a few hours. As of right now, not much is known about what the hurricane is going to do next. Earlier today, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) released an update, suggesting that Florence has continued to weaken since it reached Category 4 status earlier this morning. NASA Image: nasa earth observatory According to this update, Hurricane Florence is now a Category 2, with wind speeds reaching 105 mph, which means it is no longer a major hurricane. This is likely due to wind shear, or strong opposing winds whipping over that portion of the Atlantic that can tear storms apart. However, meteorologists predict that this weakening is only momentary and believe that within the next 36 hours, Florence will regain intensity and again become a major hurricane.

Nick Stockton,"Two weeks after Hurricane Maria, Donald Trump flew to Puerto Rico, toured a relatively affluent neighborhood there, and expressed his relief that the storm had not been “a real catastrophe” like Hurricane Katrina. He jokingly chided Puerto Ricans for throwing the federal budget a “little out of whack.” In reality, Maria caused the largest blackout in US history, and the federal disaster response on the island was, at that point, a fraction of what residents of Florida and Texas had received during the same hurricane season. The government of Puerto Rico recently published a report estimating the storm's death toll at 1,427 people, more than 20 times the previous estimate. According to The New England Journal of Medicine, the storm and its aftermath ultimately killed more than 4,000. If the federal government’s response to Maria was a scandal, the tech industry’s initial reaction seemed, comparatively, like a source of hope. In the days after the disaster, a small groundswell of private tech enthusiasm furthered the notion that Puerto Rico ought to become a test bed for renewable, distributed, climate-­resilient infrastructure. Companies like Alphabet and Tesla, which were already working on the island, looked like they might be poised to make this idea a reality. Later, a different set of tech entrepreneurs descended on Puerto Rico as well, enticed by tax breaks to advance other, more esoteric techno-​utopian visions. Here’s a progress report on how tech has, and hasn’t, managed to come to Puerto Rico’s rescue. Alphabet For years, Alphabet’s X (formerly known as Google X) has been working on a project called Loon, which provides cell service to remote areas via giant balloons. And it just so happened that one of the company’s two launch facilities for those signal-­slinging balloons was located in Ceiba, on Puerto Rico’s eastern coast. So the company deployed a handful of the floating antennas, blanketing the island with text and data service for more than 250,000 customers of T-Mobile and AT&amp;T for four months while parts of the electrical grid were down. Tesla Two weeks after the storm, Elon Musk wrote on Twitter that Tesla had a track record of building decentralized electrical infrastructure—independent solar and battery systems—on small islands. “There is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too,” he said. Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo Rosselló, tweeted back: “Let’s talk.” Since then, updates have come mostly in the form of more tweets. In April, Musk reported that “Tesla batteries are currently live &amp; delivering power at 662 locations in Puerto Rico.” Then in June he tweeted, “We have about 11,000 projects underway” on the island. Tesla has declined to clarify what that means or how many Puerto Ricans are served by those projects. The Blockchain Crowd Over the past year, about 150 cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have settled on the island, according to Giovanni Mendez, a tax lawyer who has helped many of them. They’ve been drawn in part by incentives, passed in 2012, that give tax exemptions for capital gains and passive income to individuals who spend at least half their year on the island, and by an amendment, passed just months before Hurricane Maria, that eased requirements on US companies to hire Puerto Rican residents. One of the new arrivals was the cryptocurrency guru and former child actor Brock Pierce, who promptly said he was setting out to build a utopian community—perhaps even a whole new city—on the island, to the ire of many Puerto Ricans.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Customers at a hardware store in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, which may be in the path US President Donald Trump has issued a series of warnings to prepare for Hurricane Florence, which is gathering power as it approaches the Carolinas. Mr Trump tweeted that this was ""one of the worst storms to hit the East Coast in many years"". Florence is at present a Category Four storm, with sustained winds of about 140mph (220km/h). On its current track it is predicted to make landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, late on Thursday. A number of mandatory evacuations have been ordered in South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia, affecting more than a million people. South Carolina's Governor Henry McMaster has given the entire coastline until noon on Tuesday to leave. The University of North Carolina at Wilmington has also ordered a mandatory evacuation of students. In its latest advisory at 23:00 eastern time (0300 GMT). the National Hurricane Center said of Florence: ""Some strengthening is expected during the next 36 hours, and Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday."" It said hurricane-force winds would ""extend outward up to 40 miles (65km) from the centre and tropical-storm-force winds [would] extend outward up to 150 miles (240km)"". The 23:00 report placed Florence about 465 miles south-east of Bermuda, moving west-north-west at about 13mph. This would see it pass between Bermuda and the Bahamas on Tuesday and Wednesday and make landfall on the North Carolina coast at about 22:00 local time on Thursday. The chief meteorologist for WCBD-TV in South Carolina, Rob Fowler, told the BBC that Florence was a large storm and getting bigger, and those even 100 miles away would feel the impact. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boarding up under way in Holden Beach, North Carolina He said the predicted heavy rain and storm surges could threaten areas such as Charleston, which is only a few metres above sea level, and that Florence could rival the impact of Hurricane Hugo, which wreaked $7bn (£5.3bn) in damage and claimed 49 lives in 1989. Schools in affected areas will begin to close on Tuesday and lanes on some highways will be reversed to aid evacuations. Media caption Will hurricanes like those in 2017 wreak havoc yet again? ""We are not going to gamble with the lives of the people of South Carolina,"" Mr McMaster said. The office of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam predicted ""catastrophic inland flooding, high winds and possible widespread power outages"". Rainfall could be up to 20in (50cm) in some areas. This could worsen if, as some meteorologists predict, Florence stalls after it makes landfall. Image copyright Reuters Image caption South Carolina airmen are deployed for the expected rescue efforts National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham told the Associated Press news agency: ""It's not just the coast. When you stall a system like this and it moves real slow, some of that rainfall can extend well away from the centre."" A similar event caused devastation in Texas last year when Hurricane Harvey hit. 'We were nonstop' President Trump has signed approvals for the declarations of emergency in the Carolinas and said he had spoken to the governors of the affected states. He sent out five tweets over four hours warning people to heed advice and stay safe: The US Navy is sending 30 ships stationed in Virginia out to sea. Residents of affected areas have been flocking to stores to stock up on essentials. Hardware store manager John Johnson told Agence France-Presse news agency there had been a rush on batteries, flashlights, plastic tarpaulins and sandbags at his Charleston shop. ""From eight o'clock 'til two we were slammed. We were nonstop,"" he said. Image copyright EPA Image caption The Navy is preparing to send 30 vessels out to sea Resident Deborah LaRoche told the agency: ""It doesn't matter what happened in [previous] storms. This one is different."" Some petrol stations were running dry as customers filled up. Curtis Oil, a fuel distributor in Chesterfield, South Carolina, said it had been ""overwhelmed with requests by state agencies and everybody else"". Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged. Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h Houses suffer damage, severe flooding Storm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h Some roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses. Storm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+ Serious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland.

NICHOLAS KRISTOF,"Prof. Michael E. Mann of Penn State told me that Hurricane Michael should be a wake-up call. As should have Katrina, Irene, Sandy, Harvey, Irma, Florence, he added wryly. In each of these storms we can see the impact of climate change: Warmer seas means more energy to intensify these storms, more wind damage, bigger storm surge and more coastal flooding. As recently as the early 2000s, there wasnt much difference between the parties on climate policy, and Senator John McCain campaigned in 2008 as a leader in reducing carbon emissions. In 2009, Donald Trump joined other business executives in backing more action to address climate change. Yet in the following years Al Gore helped make climate change a Democratic issue, and the Koch brothers helped make climate denial a litmus test of Republican authenticity. Tribalism took over, and climate skepticism became part of the Republican creed. So polls show that today climate denial is far greater in the United States, home to the greatest scientific research in the world, than in just about any other major country. Trump says he will pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord, and he had nothing substantive to say about a new United Nations report, which has been called a deafening, piercing smoke alarm of catastrophic consequences ahead from climate change. Republicans are correct that all this is uncertain. But in every other context, we try to prevent threats that are uncertain, and its irrational for Trump to be obsessed with, say, Iran, when he seems indifferent to the prospect that we are collectively cooking our entire planet. There are legitimate debates about the best way to reduce carbon emissions, and there is reason for skepticism that we will succeed. Carbon taxes would have to be very substantial to have a large impact, geoengineering is uncertain, and there will be painful trade-offs ahead.","Hurricane Michael hit Port St. Joe, Fla., with full force on Wednesday.",2018-10-10T23:24:05Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",The ‘Greatest Hoax’ Strikes Florida,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/opinion/climate-change-hurricane-michael.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/opinion/10kristofSub/10kristofSub-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane,1
GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO,"Jimmy Fallon taped Tuesdays Tonight Show in Puerto Rico, and things got going with a bang. During the opening sequence, Fallon joined Lin-Manuel Miranda and the cast of Hamilton in the theater in San Juan where theyre currently performing the musical. Then, along with Questlove and Black Thought of the Roots, he wandered into downtown San Juan, where he met up with the singer Bad Bunny. An impromptu dance party started.
Later in the show, Fallon interviewed Miranda about his decision to bring Hamilton to Puerto Rico, where the playwright and actors father is from. Miranda talked about the resonances between the subject matter in Hamilton and the experiences of Puerto Ricans.
Theres a song in this show called Hurricane, and I could barely get through it last night, because it is about that, he said. What I remember from Hurricane Maria so vividly was the quiet was, like, literally not being able to hear from the island in that sort of immediate aftermath.

"Tom McKay on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Hurricane Florence, which was briefly downgraded to a tropical storm last week, was re-upgraded to hurricane status on Sunday and looks like it is destined to barrel straight at the U.S.’ East Coast. According to CNN, odds are good that it will have strengthened to Category 4 status—meaning sustained winds in the range of 130-156 miles per hour—before the time it makes landfall later this week, likely on Thursday or Friday. CNN wrote: “Maximum sustained winds are now 75 mph, and further strengthening is forecast over the coming days,” said CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen. “Florence continues on a track to impact the US mainland by Thursday or Friday.” The hurricane center said, “All indications are that Florence will be an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane while it moves over the western Atlantic toward the southeastern United States.” Florence was some 1,500 miles away from the East Coast and moving west at roughly six miles per hour on Sunday morning, according to CNN. It’s projected to pass between the Bahamas and Bermuda on its way to land. According to CNN, weather experts say the storm is most likely to hit in the Carolinas. However, the Washington Post noted that the hurricane’s exact placement is “within a large cone of uncertainty” and residents anywhere “Florida to southern New England” should be aware of the storm’s progression. The Post’s weather team noted that Florence will pass over oceans that are warmer than normal, which will provide fuel and “favors at least a Category 3 hurricane landfall on the Southeast coast by week’s end” (emphasis theirs). It’s possible it could become a Category 5 storm. The National Hurricane Center warned on Twitter that there may be a high risk of “storm surge at the coast and freshwater flooding from a prolonged heavy rainfall event inland.” Accuweather added that storm swells are expected to stretch for hundreds of miles around Florence and impact, and there’s a possibility that the storm could stall right as hits land, resulting in sustained battering of the coast and flooding. The Post wrote: In these coastal areas, heavy surf and elevated water levels arrive by Wednesday morning, and rainfall could begin by Thursday morning. Tropical-storm-force winds could reach the coastline as early as Wednesday night, at which point all outdoor preparations should be completed. Extremely dangerous hurricane-force winds could batter coastal locations Thursday into Friday. Hurricane to tropical-storm-force winds could extend inland depending on the storm’s exact track. Two tropical storms are following behind it: Isaac and Helene. Helene is expected to veer north well before coming close to the coast, though Isaac is expected to turn into a hurricane as it continues heading west towards the Windward Islands, the Miami Herald wrote. In preparation for the storm, the governments of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia have all declared states of emergency and are mobilizing resources. As Axios noted, many areas in the path of the storm have not seen hurricanes of this strength for decades—like Charleston, South Carolina, where the last Category 4 storm was Hugo in 1989. Thanks to rising ocean waters from climate change, the area is already prone to the phenomenon of “sunny day flooding” in good conditions. As Earther noted on Friday, this course is unprecedented. Almost all of the 57 named storms that have passed within 200 miles of Florence’s position at that time have curved out to sea, other than a handful which slammed into the Dominican Republic.

Mark Kaufman,"The Puerto Rican government has a list of 64 dead from Hurricane Maria, the tropical cyclone that hit the island in September 2017. This number, however, is ""highly uncertain"" notes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A new study published Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine puts that number at an estimated 4,645 — 70 times higher than the official estimate. ""Our results indicate that the official death count of 64 is a substantial underestimate of the true burden of mortality after Hurricane Maria,"" write the authors, led by researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. SEE ALSO: Puerto Ricans never know if they'll have power. This is how they're surviving. NOAA says that the storm, which caused some $90 billion in damage, is the third costliest in U.S. history. But it's the deadliest in over a century, since a hurricane pummeled Galveston, Texas, in 1900, killing more than 6,000 people. Back then, both NOAA and the National Hurricane Center didn't exist, so people were largely unaware of the power brought by the coming cyclone. Puerto Rico knew what was coming, but the hurricane's wind and downpours ravaged the island's water system and electrical grid. The storm blew down more than 80 percent of the island's utility poles and transmission lines. ""Practically all cell phone service was lost and municipal water supplies were knocked out,"" said NOAA. While some fatalities were caused by drownings and people being carried away in unprecedented floodwaters, the researchers show that thousands more succumbed during the period between September 20 through December 31, 2017. Around a third of those died due to ""delayed or interrupted health care."" In the U.S., official deaths are documented by medical examiners, and in Puerto Rico, specifically, disaster-caused deaths are confirmed by the Institute of Forensic Sciences. This has proven difficult in Puerto Rico, the authors said, because the process often involves taking a dead body to be inspected in the capital. And the storm killed many people indirectly, such as from a lack of medical treatment for chronic disease. It can be challenging for medical examiners to identify such deaths as being cyclone-caused. NOAA satellite GOES-16 captures an image of Hurricane Maria hitting Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017. Image: cira/noaa For this reason, the researchers relied upon a survey of 3,299 randomly chosen homes all over Puerto Rico, asking residents about the causes of death and other factors, like whether or not they were forced to leave their houses. Only 7 percent of households involved did not complete the survey. Once the surveys were reviewed, the researchers compared the rate of deaths that occurred between September 20 and December 31 in 2016 and 2017, finding that there were more than 4,500 ""excess deaths"" in 2017 — i.e., deaths that would not have occurred without the devastating impacts of Hurricane Maria. ""These numbers will serve as an important independent comparison to official statistics from death-registry data, which are currently being reevaluated, and underscore the inattention of the U.S. government to the frail infrastructure of Puerto Rico,"" write the authors. If the official government report approximates this latest estimate by researchers outside the government, it may persuade current and future U.S. lawmakers to address the aftermath of a tropical cyclone more promptly, and with a heightened awareness of the necessary resources. NOAA forecasts the coming 2018 Atlantic hurricane season to be ""active,"" with between five and nine hurricane-level storms.","The Puerto Rican government has a list of 64 dead from Hurricane Maria, the tropical cyclone that hit the island in September 2017.

Rayne Ellis,"The Hawaiian islands are battening down the hatches as they prepare for Hurricane Lane, a powerful, Category 4 storm barreling toward the state at 155 mph. And now, photos taken from space show the extreme power of that storm as it makes its way toward possible landfall. SEE ALSO: Powerful hurricanes usually steer clear of Hawaii, but Hurricane Lane is coming NASA astronaut Ricky Arnold highlighted Hurricane Lane's size with photos tweeted from his post on the International Space Station.

In the images from space you can see the hurricane's cotton-like tendrils sprawl from the center in a way that looks peaceful — but don't be fooled. The clouds are whipping up dangerous amounts of rain and wind. The hurricane also seems to cover the horizon as seen from the station's windows. Even the video from space station is deceivingly calm. Hawaii's governor David Ige has been constantly updating his constituents via social media with new reports from the weather organizations keeping tabs on Hurricane Lane's path. ""Hawaii is in danger of being significantly impacted by Hurricane Lane, whether or not the hurricane directly hits the state,"" Ige said in a statement on Facebook.

"Michelle Woo on Offspring, shared by Michelle Woo to Lifehacker","Flying almost always comes with some anxiety, but for parents traveling with kids with special needs such as autism, the mere thought of navigating the sensory hurricane that is a busy airport can be terrifying. The crowds, the lines, the announcements piping through the loud speakers, the orders to remove your shoes, the spontaneous pat-downs—it’s often too much. But one mom shared a tip on social media that could save families a ton of stress: Before your trip, call TSA Cares (855-787-2227) to arrange for a passenger support specialist to escort you through security. Angie Solis wrote an eloquent letter to the Transportation Security Administration, thanking them for the smooth experience she had traveling with her autistic son. In an Instagram post, which was shared by TSA, Solis describes how she had found herself in “a worried frenzy” looking at the hundreds of people waiting to pass the security checkpoint—when her passenger support specialist Alicia appeared. “With her super powers, [Alicia] lifted a divider, motioned us through, and escorted us to the front of the line,” Solis writes. “We went through a gentle security check where no one put their hands on us or even said much. We didn’t even have to remove our shoes.” The total time from the moment they walked into the airpot to the moment they were seated at the gate: fourteen minutes. The TSA Cares helpline was launched in 2011, but travelers may not know it exists. Passengers with disabilities, medical conditions and special needs can request a passenger support specialist, who’ll help you right there on the spot. Just call the helpline three days before your flight. As Solis notes in her letter, you will not be exempt from security—her son still passed through a scanner and all of their bags were screened. She believes the service simply recognizes that “some people just process differently and need extra TLC.” Here are some other tips for flying with an autistic child: Prepare your kid. Shannon Airport has some step-by-step videos to show travelers what’s to come, from arriving at the airport to landing. Do a practice run. The Arc’s Wings for Autism program allows autistic passengers to do a “rehearsal” at the airport before their flight. Request priority boarding. When you make your reservation, let the airline know you’d like priority seating, and inform the gate personnel of your request when you arrive. Print and fill out a TSA Disability Notification Card. It lets TSA agents know your specific needs. Bring comforting items. For instance, if your child is sensitive to loud sounds, make sure to pack noise-cancelling headphones.","Flying almost always comes with some anxiety, but for parents traveling with kids with special needs such as autism, the mere thought of navigating the sensory hurricane that is a busy airport can be terrifying.

MATT STEVENS,"Forecasters said they expect the Florida Panhandle as well as parts of eastern and central Alabama and western Georgia to get between four and eight inches of rain through Tuesday, with some isolated areas getting as much as a foot; they warned that flash flooding was possible in Florida, much of Alabama, and western Georgia. Storm surge in Florida could cause water to rise as high as three feet from the Aucilla River to Mexico Beach, they said. Isolated tornadoes were also possible over parts of Georgia and southeast Alabama. After the exceptionally destructive season last year, forecasters said last week that the possibility of a weak El Niño, along with near-average sea surface temperatures, suggest that this year’s hurricane season will be normal or only slightly more active than average. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s forecasters predicted a 70 percent likelihood of 10 to 16 named storms this year with winds of 39 miles per hour or higher. Hurricane season runs from June 1 until Nov. 1 and peaks from mid-August through late October. Last year, there were 17 named storms, 10 of which became hurricanes ; the first named storm was Arlene — a rare preseason tropical storm that arrived in April. “We’re not expecting the season to be one of the most active on record,” said Gerry Bell, lead hurricane season forecaster with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center.

Devin Coldewey,"One would think that the classification of internet providers as telecoms or not, and which federal agency has authority over them, is about as in the weeds as it gets. But it is a symptom of the times in which we live that no issue, however technical, provincial, or jurisdictional, can escape being swept up in the eternal hurricane of partisan politics. The FCC’s masterstroke in 2015, the lead-up to which formed the first article in this series, made a lot of people very angry. It angered the broadband industry, as you might expect, for several reasons. For one thing, decades of legal maneuvering to keep regulations light (or failing that, to switch regulators) were being nullified. This was a worst case scenario: not only were they being classified as telecoms, with all the headaches that brought, but the agency writing the rules was not naive or sympathetic and, in fact, was rather tired of being pushed around. The actual rules being proposed also preemptively banned a number of practices and business models — paid prioritization, zero rating, etc — that might otherwise have proven profitable. It angered the Federal Trade Commission because broadband providers had for a long time largely been considered theirs to regulate. With this responsibility came authority, power, and a sort of obscure glory — all of which now belonged to the FCC. What’s more, the FTC resented the implication of the takeover that internet providers had been inadequately regulated. “So the FCC thinks we don’t know how to do our job, huh?” (It wasn’t that, but that the job needing doing has changed.) And it angered conservative lawmakers throughout the U.S., for reasons both justified and dubious. They were bothered by what they perceived as, and justifiably so, an expansion of regulatory reach — in other words, bigger government encroaching on a market that was thriving without its interference. Somewhat less justified but still understandable, the GOP was frustrated that they had been outfoxed by the Obama administration, the hand of which was recognizable throughout this whole initiative. Lastly, and most dubiously, Republican members of Congress, more so than Democrats, count on the generous donations of the telecoms and cable industries to fund their reelection campaigns, and, well, promises were probably made. (On this last point, I want to make something clear, lest I myself be accused of partisanship in my representation of this issue. I’m under no illusion that Democrats in Congress do not have similar obligations to lobbyists and industries who fund their operations. But they are usually different industries. In fact, it is worth noting that many Democrats who supported net neutrality and the Open Internet Order receive large sums of money from edge providers like Google and Facebook, which hold similar views and similarly weighty coffers. In the case of net neutrality many Republicans find themselves, in this sense, at least, allied to the opposition and ultimately the wrong side of history. The problem of corporate lobbying applies to both sides of the aisle, but on this particular issue this is how the political divide falls, and how we must address it.) These are powerful enemies, and what’s more, ones that have every incentive to work together against their common foe. But before we see how they responded, let’s have a quick recap of what the Open Internet Order actually does, and the authority under which the FCC did it. Title bout In part one, we saw how as early as 1966 the FCC and FTC were drawing a hazy line between two types of services: telecommunications services, which are responsible for merely moving information to and from locations chosen by users, and information services, which involve creating, storing, and performing other non-transportation tasks on that information. The FCC has authority over the former, and over the latter we have the FTC. The 1996 Telecommunications Act delineated these definitions, and enumerated the services and their regulators under a set of Titles, which is the legal name for those portions of the law. I tried to avoid these terms in part one, but here they become more relevant. There are seven titles, but only two we really need to worry about: Telecommunications services fall under under Title II of the act and are also called “common carriers.” This term was used for much of the country’s history to indicate someone offering a service to move goods from point to point, but lately (that is, starting in the mid-20th century) also applied to things like telephone operators — which makes sense if you think about it. Common carriers are subject to special regulations that harmonize interstate commerce, prevent discrimination and anticompetitive practices, that sort of thing. The FCC is given the power to regulate Title II services, and the FTC is actually specifically prohibited from doing so. Information services, much more loosely defined, fall under Title I of the act. The FTC is charged with making sure these services meet minimums of safety, privacy, reporting, and other business standards. Sometimes a Title I service will get poked by the FCC, if, say, it were a device maker (obviously not telecoms) that wasn’t meeting radiation emissions standards, but generally speaking, Title I is FTC territory and the FCC’s powers under it are limited. So if AT&amp;T was failing to meet national standards in rolling out telephone service, the FCC would come calling. On the other hand, if the company were misrepresenting that service to its customers, it’s the FTC’s job. For a long time, the FCC tried to make net neutrality and other open internet rules happen with that limited authority it exerted over them under Title I. And it took these approaches, which were rejected again and again, in order to avoid having to rock the boat and reclassify broadband providers as Title II telecommunications services. But in 2015 it saw no other option, and did just that. Cheat sheet for the 2015 Open Internet Order You are forgiven if you have not read the actual order. It’s 400 pages long, after all, and you can’t skip the footnotes. But a large amount of those pages are dedicated not to detailing the rules themselves, but to justifying the authority the FCC was exerting. The actual rules are remarkably compact and, most seem to agree, quite reasonable. They can be summarized thus: No blocking of any lawful content, applications, services, or devices. No throttling, impairment, or degradation of lawful, non-harmful content, applications, etc. No paid prioritization, or favoring some traffic over other traffic, at least not for “consideration” (money or favors) or to benefit an affiliated entity. (The no “fast lanes” rule; exceptions are allowed for “reasonable network management”) No unreasonable interference with or disadvantaging of end users or edge providers. (The “general conduct” rule). Public disclosure of commercial terms, fees, data caps, performance, network management practices, etc. That’s really it! Most of the rest of the order is justifying Title II authority, “forbearing” from using many parts of that part of the law (i.e. it technically could do direct rate regulation, but promises not to), and defining the terms in the above rules — what exactly is meant by “content” or “harmful,” for instance. Wolves at the door (with lawsuits) So, back to the story. What’s the first thing you do in America when things don’t go your way? That’s right, you sue. Which is exactly what happened. And while we don’t need to get into the details here, suits from telecoms and trade associations aiming to prevent the rules from taking effect fell flat and everything, amazingly, went more or less as the FCC planned. One challenge had a higher profile than the others, going to the federal level at the DC Circuit Court. There it was delivered a sound drubbing: the judges basically handed the industry’s arguments back to them, saying “nice try.” Petitioners and their amici offer various grounds for distinguishing broadband service from other kinds of common carriage, none of which we find persuasive. This decision, which strongly supported the FCC’s authority and decision to use Title II, was a powerful deterrent; litigants were forced to acknowledge that more decisions like this would only further cement the Open Internet Order’s legitimacy and pile up hostile precedents. However, a substantial dissent by one judge pointed out that many of the FCC’s justifications for its rules, such as that banning paid prioritization would encourage that “virtuous cycle” the agency is so fond of mentioning, had no factual justification. This is important because no matter how much sense something makes to us as consumers — no fast lanes, no content throttling — that doesn’t mean it holds water in court. The judge went through the FCC’s arguments and issued the opinion that the Order’s rules were, in fact, “arbitrary and capricious.” It may not sound like it, but this is about the strongest argument against the net neutrality rules that has been advanced. Certainly stronger than some that came later — on the same suit, in fact. It turns out the safest move on the part of the petitioner (the United States Telecom Association) was to request the case be revisited because not all the judges weighed in the first time around. If they got a new hearing, it was like a free do-over; if they didn’t, the worst the court would do is reject them again. Unfortunately for them, not only was the request denied, but some particularly absurd dissents from Judges Brown and Kavanaugh allowed the court to give the ruling a fresh coat of paint and further discredit the arguments against Title II. Kavanaugh argued that net neutrality infringed on the free speech rights… of internet providers. He attempted to equate cable TV operators with ISPs, saying both “decide what content they will transmit.” This risible misconstrual of the facts went poorly for him, as you might expect, and the other judges explained at length the difference between providing a television channel and providing internet access. It offered them an opportunity to explain also why ISPs are compelled in many ways to act as non-discriminatory transmitters of information, not arbiters of that information — in other words, common carriers. Brown’s similarly disastrous attempt to show how broadband internet fits the 1996 Telecommunications Act’s definition of “information service” is not merely wrong, but demonstrates the exact opposite of what she wanted it to. It’s worth quoting here for reasons we’ll come to later: Unsurprisingly, the Act’s definition of “information service” fits broadband Internet access like a glove. “[G]enerating, acquiring, storing,” or “making available information via telecommunications” is what users do on social media websites like Facebook. See id. § 153(24). “[T]ransforming” or “utilizing” “information via telecommunications” is what users do on YouTube. See id. “[A]cquiring, storing,” and “retrieving… information via telecommunications” is what users do with email. See id. The “offering of a capability” for engaging in all of these activities is exactly what is provided by broadband Internet access. Of course, internet providers aren’t actually the ones that do those things; the companies she listed, known as edge providers, do, and are rightly classed under Title I as information services. ISPs don’t generate, store, or transform information but simply transmit it, and rarely claim otherwise. (Do these arguments sound familiar? That’s because they are the exact same wrong arguments made in the order that would eliminate net neutrality.) Legislation fared no better. Under the threat of an Obama veto there was only so much the Republican-held Congress could do. One bill attempted to retroactively remove the FCC’s ability to reclassify broadband; it never had legs. Another gained some momentum by attempting to ban broadband rate regulation by the FCC, which would have been fine, had it not also sneakily defined rate regulation so broadly that it would have seriously undermined the agency’s authority. Congress settled for a punitive slashing of the FCC’s budget, which didn’t do much to change the new rules. Opposition to the FCC was galvanized and unified, but it was clear that the agency had fortified its position well and attacks from the outside were ineffective. What its opponents needed was someone on the inside. Fortunately there was a good chance of that happening in just a few short months. Inside man The election itself thankfully doesn’t concern us much, since tech and internet regulation were hardly addressed at all in debates and speeches, but the results — naturally — would have major consequences. Under a Democratic president, the FCC would continue much as it had done for years, with a Democratic majority hard at work refining and bolstering net neutrality. Under a Republican one, leadership would switch and the new FCC would unite the interests of the desperate broadband industry, the slighted FTC, and the vengeful conservative Legislative branch. The latter, of course, is what came to pass. All the parties concerned needed now was someone sympathetic on the Commission itself. Enter Ajit Pai. Actually, it’s misleading to say he “enters” now, since he’d been on the Commission for years. But this is certainly the moment he stepped into the spotlight. For the purposes of his backers, his qualities are clear. He’s young, ambitious, savvy, and best of all, he had dissented vehemently and at length when the Open Internet Order was passed. Pai also had (and has) the admirable habit of infusing his objections with partisan bitterness: his dissenting statements and op-eds over the years embody the kind of values-based politics that propelled groups like the Tea Party to prominence. Perhaps Pai scented blood in the water and the potential of being elevated to Chairman if he made himself visible, or perhaps he was just infected with the usual red vs. blue mentality to which we all succumb during election seasons. At any rate he made it abundantly clear what side he was on, and the bet paid off. He was appointed Chairman in January. The FCC, aided by the FTC and Congress, now began in earnest its campaign to undo the work of the previous administration. This is the second article in a series on the history of the FCC and net neutrality. Keep an eye out for the third, a timeline of the FCC’s actions since the election.","One would think that the classification of internet providers as telecoms or not, and which federal agency has authority over them, is about as in the weeds as it gets.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","The countrys midsection is about to be hit by a rare, potentially record setting bomb cyclone that will bring everything from rain to snow to hurricane-force winds and could leave severe flooding in its wake from Texas to Minnesota. So if you live in that area, listen up!
The mayhem is already beginning as moisture streams from the Pacific into the Southwest, where winter storm warnings are in effect as of Tuesday afternoon. Up to two feet of snow could fall in New Mexicos Sangre de Cristo Mountains, accompanied by winds whipping across ridge tops at speeds of up to 75 mph, according to the National Weather Service. That alone would be pretty wild, but its only a precursor to Wednesdays weather mayhem.
As the storm pushes inland, its pressurewhich drops as storms get strongeris expected to dip into the range of 970 millibars. Thats roughly on par with an average Category 2 Atlantic hurricane and could challenge the all-time low pressure record for Kansas. The drop will be driven by the storms winds as they wrap around its core in a counter clockwise direction, bringing moist, warm air from the Gulf of Mexico in contact with cold air from the Upper Midwest and Canada. The movement of the winds is called cyclonic, and pressure is expected to drop more than 24 millibars in 24 hours, which means this storm is shaping up to fulfill the criteria for a rare inland bomb cyclone. It could even take on a hurricane-like appearance.
The fascinating thing about this storm is how quickly it will intensify and the possible record-low pressures it will produce in the Plains, Jason Furtado, a meteorology professor at the University of Oklahoma, told Earther. Another neat thing is that some models are indicating that this storm will strengthen so quickly, it could develop an eye-like feature in the center of the storm. This is a very rare for non-tropical systems and even more so for storms in the central U.S. (Its also rare for noreasters, which tend to be more comma-shaped.)
Weather geekery aside, the storm is going to make a mess of things. The area facing wind gusts up to 60 mphthe equivalent of a mature tropical stormstretches for more than 1,000 miles from Sturgis, South Dakota to the Texas-Mexico border. For comparison, the reach of Sandys tropical storm-force winds was 1,150 miles from edge to edge, although even thats not a perfect comparison, since tropical storm winds start at 39 mph.
So about those winds. The most intense blasts could rip up to 75 mph in the Rockies and Southern Plains. The rotation of the storm will also create what Furtado called a moisture pipeline straight out of the Gulf of Mexico. That means not only will it be windy, but also snowy. The National Weather Service is forecasting up to a foot or more of snow from Colorado to the Dakotas. Blizzard warnings are also in effect for large part of the region, and they could expand as the storm begins its onslaught.
Even after the storm clears out on Wednesday night, its impacts could linger. Aside from the heavy, blowing snow, areas on the Southern Plains could see wind-driven rain that could melt out what snowpack there is, aided by a blast of warm air on Thursday. Ed Vallee, the founder of Empire Weather, told Earther that flooding and melting snowpack is another unique impact could happen after the storm blows out into the Atlantic.","The country’s midsection is about to be hit by a rare, potentially record setting bomb cyclone that will bring everything from rain to snow to hurricane-force winds and could leave severe flooding in its wake from Texas to Minnesota.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","When it comes to geoengineering the planet to cool the climate, theres rightfully a lot of hesitation. Blocking incoming sunlight might seem like a quick fix to rising temperatures, but doing so could quickly tie up humanity in a decades-long project with alarming side effects like shifting precipitation patterns and changes in hurricane season.
Which is what makes a new paper released on Monday in Nature Climate Change so alluring. It shows that undertaking half measures to block the sun could end up providing the benefit of a cooler planet without many of the adverse impacts on other parts of the climate system. The results suggest there could be a role for geoengineering to play in saving us from a climate catastrophe, though its hardly the last word on what that role could be, or even if its worth the risk. And there are a few important caveats showing that theres still a lot of research needed on the topic.
Most research on geoengineering has focused on how humans could offset all the global warming associated with greenhouse gas pollution. The new study takes a different path, though. Using high resolution climate models, researchers first doubled the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They then used the models to reduce incoming sunlight enough to offset half of the warming associate with the rise in carbon pollution. Basically its like two steps forward, one step back.
They then looked at geoengineerings impact not just on temperature but precipitation, evaporation, and tropical cyclones. Precipitation and evaporation are crucial components of the hydrological cycle that humanity relies on for drinking water, agriculture, and more while cyclones can cause massive amounts of damage and suffering. Climate change is already causing more heavy downpours and could be playing a role in increasing hurricane intensity (and is likely to keep doing so in the future).
The new findings show, though, that using a geoengineering half measure could reduce temperature and moderate the adverse impacts on the hydrological cycle associated with both climate change and full-on geoengineering. According to the study, tropical cyclone intensity would be reduced as well.
Surprisingly we find only a very small fraction of places see the effects of climate change exacerbated, Peter Irvine, a postdoctoral researcher who led the new study, told Earther. If you kept cooling, youd keep getting benefits of temperature but diminishing returns on hydrological variables. Offsetting all warming, and youre beginning to introduce problems that are new.
Indeed, some previous research that maxes out geoengineering indicates that the hydrological cycles would slow down, causing drought in a number of locations around the world like the Sahel region of Africa. The uneven nature of these adverse impacts has led to calls for the global south to be more involved in any decision making around it. The new findings dont necessarily change the need for inclusive governance, but they do show one way geoengineering could be a potential tool in the fight against climate change.
That said, the findings come with some caveats. For one, no single study is a cause for action, especially when it comes to something as dramatic as intentionally altering the climate. The methods used to analyze the efficacy of halving global warming also might not paint a full picture of the impacts.
[T]he study would have been more policy-relevant if it concentrated on a realistic (transient) global warming scenario and represented solar geoengineering using stratospheric aerosols, Anthony Jones, an aerosols research who published a recent paper on geoengineering and hurricanes, told Earther.
Jones said that rather than looking at an abrupt doubling of carbon dioxide, using a scenario where pollution changes over the course of a century would yield more decision-oriented results. Ditto for replicating a specific solar geoengineering technique like injecting aerosols into the atmosphere (which can cause the stratosphere to warm and have other unintended consequences) rather than just turning down the incoming sunlight. Nevertheless, he said the results strengthen the notion that a moderate solar geoengineering application would be highly effective at ameliorating most regional climate changes caused by global warming.
That doesnt mean sun-dimming will be coming to a stratospheric location near you anytime soon. And it doesnt offer a substitute for what really needs to be done to address climate change. Irvine was blunt in his assessment that its only one piece of the puzzle, and a speculative one at that.
This cant solve climate change, Irvine said. Nothing about this gets rid of the fact that to stop the climate from changing, you need to reduce emissions to zero.","When it comes to geoengineering the planet to cool the climate, there’s rightfully a lot of hesitation.

In fact, roughly a third of Americans who understand that climate change is real and driven by human activities agree with the idea that climate deniers get what they deserve when disasters strike their communities, according to the new research, which hasnt yet been peer-reviewed.
 We were not too surprised though we are a bit disappointed, Matthew Motta, a postdoctoral researcher studying science communication at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author on the study, told Earther.
Motta and his colleagues from Washington University in St. Louis and Emory University used an online survey tool to poll 4,056 individuals. Respondents were first asked to identify their political leanings on a 7-point scale. The poll then asked whether they think climate change is real and human-driven. Those who answered yes were asked whether they agree with the sentiment that people who dont believe in climate change get what they deserve when natural disasters strike.
Of the 54 percent of respondents who were on board with the scientific consensusa fraction that tracks other national surveys but is a bit lower than one published last weekthe authors found that more than a third think climate deniers are getting their due when a hurricane flattens their town or a wildfire engulfs their city. Nearly 70 percent of these victim-blamers identified as Democrats, with more ideologically liberal respondents tending to dish the blame more. 
 While previous research has shown that people who hold strongly partisan views tend to dislike the other side more, this finding takes things a disturbing step further. As the authors put it, a substantial number of Americans are wishing, or at least accepting, physical harm as a sort of political retribution. And lest any right-of-center readers see this as vindication that the libs are a bunch of assholes, Motta pointed out that this sort of victim blaming likely isnt limited to Democrats. 
I think it would go the other way as well, he told Earther, citing violent crime as a potential issue that might engender ill will from conservatives if, for instance, the victim was opposed to carrying weapons. Thats a hypothesis he and his colleagues are planning to explore in future work, but one need look no further than Trumps awful tweets on Californias wildfires for evidence that partisan victim blaming is bi-directional.
While the findings should be taken with a grain of salt until the study is published in a peer-reviewed journal, if the truth is anywhere close to these survey results, its bad news. Not only is it deeply shitty to spit on others suffering, blaming people for their misery is, in Mottas extremely evenhanded assessment, not a solid science communication strategy. Communications experts often cite discussing shared values and common ground as effective strategies when talking about climate change with a skeptical audience. Shaming people for their beliefs is kind of the opposite.
Theres also the reality that those who suffer most from natural disasters generally have the least power to effect change in our global fossil fuel-driven energy system. With only a handful of years left to rein in the worst consequences of a warming climate, the only people we should be shaming are the oneswho got usinto this mess in the first place.","When Hurricane Michael flattened entire communities in the Florida Panhandle last fall, most Americans and media outlets responded with an appropriate level of horror and empathy.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Hudson Hongo to Gizmodo","Hurricane Harvey appears to be just the beginning of what’s to come for Houston, and Texas as a whole. That’s according to a study published online Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a tricky one. We know that, generally, storms are more intense when the air is warmer, and their impacts on coastlines are more severe when the sea level is higher. But determining whether the odds of a single storm were affected by the warming climate is a science all unto itself. It’s called weather attribution. “We believe the odds of a flood like Harvey are changing.” Many researchers weren’t sure what to initially think about Harvey when it struck the Gulf in August. Nearly three months later, at least one scientist is offering some answers as to how much climate change impacted the odds of the hurricane that left at least 82 dead and damaged more than 119,000 homes in Harris County, Texas—and how much it’ll continue to boost those odds in the future. Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric science professor at MIT who authored the paper, found that record rainfall—like the 27 trillion gallons of water we saw with Harvey—will become 18 percent more likely to hit the state by the end of the century under a business-as-usual, worst-case-scenario emissions model, which Emanuel uses in the study. Between 1981 and 2000, those chances were slim: 1 percent for a given year. When looking at Houston, specifically, he found that storms like Harvey have historically happened once every 2,000 years, describing it as “biblical,” in a press release. Climate change is changing all that. It already is: Emanuel estimates that, in 2017, those 1 percent odds have increased to 6 percent. “You’re rolling the dice every year,” said Emanuel, in the press release. “And we believe the odds of a flood like Harvey are changing.” Most climate models available to scientists like Emanuel are too coarse in resolution to simulate the formation of hurricanes. But Emanuel and his team developed one that can model hurricanes at high spatial resolutions within a changing climate. At least one other scientist, atmospheric scientist Phil Klotzbach, at Colorado State University, knows and trusts this approach. He’s seen this model used in previous research by Emanuel, and “it seems to work fairly well at replicating overall Atlantic hurricane activity,” Klotzbach wrote in an email to Earther. “How will steering current patterns change in the future?” But we also know that Texas saw some unique conditions with Harvey that made the storm’s impacts so much worse. For one, Houston didn’t build with storms in mind. Its sprawling development and vast impervious surfaces allowed water to just pool in the city and create flooding like no one ( well, except these journalists ) expected. Then, there were the meteorological conditions surrounding the storm itself. Atmospheric steering currents, which would usually bring a storm like Harvey inland to die, were unusually weak, so the hurricane stayed close to shore picking up more and more water from the Gulf with which to pound Texas. That’s where Klotzbach has some questions: “How will steering current patterns change in the future?” he asked, in the email to Earther. Emanuel ponders this, too, in his study. Still, in an email to Earther, he emphasized his confidence in his methods, which account for both storm movement and changing atmospheric moisture. And this study isn’t the last one coming. He and his team are analyzing how much of the state’s projected rainfall increases will result from either changing atmospheric moisture levels or longer-lasting events. “Preliminary results show roughly equal contributions from both factors,” he wrote to Earther. Emanuel does know some things for certain, though. And he makes note in his study: [A]nthropogenic climate change is expected to lead to a greater incidence of high-intensity hurricanes, which together with rising sea level, will produce increased risk of storm surge flooding, while hurricanes are projected to produce substantially more precipitation as the atmosphere and oceans warm. While it’s difficult to say climate change caused any one storm, we can safely assume climate change will bring about more storms like Harvey, or Irma, or Maria. Research like Emanuel’s gives us a sense of how much more likely these storms will be in the future. And that information will help us prepare.","Hurricane Harvey appears to be just the beginning of what’s to come for Houston, and Texas as a whole.

"Yessenia Funes on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Cyclone Idai is on track to becoming the deadliest tropical cyclone on record for the Southern Hemisphere. The storm, which struck the southeastern coast of Africa with the strength of a Category 2 hurricanelast week, almost obliterated the city of Beira in Mozambique, home to some 500,000 people.
While the countrys death toll currently stands at 84, Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi is estimating that number could rise to more than 1,000, according to the Associated Press. And thats just for one country; the death tolls for other affected countries like Zimbabwe and Malawi may continue to rise as governments begin evaluating their situations. In Zimbabwe, at least 89 people are dead. In Malawi, at least 56, per Africa News.
It is a real disaster of great proportions, President Nyusi said to state Radio Mozambique, according to the AP.
If we believe the president of Mozambique, then the death toll is going to go a lot higher than that.
CNN reports people in Mozambique are still awaiting rescue on their rooftops in places like Buzi where floodwaters remain high. At least 67 schools and 24 health units have been affected across the country according to ReliefWeb, and many areas are without power. To make matters worse, the rains are expected to continue through Thursday even though the cyclone has dissipated.
The deadliest storm on record in the Southern Hemisphere is Cyclone Leon-Eline in 2000, which killed some 800 people in this same region, as noted by Weather Underground co-founder Jeff Masters in a blog post. Even if the death toll doesnt increase, Cyclone Idai is already among the deadliest tropical storms this part of the world: So far, its No. 5. 
If we believe the president of Mozambique, then the death toll is going to go a lot higher than that, Masters told Earther. Just a couple days before landfall, I was saying this is going to be a bad one because they dont have a lot of hurricane experience there preparing for big storms like this.
The people of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi arent prepared because, well, storms of this strength arent all that common in this area. The last time these countries experienced a storm this intense, Masters said, was Leon-Eline in 2000. Though that storm was much strongera Category 4it didnt hit Mozambique the way Cyclone Idai did.
Idai had all the makings of a meteorological horror story. It was moving slowly, contributing to extreme rainfall conditions, including about 2 feet of rainwater in Beira. The storm also hit during high tide, which made the surge much worse than it wouldve been during low tide. On top of that, the cyclone came ashore just north of Beira where the surge could move into the Pungwe River delta, which exaggerated the flooding conditions. 
Idai was a near-textbook example of a cyclone inflicting maximum flood damage on this part of Mozambique, said Bob Henson, a meteorologist at Weather Underground, to Earther in an email.
Idai was borne from the same system that was already causing downpours in the area in the week prior, explained Masters. A tropical disturbance over land dumped one to two feet of rain over Mozambique some two weeks back, with one station recording 11 inches in just 12 hours March 7, he said. Once that disturbance moved over the water, Cyclone Idai formed.
We cant be sure how much of a role climate change played in Idai, but science is telling us that these type of extreme weather events will become more common in a warmer world with higher ocean temperatures. Even though they had little to do with causing this mess, African governments need to be better equipped if they want to safeguard their communities. Experiencing both flooding and droughts, Mozambique currently ranks third in Africa in terms of its vulnerability to these types of events.
Cyclone Idai underlines that no matter how effective early warnings are, there is still a huge demand for greater investment in resilient infrastructure in many parts of the world if we are to break the cycle of disaster-response-recovery, said United Nations Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction Mami Mizutori, in a statement.","Cyclone Idai is on track to becoming the deadliest tropical cyclone on record for the Southern Hemisphere.

Rayne Ellis,"Puerto Rico was ravaged by Hurricane Maria one year ago next month. Since the island's long recovery began, the government and independent institutions have worked to figure out exactly how many lives were taken by the effects of the extreme storm. SEE ALSO: We may never see a hurricane season worse than the one that brought us Katrina Today, we have a new, better estimate — and it’s more than 46 times the old one. According to a new study released by George Washington University (GW), 2,975 people died as a result of the hurricane. The government of Puerto Rico now accepts that number as an accurate death toll, updating their previous official estimate of 64. A group of workers repair a gravestone damaged by Hurricane Maria in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Image: Getty Images The GW group teamed up with the University of Puerto Rico Graduate School of Public Health to analyze death certificates and other mortality data collected from September 2017 to February 2018. They found that the number of deaths during that time were uncharacteristically high, when compared to that same time period from other years. “The results of our epidemiological study suggest that, tragically, Hurricane Maria led to a large number of excess deaths throughout the island. Certain groups – those in lower income areas and the elderly – faced the highest risk,” lead investigator Carlos Santos-Burgoa said in statement on Tuesday. In fact, the study found that in the poorest communities, the risk of dying increased 60 percent in the wake of Hurricane Maria. And the risk of dying increased 35 percent for older Puerto Rican males. This means that though the exact causes of death may be varied or unclear, in the six months after Hurricane Maria, more people died than usual. This kind of statistical analysis allows researchers to say that the hurricane left groups of people extremely vulnerable after the storm, even if the flooding rains and wind didn't explicitly kill these individuals. Broken headstones pile up in a cemetery in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Image: Getty Images Researchers and journalists alike have long speculated that Puerto Rico’s official death toll of 64 was suspiciously low. Back in 2017, a New York Times investigation estimated that the death toll was around 1,052 — nearly 1,000 more than the original calculation. This led the governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Roselló, to commission an independent study looking into the death toll in February 2018. “It is of great interest to the State to identify how many lives were lost due to the passage of Maria through the Island,"" Roselló said in a statement announcing the effort. ""It is our interest that experts can identify as accurately as possible the deaths directly and indirectly associated with the hurricane to improve protocols for future natural disasters.” In early July, researchers at Harvard released a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine which estimated that an excess of 4,500 people died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria by surveying more than 3,000 houses. Then in late July, the Puerto Rican government quietly acknowledged that the death toll was likely much higher than 64, after releasing a 400-page document that put the toll at more than 1,400 people. The government waited for the GW study to officially update the death toll. Broken tree branches pile up as workers push to clear out cemeteries in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Image: Getty Images The newest count puts Hurricane Maria in second place as the deadliest hurricane to ever hit the United States, behind the Great Galveston Hurricane of 1900 which reportedly took 6,000 lives or more. Aside from the official death toll, the study also provided recommendations to Puerto Rico’s local government and the U.S. federal government to better prepare for the next deadly storm. The study suggests a more efficient way to tally deaths after disasters, a fully staffed Department of Health, better intra-department communication, and other recommendations. “The lessons learned from this report and subsequent studies will help not just Puerto Rico, but other regions in the U.S. and around the world that face the ongoing threat of hurricanes and other natural disasters,” co-author Lynn R. Goldman said. “If enacted, the recommendations of this report could help save lives in Puerto Rico and beyond.”","Puerto Rico was ravaged by Hurricane Maria one year ago next month.

Mark Kaufman,"The tumultuous 2017 Atlantic hurricane season proved to be one of the most active years on record, with 17 named storms and six major hurricanes. But it can get quite a bit stormier than that. In a study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, researchers looked at hurricane seasons dating back to 1851 and found that it's quite unlikely any Atlantic hurricane season will surpass the 28 named storms and 15 hurricanes produced during the 2005 season, infamous for the deadly Hurricane Katrina that struck the Gulf Coast. SEE ALSO: A landmark climate change ruling could go up in smoke after Justice Kennedy retires ""To me, it makes sense that 2005 is about as many as you can get,"" Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University who had no role in the study, said in an interview. Using sophisticated weather models, the research team ran over 6,000 simulations of a wide range of weather conditions — such as temperature, winds, and air pressure — that our present climate can produce. They found that there's less than a 3.2 percent chance that any combination of conditions might result in more than 28 storms forming in any given year, which they took to mean 28 cyclones is pretty much the Atlantic Ocean's maximum storm potential. Hurricane Katrina makes landfall in 2005. Image: nasa This could be useful information for both Atlantic nations and the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences’ Risk Prediction Initiative, the natural catastrophe research group that funded the study. But, it's not really the number of storms that matters for people on the ground. ""At the end of the day, if you have 28 weak pieces of junk, no one cares,"" said Klotzbach. ""It's the Irmas people care about."" Last year, Hurricane Irma made landfall several times in the Caribbean, including leveling 95 percent of the structures on the island of Barbuda, before hitting Florida and causing severe flooding. Wind and water damage from the storm in the U.S. alone amounted to an estimated $50 billion, and, in total, Irma killed 47 people, though many more indirect deaths were reported. It could be a quiet storm year overall, said Klotzbach, but ""obviously all it takes is one or two high-profile storms to make the headlines and cause a lot of damage."" How about future storms in a changing climate? This study looked exclusively at what our present climate could produce in the Atlantic. Running sophisticated models on powerful computers has time and budget constraints, so the researchers restricted their research to the present. ""Of course, future climate is very important to consider,"" Sally Lavender, the study's lead author and researcher at Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's Division of Marine and Atmospheric Research, said over email. Yet, a changing climate doesn't necessarily mean more hurricanes, like it does more heat waves and wildfires. Massive Hurricane Irma passing the eastern end of Cuba on September 8, 2017. Image: nasa ""Based on work by others it is not at all clear if we could expect an increase in the numbers of tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic,"" said Lavender. Klotzbach agrees. ""Most models don’t show the number of storms increasing,"" said Klotzbach. ""In general, the number of storms is probably not going to change that much."" Still, future storms may carry more water, noted Klotzbach, or they may bring stronger winds, said Lavender. There's also strong evidence that storms are slowing down, which would mean considerably more flooding and destruction over the unlucky regions the storms stall over. Even so, Klotzbach emphasized that we might as well focus on preparing for what could happen today. In the 1940s, for example, five Category 4 and 5 storms (the highest rated storms) pummeled Florida over the course of six years. And with coastal development and massive population increases since then, we're not prepared to deal with that sort of storm onslaught, said Klotzbach. ""We’re not prepared for what we have now,"" he said. ""When Category 5's start hitting Florida again, it's going to be bad.""","The tumultuous 2017 Atlantic hurricane season proved to be one of the most active years on record, with 17 named storms and six major hurricanes.

Mark Kaufman,"Hurricane Florence has done something strange. The Category 4 storm — which is expected to make landfall somewhere in the Southeastern U.S. on early Friday morning as a major hurricane — has broken with a 170-year long history of Atlantic hurricanes to now target the United States. Since 1851, there have been 33 named-storms that churned within 100 miles of Florence's position in the middle of the Atlantic. None of them, according to a tweet from hurricane scientist Phil Klotzbach, ever made landfall in the U.S. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Florence is on its way to the East Coast. Here's what to expect. But some unusual weather is steering Florence westward, straight into the U.S. ""All its friends of years gone by have all been going to the north, while this one is going to the west,"" Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said in an interview. 33 named storms (since 1851) have been within 100 miles of #Florence 's current position. None of these storms made US landfall. The closest approach was #Hurricane George (1950) - the highlighted track. However, Florence does not appear to be taking a climatological track. pic.twitter.com/4x02pasgPg — Philip Klotzbach (@philklotzbach) September 7, 2018 Specifically, a potent mass of high pressure over the Atlantic has blocked Florence from traveling north, away from the U.S. ""Usually storms that are located there are already recurving toward the north,"" said McNoldy. ""This an anomalous storm."" Coming back to life Last Thursday, Florence had lost its status as a hurricane, weakening to a tropical storm, which has sustained maximum winds speeds of less than 74 mph. ""It weakened significantly,"" said McNoldy. The storm passed through an area of powerful wind shear — winds that hit storms at their sides, and weaken a hurricane's strength. But as meteorologists predicted, Florence made it through this temporary threat. ""As soon as it got out of that [shear] it began to regain strength,"" said McNoldy. ""There's nothing to inhibit it now."" What's more, hurricanes feed off of warmer ocean waters, and Florence has now entered an area of the Atlantic with waters that are typically warm enough to support a hurricane. But right now, these already-warm waters are even warmer than usual, noted McNoldy. The ocean temperatures Florence will pass through will peak near 85 degrees Fahrenheit, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. ""That certainly doesn't help the situation,"" McNoldy said. The end result is that the NHC forecasts a powerful, destructive storm hitting the Southeastern U.S. early Friday with intense wind speeds of 145 mph, which are then expected to fall to around 85 mph after moving inland. But from there, the situation will likely grow worse. There are no influential weather systems, like the high-pressure system that steered Florence toward the U.S. in the first place, to keep it moving along. This portends heavy rainfall and flooding as the storm stalls over the area. ""That's actually what happened last year for Hurricane Harvey,"" said McNoldy, noting that Harvey stagnated over Houston and dropped historic rainfall on southeastern Texas, becoming the second-most costly hurricane in U.S. history. As for Florence in the Southeastern U.S., ""It could remain in place for the entire weekend,"" said McNoldy.",Hurricane Florence has done something strange.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","After two mercifully quiet months, the Atlantic hurricane season has suddenly roared to life. There are currently two storms spinning in the Atlantic basin with a potential third on the horizon. While it’s not like 2017's record-setting run of storms, the sudden spate of unwelcome activity is the result of similar climate conditions. And those conditions are likely to persist for the next few weeks just as we reach the statistical peak of hurricane season, meaning we could see more storms spin up. The two active storms are Tropical Storm Gordon and Hurricane Florence. The former poses a pretty serious threat to Gulf Coast, with the National Hurricane Center forecasting it will intensify into a hurricane and make landfall on Tuesday night with life-threatening storm surge from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle. It could also dump up to a foot of rain. Florence, meanwhile, reached hurricane strength on Tuesday morning, though it’s expected to weaken to a tropical storm and then restrengthen to a hurricane again. It could reach Bahamas by early next week and possibly the East Coast, but that’s still a long ways away. Ryan Truchelut, the president and chief forecaster at WeatherTiger, told Earther that he’s concerned about Florence’s threat to the Bahamas in the near-term, but the odds of it reaching the East Coast are low given its track and historical precedent. Finally, there’s a tropical wave off Africa. Waves are often precursors to tropical storm systems characterized by low pressure and thunderstorms. This one currently has a 70 percent chance of becoming a full fledged tropical system within the next five days. What happens after that is still up in the air. Regardless of the unnamed wave’s fate, things are definitely rumbling along after the Atlantic basin went nearly two months without a hurricane. There are two climate shifts helping stir the basin up. Or more to the point, there’s one that’s happening and one that isn’t. The one that’s happening is the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which is characterized by a band of rainstorms that move around the equator influencing the convection of air masses in the tropics. It recently “shifted into a pattern more favorable for upward motion and tropical cyclone development in the Atlantic,” according to Bob Henson, a meteorologist with Weather Underground. Henson noted that the Madden-Julian Oscillation could stay in its current phase for weeks, meaning we could see activity continue. This is particularly true since mid-September is the statistical peak of hurricane season in the Atlantic basin. Then there’s the climate shift that isn’t happening. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has had an El Niño watch in place since June. El Niño is characterized by a warming of eastern tropical Pacific that in turn impacts the atmosphere. One of those impacts is increased upper level winds blowing into the Atlantic that can rip apart hurricanes or inhibit them from forming. “[T]he progress toward that predicted El Niño event has stalled over the last month, so the potential suppressive effects on the Atlantic tropics aren’t increasing,” Henson said. He also noted that trade winds in the Atlantic are weaker than normal right now, making life easier still for tropical storms to spin up. A third factor is temperatures in the main development region, the area of the tropical Atlantic where hurricanes traditionally form. For nearly all of hurricane season, temperatures in this region have been cooler than normal by roughly 1-2 degrees Fahrenheit—enough to slow down convection and deprive storms of humid fuel. Since bottoming out in late July, though, ocean temperatures in the main development region have been steadily increasing. “Recently, sea surface temperatures in the main development region have returned to near-normal levels,” Allison Wing, a hurricane researcher at Florida State, told Earther. All of these conditions are likely to continue to grip the region over the next few weeks, meaning that even in a hurricane season forecast to be quieter than normal, things could get active. Truchelut worries that any storms forming after Florence could be more problematic for the U.S., particularly with the way a ridge of high pressure is expected to build in the coming weeks. “ I am more concerned about the waves following Florence, particularly if they are slower to develop and thus travel westward rather than west-northwestward for an extended period of time,” he said. “The broad ridge that ensembles suggest will be in place over the east-central U.S. for at least 11-15 days is a dangerous steering pattern that is capable of moving storms that reach the Lesser Antilles towards Florida and the Gulf Coast.” In other words, pay attention to the forecast.","After two mercifully quiet months, the Atlantic hurricane season has suddenly roared to life.

George Dvorsky,"A new simulation produced by NASA’s Data Visualization Studio packs four months of swirling atmospheric activity into a two minute clip that reminds us how unrelenting this past hurricane season really was. This looks like a timelapse pieced together from images taken by satellites, but it’s not. Rather, it’s a computer simulation based on real data. Specifically, the model is showing the progression of aerosols—wafts of sea salt, dust, and smoke—blowing through the atmosphere from July 31 to November 1, 2017. This visualization was churned out by the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS), a system of math models developed by the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. What’s particularly neat about this video is that the hurricanes kind of appear by accident. Hurricanes aren’t aerosols, but because the NASA scientists were tracking the stuff carried by wind around the atmosphere, they were able to visualize the various storm systems as they moved across the Atlantic. NASA explains : During the 2017 hurricane season, the storms are visible because of the sea salt that is captured by the storms. Strong winds at the surface lift the sea salt into the atmosphere and the particles are incorporated into the storm. Hurricane Irma is the first big storm that spawns off the coast of Africa. As the storm spins up, the Saharan dust is absorbed in cloud droplets and washed out of the storm as rain. This process happens with most of the storms, except for Hurricane Ophelia. Forming more northward than most storms, Ophelia traveled to the east picking up dust from the Sahara and smoke from large fires in Portugal. Retaining its tropical storm state farther northward than any system in the Atlantic, Ophelia carried the smoke and dust into Ireland and the UK.

"Ray Sanchez, CNN","Puerto Rico's emergency management director Abner Gómez's resignation is effective Saturday Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, appointed by Pentagon to lead military relief efforts, leaves island next week (CNN) Puerto Rico's emergency management director resigned Friday as the island's slow recovery continues nearly two months after Hurricane Maria made landfall. In announcing the resignation of Abner Gómez, effective Saturday, Gov. Ricardo Rosselló praised the work of his emergency management chief following the passage of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in early and later September. The governor also announced that Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, who was appointed by the Pentagon to lead all military relief efforts, will be reassigned outside the island next week. About 60% of the US territory is still without power as the island's approximately 3.4 million US citizens struggle through the aftermath of the storm. A massive power outage struck the capital of San Juan on Thursday after a major north-south transmission line failed, according to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as PREPA. No reason given for resignation Héctor Pesquera, secretary of Puerto Rico's Department of Public Safety, will take over emergency management duties. Rosselló did not give a reason for Gómez's resignation. The emergency management director came under fire after the island's El Nuevo Dia newspaper reported that Gómez took a two-week vacation shortly after Maria made landfall on September 20. Buchanan, a three-star star general and commander of US Army North (5th Army), arrived in Puerto Rico in late September as the military was tasked with improving distribution networks of relief supplies. 'We've moved out of the crisis' ""The cessation of General Buchanan's work does not mean that the military is leaving,"" Rosselló said in a statement. ""His departure marks a positive transition. We have not finished the recovery, but there is progress in the missions that have been carried out."" Buchanan will be replaced by a two-star general, according to the governor. ""From my perspective, we've moved out of the crisis,"" Buchanan told reporters. ""We're moving out of response and most places are moving on towards recovery... FEMA is going to be here for very much the long term and the rebuilding effort, and we in the military generally don't do that."" The changes come as the island's government faces questions about the official death toll of 55 from the massive storm. Government officials acknowledged this week that nearly 500 more people died in Puerto Rico in September than in the same month the previous year. An official with Puerto Rico's forensics institute told reporters that 472 more people died this September than in the same month in 2016 -- up from 2,366 to 2,838. Wanda Llovet, director of the Demographic Register, said there were about 82 deaths a day reported from September 1 through September 19, compared to some 117 per day during the last ten days of the month. ""We are not going to say there could be more or less,"" Pesquera, whose oversees the count, said of hurricane-related fatalities. ""We've quantified the number of deaths."" Pesquera has staunchly defended government efforts to generate an accurate count under extremely trying conditions: most lines of communication were cut and many roads on the island were initially impassable.

Kirsten Korosec,"Google’s annual Year in Search is more than a digital record of the events, stories and phenomena that captured our attention over 12 months. It’s a reckoning, or computation, on what mattered to society in any given year and sometimes even signal where it’s headed. And 2018 showed a world transfixed on one sporting event, one wedding, celebrity deaths, natural disasters and politics. In 2018, the global community was locked in on the World Cup. The final match was between France and Croatia; we’ll let you Google who won. The world was also transfixed on high-profile deaths of musicians, scientists and artists. Seven of the 10 top Google searches globally were of people who died in 2018, including theoretical physicist and author Stephen Hawking, rapper Mac Miller, the DJ Avicii, comic book creator and icon Stan Lee, celebrity chef, author and TV personality Anthony Bourdain, and fashion designer Kate Spade. One movie, Black Panther, made the top 10 global list, as well Meghan Markle, the former actress who became Duchess of Sussex when she married Prince Henry. In the U.S., the top overall searches followed a similar pattern, with a few other disruptive moments thrown in the mix, including the elections results, Hurricane Florence and Mega Millions results. A scan of other search categories that Google tracked reveals that U.S. users were obsessed with eyelashes in 2018, 1980s fashion, how to vote and how to register to vote, Unicorn cake and the Keto diet. Our top news search in the U.S. was led by the World Cup, followed by Hurricane Florence, Mega Millions, election results and Hurricane Michael. The Kavanaugh confirmation was the sixth most searched news story in 2018. The Florida shooting, the Royal Wedding, Olympic medal count and government shutdown rounded out the top 10 news searches in the U.S., according to Google. One of the more insightful metrics that Google tracks is the “What is ___ ?” list. In the U.S., people typing in that “what is” question into Google search asked most often about Bitcoin, racketeering, DACA (the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), government shutdown and Good Friday. U.S. Google users also wanted explanations for Fortnite, the “Yanny or Laurel” auditory illusion and what a nationalist is. Speaking of Fortnite, it was the most searched video game, according to Google’s annual Year in Search. The video game Fortnite was also the most searched GIF followed by “Default Dance,” “Dilly Dilly” and “Orange Justice” and “Black Panther.” Other top searched video games included Red Dead Redemption 2, Fallout 76, Far Cry 5 and God of War.

FRANCES ROBLES,"Prepa still needs to complete repairs to five critical transmission lines, 12 damaged substations and three transmission centers that are needed for grid stability and redundancy, said Gil Quiniones, the chief executive of the New York Power Authority, which has helped in Puerto Rico’s recovery. “The No. 1 goal was to get electricity back as quickly as possible,” Mr. Quiniones said. “On the one hand, there’s lots of new stuff. On the other hand, the crews and other contractors really rushed the work to put it back together.” Michael Byrne, the federal disaster recovery coordinator for Puerto Rico, said the utility’s task now is to design and build a resilient distribution and transmission system that can better withstand problems large and small. “We’ve been flying helicopters all over this island for 11 months now, stringing new lines and putting new towers in,” Mr. Byrne said. “So the level of effort has been historic. But that was just to patch back together what was there.” Just after the governor of Puerto Rico announced in November that the power authority had gotten back to 50 percent of its former electricity generation, the island suddenly went dark, in one of what would be a series of wide blackouts in the months following the Sept. 20 storm. Just last week, the power went out again in large swaths of San Juan. Asked to describe the island’s power grid, Mr. Byrne said, “It’s stable, but fragile.”","Jazmín Méndez’s home in Ponce, P.R.

Adam Rogers,"The sixth-month anniversary of Hurricane Maria’s grinding-up of Puerto Rico brought what might feel like good news. According to AEE, the Electrical Energy Authority, almost 93 percent of Puerto Ricans—1,365,065 people—now have power. The process has been agonizing—a misguided early repair contract to the unlikely Whitefish Energy for $300 million got cancelled, and it took months for crews from better-suited firms to get started. Financial problems, logistical difficulties, and a weird reluctance on the part of the federal government to make Puerto Rico a priority all extended the timeline. The work is far from over. Thousands of people are still without water and power, and suffering—especially in rural areas—goes on. But in the midst of that tumult and travail, some technologists see opportunities for innovation. Puerto Rico’s energy infrastructure was falling apart even before the hurricane. So lots of folks are advocating solar power systems as a jump into the future. Earlier this month, the design-driven nonprofit Resilient Power Puerto Rico announced it would receive grants of $625,000, with which the group plans to construct 25 of a planned 100 small, commercial-scale solar arrays—with an eye toward revamping pieces of the island’s grid. Jonathan Marvel Resilient Power Puerto Rico is itself powered, in part, by Jonathan Marvel, an architect perhaps best known these days for beautiful hipster remodels in Brooklyn. But Marvel’s father Thomas was one of the islands most important architects. “I was without a lot of knowledge about solar or electrical engineering, but because of the hurricane, and being born and raised here—I have an office in San Juan as well as new York—it became a matter of pride and responsibility to try to power up Puerto Rico,” Marvel says. His pedigree goes back even farther; Marvel’s great uncle was famed designer Buckminster Fuller, of geodesic domes, Dymaxion cars, and the early sustainability philosophy of Spaceship Earth. “We started by bringing solar generators and batteries, because the governor said we could install them without having to go through a permitting process during the relief and recovery period,” Marvel says. Instead of homes, Marvel installed solar panels at the community centers common in smaller municipalities, where people already gathered and could share the power. “If we could power up community centers, we could power up the island.” Resilient Power Puerto Rico isn’t the only group working on solar. (Naomi Klein has a terrific article in The Intercept about this movement.) It has installed six community center arrays so far—20 panels each, with two Tesla batteries (one for backup), each capable of supplying 5 to 6 kWh. It’s not enough to run an air conditioner all day, but it’ll run water filters, pumps, and charging stations for phones and radios. “The beauty of the Powerwall, which is what we’re installing, is that it’s super-efficient. It occupies very little space, hangs on existing block wall so that there’s more space left for activities,” Marvel says. That’s not a replacement for a traditional power grid, of course. AEE says repair crews have brought in 6,647 new transformers, 45,200 poles (with thousands more on the way), and 19,000 miles of cable to get power from generation facilities—running on coal or oil—to users. The last mile is always the hardest; Puerto Rico’s power utility Prepa had serious financial woes even before Maria, which slowed things down, and the hurricane did some of its heaviest damage in remote areas where transmission lines carried power from generating facilities to population centers. A December report from Prepa and the New York Governor’s Office, among others, said that $17.6 billion over the next ten years could completely revamp Puerto Rico’s aged grid. The model might be what New York did on Long Island after Hurricane Sandy, hardening infrastructure against storms with flood barriers and elevated platforms while upgrading traditional transmission and distribution lines. But the report also recommends switching 10 percent of the system to “microgrids,” solar panels with battery storage that could provide backup power to critical infrastructure like hospitals, as well as rural areas. Solar can’t replace an island-wide grid; it’s not efficient enough yet, even in a place that gets as much sun as Puerto Rico. Solar-plus-batteries helps, because the sun can literally charge the batteries for a rainy day—or for nightfall. Batteries smooth out peaks and valleys in output. “To be clear, it’s still cheaper to serve most of the population with grid electricity, but for facilities where resilience is super-important, like a fire station or a wastewater treatment facility, it makes sense to price in the added cost,” says Varun Sivaram, a science and technology fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of Taming the Sun. “Microgrids are complex systems, but they’ve been built in many places and lots of people have expertise in building them. The primary hurdles are policy and standards.” Marvel knows that, but he wants to expand the microgrid idea even further—beyond individual buildings to entire municipalities. He was in Puerto Rico a couple weeks ago talking to mayors, hoping to move from the scale of a single building to powering 20,000 people. “As long as we’re not crossing property lines, we can legally create these microgrids,” Marvel says. “Right now it’s all in the engineering and proposal stages. We’re looking for locations to host and opportunities to finance the locations. Because of the interest from the mayors, I don’t think there’s going to be a shortage of places.” This is the kind of project that fewer people know how to build, but that might have a far greater impact. It’s also, perhaps not by coincidence, the kind of systems-based, sustainable, futuristic Spaceship Earth-type solution that Marvel’s Great Uncle Bucky would probably have approved of. (Putting a geodesic dome over Puerto Rico seems less feasible.) And if his group can get that stepped-up scale of solar built, it could have a ripple effect—not just in Puerto Rico, but everywhere. “Architects love to talk about scale—the scale of a house, a city, a planet,” Marvel says. “If you can solve things in Puerto Rico, you can solve things on a larger scale as well.” There’s already evidence of demand. Microsoft, for example, is buying 315 megawatts of solar for its cloud computing facilities in Virginia. “Solar deployed at the scale of communities is a kind goldilocks zone,” Sivaram says. Rooftop solar isn’t always economical, and vast solar installations require new substations and transmission lines, but “solar at a megawatt scale, on the order of serving hundreds of American households, that’s the right scale. But for that to happen it’s got to be integrated into the rest of the electricity grid.” For now, though, it makes sense to focus on Puerto Rico recovery. The island has at least a few of the resources necessary for a project like this—plenty of fresh water, plenty of sunlight, plenty of labor. What it lacks, of course, is capital. Resilience Power Puerto Rico figures it’ll take $5 million to $10 million to power up a 20,000-person solar grid. So now Marvel finds himself in a policy role, talking to mayors and potential sources of funding, negotiating property rights. He says he’s just using standard architectural problem solving to help out his childhood home. “Architecture is a profession that sees things holistically, that sees things along the lines of systems dynamics, where everything is interrelated,” he says. “Those are tools we learn in architecture school.” And even though the efforts to get the power back on with traditional technology seem to finally be seeing success, the clock is ticking. The 2018 hurricane season starts in June. Powering Up Overhauling Puerto Rico’s grid won’t be easy, but it’s necessary. One reason an island territory needs power? To communicate with itself, and the rest of the world. Hurricane Maria was a disaster with many faces, including a health crisis with dimensions still largely unknown.","Architect Jonathan Marvel is building solar arrays to serve community centers, and soon, he hopes, communities.",2018-03-26T11:00:00Z,"{'id': 'wired', 'name': 'Wired'}",This Brooklyn Architect Wants to Rewire Puerto Rico with Solar,https://www.wired.com/story/this-brooklyn-architect-wants-to-rewire-puerto-rico-with-solar/,https://media.wired.com/photos/5ab593c3a54678516963cc8e/191:100/pass/puertoricosolarpanels.jpg,wired,Wired,Hurricane,1

Home-cooked meals, prepared by Mr. Winner’s daughter, were in the refrigerator. A diesel generator was hooked up on the cement porch, along with a supply of fuel. The house is made of cinder block and cement, with a 2-inch-thick front door insulated with horsehair. “It’s Fort Knox over there,” said Mr. Winner’s daughter, Annette Winner. Like many holdouts, Mr. Winner stays because he is most comfortable at home and believes that his presence might, in some ineffable way, help protect the place. He worries about looters, too. Seven security cameras around his property beam images to a monitor next to his recliner. “If you leave, you’re likely to lose everything,” he said. “I’d worry to death that I might have been able to save something.” Another holdout, Willard Killough III, 44, who has survived every hurricane and storm in Carolina Beach since the early 1990s, said there is something else at play. “Sure, they say, ‘This is my home and I’m never leaving,’ but I think maybe there’s a sense of adventure there, too,” he said. Mr. Killough does not plan to leave for Florence, either. Brad Swain, a behavioral researcher at a center affiliated with Duke University who wrote a 2017 analysis titled “The Psychology of Riding It Out,” concluded that many people do not perceive hurricanes as especially dangerous.

Beth Skwarecki,"A hurricane’s category only tells you about its wind speed, but much of its devastation comes from flooding. With Hurricane Florence, some areas could see as many as 30 inches of rain plus ten feet of storm surge. What is a storm surge? The winds of a hurricane push water around, even while the storm is still in the ocean. Water that is pushed onto land becomes the storm surge. Think of how the tide can roll in from the sea and cover up land that was previously bare. It’s like that, except you have tides in addition to the storm surge, raising water levels even higher. Where does the storm surge happen? It’s not just an issue at the coast. Storm surges can cause flooding in upstream rivers, or in any low-lying areas the surge water reaches. North Carolina is so flat that the surge is expected to cause flooding many miles inland. How much flooding should we expect? Total flooding depends on the storm surge, including storm tides, plus rainfall. It varies depending on the exact contours of the land. And your safety in the storm depends on other factors as well: perhaps your house will be dry, but if all the roads are flooded, that doesn’t help you much. Bottom line, if you or a loved one are in the area, the most important map is an evacuation map. But if you’re curious about the predicted flooding, here is the storm surge prediction map from the National Hurricane Center. Predictions change as more information comes in, and the NHC notes that the map “includes many assumptions and has limitations, and it cannot tell you what amount of flooding will definitely occur at any given location.” Hurricane Florence is expected to make landfall along the Atlantic coast as early as this coming… Read more Read Rainfall predictions are shown on a separate map, and those predictions are likewise going to change as forecasters watch the storm approach.

SANDRA E. GARCIA,"Tropical Storm Isaac was strengthening and the National Hurricane Center expected it to be upgraded to a hurricane by Sunday night. It was headed toward the Caribbean, but no warnings had been posted. In the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Helene was close to the Cabo Verde Islands off the coast of Africa and was expected to go out to sea after it passes the islands. In the Pacific, Tropical Storm Paul was southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. Forecasters expected it to remain a tropical storm and head out into the open water. A second tropical storm in the Pacific, Olivia, could threaten Hawaii in a couple of days, but it was too early to tell, Mr. Feltgen said.

JESS BIDGOOD,"• The authorities evacuated people in Lahaina, in West Maui, after a brush fire ignited and spread quickly on Friday. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. • Five tourists from California were rescued from a flooded vacation home in Hilo on Thursday, according to The Associated Press. A slow-moving storm can lead to a lot more rain. The fact that Lane is moving slowly, about five miles an hour, means that it is likely to dump large amounts of rain. In June, our reporter Kendra Pierre-Louis looked at a study published in the journal Nature that focused on what is known as translation speed, which measures how quickly a storm is moving over an area, say, from Miami to the Florida Panhandle. Between 1949 and 2016, tropical cyclone translation speeds declined 10 percent worldwide, the study says. The storms, in effect, are sticking around for a longer period of time. Lingering hurricanes can be a problem, as Texans learned last year when Hurricane Harvey stalled over the state, causing devastating flooding and billions of dollars of damage. The storm dropped more than 30 inches of rain in two days and nearly 50 inches over four days in some places. A report released by Harris County, which includes Houston, found that Harvey’s rainfall exceeded every known flooding event in American history since 1899. The storm was approaching Hawaii on Wednesday. Read more about the dangers of lingering hurricanes here. It’s been a year filled with emergencies for Hawaii. First came an errant alert that a ballistic missile was headed for Hawaii. Then 50 inches of rain were recorded in one day on Kauai, flooding parts of the island. Next a slow-motion eruption of the Kilauea volcano ravaged parts of the Big Island. Now the state is facing its latest potential calamity: Hurricane Lane. On Thursday, we spoke with Hawaiians on the Big Island who were dealing with the deluge, and those to the north as they prepared for their own lashing of strong winds, heavy rain, rough surf and rising water. For many of the islands’ residents, it was hard to believe that a hurricane would make a direct hit when they have been spared so many times in the past. Still, some people prepared with a sense of urgency. “I’m normally not a person that makes sure my gas tanks are full and everything is all settled and organized, but I totally organized and brought everything in, and my chickens are in the garage,” said Heather Nelson, 39, who works in event production and lives in Volcano, Hawaii. On the Big Island, in Kalapana, Suzette Ridolfi, a teacher who evacuated her home as Kilauea was spewing lava, said “the volcano was may more scary.” “With the volcano there was no rest,” she said. “It was intense, intense, intense and the intensity never slowed down a bit. And, with the hurricane passing, there’s big rains and heavy rains and we get really scared for a few minutes, but then it stops and it’s peaceful, it’s calm.” Photo Employees of a Honolulu hotel filled sandbags in preparation for the storm. Credit John Locher/Associated Press Read more about the multiple threats faced by Hawaiians this year here. The storm put a damper on thousands of vacations. The five California tourists rescued from a vacation home on Thursday were a minuscule slice of the 270,000 tourists estimated to be on Hawaii. The state had a record year for tourism in 2017, according to George Szigeti, the president and chief executive of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, who said things had continued at a steady clip in 2018 despite the drumbeat of bad news. “It’s been a very active year,” Mr. Szigeti said, “but I would tell you, Hawaii is a very resilient destination.” Tourists who wanted to cut vacations short early may have found it difficult to do so, Mr. Szigeti said, because so many flights were already full. Doug Okada, the general manager of the Aston Waikiki Sunset, a towering hotel in Honolulu, said his 330 units were full this week, since it was high season. Some visitors had canceled incoming stays, but others had extended them because they did not want to fly out during the storm. “We just have to do our best to get through this,” said Mr. Okada, who was urging guests to shelter in place. “Some guests have never been in a hurricane situation, so it’s a thrilling experience. I’m glad they are positive, but they’ve been warned not to go out in dangerous conditions.” Meghan Miner Murray, Barbara Tanabe, John Schwartz, Kendra Pierre-Louis and Matt Stevens contributed reporting.

"CAMPBELL ROBERTSON, JIM TANKERSLEY and WHITTEN SABBATINI","But nothing happened. And in 2016 Mr. Ledbetter, along with a narrow plurality of voters in Knox, voted for Mr. Trump. “The one thing he kept keying on was bringing jobs,” he said. “The jobs going away is what tore this county apart. Jobs might bring it back.” Had anything changed here since 2016? No, he said. Not yet. But it would take time, he said, and the fact that the economy elsewhere, in wealthier places, is doing so well means the benefits would eventually trickle down to here. “They can only build so much,” he said. Knox County officials say they have stopped looking for deliverance in the landing of a Maytag-size factory, a “moonshot,” and frankly they are a bit tired of hearing about those years. They said the future is in smaller manufacturing companies, new industries and local entrepreneurs, anything that would keep the brightest young people from leaving, as they almost all do. Officials see signs of a turnaround in the flurry of new retail — a Kohl’s, a Love’s travel station, a Kay Jewelers — in the bustling boutique restaurants downtown and, for the first time in many years, in a haul of tax revenues in Galesburg that outpaced city expenses. “There’ll be a group of people always that want to go back to the good old days of the 1920s or the 1880s or whatever,” said John Pritchard, the mayor of Galesburg, who insists that the Labor Department figures about Knox County are simply wrong. “But the reality is I think most people are feeling better about how things are moving. It’s just a challenge to keep people here.” Marisa Miller, 23, who plans to be a physician assistant, was sitting in her car in the vast parking lot of the old mall, where the last department store was having an out-of-business sale. Her parents worked at Maytag and her grandparents worked at the Butler factory that closed down in 2005. “Honestly we’re bringing new places here,” she said of the stores opening in the other parts of town. “But we’re seeing other places leave.” Ms. Miller said she was not surprised that economic revival had not yet washed over her town.

MARK A. WALSH,"Now in its 15th year on the market, the frothy beverage helped unleash the pumpkin spice deluge, which shows no signs of ebbing. So you may well wonder: What is pumpkin spice, anyway? Originally marketed by the U.S. spice giant McCormick in the 1950s as a convenient way to season pumpkin pie, the mix consists of ground cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and allspice. Other blends also include clove, cardamom and mace. Tasted together, the spices evoke the heady fragrance of a freshly baked pie and have other cozy, autumnal associations — chunky knit sweaters, colorful fallen leaves, hot apple cider. What the mix doesn’t taste like, however, is pumpkin. Because pumpkin spice mix contains none.

Saqib Shah,"Although, it's difficult to chalk 2017 up as anything other than a lousy year, we can find some solace in the well-meaning ""how"" queries sent Google's way. Aside from an increase in political mobilization (as evidenced in the popularity of ""how to make a protest sign?""), we were asking ""how to help?"" more than ever. Spurred by natural disasters (like the California wildfires), people also looked for ways to help out within local communities by asking how to become firefighters, paramedics, social workers, and activists. ""In these moments and others, our collective humanity shined,"" remarked Google. The company itself marked the year by fully embracing hardware, but (judging by its trends) the Pixel 2 wasn't the handset search users were anticipating the most. That honor went to Apple's iPhone 8 and iPhone X, which came in at second and third place respectively on global search results. Staying on the tech side of things, Bitcoin was also in the mix, as people kept pace with its volatile price surges (while hopefully refraining from splashing their savings on the digital currency). When it came to celebs, the news cycle had us furiously looking up Matt Lauer and other men on the end of sexual misconduct allegations. Harvey Weinstein, on the other hand, whose outing at the hands of a New York Times expose opened the sexual harassment floodgates, wound up at number three. Kevin Spacey and Bill O' Reilly also made the cut. Meanwhile, soon-to-be princess Meghan Markle landed in second place and Gal Gadot just cracked the top ten. Elsewhere, in a grab bag of top US and global searches, we commemorated rock legends Tom Petty and Chester Bennington, gawked at Mayweather vs McGregor, binged Netflix's 13 Reasons Why, sought out the solar eclipse, and googled fidget spinners (bet you're not doing that anymore).","It's been a heck of a year.

KAYA LATERMAN,"As towns along the Florida Panhandle start to assess the damage from Hurricane Michael and plan their next steps, homeowners in Long Island offer a cautionary tale of how natural disasters can leave a different type of debris after storm waters recede: endless paperwork, unfinished homes, displaced families, foreclosures, overworked contractors and caseworkers, miscommunication, suspected fraud and massive debt. “All I ever wanted to do was help people,” Mr. Lawrence said. Around 30 homeowners on Long Island have estimated that Turnkey, Mr. Lawrence’s company, took about $4 million in federal grant awards for jobs that were not completed. Credit Kaya Laterman The day after Sandy hit New York, the Bacigalupos, who had evacuated, returned to Island Park to assess the damage. Like most of the homes in this small village in Nassau County, their three-bedroom ranch had been completely ravaged. Although the house was still standing, every room had flooded. I was screaming, hysterically crying, Ms. Bacigalupo said. The neighborhood looked like a war zone, Mr. Bacigalupo said. Emergency personnel conducted search-and-rescue missions. Police officers, firefighters and volunteers from across the country worked tirelessly to clean up debris, including boats in the middle of the street. Despite the devastation, the community pulled together. Ms. Bacigalupo said workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, local officials and nonprofits like Long Island Cares, as well as the Salvation Army and American Red Cross, distributed water, food, clothing and household goods immediately. Owners of local stores handed out gift cards and vouchers. The Village of Island Park paid for trash haulers. The Bacigalupos were awarded $149,000 from their flood insurance policy. They cobbled together an additional $71,000 from savings and Mr. Bacigalupos 401(k) to renovate.

JEFFERY C. MAYS,"After Hurricane Maria, Mr. Bonilla, who lived in Toa Baja, P.R., began having trouble breathing. He was taken to a hospital, which ran out of oxygen. At another hospital, the generator providing electricity for his ventilator would shut off occasionally. The official cause of death on his death certificate was sepsis. “In reality, his death was indirectly caused by the hurricane,” Ms. Bonilla said. “The hospitals were not running as usual. These stories cannot be forgotten.” Having an accurate death toll after a natural diaster helps determine the scope of the recovery effort, encouraging new resiliency efforts, while providing families closure and qualifying them for assistance, the Harvard researchers said in explaining their efforts. Jordan Sanchez, who works with the disaster relief agency SBP, said he was worried about the future because Puerto Rico is still struggling with basic tasks at the start of hurricane season, which began on Friday. Mr. Sanchez, who is Puerto Rican and has family members on the island, recently returned from his second trip there since the storm. He said families, especially in more rural areas, are still struggling to obtain power, healthy food and medical care. Normally, the aid relief effort would have already moved to the recovery and rebuilding phase. “Even a strong storm could be devastating,” Mr. Sanchez said. “But we are a resilient people, so I have to remain optimistic.”","Demonstrators at a rally outside the United Nations in Manhattan on Saturday.

EMMA G. FITZSIMMONS,"On Wednesday, Mr. Byford presented his plan to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s board. He compared the subway crisis to earlier emergencies in New York history that the city recovered from, including Sept. 11 and Hurricane Sandy. “Not acting now is not an option, and it will only get more difficult and more expensive,” Mr. Byford said. “I believe this can be achieved and we now have a road map.” But even before Mr. Byford’s presentation, the many obstacles facing the plan began to emerge. Subway officials had told board members on Tuesday that the plan could cost $19 billion for the first stage, but the authority’s chairman, Joseph J. Lhota, quickly walked back that estimate and said it was too soon to determine the costs — an acknowledgment that the price tag might spook elected officials. There are other hurdles: the authority’s lack of credibility after regularly delivering projects late and over-budget; an ongoing battle between Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio over who is responsible for funding the subway; and the recent failure in Albany of congestion pricing — a proposal to charge drivers in Manhattan that would have raised money for the transit system, but that did not garner widespread support. There were early signs that Mr. Byford’s plan might not have enthusiastic support from Mr. Cuomo, who controls the authority and would likely have the greatest responsibility for securing financing for the plan. Mr. de Blasio’s office also immediately distanced itself from helping to pay for the proposal and urged state leaders to approve a tax on the wealthy.","Riders on the L train in March.

Reuters Editorial,"CANOVANAS, Puerto Rico (Reuters) - Among the countless Puerto Rico neighborhoods battered by Hurricane Maria is one named after another storm: Villa Hugo. The illegal shantytown emerged on a public wetland after 1989’s Hurricane Hugo left thousands homeless. About 6,000 squatters landed here, near the El Yunque National Forest, and built makeshift homes on 40 acres that span a low-lying valley and its adjacent mountainside. Wood and concrete dwellings, their facades scrawled with invented addresses, sit on cinder blocks. After Maria, many are missing roofs; some have collapsed altogether. Amid the rubble, 59-year-old Joe Quirindongo sat in the sun one recent day on a wooden platform - the only remaining piece of his home. Soft-spoken with weathered skin and a buzzcut, Quirindongo pondered his limited options. “I know this isn’t a good place for a house,” said Quirindongo, who survives on U.S. government assistance. “Sometimes I would like to go to another place, but I can’t afford anything.” Villa Hugo reflects a much larger crisis in this impoverished U.S. territory, where so-called “informal” homes are estimated to house about half the population of 3.4 million. Some residents built on land they never owned. Others illegally subdivided properties, often so family members could build on their lots. Most have no title to their homes, which are constructed without permits and usually not up to building codes. The houses range in quality and size, from one-room shacks to sizable family homes. Many have plumbing and power, though not always through official means. (For a Wider Image photo essay on the island's post-Maria housing crisis, see: reut.rs/2EJmIq3 ) The concentration of illegal housing presents a vexing dilemma for local and federal authorities already overwhelmed by the task of rebuilding an economically depressed island after its worst natural disaster in nine decades. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló has stressed the need to “build back better,” a sentiment echoed by U.S. disaster relief and housing officials. But rebuilding to modern standards or relocating squatters to new homes would take an investment far beyond reimbursing residents for lost property value. It’s an outlay Puerto Rico’s government says it can’t afford, and which U.S. officials say is beyond the scope of their funding and mission. Yet the alternative - as Villa Hugo shows - is to encourage rebuilding of the kind of substandard housing that made the island so vulnerable to Maria in the first place. “It’s definitely a housing crisis,” said Fernando Gil, Puerto Rico’s housing secretary. “It was already out there before, and the hurricane exacerbates it.” In Puerto Rico, housing is by far the largest category of storm destruction, estimated by the island government at about $37 billion, with only a small portion covered by insurance. That’s more than twice the government’s estimate for catastrophic electric grid damage, which was made far worse by the shoddy state of utility infrastructure before the storm. Puerto Rico officials did not respond to questions about how the territory estimated the damage to illegally built homes. Maria destroyed or significantly damaged more than a third of about 1.2 million occupied homes on the island, the government estimates. Most of those victims had no hazard insurance - which is only required for mortgage-holders in Puerto Rico - and no flood insurance. Just 344,000 homes on the island have mortgages, according U.S. Census Bureau data. Officials at the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration (SBA) acknowledged the unique challenges of delivering critical housing aid to Puerto Rico. Among them: calculating the damage to illegal, often substandard homes; persuading storm victims to follow through on application processes that have frustrated many into giving up; and allocating billions in disaster aid that still won’t be nearly enough solve the island’s housing crisis. By far the most money for Puerto Rico housing aid is expected to come from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD spokeswoman Caitlin Thompson declined to comment on how the agency would spend billions of dollars in disaster relief funds to rebuild housing, or how it planned to help owners of informally built homes. Two HUD officials overseeing the agency’s Puerto Rico relief efforts, Todd Richardson and Stan Gimont, also declined to comment. But the disaster aid package currently under consideration by the U.S. Congress would provide far less housing aid than Puerto Rico officials say they need. Governor Rosselló is seeking $46 billion in aid from HUD, an amount that dwarfs previous allocations for even the most destructive U.S. storms. That’s nearly half the island’s total relief request of $94 billion. The U.S. House of Representatives instead passed a package of $81 billion, with $26 billion for HUD, that still needs Senate and White House approval. The money would be divided between regions struck by several 2017 hurricanes - including Maria, Harvey in Texas and Irma in Florida - as well as the recent California wildfires. Congress could also decide to approve additional aid later. ‘MY MOTHER IS SCARED’ A generation ago, Maria Vega Lastra, now 61, was among the estimated 28,000 people displaced by Hurricane Hugo. Neighbors helped her build a new home in what would become Villa Hugo, in the town of Canóvanas. Her daughter, 34-year-old Amadaliz Diaz, still recalls her older brother grinning as he sawed wood for the frame of their self-built, one-floor house, with a porch and three bedrooms. Now, Vega Lastra’s roof has holes in it, and her waterlogged wooden floorboards buckle with each step. Vega Lastra has been staying with her daughter, who lives in Tampa, as the family waits on applications for FEMA aid. The agency initially denied her application in December, saying it could not contact her by phone, Diaz said. Vega Lastra is returning to her home this week, uncertain if its condition has gotten worse. Her daughter bought her an air mattress to take with her. “My mother is scared,” Diaz said. “I hope the government helps her. I work, but I have three kids to take care of.” The island’s housing crisis long predated the storm. According to Federal Housing Finance Agency data, Puerto Rico’s index of new home prices fell 25 percent over the last decade, amid a severe recession that culminated last May in the largest government bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. Legal home construction, meanwhile, plummeted from nearly 16,000 new units in 2004 to less than 2,500 last year, according to consultancy Estudios Tecnicos, an economic data firm. A 2007 study by environmental consultant Interviron Services Inc, commissioned by the Puerto Rico Builders Association, found that 55 percent of residential and commercial construction was informal. That would work out to nearly 700,000 homes. That figure might be high, said David Carrasquillo, president of the Puerto Rico Planning Society, a trade group representing community planners. But even a “very conservative” estimate would yield at least 260,000 illegally built houses, he said. Generations of Puerto Rican governments never made serious efforts to enforce building codes to stop new illegal housing, current and former island officials said in interviews. Past administrations had little political or economic incentive to force people out of neighborhoods like Villa Hugo. Former Governor Rafael Hernandez Colon, in office during Hurricane Hugo, said he tried to help informal homeowners without policing them. “Our policy was not to relocate, but rather improve those places,” Hernandez Colon said in an interview. Subsequent administrations advocated similar policies; none made meaningful headway, partly because of Puerto Rico’s constant political turnover.

REUTERS/Alvin Baez Today, informal communities provide a stark contrast to San Juan’s glittering resorts and bustling business districts. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz pointed to poor barrios like those near the city’s Martín Peña Channel, hidden behind the skyscrapers of the financial hub known as the Golden Mile. “It’s not something I’m proud of, but we hide our poverty here,” Cruz said in an interview. RECOVERY DILEMMA The task of rebuilding Puerto Rico’s housing stock ultimately falls to the territory government, which has no ability to pay for it after racking up $120 billion in bond and pension debt in the years before the storm. That leaves the island dependent on U.S. relief from FEMA, the SBA and HUD. The SBA offers low-interest home repair loans of up to $200,000. FEMA provides homeowners with emergency grants, relocation assistance and other help. HUD is focused on long-term rebuilding efforts, working directly with local agencies to subsidize reconstruction through grants. FEMA’s cap for disaster aid to individuals is $33,300, and actual awards are often much lower. Normally, FEMA eligibility for housing aid requires proving property ownership, but the agency says it will help owners of informal homes if they can prove residency. How exactly to help gets complicated. For example, someone who builds their own home with no permits on land they own is more likely to be treated as a homeowner, said Justo Hernandez, FEMA’s deputy federal coordinating officer. Squatters who built on land they didn’t own, however, would likely only be given money to cover lost items and relocate to a rental, he said. Several Villa Hugo residents said they received money from FEMA, but many didn’t know what it was for and complained it wasn’t enough. Lourdes Rios Romero, 59, plans to appeal the $6,000 grant she got for repairs to her flooded home, citing a much higher contractor’s quote. Neighbor Miguel Rosario Lopez, a 62-year-old retiree, showed a statement from FEMA saying he was eligible for $916.22, “to perform essential repairs that will allow you to live in your home.” Without money for major changes, most homeowners said they planned to combine the aid they might get from FEMA with what little money they could raise to rebuild in the same spot. FEMA does not police illegal building. Code enforcement is left to the same local authorities who have allowed illegal construction to persist for years. FILE PHOTO - A house destroyed during Hurricane Maria in September 2017 is seen in Utuado, Puerto Rico February 1, 2018. REUTERS/Alvin Baez Quirindongo is planning to buy materials to rebuild his Villa Hugo home himself with about $4,000 from FEMA. It will be the third time he has done so, having lost one home to a 2011 flood, another to a fire. “I just want to have something that I can say, ‘This is mine,’” Quirindongo said. GIVING UP Many others appear to have given up on FEMA aid because the agency’s application process is entangled with a separate process for awarding SBA loans to rebuild homes. FEMA is legally bound to assess whether applicants might qualify for SBA loans before awarding them FEMA grants. If an applicant passes FEMA’s cursory eligibility assessment, they are automatically referred to SBA for a more thorough screening. Applicants are not required to follow through on the SBA process - but they cannot qualify for FEMA aid unless they do. FEMA only provides a grant when the SBA denies the applicant a loan. FEMA said it has referred about 520,000 people out of 1.1 million total applicants so far to the SBA. But as of Monday, only 59,000 followed through with SBA applications. Of those, some 12,000 later withdrew, SBA data shows. “As soon as people see SBA they say, ‘I give up, I don’t want a loan - I can’t afford a loan,’” FEMA’s Hernandez said. SBA spokeswoman Carol Chastang said the agency is working with FEMA to educate flood victims on available benefits and the application process, including sending staffers to applicants’ homes. 330,000 VACANT HOMES Before the storm hit, Puerto Rico already had about 330,000 vacant homes, according to Census Bureau 2016 estimates, resulting from years of population decline as citizens migrated to the mainland United States and elsewhere. Puerto Ricans are American citizens and can move to the mainland at will. Puerto Rico and federal officials have considered rehabilitating the vacant housing for short- and long-term use, along with building new homes and buying out homeowners in illegally built neighborhoods, according to Gil and federal officials. Rosselló, the Puerto Rican governor, has said the rebuilding plan must include a fleet of properly built new homes. Gil, the housing secretary, said the administration would like to build as many as 70,000 properties. HUD officials declined to comment on whether the agency would finance new housing. Its Community Development Block Grant program allows for local governments to design their own solutions and seek HUD approval for funding. The cost of constructing enough new, code-compliant properties to house people displaced by Maria could far exceed the available federal aid. Making them affordable also presents a problem. Puerto Rico’s subsidized “social interest housing,” geared toward low-income buyers, typically provides units that sell in the mid-$100,000 range, with prices capped by the government. That’s beyond the means of many displaced storm victims. Gil offered little detail on a solution beyond saying it will include a mix of new development, buyout programs for owners of illegally built homes and other options. The answer will come down to how much Washington is willing to pay, he said. He invoked the island’s territorial status and colonial history as a root cause of its poor infrastructure and housing stock before the storm. “It is precisely because we have been neglected by the federal government that the island’s infrastructure is so weak,” he said. Many Puerto Rico officials continue to advocate for bringing relief and legitimacy to squatter communities like Villa Hugo, rather than trying to relocate their residents. Canovanas Mayor Lornna Soto has been negotiating with island officials to provide property titles to Villa Hugo’s population. The vast majority still don’t have them. “It’s long overdue to recognize that they are not going anywhere and their communities need to be rebuilt with proper services,” Soto said. Diaz said she supports her mother’s decision to return to Villa Hugo, regardless of what aid the government ultimately provides. “I grew up there,” Diaz said. “Everyone knows us there.” Reporting by Nick Brown in Canóvanas, Puerto Rico; editing by Brian Thevenot","CANOVANAS, Puerto Rico (Reuters) - Among the countless Puerto Rico neighborhoods battered by Hurricane Maria is one named after another storm: Villa Hugo.

MARY HUI,"(From 2004 to 2013, Singapore flew the route with the less efficient A340. Rising fuel prices ultimately made that operation uneconomical.) While it may be the longest flight now, 19 hours is nothing compared with some of its predecessors. In 1936, Pan American Airways started the first passenger service between San Francisco and Manila via Honolulu, Midway, Wake Island and Guam. The first leg of that trip alone was originally more than 21 hours. Just eight days after mail service began on that route a year earlier, The Times ran a headline exclaiming, CLIPPER TRIMMED SCHEDULED TIME ; Reached Manila From Alameda in 59 Hours 47 Mins., Instead of 60 Set, Musick Says. Even then, airlines wanted to provide as fast a trip as possible. Their passengers probably would have loved seat-back TVs with video on demand, too. The ability of airlines to deliver fast, direct trips was and is constrained by fuel. As one analyst told The Times when Singapore retired its previous Newark-Singapore flights, ultralong-haul flights like this are essentially flying jet fuel tankers.

Jack Stewart,"More than a million people have been told to leave their homes, get away from the coast and low lying areas, and get to safety, as Hurricane Florence bears down on the Carolinas and Virginia. But a new group of temporary, risk-taking, residents is getting ready to ride out the storm. Drone pilots are watching forecasts, and staging in areas where they’ll be safe, but useful, ready to rush into action as soon as possible, as a now vital part of the disaster response. “When we’re pre-deployed, we have our rations—it’s an ongoing joke of beef jerky and pretzels,” says Hadley Doyle-González, who runs SMG Drones, in Palm Beach, Florida. “We have a ridiculous amount of batteries,” she says. “We need to be able to fly for 24 hours with no power.” During Hurricane Irma, which hit Florida this time last year, she was deployed to Naples, and holed up in a hotel. She made sure all her equipment was in waterproof cases and moved her car to higher ground. When the winds died down, she headed out to capture high resolution images of houses, buildings, or utilities, which can show damage early, and get help and repairs, as well as insurance money, to where it's needed. “You’re charging every battery you have to the nth degree,” says Craig Besse, flight ops manager for Airbus Aerial, who was also deployed in Irma's aftermath. You need 20 to 30 gallons of water per person, and to make sure your truck is loaded with food, water, and fuel. “Get that last shower in,” he says, before supplies are cut off. Then, it’s about being flexible. “It’s not going to go the way you expected.” LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Drones As Hurricane Florence continues its unstoppable march toward the Atlantic coast, both Besse and Doyle-González are managing teams of drone pilots and going through those same final preparations. They are just a few of the expected thousands of drones and pilots getting ready to fly over the damage left by the storm. When Florence hits the coast, it will bring torrential downpours, wind blasts, coastal erosion, and the possibility of a storm surge of seawater causing flooding. The National Hurricane Center has predicted ""life-threatening storm surge and rainfall."" Accuweather is warning that the angle at which the storm will impact the coast—nearly perpendicular—means the winds on the east side will be particularly effective at driving waves, and that surge, onto shore. It’s predicting $60 billion in economic impact and damage. Air travel, of course, will be disrupted. The FAA says to expect flight cancellations and airport closures. Air traffic controllers will evacuate tall towers in extreme winds, but stay on duty on a lower, secure level. Airport workers will disable airport surveillance radar antennas so they spin freely, to save them from wind damage, and get up and running as quickly as possible once the threat has passed. The assembled drone pilots, though, won't wait for commercial aviation to restart before they take off. Insurance companies are the biggest clients for their services, so they can figure out where to send resources, and in some cases, to settle claims within hours. Utility companies employ drone pilots to spot downed power lines. Infrastructure engineers can see flooded roads. And they can do it all long before it's possible or safe to reach these areas on the ground. At the Airbus Aerial headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, Jesse Kallman, president of the imaging company, has taken over a conference room, with a team of 10. Together they’re putting well prepared plans into action, to combine data from Airbus’ satellites, fixed wing aircraft, and drones. Insurance companies are sending over databases of where their policy holders are concentrated. Utilities are spelling out where they have vulnerable infrastructure like long power lines. The company is also pulling together pre-event data: ""before” pictures to contrast with the “after.” Getting those “after” images is the challenge. No aircraft can fly in the storm itself, and even when it passes, they have to get into place to start work. “We work with the satellite team to try to understand the optimal times to acquire data, and work through all the types of data needed,” says Kallman. A detailed understanding of the path of the storm can give them a head start. “Once the weather clears, we want to be prepared to get planes and drones up in the air,” says Jonathan Gadd, who manages drone and planes at EagleView, another imaging company, for which Doyle-González is subcontracting. It’s not just quadcopters that can be useful. Small, manned planes can also cover more distance, but at a greater cost. EagleView is working to stage 15 fixed-wing aircraft in Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee, and Florida. Planes are not only useful for supplementing drones for image capture, particularly on long runs, but they’re also crucial for transport. EagleView’s pilots can act as couriers, flying into affected areas, collecting hard drives of video and image data, and flying them to HQ in Rochester, New York. Drone operators train for this type of work, and know enough to stay out of the way of first responders. The FAA is appealing to amateurs to do the same. Professional drone pilots can apply for emergency certificates of operation from the sky safety regulator if they need to work in areas that have been blanketed with temporary flight restrictions. Combining this bird's eye view with some clever computing lets insurance agencies move faster than ever before, like Allstate did after Hurricane Irma. “We had a customer in Orlando, and we called him, and said we believe your roof has damage,” says spokesperson Justin Herndon. “That was before he filed a claim.” The man had money in his bank account within five hours. Well after the storm has gone, drones can help with the heavy lifting. In hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico last year, utilities used drones to restring downed power lines in hard to access areas. But now, America's drone pilots are lying in wait for Florence's rage. “This one’s supposed to linger—it’s going to be a lot slower of a go time than what we’re used to,” says Doyle-González. Teams will have to spend more like 48 hours surviving on their jerky and pretzels, sitting and waiting, sleeping while they can. Then they’ll be ready to start work—even if it means a few days before their next shower.

MEKELA PANDITHARATNE,"The wind and rain began lashing New Orleans in the early hours of Aug. 29, 2005, while President George W. Bush was on vacation at his ranch in Texas. As the levees buckled and water poured into the city, the federal government tarried. Later, Hurricane Katrina’s long pall — the more than 1,800 related deaths, the devastation and the slow federal response — would come to haunt Mr. Bush’s presidency, cratering his approval rating. President Trump, who has overseen his own hurricane crisis after last year’s storms in Texas and Puerto Rico, has largely escaped the presidency-defining censure that dogged Mr. Bush after Hurricane Katrina. Last week,Puerto Rico’s government increased the island’s official death toll, estimating that 2,975 people died as a result of the hurricane and its effects — up from the tally of just 64 that had been the official count until then. Nearly one year after the storm hit, we now know that Hurricane Maria may be among the deadliest natural disasters to occur in the United States in a century. So why the pass for President Trump? Mr. Trump’s scandal-plagued presidency has benefited from a deliberate pattern of diversion and the deep executive dysfunction he has created in the federal government. Under his tenure, the president has given the impression it is not the White House’s job to coordinate with federal agencies and that by extension, he does not own his agencies’ failures. This shouldn’t stand.","A memorial, in San Juan, P.R., in June called “Project 4,645,"" was a collective initiative from social media reacting to a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine that estimated that 4,645 people died in Hurricane Maria and its aftermath.

Ryan F. Mandelbaum,"The drive to the Arecibo Observatory from San Juan is breathtaking in both beauty and treachery. The hour-long journey follows a roller-coaster-like path of humps and switchbacks through the dense tropical forest on what should be, but is not, a one-way road. Houses remain covered in tarps, awaiting repairs to their storm-ravaged roofs, and at least one sported anti-FEMA graffiti. Though Puerto Rico’s huge, historic observatory survived Hurricane Maria with little damage, its future is now in jeopardy. Recently, the University of Central Florida revealed itself as the leader behind a mysterious consortium that would take over management of the storied telescope—the world’s second-largest single dish. Six months after Hurricane Maria, which killed hundreds of people and left Puerto Rico with widespread power outages that continue today, Arecibo could potentially be in a better place than it was before the storm, as it transitions to new management with more private funding. But there’s work left to be done before the Arecibo is out of the woods. At 1,000 feet wide, Arecibo was the largest single-dish telescope from 1963 until 2016, when it lost its title to the 1640-foot FAST telescope in China. It’s responsible for years of asteroid imaging, exoplanet and pulsar studies, and atmospheric research. It sent the famous Arecibo Message meant for extraterrestrials in 1974. Its observations earned two scientists the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering binary pulsars, a tool that could be used to further study how stars emit gravitational waves. Arecibo appears as alien on the Puerto Rican landscape as the beings it attempted to contact back in the 1970s. Three support towers, all taller than 200 feet, suspend a massive ring with a dome and antennae over the thousand-foot-dish, built into a sinkhole in the area’s hilly topography. It looks like a hidden Cold War-era weapon with its dark, dirty panels, but this doesn’t get in the way of the cutting-edge science conducted there (and the panels are currently getting a cleaning). Its look earned it a spot in the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. The telescope’s troubles began long before Maria. The federal government discussed budget cuts as early as 2006, reports the Associated Press, as the National Science Foundation has hunted for ways to free up money by letting go of older projects. The NSF previously funded two-thirds of Arecibo’s $12 million budget, as Nature has reported, and has been looking for a way to reduce its contribution. Maria struck Puerto Rico as a category 4 hurricane on September 20, 2017. Much of the island lost power, and hundreds of thousands were still in the dark as of last month. The telescope seemed to weather the storm miraculously, only losing part of one of its instruments, which crashed down into its dish, breaking 30 of the nearly 40,000 reflective aluminum panels that focus radio signals into the telescope’s antennae. But good news came in November: The NSF announced a way forward that wouldn’t require shutting down the observatory. Over the next five years, the NSF would decrease its annual funding from $8.2 million to $2 million, while private backers would take over the rest. More recently, the telescope’s management team announced a restructuring, as a cooperative agreement with managers SRI International, the Universities Space Research Association, and Universidad Metropolitana (UMET) was set to end on March 31. Instead, a consortium led by the University of Central Florida, with help from a private company called Yang Enterprises, will take over, with UMET remaining involved. NASA will continue to fund around $4 million of the telescope’s costs per year to support its own research. Next steps for the telescope are fraught. Physics Today reported that all employees will need to reapply for their jobs by the end of this month; that the University of Central Florida doesn’t currently have scientists with the expertise required by Arecibo; and that the consortium is looking for other options for more funding, too, such as partnerships with the Department of Defense (who does fund some science research through programs like DARPA) or arrangements for scientists and agencies to pay to use the telescope. Gizmodo reached out to Francisco Cordova, Arecibo’s director, for comment about the Physics Today article, and we will update the post when we hear back. Then of course, there’s how Arecibo fits into Puerto Rico as a whole. The telescope’s local staff of around 120 was responsible for clearing the roads and ensuring things were back up and running a week after the storm. But the island still faces power outages and its own long road to recovery. Some worry the island is being forgotten. “It’s easy for the government to focus its energy on things that are easy to fix,” planetary radar astronomer Alessondra Springmann from the University of Arizona told Gizmodo. “But it’s also easy for the US to forget.” Back at the telescope, some of the observatory’s users are more optimistic. After all, the future may be hazy, but at least there’s a future. “I think things will get much better,” Abel Mendez, planetary astrobiologist at the University of Puerto Rico, Arecibo told Gizmodo. “This is a setback, but with the plan that the observatory is making, that NASA is putting faith in it—I think in the long run, we’ll have a better telescope.”","The drive to the Arecibo Observatory from San Juan is breathtaking in both beauty and treachery.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"In September, following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Congress approved $15 billion in relief aid. Lawmakers signed off on another $36.5 billion for storm and wildfires assistance in October, after weeks of criticism leveled against the Trump administration for its response to Maria in Puerto Rico. The $90 billion disaster relief package outlined on Wednesday also includes aid for communities affected by hurricanes or wildfires in California, Florida, Texas and the Virgin Islands. When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in 2005, Congress approved $10 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency four days later, and another $50 billion six days later. The federal government is still spending money on Katrina assistance, more than 12 years after the storm’s landfall. Before Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in nearly a century, the island was already grappling with insolvency. The government declared a form of bankruptcy last May, after years of borrowing money to pay for operating expenses after a painful recession that began in 2006. The relief package sets aside $4.8 billion for Medicaid in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, helping to avoid a looming shortfall that could have left some 600,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in Puerto Rico without health insurance by April. Puerto Rican leaders worried some of the people left uninsured would migrate to the mainland seeking coverage. Compared to the states, territories receive only a fraction of funding for entitlement programs. The Senate deal would waive the requirement for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to share in the cost of Medicaid for two years, placing the funding responsibility on the federal government instead. Louisiana received the same reprieve after Hurricane Katrina, but for only one year, said Representative Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting delegate in Congress. Lawmakers approved relief packages for 10 years after that storm, she noted. Puerto Rico is not that far removed yet from Hurricane Maria. “Receiving these funds is important, and that will demonstrate that Puerto Rico will use them wisely and with transparency,” she said. “That’s an important issue here: We can be a model for how to invest in infrastructure on the island.” Puerto Rico’s governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló, said the $2 billion earmarked for power restoration in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could help his island harden its battered grid. While funds from the previous aid packages went to FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers, the latest relief package will give money directly to the Puerto Rican government. Twenty-eight percent of Puerto Ricans — more than 400,000 utility customers — still do not have power more than four months after Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico. “With these resources, we can begin rebuilding our housing and energy future, putting Puerto Rico on a new path forward,” Mr. Rosselló said in a statement.

,"At a Glance In less than a day, Beryl went from an area of interest to the first hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. This tiny hurricane may strengthen a tad more into early Saturday. It will then encounter wind shear this weekend, causing it to weaken rapidly. Beryl should reach the Lesser Antilles by late Sunday or Monday. An increase in showers and gusty winds is expected in the Lesser Antilles. Hurricane Beryl has rapidly intensified to become the first hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic season well east of the Lesser Antilles, going from a tropical depression to hurricane in less than 24 hours. This tiny hurricane is currently located over 1,100 miles east-southeast of the Windward Islands, moving west. (The highest cloud tops, corresponding to the most vigorous convection, are shown in the brightest red colors. Clustering, deep convection around the center is a sign of a healthy tropical cyclone.) Beryl was upgraded to a hurricane based on microwave and infrared satellite imagery showing a ""pinhole eye"" had developed. Its tropical storm-force winds extend only up to about 35 miles from its center. Beryl's Current Wind Field (The orange circle shows the extent of the system's tropical storm-force winds (at least 39 mph). The purple circle indicates the extent of hurricane-force winds (at least 74 mph), according to the National Hurricane Center.) Tropical cyclones as tiny as Beryl are prone to intensify faster than forecast. Given barely enough ocean heat content (sea-surface temperatures around 80 degrees Fahrenheit), low wind shear, and its location south of a plume of sinking, dry air known as the Saharan air layer, Beryl intensified quickly from a tropical depression at 11 a.m. EDT Thursday to a Category 1 hurricane just 18 hours later. According to the National Hurricane Center, these favorable conditions may remain in place through early Saturday, and Beryl could gain even more intensity. However, upper-level winds will become hostile before Beryl approaches the Lesser Antilles this weekend. These shearing winds should weaken this system as it draws closer to the Lesser Antilles. Current Satellite and Wind Shear (The current tropical system is shown by the icon at lower right. Areas of strong wind shear, the difference in wind speed and direction with height, are shown in purple. High wind shear is hostile to tropical cyclones and those trying to develop.) Dry air is also plentiful ahead of Beryl and may also play some weakening role. Water Vapor Satellite Image (Dry air is shown by the progressively deeper orange and red colors. Progressively more moist air is shown by the gray, white, pink and blue colors.) While allowing Beryl to rapidly strengthen, its small size also makes it more fragile compared to larger systems. This should make Beryl's eventual weakening more rapid. The question is how fast will that occur. There is some chance Beryl may still be a tropical storm by the time it reaches the Lesser Antilles late Sunday into Monday. However, there's also a chance tiny Beryl may be ripped apart by the aforementioned combo of wind shear and dry air. Even if the system degenerates into a tropical wave, an uptick in shower activity, including some locally heavy rain, and gusty winds are expected in the Lesser Antilles late Sunday into Monday. (The red-shaded area denotes the potential path of the center of the tropical cyclone.

"Alicia Adamczyk on Two Cents, shared by Alicia Adamczyk to Lifehacker","An estimated 2,300 children have been separated from their parents as a result of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy. Though President Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday reversing his stance on separating families (the zero-tolerance policy is still in effect, meaning people will still be prosecuted), it does not reunite those who have already been separated. In many cases, parents cannot afford bail or are being deported before they’re reunited with their children, and images of children locked in prison-like conditions and reports of rampant abuse and neglect are enraging and mobilizing people across the country. It’s only human to want to help in any way you can, and for many people that means giving money to organizations and charities doing good work. And while you shouldn’t be deterred from giving in times of need, you should also be on the lookout for scammers who use people’s pain for financial gain. After pretty much every major incident in the U.S.—from September 11 to Sandy Hook to Hurricane Katrina —fake charities and organizations proliferate to steal from unsuspecting good Samaritans. Hitting the streets to make your voice heard is a fundamental right in the United States, and it’s… Read more Read Here’s how to avoid being scammed. Do Your Research There are a few places you can research organizations and how they use their funds: A good rule of thumb is to look for orgs that spend no more than 20 percent of their funds on overhead costs, which you can find on Charity Navigator. One reason to donate to a larger organization is because they have the knowledge and experience to use funds and not be overwhelmed by an influx of donations. A small shop run by people with no experience managing millions of dollars will likely not maximize use of the money (and it’s been an issue over and over again after catastrophic events like the Sandy Hook massacre and even Hurricane Harvey ). But this isn’t fool-proof. The New York Times reported on the Red Cross’s botched relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina, for example, and ProPublica and NPR detailed how the Red Cross dropped the ball after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. New charities and organizations do pop up in the aftermath of disasters that intend to do good work, and they won’t have ratings on these sites. In that case, you can research on their website to see how the money is to be used. If they don’t have any info, that’s not a good sign—and in fact, is likely a deal-breaker. It’s fine to want to raise money, but the org should have a plan of how it will be dispersed first. One other way to donate: Companies like GoFundMe verify fundraising campaigns, and will update info on how the money is being spent. To help families at the border, see this page. If you plan to donate to The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), an organization that helps… Read more Read Ask Where Your Money Is Going If you’re giving money and can’t find where it’s going on the org’s website, you can ask what it will be used for, or even stipulate how the funds should be dispersed. If reps from the organization are cagey or vague, consider sending your money somewhere else. Don’t Donate on Social Media... It might be easy to donate through Twitter and Facebook, but experts have advised against doing so. The same is true for text messages and email—scammers can easily send phishing emails or fake text alerts. The best way to donate is directly through an organization’s website. Communicating with the people that are supposed to represent you in government can sound like a… Read more Read... With Smart Exceptions That said, the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES) in Texas is the recipient of funds from a viral Facebook campaign to raise money to reunite kids with their parents. It’s raised over $15 million thus far, which might seem like an overwhelming amount for the little-known nonprofit. But RAICES has a detailed breakdown of how the funds will be used: The Legal Representation, Advocacy, and Education (LEAF) Project: This effort provides representation for released unaccompanied children in Texas “so they do not have to do this alone.” Family Reunification and Bond Fund: FREE our Families: This fund “support[s] legal services for detained separated parents and the direct funding for bonds to get parents released.” Bonds for these parents are set at a minimum of $1,500, and are more often in the $5,000-$10,000, according to RAICES. Also important: Facebook does not collect a fee on charitable donations that are processed through the Fundraiser feature (places like GoFundMe do charge a fee, though they waive it some cases). You can also donate directly through the organization’s website if you want to help but don’t want to donate through Facebook, or volunteer with RAICES. They are looking for attorneys and graphic designers, and people who speak Spanish and French. Lifehacker has also compiled this list of additional ways to help. That said, you can keep track of and demand accountability from the organizations you donate to in the ensuing years. They should be able to provide detailed reports of how all the money is spent. If you think you’ve been scammed, you can file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.","An estimated 2,300 children have been separated from their parents as a result of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy.

The remnants of Hurricane Leslie swept into the centre and north of the country overnight on Saturday. There have been no reports of deaths or injuries, but officials have warned people not to venture outdoors, and a number of flights have been cancelled. The storm, one of the most powerful to ever hit the country, is now heading for Spain. Wind speeds of up to 176km/h (109mph) were recorded after the storm struck the mainland. It is rare for an Atlantic hurricane to reach the Iberian Peninsula, and it is thought this could be the most powerful to hit Portugal since 1842. However, Hurricane Leslie, which formed on 23 September, was downgraded to a tropical storm before it made landfall.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Florida Governor Rick Scott warned state residents that ""this storm could kill you"" Powerful Hurricane Michael is set to make landfall in Florida later on Wednesday, forcing mass evacuations in the southern US state. A category three storm with winds near 120mph (193km/h), Michael is expected to strengthen further when it hits the Florida Panhandle or Florida Big Bend in the north-west, meteorologists warn. More than 370,000 people have been ordered to evacuate in Florida. Florida, Alabama and Georgia have declared states of emergency. At least 13 people have reportedly died in Central America due to the storm. What are the latest developments? In its bulletin, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) said: ""Strengthening is expected overnight and on Wednesday, and Michael is forecast to be near category four strength when it makes landfall."" The NHC warns that some regions of Florida may see storm surges of up to 12ft (4m). It said that at 00:00 GMT on Wednesday, the eye of the storm was about 255 miles south of Panama City, Florida. Michael is currently moving northwards at 12mph. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Residents put plywood up in Port St Joe, Florida ""Weakening is expected after landfall as Michael moves across the south-eastern United States,"" the NHC added. Florida Governor Rick Scott called Michael ""a monstrous storm"" and urged residents to listen to officials. ""Let me be clear - the storm surge that our coastal counties are facing is deadly,"" the governor tweeted. ""Do not ignore warning from local officials - this storm could kill you. We can rebuild your house, we cannot rebuild your life."" Despite the warnings, local officials believe a far fewer number of people have in fact moved away. Schools and state offices in the area are to remain shut this week. On Tuesday, Gov Scott said he activated 2,500 Florida National Guard troops in preparation for the storm. Heavy rains are forecast for the Carolinas, which were drenched by Hurricane Florence last month. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told residents: ""I know people are fatigued from Florence, but don't let this storm catch you with your guard down."" More than 300 miles of coastline are currently under threat, the National Weather Service has said. Forecasters in Alabama warned of possible tornados. President Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday: ""We are very well prepared for the incoming hurricane."" Image copyright AFP Residents face frightening ordeal By BBC's Gary ODonoghue in Florida Adrian Mahangos hopes he is one of the lucky ones. Sitting outside his home, reading a magazine, less than 100 yards from the water's edge in Wynnehaven, he knows Hurricane Michael is now due to make landfall 50 or 60 miles to his east. Mr Mahangos is not going anywhere. His house is 11ft above sea level, and if the 4ft-surge predicted for this part of the coast goes no higher, then he's confident his newly-built home will survive. Just an hour along the coast, it's different. The aptly named Lullwater Beach, just west of Panama City Beach, is quiet at the moment, but this whole stretch is looking a possible surge of up to 13ft. A man in the distance is gathering sand from the beach while it's still light, and pouring it into trash bags - making do with what's at hand to protect from the water. Local officials are warning that not nearly enough people have evacuated as they would wish. Florida is used to storms, but the Panhandle, with its low-lying coastal strip and scattered communities, hasn't seen anything this strong for more than a dozen years. Those that remain will be facing a frightening ordeal. Where has Hurricane Michael hit so far? The storm caused widespread destruction in Central America over the weekend, where at least 13 people have been reported dead. According to the Associated Press, six people were killed in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador. Images on social media showed evacuating families wading through water to get to safety. Image copyright EPA Image caption Western Cuba, including Havana, was struck by Hurricane Michael on Monday Parts of western Cuba, which was hit by the storm on Monday, were forecast to receive up to a foot of rain. Offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico have evacuated workers, halting nearly a fifth of daily production. Five drilling rigs have been moved out of the storm's path, according to the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h Some minor flooding, little structural damage. Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h Roofs and trees could be damaged.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","It’s been a year of unique weather to say the least. The latest potentially bizarre weather happening to add to the list? Florence, the first major hurricane of the season, could follow a highly unusual route from the center of the Atlantic into the heart of the Eastern Seaboard thanks to a weird atmospheric setup. There are a lot of factors that will affect the storm’s track over the coming days, and slight shifts in any of them could have major consequences. A U.S. landfall is not a given by any means, but Florence is a storm that bears watching into next week, especially with the latest model runs. The storm has already had a wild ride. On Wednesday, it whipped up into a Category 3 hurricane before running into turbulent winds that are part of the subtropical jet stream, a fast-flowing river of air in the atmosphere. By Thursday, Florence had weakened back to a tropical storm. It continued its subdued simmer into Friday with winds at 65 mph. That weakening is the start of the potential bad news for the East Coast, but it also means Florence will in all likelihood spare Bermuda. Hurricanes in the Atlantic usually follow a track that looks roughly like a backwards C owing to steering winds and the location of high pressure system known as the Bermuda High that generally sits parked in the middle of the Atlantic. If the storm had kept tracking northwestward, it would eventually have gotten sucked in by the high and spit back out into the North Atlantic, potentially clipping Bermuda in the process. But weaker winds and the storm’s interaction with the jet stream have nudged it on a more westerly track that’s very unusual. “It’s so far north for that longitude that storms in the area are historically in the process of recurving toward the north,” Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami, told Earther. “Not Florence.” Of the 57 named storms that have passed within 200 miles of Florence’s location as of late this morning, none have come close to striking the U.S. Most have curved out to sea with the exception of a few freak storms that skirted southwest toward the Dominican Republic. Florence’s northerly position is the East Coast’s first piece of bad news. The second is that an exceptionally strong ridge of high pressure air is building to the north that could essentially bottle up Florence and keep it rumbling westward. “No hurricane can turn north into that,” McNoldy said. In other words, if the ridge comes to bear at the strength recent model runs are showing, it would put Florence on a collision course with the East Coast. Not only that, it would steer the storm over a pool of very warm water, allowing it to roar back to life and potentially reach major hurricane status again. The vaunted Euro model has pretty consistently been pointing toward an East Coast landfall and the American weather model known as the GFS has been nudging that way, too. The Friday afternoon ensemble run of the Euro pushes Florence further westward with a likely landfall in the Southeast or Carolinas. If it happens, the storm will have essentially taken an unprecedented track across the Atlantic. Still, this is not the time to freak out. Florence remains 1,800 miles east of Florida. There are still a number of moving parts that will have to fall into place to make things go wrong for East Coasters. That said, it’s the time to listen to the National Hurricane Center and weather professionals and think about how you’ll prepare if the forecast continues to shape up poorly.","It’s been a year of unique weather to say the least.

DANIEL VICTOR,"Hawaii is bracing for possible landfall from Hurricane Lane, a Category 4 storm that forecasters are warning could bring whipping winds, flooding and high surf. Tropical storm-force winds could arrive on the Big Island by Wednesday afternoon local time, with hurricane-force winds to follow soon afterward, said Gavin Shigesato, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The storm would then continue north toward Maui and Oahu around Thursday morning, he said. As of 5 p.m. Tuesday in Hawaii, the storm, packing 155 mile-per-hour winds, was moving west-northwest toward Hawaii at about 9 m.p.h., he said. Hurricane-force winds were extending about 40 miles from the center. “It’s still a very strong storm,” Mr. Shigesato said. Mountainous areas could be particularly prone to flooding, and the southern shores could experience damaging surf levels, with more than 20 inches of rain possible. There is danger of tornadoes and large waterspouts, and the National Weather Service warned residents to prepare for considerable property damage, saying some locations “may be uninhabitable for weeks.”","Brianna Sugimura loading supplies into her car in Lihue, on the island of Kauai, Hawaii, in preparation for Hurricane Lane, which may hit the archipelago later this week.",2018-08-22T04:06:06Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Hurricane Lane, a Category 4 Storm, Closes In on Hawaii",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/us/hurricane-lane-hawaii.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/22/us/22hawaii_xp/22hawaii_xp-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane,1
RICHARD FAUSSET,"‘We are bracing for a hard hit’ Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina said that the lanes of two major divided highways — Interstate 26 and U.S. 501 — would be reversed to make them one-way, carrying traffic only away from the coast for the mandatory evacuations starting at noon on Tuesday, and that two other routes might also be reversed if needed. Schools and state offices in the lower half of the state will be closed. “We know that this evacuation order I’m issuing is going to be inconvenient for some people,” the governor said. “We do not want to risk one South Carolina life in this hurricane.” In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper asked President Trump on Monday to declare a federal state of emergency for his state. In coastal Dare County, the local emergency management agency announced a mandatory evacuation for all residents and visitors on Hatteras Island, the long, slender barrier island off the North Carolina coast, with a similar order to go into effect Tuesday for the rest of the county. Schools in 17 counties were expected to be closed on Tuesday. “The forecast places North Carolina in the bull’s-eye of Hurricane Florence, and the storm is rapidly getting stronger,” Governor Cooper said. “When weather forecasters tell us ‘life-threatening,’ we know it’s serious. We are bracing for a hard hit.” A double threat, supercharged by climate change Hurricane Florence presents a double threat to the region, said J. Marshall Shepherd, a meteorologist and professor of geography at the University of Georgia. First, the coast faces high winds and storm surge from a powerful direct hit. But farther inland, he added, the probability of severe flooding is high if the storm stalls for several days once it makes landfall, as predicted. “The models are suggesting something very similar to what we saw with Harvey,” Professor Shepherd said, referring to last year’s catastrophic flooding in Houston and elsewhere. “This is another example of a one-two-punch storm,” he said. And although people generally prepare for coastal damage, they may underestimate the flooding threat. Graphic The storm strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane as it continued on a path toward North Carolina and South Carolina, where it could make landfall by the end of the week. “People have a hard time internalizing, preparing for something that’s outside their realm of experience,” he said. But Florence could bring conditions that people have not seen in their lifetimes. “It’s a dire situation that I believe is setting up,” he said. Climate change is leading to more destructive storms in a number of ways, Professor Shepherd noted. “When we have a storm like Florence, it’s certainly going to be shoving higher sea levels onto the coastline,” he said. Although he said he was wary of linking individual storms to climate change, he added that scientific research laid out in authoritative documents like the National Climate Assessment of 2015 state that a warming climate increases the likelihood of “rainier storms,” with an increased risk of flooding. Other scientific research suggests that Florence is part of the trend of storms affected by climate change. A 2014 study in the journal Nature shows a “poleward migration” of intense storms, and further research links climate change to a “wavier” jet stream, which could contribute to weakened steering currents, a phenomenon that kept Hurricane Harvey over Houston and could stall Florence over the Carolinas, as well. Schools and government offices closing Schools were scheduled to close Tuesday in large swaths of North and South Carolina, with many of them set to serve as shelters for people fleeing the hurricane. In South Carolina, Governor McMaster issued an executive order Monday closing all state offices and public schools, including state colleges, universities and technical colleges, in 26 counties threatened by Hurricane Florence. The closings would affect more than 430,000 students in kindergarten through high school, said Ryan Brown, a spokesman for the state education department. Schools on higher ground that have been designated as shelters will be serving food and staffed by the American Red Cross and other relief workers, he said. Although South Carolina schools are experienced at dealing with hurricanes, this one is expected to be the most challenging the state has seen in a long time, Mr. Brown said. “This is the strongest hurricane we’ve had since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. That was a direct hit to Charleston, Category 4.” In North Carolina, schools in 17 eastern counties were expected to close, said Graham H. Wilson, a spokesman for the state’s department of public instruction. Most of those closures were set to begin Tuesday, but some were scheduled for Wednesday, and the timing of others was still to be announced. “We do anticipate more closings, once the path and severity of the storm is more certain,” Mr. Wilson said. Shelves emptied; homes, pets and iconic cows secured People in the Carolinas shared photos on social media of long lines and empty shelves as they shopped for groceries, propane and other storm supplies.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","You might want to turn the sound on. I’m not sure if lizards can experience PTSD, but if they can, I have every reason to believe this science experiment induced it. New research released on Wednesday in Nature chronicled a bizarre experiment involving lizards from Turks and Caicos, a stick, and a leaf blower. The goal? To study how hurricanes influence natural selection, of course. Last year’s brutal hurricane season took a toll on wildlife in the Caribbean, as Hurricanes Irma and Maria rattled ecosystems from the Florida Everglades to Puerto Rico’s rainforest. Researchers are still digging into how wildlife bounced back from the pounding storms, but the new research goes one step further by looking at how the storms may have left an imprint on future generations of lizards in Turks and Caicos. Scientists’ ability to tease this out involved a weird twist of academic fate. An international team of researchers had been conducting studies of populations of Anolis scriptus lizards spread across two islands. They finished their fieldwork four days before Hurricane Irma slammed into their research sites with 165-mph winds. Two weeks later, Maria plowed through the area again with 124-mph winds. That gave scientists a rare opportunity to look at whether the lizards that survived were different, on average, from the pre-storm populations. They found that the lizards who weathered the storm had bigger toepads, longer forelimbs, and shorter back legs. The researchers hypothesize that the first two qualities allowed the lizards to cling for dear life with a stronger grip than their shrimpy-limbed brethren. Meanwhile, the shorter back legs allowed them to be more aerodynamic in the hurricane-force winds, acting like a wind sock rather than a piece of sheet metal. But why just hypothesize when you can test it out, amirite? The researchers took lizards to a lab of horrors to measure what they innocuously called “performance capacity.” In this case, it meant having the lizards do their best Jim Cantore impression by having them cling to a pole while a leaf blower tossed them about in hurricane-force winds (side note: leaf blowers are no joke apparently). Amazingly, the little buggers were able to hang on, even in winds up to 108 mph. While it may look like a lizard version of Saw, the researchers stressed that no lizards were harmed—when they finally lost their grip, they flew into a nice, soft net. All of them were returned to the locations where they had been collected. Even so, there’s no way to measure the psychological trauma potentially experienced by these poor lizards. The findings are the first of their kind to measure natural selection before and after a storm. In a world where climate change is projected to make hurricanes more intense, it could mean lizards are going to have to up their tree-hugging game if they want to survive.","I’m not sure if lizards can experience PTSD, but if they can, I have every reason to believe this science experiment induced it.

FRANCES ROBLES,"“We don’t want to spend the rest of our lives in hotels,” Mr. Santiago said. “We’re not asking FEMA to support us, just to help us until we are more stable. If this has been so hard for me, I can’t imagine what it’s like for the people with little kids or illnesses.” Mr. Santiago moved to Florida in December from Corozal, where his home was destroyed. He is working for a transportation company but not earning enough to afford an apartment. “Every time the deadline approaches, your nerves are shot,” he said. Lawyers for LatinoJustice argued that survivors of past storms had received more help. Hurricane Katrina survivors stayed in hotels for 27 months, Ms. Bannan said. Hurricane Harvey and Irma victims received seven benefit extensions, but Hurricane Maria survivors received just three, the group said. The judge found, however, that those previous storms affected far more people. The governor of Puerto Rico, the judge noted, stopped asking for extensions to the voucher program once a provision under FEMA rules took effect that would have required the government of Puerto Rico to share 10 percent of the housing costs. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. FEMA said there are 1,038 families still receiving Transitional Shelter Assistance across 27 states, with about 400 of them in Puerto Rico. “FEMA is working with its vendor and notifying participating hotels that the TSA program has been extended to comply with the court’s order, said Lenisha Smith, a FEMA spokeswoman. “Beyond that, FEMA will not comment on pending litigation.” Although Judge Hillman found that FEMA’s funding of the housing assistance program was “discretionary” and denied the request for an injunction, he urged the government to find a way to help the families.","After months of temporary reprieves, the judge says temporary housing vouchers for victims of Hurricane Maria staying in hotels can be ended on Sept. 13.",2018-08-31T17:02:34Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Government Can Stop Paying to House Puerto Rico Hurricane Victims, Judge Rules",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/us/puerto-rico-fema-housing.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/31/us/31puerto-print/31puerto-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane,1
JACK HEALY,"Now, mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates are edging higher around Houston, according to real estate and legal aid groups. Many families who suffered damage in the Aug. 25 storm say they are borrowing money from relatives, living off credit cards and falling behind on bills. A survey last month of Harvey survivors found that nearly 25 percent of people who suffered damage or lost income in the storm said they were in worse financial shape today than a year ago. “They were just pouring all the money they had into living,” said Jon-Ross Trevino, a staff attorney with the Foreclosure Prevention Project of Lone Star Legal Aid. “It goes fast.” This time a year ago, Ms. Ford-Amofa, who was 43, was sitting in her sister’s kitchen, dialing and redialing two phones to get through to a rental-car company and FEMA. Her husband, Yaw Amofa, 47, was back at their house, tearing out soaked wallboard with a dull bread knife. The family had fled when floodwaters reached as high as their three children’s chests, ruining the first floor of their home. [ Revisit our coverage of the Amofa family immediately after the storm. ] They had been desperate to start rebuilding.

"Starre Vartan on Earther, shared by Tom McKay to Gizmodo","Thousands of sailors perished in stormy seas throughout the Caribbean in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. Surely they would never have guessed that their terrifying ends would help scientists in the future. But creative researchers have found a link between historic Spanish shipwrecks, hurricanes, and the climate. Their initial research, published last year, takes on added urgency after a devastating hurricane season has sparked conversations about the linkages between powerful storms and climate change. As a story about scientists and shipwrecks should, it all began over pints of grog: In this case, it was beers following a conference of dendrochronologists, scientists who study tree-rings to mine data about the past. Valerie Trouet, a professor at the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona, Grant Harley, now a professor of geography at the University of Idaho, and Marta Domínguez-Delmás, a dendrochronology researcher and archaeologist at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain, were sharing their work on Hotel Congress’ patio in Tucson, Arizona. As they talked, they realized that each had unique pieces knowledge that together, might answer questions about how climate affects hurricanes. “Grant had talked about how he had collected tree ring data from trees in Big Pine Key, Florida and how [their rings showed] a hurricane signal,” Trouet told Earther. “And Marta described how she dived for shipwrecks. As we talked, we realized there’s an interesting link between these things—shipwrecks and tree rings.” That link? Both downed ships and ancient trees could tell the scientists something about the history of hurricanes in the Caribbean—going back over 500 years. This was a pretty big deal, because the official HURDAT hurricane data sets scientists currently work from don’t start until 1850—that’s only 168 years of information. Without a longer period of reliable data, it’s tough for scientists to use that data for what everyone wants—better hurricane predictions. There are proxies that scientists can use to look at hurricane frequency before 1850, but they come from lake and ocean sediments and “they don’t have a data point every year,” said Trouet. “The best you can say is how many hurricanes there were in a century.” That’s why, when Domínguez-Delmás shared details about the Caribbean shipwreck data with Trouet and Harley, they were so interested. Before modern forecasting, ships by the hundreds were lost to hurricanes, and the worse the storm, the more lives and cargo ended up at the bottom of the Atlantic. So shipwreck data could be directly linked to powerful storms. Some of these lost ships are really old—the records go back to 1495—and the records are pretty reliable. Investors wanted to know what happened to ships carrying their cargo, so they kept close tabs. Plus, the sailors and other crew aboard lost voyages were someone’s family. With lots of help from undergrad and graduate students, the scientists went through over 3,000 shipwrecks collected in the book Shipwrecks of the Americas, by Robert Marx. They wound up looking only at Spanish ships, since they were the first country to do the voyage across the Atlantic and therefore had the longest record, as well as some of the most reliable record-keeping. “We looked only at ships in the Caribbean region, that wrecked during hurricane season and then excluded those that were wrecked for other reasons—war, pirates, etc,” said Trouet. They were left with 657 hurricane-attributable wrecks between 1495 and 1825, with peaks and valleys indicating times when more or fewer ships were lost. But in order for all this data to be useful for understanding what causes hurricane season to be active or mellow, the scientists needed a continuous data set. The shipwreck details only went through 1825 and the HURDAT set didn’t start until 1851—they didn’t overlap. That’s where tree-ring data came in. Harley had been taking samples from slash pine trees on Big Pine Key in Florida, some of which were hundreds of years old. He already knew that the growth of these trees, which dendrochronologists can see in the spacing between consecutive rings, isn’t affected by much—not rainfall or temperature fluctuations. However, their growth is suppressed for two reasons: sunlight (the trees shut down growth during mid-November to January each year), and hurricanes. First, Harley compared the more recent rings from the tree with the record of hurricanes in the more recent HURDAT set. The two datasets matched, showing the tree rings were a good proxy, which he could then use to extrapolate back in time. The three scientists now had a continuous record, from 1495 onward, that told a story about when hurricanes occurred. What the record showed was that during a period of decreased solar activity from 1645-1715, called the Maunder Minimum, shipwrecks—and hurricanes—were less frequent. “Climate dynamically it makes sense,” said Trouet. “Your waters need to be a certain temperature in order for hurricanes to happen in the first place—that’s why there is a hurricane season.” Since tropical storms are born from warmer waters, cooler sea-surface temperatures meant fewer hurricanes. The Maunder Minimum is of special interest to climate scientists because it was part of a larger cold period called the Little Ice Age, which altered weather patterns throughout Europe. This 500+ years of data can now be added to climate models to help predict what circumstances will cause devastating hurricanes: Trouet, who works with climate modellers, said that the more specific and detailed the data from the past, the more useful the model. “Now that we know that there were fewer hurricanes during the Maunder Minimum, we can run the models back into the past,” said Trouet. The models that correctly predict the past can then be run forwards to predict what’s coming, and “are more reliable” for the additional detailed information. While hurricanes are difficult to predict, educated guesses can be made: As global temperatures increase due to climate change, “We can guess that hurricanes will become more intense, but maybe not more frequent,” Harley said. That’s in line with the conclusions of recent National Climate Assessment, which stresses there is still a great deal of uncertainty in how climate change will impact hurricanes. The 2017 hurricane season was a stark reminder of why understanding that linkage is really important. Harley and Trouet plan to keep plumbing records of the past to shed light on our future climate. They hope to use additional tree-ring data to understand how these historic temperature changes impacted ocean currents—which could have in turn kicked off the Little Ice Age. One of the wonderful parts about being human is that while we can’t physically travel through time, we can use our ancestors’ lives to inform our own—and maybe predict the future. And it’s heartening to think that maybe all those unlucky sailors whose ships wrecked in Caribbean hurricanes didn’t die for nothing. As a kid, Starre Vartan argued with her teachers that both science and art were creative endeavors; after 15 years as a science and environment reporter and creative writer, she still thinks that’s true.","Thousands of sailors perished in stormy seas throughout the Caribbean in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries.

They lived near a bayou, he said, which they feared would overflow with the storm surge. But they were still on the fence about leaving. The plan was to keep waiting and watching the news. If by Wednesday morning Michael still looked like it was going to slam straight into Panama City, then maybe they, too, would head to Dothan to bunk with relatives. As he waited to buy a 20-pound bag of ice, Mike Sanville, 64, puffed on a cigarette and said that he was also going to try to ride the storm out in Fountain, in the small house he shares with two other men.

No crab eaters at Dirty Dicks Crab Shack. No putters on the towns elaborate fantasias of novelty golf. One of the few places still open was a bar called Foghorns, a strip-mall bar a couple of blocks inland. On Tuesday afternoon, drinks were flowing, pool was being shot and somebody had put Rock You Like a Hurricane on the digital jukebox. Bill York, the owner, had already boarded up his house, but he saw no reason to close up Foghorns if landfall was not until Wednesday. That left a lot of downtime, he said, for locals who werent going anywhere: Some people got nowhere to go and nothing to do.","Workers in Panama City Beach, Fla., prepared on Tuesday for Hurricane Michael, which is expected to make landfall as a Category 3 storm in the area on Wednesday.",2018-10-09T23:22:37Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Strengthening to Category 3, Hurricane Michael Aims at Florida",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/us/hurricane-michael-florida.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/10/us/10michael/10michael-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane,1
Mark Kaufman,"Hurricane Michael has matured, developed an eye, and is gathering strength as it churns on a direct path towards the Florida Panhandle. National Hurricane Center scientists expect the storm to strike land on Wednesday as a major storm, with winds greater than 110 mph, making it at least a Category 3 hurricane. There's now almost nothing holding back the storm from further intensification as it approaches land, bringing not just destructive winds but perilous surges of ocean water into the Florida and Alabama coasts. ""Hurricane Michael is primed for additional strengthening prior to landfall because the key players in the atmosphere and ocean are all conducive for it,"" Brian McNoldy, a storm researcher at University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said over email. One of these key players is wind shear, which are winds that hit hurricanes at their sides and weaken, or sometimes kill, the tempests. Without these winds, there's little threatening Michael's stable, cyclone-like form. ""That helps the storm remain intact, upright, and symmetric,"" said McNoldy. By fall, these hurricane-threatening winds often pick up in the Gulf, Falko Judt, a research meteorologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said in an interview. But not this year. ""This is unusual,"" noted Judt. SEE ALSO: An appreciation of the persistently grim tweets from the Norway Ice Service A second influential factor is the warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricanes feed off of the bath-like temperatures of sea surface waters. Without these warm waters, they couldn't even form, nor sustain themselves. And in the Gulf right now, even as the waters begin to gradually cool as fall sets in, they're still plenty warm. ""It's always warm there,"" said Judt. Lastly, there are no masses of dry air in the lower or middle portions of the atmosphere where Hurricane Michael is headed, said McNoldy. A hurricane's thunderstorms need moisture to fuel their activity, but when storms suck up dry air, they threaten to ""wrap into the circulation and choke off the thunderstorm activity,"" said McNoldy. But Michael has mostly moist air ahead. Water levels will rise well in advance of the arrival of #Michael. It's essential that residents within the storm surge warning area finish preparations to protect life and property today. pic.twitter.com/0Xz3nNkAnr NHC_Surge (@NHC_Surge) October 9, 2018 The storm poses a particularly severe threat to the Florida coast places like Panama City and Apalachicola as well as inland Tallahassee, because the storm is not expected to weaken much as it approaches land. ""Usually they weaken before they hit land,"" said Judt. ""The models are predicting this will not weaken before landfall, which would be very unusual."" The question of why storms typically weaken as they approach land ""is still an open science question,"" noted Judt. Some scientists have proposed drier air from nearby land can temper the storms. But as of Tuesday, any such weakening isn't in the cards for Michael. If Michael follows its expected course, it will become just the fourth major hurricane to hit the Florida panhandle since 1950.","Hurricane Michael has matured, developed an eye, and is gathering strength as it churns on a direct path towards the Florida Panhandle.

SHERI FINK,"Gary Watts, the coroner of Richland County, S.C., said it was his impression that the state wants it to be directly related, like someone gets hit by a fallen tree and someones vehicle runs off the road and they drown. And so he did not relate Hurricane Florence to several deaths of evacuees from hospices or hospitals where, he said, it was just a matter of the stress, I believe, the added stress probably hastening the deaths. In North Carolina, Dr. Carl Barr, the longtime medical examiner of Sampson County, had a similar understanding of the kinds of deaths his state wanted on the official list. When Dr. Barr discussed several deaths, including a suicide, with an associate chief medical examiner, he came away believing that by the C.D.C. definition these were hurricane-related, but by our own state medical examiner definition, they were not related to the hurricane. The state official, Dr. Craig Nelson, said that was incorrect. He said North Carolina was attempting to apply the C.D.C. guidance, particularly by considering a wider range of indirect deaths, like the worsening of a chronic illness, in the official count. Now the C.D.C. guidelines say those deaths should be considered disaster-related, Dr. Nelson said, adding that the Florence count was still ongoing. There is always potential for additional information to come in. But only on Tuesday, after being contacted by a reporter, did Dr. Nelson send the C.D.C. guide to the states medical examiners, part of a note urging them to report deaths that might result from Hurricane Michael. These notifications are critical in tracking storm-related deaths, and no statewide system exists to track them otherwise, he wrote. A spreadsheet of Hurricane Florence-related deaths provided by North Carolinas health department listed only one of 41 deaths from that storm as indirect. In an interview on Tuesday, Dr. Nelson was unaware that a crucial aspect of the C.D.C. guidance is to make note of the storm on the death certificate, even if it is only a contributor to a natural death. That has not been something we have done for the death certificates, Dr. Nelson said. He added that it was unnecessary, because even if death certificates did not mention the disaster, the deaths could still be included in the official state count. It has been better to try and maintain a central database of deaths related to the storm rather than rely on individual reporting on death certificates, he said.","Rainfall from Hurricane Florence flooded neighborhoods in Burgaw, N.C.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by AJ Dellinger to Gizmodo","We’re 10 days out from the 2018 hurricane season, but if a new NASA-led aerial survey is any indicator, Puerto Rico’s forests and wetlands still have a long way to go before they’ve recovered from the last one. In April, a NASA science plane flew across a vast swath of Puerto Rico’s ecosystems, from tropical rainforests in the northeast to dry forests in the southwest. A follow-on to a similar mission conducted last spring, the goal was initially to track long-term forest regrowth after land abandonment. Hurricane Maria changed all that. Instead of focusing on land use change, the research flights—whose G-LiHT instrument system included LiDAR and more—became the first large-scale, multi-sensor aerial survey of the island after the Category 4 storm that struck last September. They survey’s 65,000+ high-resolution images, released online this week, reveal that Puerto Rico’s unique ecosystems are still hurting in a big way. 1 / 6 “Every forest type we observed has clear signs of damage from the hurricane,” Doug Morton, an earth scientist at NASA’s Goddard Spaceflight Center who participated in the new surveys, told Earther. In a normal year, Morton said, they’d expect about one percent of the forest canopy to have been damaged by windstorms and other natural causes. This year, about 50 percent of the canopy was damaged across much of the 3,000 kilometers of flight lines surveyed. That means a lot more light and heat reaching the forest floor, which, combined with all the foliage blown off trees by the storm, equates to a pulse of energy and nutrients that will help ecosystems recover. “It’s pretty much prime growing conditions,” Morton said, noting that despite the lingering damage, vegetation is clearly bouncing back in many areas. Some spots are taking longer than others, though. The mangrove swamps in the northeast, home to one of Puerto Rico’s famed bioluminescent bays, still seemed incredibly damaged seven months after Maria. “The photos are powerful. [They’re] powerful reminders of the extent of damage.” Part of the goal of the survey was to suss out winners and losers among the vegetation, and learn which ecosystems are most resilient across the island. To that end, the researchers plan to compare notes with various field research groups on the ground in Puerto Rico. Another goal is to offer high-quality aerial imagery and data that will be helpful to land managers involved in the island’s ongoing recovery process. Morton noted that the survey’s LiDAR data, which provides a 3-D look at the forest canopy, can be used to make quantitative estimates of the loss of trees and soil that can help guide planning and recovery. On a more basic level, the survey offers a potent reminder that for the island of Puerto Rico and the American citizens who call it home, the disaster of Hurricane Maria is far from over. “The photos are powerful,” Morton said. “[They’re] powerful reminders of the extent of damage.”","We’re 10 days out from the 2018 hurricane season, but if a new NASA-led aerial survey is any indicator, Puerto Rico’s forests and wetlands still have a long way to go before they’ve recovered from the last one.

REMY TUMIN,"Every fall, the list of pumpkin pie-flavored foods grows longer and weirder. This year, Starbucks didn’t even wait for September to bring out its wildly popular pumpkin spice latte. It’s been on sale since Aug. 28, much to the delight of #PSL lovers everywhere. Now in its 15th year on the market, this frothy beverage helped unleash the pumpkin spice deluge, which shows no signs of ever ebbing. So you may well wonder: What is pumpkin spice, anyway? Originally marketed by the U.S. spice giant McCormick in the 1950s as a convenient way to season pumpkin pie, the mix consists of ground cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and allspice. Other blends may also include clove, cardamom and mace. Tasted together, the spices evoke the heady fragrance of a freshly baked pie and trigger other cozy, autumnal associations — chunky knit sweaters, colorful fallen leaves, hot apple cider. What the mix doesn’t taste like, however, is pumpkin. Because pumpkin spice mix contains none.

Queen Elizabeth II celebrates 25 years on the throne. Apple, founded a year earlier, becomes an incorporated company. It is 1977.

Credit Leemage/Corbis, via Getty Images Such executions were introduced in France in the late 1780s, by King Louis XVI, and were thought to provide quicker, more humane deaths. (Paradoxically, he was guillotined himself.) Nearly 200 years later, France was one of few Western European countries with capital punishment. Polls showed that 61 percent of the population still supported the guillotine, and Michel Sardou, one of France’s most popular singers, released the song “Je Suis Pour” (“I Am in Favor”) in 1976 supporting the death penalty.","The fall of Leslie Moonves was another stark reminder of how male-dominated the entertainment and news industries remain, especially in their upper ranks.",2018-09-10T09:47:04Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}","Your Monday News Briefing: Les Moonves, Serena Williams, Hurricane Florence",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/briefing/monday-news-briefing.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/10/world/10USBriefing-amcore/10USBriefing-Moonves-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane,1

Justin Ray Parker, a guest at Shores of Panama captured the little rampaging waterspout on their smartphone, even the moment when a pool float is tossed into the air. The storm, while projected to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to areas in Florida and some Gulf Coast states through Wednesday, will not become a hurricane, according to NOAA — in fact, it has already been downgraded to a subtropical depression.

Jennings Brown,"No one should ever screw around on a public alert system. But considering it’s been a bad year for warning systems—from the Hawaii false emergency alert accidentally informing the public of an incoming missile that didn’t exist to the National Weather Service’s false tsunami warning to the Department of Justice’s Amber Alert site issues that redirected visitors to porn sites —now is an especially bad time for someone to be screwing around on an alert system. But that may have been what happened when the City of Lake Worth, Florida, sent out a “zombie alert” during a power outage around 1:45am Sunday. “There are now far less than seven-thousand-three-hundred-eighty customers involved due to extreme zombie activity,” the alert states. (Get it? There are fewer customers because many are zombies now!) The message said the alert was for “residents of Lake Worth and Terminus.” Since Terminus is a location in The Walking Dead, it seems likely this message was sent out as a joke or was the result of a hack. The city public information officer, Ben Kerr, told Gizmodo this has been a reoccurring issue. “We first became aware of the zombie messages during Hurricane Irma,” Kerr told Gizmodo. He doesn’t know when the culprit got into the system and changed the messages, but the city noticed during the August 2017 hurricane because many (zombie-tainted) outage alerts were going out. At the time, the city was able to attend to the message issues before the public noticed. Lake Worth’s electric utility system is set up to send out automatic alerts when there’s an outage. The system has thousands of pre-programmed messages, Kerr explained. But it seems that at some point someone went through and messed with some of the messages to turn them into zombie jokes. “The actual power systems were not in any way compromised. This is a separate messaging system that at some point has been compromised,” Kerr said. “They just added a zombie fantasy.” Kerr says the city has is investigating the prank, and has finally scrubbed all the zombie messages from the system. “Hopefully the next time there is a zombie invasion alert,” Kerr said, “it will be a real zombie invasion.” [ Palm Beach Post / Lake Worth Live ]",No one should ever screw around on a public alert system.

Miriam Kramer,"We all know about Jupiter's Great Red Spot, the extreme, Earth-sized storm that's been swirling on the huge planet for decades. But what about the world's other, less well known tempests? A series of studies published in the journal Nature this week reveal new discoveries about the way that Jupiter's atmosphere functions and the storms that swirl within it. In particular, one of the studies details the nature of the cyclones spinning in the clouds of Jupiter's north and south poles. SEE ALSO: This is what Jupiter sounds like In the planet's north pole, one large cyclone is surrounded by eight other polar cyclones, and a large south polar cyclone is encircled by five cyclones, according to the new study produced using data from NASA's Jupiter-exploring Juno probe. A computer-generated image showing Jupiter's south pole. Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/ASI/INAF/JIRAM ""Prior to Juno we did not know what the weather was like near Jupiter's poles. Now, we have been able to observe the polar weather up-close every two months,"" Alberto Adriani, Juno co-investigator, and lead author of the cyclone study, said in a statement. ""Each one of the northern cyclones is almost as wide as the distance between Naples, Italy and New York City — and the southern ones are even larger than that. They have very violent winds, reaching, in some cases, speeds as great as 220 mph (350 kph). Finally, and perhaps most remarkably, they are very close together and enduring. There is nothing else like it that we know of in the solar system."" That's for sure. Jupiter's storms are complex beasts that defy explanation at this point. The dynamics of the storms in the south and north poles of the world are mysterious, and scientists aren't sure how they formed or how they have persisted. Even Saturn's storms aren't a good proxy for the dynamics at play on Jupiter. Saturn actually has one hexagon-shaped storm at each pole, so why does Jupiter have more than one and why don't they merge together? It's also odd that the cyclones at the north and south pole on Jupiter aren't the same. ""The Juno observations so far provide concrete evidence that the Jovian poles display multitudes of structure at its poles, but that structure is not identical at both poles, even though the stability and structures have remained stable over 11-months,"" planetary scientist Padma Yanamandra-Fisher, who wasn't an author on the new study, said via email. ""How? Why? These are questions that will engage Jovian researchers for years to come."" In general, storms on Jupiter are pretty badass. A storm called the North North Temperate Little Red Spot 1 is 3,700 miles across. Yes, a storm that's over 3,000 miles across — which is roughly the distance from California to New York — is considered ""little"" on Jupiter. The huge planet's storms can also swirl for years and years because Jupiter, unlike Earth, doesn't have any continents that would break up airflow feeding these tempests.","We all know about Jupiter's Great Red Spot, the extreme, Earth-sized storm that's been swirling on the huge planet for decades.

PATRICIA MAZZEI,"“The limitation we had with Maria is we had no cash to burn,” said the governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló. Emergency managers and business leaders also are concerned about the logistics of getting aid into Puerto Rico. Maria created a bottleneck at the Port of San Juan, which slowed everything from food to electrical poles. “What am I most worried about?” Mr. Byrne said. “A ship sinks in the channel in San Juan, and we can’t bring anything.” Manuel Reyes Alfonso, executive vice president of MIDA, the island’s food industry association, said wholesale and retail businesses continued to experience delays in receiving cargo. “We are not where we’d like to be, or where we should be,” he said. He worries about a trucker shortage and about slow fuel delivery for generators. Puerto Rico had fuel after Maria, but no easy way to get it to people, leading to endless lines at gas stations and a black market for diesel sales. FEMA had to bring in a fuel barge for its operations. Food could also be scarce again, Mr. Reyes said, because Puerto Rico continues to impose a tax on inventories. Eliminating the tax could increase food stores to an average of 37 days from 26, according to a survey that the food association conducted of its members in February. A legislative effort to do away with the tax has stalled, Mr. Reyes said, in part because lawmakers have yet to figure out how to make up for the lost revenue. Photo Puerto Rico officials worry that the island remains vulnerable to another storm because repairs to the power grid have been slow in some areas, including Las Piedras. Credit Erika P. Rodriguez for The New York Times Rodrigo Masses, president of the Puerto Rico Manufacturers Association, said he had advised businesses to double their fuel storage capacity, keep their generators in shape and designate an emergency contact off the island to relay information in the event cellphone service fails again. “We’re still not out of the crisis. If we’re hit by another hurricane like this one, we’re going to lose power again. We’re going to lose connectivity again,” he warned. “But the private sector is going to be much better prepared.” Once the Corps of Engineers departs, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa, will be tasked with completing unfinished repairs to the power grid. At a hearing last week of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in Washington, lawmakers sounded skeptical that Prepa, which has come under fierce scrutiny over its early response to the storm, is up to the job. Representative González-Colón has asked FEMA to extend the Corps’ stay. “We sure want to know that you really are ready,” Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told Prepa’s new chief, Walter Higgins, at the hearing. “We feel that we are ready,” Mr. Higgins said. But, he added, “I don’t doubt that we will have some growing pains.” In Las Piedras, which sits on the hills south of El Yunque National Forest, people who have electricity say it goes out often. “If a little bit of wind blows through, we will lose power,” said Roberto Rosado, 53, who still has metal shutters on his sliding doors. “We just lost power now. This is an everyday occurrence.” Mayor Miguel López, who is known as Micky, recently blocked two of the three power crews from leaving his town. “There was no other option,” said Mr. López, whose unorthodox strategy succeeded in keeping the linemen at work. His director of emergency management, Xavier Muñoz, said the one upside of Maria was that it had scared residents into taking hurricane plans seriously. “Shelters are going to get full,” he predicted. “I have 220 cots right now, and I think that’s not going to be enough.” Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.

Andrew Freedman,"New documents released online and published by a Dutch news website reveal that, like ExxonMobil Corp., Shell Oil also knew the truth about global warming at least 30 years ago, but continued to dig up and sell more oil and gas anyway. Although the company is now investing more heavily in renewable energy compared to other oil majors, such as Exxon, it continues to sell fossil fuels worldwide, which, when burned to create energy, are the main cause of global warming and its related hazards, such as extreme weather events and sea level rise. SEE ALSO: The feds are afraid of 21 teens suing on climate. An appeals court wants to know why. The documents, posted online at the Climate Files website and the Climate Investigations Center, show that Shell researchers were remarkably prescient about how global warming would play out, and the eventual legal ramifications for oil companies given the warnings. Remarkably, one of the Shell reports – published in 1998 – gamed out a scenario in which, in the year 2010, ""...Violent storms causes extensive damage to the eastern coast of the U.S."" The report was off by just two years. This scenario essentially projected Superstorm Sandy, which occurred in 2012 and devastated the New Jersey shore while also putting lower Manhattan under water. That storm helped prompt a new wave of climate activism in the U.S. that has continued to build. The Shell petroleum refinery on Bukom Island off Singapore. Image: AFP/Getty Images Describing the ramifications of such extreme weather events, the report states: ""Although it is not clear whether the storms are caused by climate change, people are not willing to take further chances,"" the report states. ""The insurance industry refuses to accept liability, setting off a fierce debate over who is liable: the insurance industry, or the government. After all, two successive IPCC reports since 1995 have reinforced the human connection to climate change."" The 1998 report envisioned class action lawsuits filed after these storms against the government and fossil fuel companies, because these entities ignored what scientists ""(including their own) have been saying for years: that something must be done."" Right now, in fact, the fossil fuel industry is facing a rising tide of lawsuits stemming from their role in contributing to climate change. These include a novel lawsuit brought by a group of young Americans against oil companies and the federal government for failing to act on climate change, which is set to go to trial in the coming months. The cities of San Francisco and Oakland, among others, are seeking financial compensation from major oil companies like Chevron for damage from sea level rise. And Exxon is under investigation from the attorneys general of Massachusetts and New York for misleading their shareholders and the public about climate change. Many of these cases are known by the hashtag #ExxonKnew, based on documents showing what Exxon executives were told about climate science. It's likely that these newly revealed Shell documents will show up in some of these court cases, because they show that Shell was aware of the risks of climate change but didn't change its business practices accordingly. Activists have seized on the Shell documents as evidence that the oil industry writ large is guilty of studying climate science and then continuing to contribute to the problem, while in some cases misleading the public about the science during the process.

Instead they appear to have chosen the path of hedging, minimizing, and diverting—and given the stakes, this was both tragic and immoral. Shell knew. And now we do too,” said Bill McKibben, a co-founder of the environmental group 350.org. Precise calculations made in 1986 Another newly-revealed Shell climate document that's likely to play a role in ongoing court cases dates back to 1986, in which company researchers went so far as to quantify the company's own contribution to global emissions of greenhouse gases. Shell researchers calculated it as 4 percent of the world total emissions of carbon dioxide, the main long-lived greenhouse gas, at the time. That same report showed that the company had been producing climate change reports via a working group since at least 1981. The 1986 document included clear warnings about what Shell, and the world at large, would face from continued burning of fossil fuels. The report indicates that Shell was on board with what mainstream climate scientists have concluded, but members of the Trump administration disagree with — that fossil fuel burning is causing climate change. ""Although CO2 is emitted to the atmosphere through several natural processes… the main cause of increasing CO2 concentrations is considered to be fossil fuel burning,"" the report found. It repeatedly notes that public opinion could turn against fossil fuel companies for contributing to global warming: ""The changes in climate being considered here, are at an unaccustomed distance in time for future planning, even beyond the lifetime of most of the present decision makers but not beyond intimate (family) association,"" the report said. ""The changes may be the greatest in recorded history. They could alter the environment in such a way that habitability would become more suitable in the one area and less suitable in the other area. Adaptation, migration and replacement could be called for. All of these actions will be costly and uncertain, but could be made acceptable."" The report details many of the climate change impacts we're dealing with today, including sea level rise, ocean acidification, and extreme weather events. A flooded street in Hoboken, New Jersey on October 30,2012. Image: Corbis via Getty Images Interestingly, the 1986 report advised Shell to take action on climate change early, since by the time clearly recognizable effects would be occurring, it will be ""too late"" to prevent damage. “With very long time scales involved, it would be tempting for society to wait until then to begin doing anything,"" the report found. ""The potential implications for the world are, however, so large, that policy options need to be considered much earlier. And the energy industry needs to consider how it should play its part.” Richard Wiles, executive director of the Center for Climate Integrity, said the documents put Shell — which has been investing more aggressively in renewables compared to Exxon — in the same category as the Texas-based oil and gas giant, when it comes to studying climate change and then ignoring its own findings. ""Shell, like Exxon, understood 30 years ago that failing to act on climate change could cause irreversible damage to our planet. And like Exxon, Shell chose not to act,"" Wiles said in a statement. ""The documents eerily predict the extreme weather disasters and court battles over liability that we are seeing today."" Mashable has reached out to Shell for comment and will update the story when we hear back.","New documents released online and published by a Dutch news website reveal that, like ExxonMobil Corp., Shell Oil also knew the truth about global warming at least 30 years ago, but continued to dig up and sell more oil and gas anyway.

Sports, elections, catastrophes and celebrities typically dominate these lists, and the year behind us was no different. There is one notable change compared to years past, however: Tech-related topics didn't make any of the lists. SEE ALSO: Fortnite and Stormy Daniels dominated Pornhub in 2018 World Cup aside, the global top list of searches is dominated by a heartbreakingly long list of celebrities who died in 2018: Avicii, Mac Miller, Stan Lee, Anthony Bourdain, XXXTentacion, Stephen Hawking and Kate Spade are all in the top ten. Black Panther and Meghan Markle (who also tops Google's ""People"" list this year) round up the list. When it comes to news, Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Michael were popular search topics, as was the Royal Wedding, Mega Millions lottery results, and election results, both in the U.S. and in other countries, such as Pakistan. Despite all the tragic events that happened this year, in a blog post accompanying the lists, Data Editor at Google News Lab Simon Rogers highlighted an interesting trend: People were searching for ""good"" more than ever. The absence of tech in both the general searches and news searches list is notable though mostly for Apple, whose phones are typically very popular search topics.

https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews,"Image copyright AFP Image caption Forecasters say the hurricane will certainly hit the US coastline Evacuations have been ordered as the US East Coast braces for Hurricane Florence - in what may be the strongest storm to hit the region in two decades. South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia have declared states of emergency, and residents are stocking up on essential supplies. Officials say Florence is now a category three storm with 115mph (183km/h) winds, and gaining strength. It is expected to strike the Carolinas by Thursday. Florence - which was 1,200 miles (2,000km) southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina, on Monday morning - could reach category four as its draws strength from the warm Atlantic waters, say forecasters. It would be the first category three storm to hit the region since Fran ravaged North Carolina 1996. It would be the first East Coast hurricane since Jeanne struck Florida in 2004. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) says Florence may bring catastrophic levels of rain and flooding to coastal and inland regions. The National Weather Service warned it may be ""an extremely dangerous major hurricane"" by the time it made landfall. Image copyright Reuters Image caption International Space Station by astronaut Ricky Arnold took this photo of Florence on 6 September The Miami-based NHC said: ""There is an increasing risk of life-threatening impacts from Florence: storm surge at the coast, freshwater flooding from a prolonged and exceptionally heavy rainfall event inland, and damaging hurricane-force winds."" The agency called Florence an ""extremely dangerous"" weather event. ""Somebody is going to suffer devastating damage if this storm continues as it is currently forecast,"" National Weather Service meteorologist Dan Miller told The State newspape r in South Carolina. States of emergency North Carolina officials on Monday ordered residents to evacuate the state's Outer Banks barrier islands. There have been long queues in supermarkets around communities near waterways and coastlines as residents clear shelves of water, batteries and plywood. South Carolina's state emergency management agency said on Sunday that it is ""preparing for the possibility of a large-scale disaster"". Image copyright NOAA Image caption A government satellite image shows the storm's location on Sunday ""Pretend, assume, presume that a major hurricane is going to hit right smack dab in the middle of South Carolina and is going to go way inshore,"" said South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. In North Carolina, Governor Roy Cooper waived agricultural transportation restrictions in order to allow farmers to move goods more quickly. ""During harvest, time is of the essence. Action today can avoid losses due to Florence."" Red flag warnings are keeping swimmers off beaches, as residents sandbag their homes in the communities of Myrtle Beach in South Carolina, and the Outer Banks in North Carolina. ""Literally, they are filling buggies full of water, shopping carts full of water,"" Ryan Deeck, grocery department manager at a Walmart, told The Sun News in Myrtle Beach. Naval preparations Naval Station Norfolk, the largest naval installation in the world, is preparing to send ships away from bases to weather the storm out at sea. Two other hurricanes are currently churning in the Atlantic Ocean. Hurricanes Isaac and Helene are expected to accelerate over the next several hours, but at this point, are not expected to threaten the US mainland. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms. This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land. These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!"" Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia.

Mark Kaufman,"Hurricanes and typhoons — the monstrous, destructive storms that bring extreme wind and rain to coasts around the world — are slowing their pace as they traverse the globe. After assessing every tropical cyclone on record between 1949 and 2016, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientist James Kossin found that the storms have slowed down in every ocean, save the Northern Indian. This research, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, concluded these storms are now moving about 10 percent slower on average than they did in the past, though regional speeds in specific oceans vary. SEE ALSO: Hurricane damage could triple in the U.S. if global warming goes unchecked At first blush, 10 percent might sound like a relatively small percentage, but in reality, it's a big deal, said Kossin, in an interview. A storm that sits still over one place for an extended period of time brings that much more wind and rain to that area. ""Nothing good can come of a slower storm,"" said Kossin. Hurricane Harvey on August 25, 2017, when it reached maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. Image: nOaa Hurricanes already bring a number of well-known hazards — flooding, pummeling winds, and surging seas — all which can prove fatal and wreak havoc on infrastructure. In a May 2018 report, NOAA said last year's Hurricane Harvey, which stalled over Houston, was responsible for the direct deaths of at least 68 Americans. ""It's safe to say you want them [hurricanes] to get out of your neighborhood as quickly as possible,"" said Kossin. Hurricane Harvey may have been exceptional — breaking rainfall records while dumping over four feet of rain onto Houston — but any cyclone can wreak havoc if slowed or stalled. ""Sitting still for two days is a big deal,"" Hugh Willoughby, a hurricane researcher at Florida International University who had no role in the study, said in an interview. Willoughby noted that there's another culprit at play here, too. With every 1 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit) rise in global temperature, the atmosphere becomes capable of holding 7 percent more water vapor, which provides fuel for heavier downpours. A Houston resident paddles through his home following Hurricane Harvey. Image: John Glaser/CSM/REX/Shutterstock ""This research gives a pretty good picture of what we should expect in the future,"" said Willoughby. ""The threat to the U.S. is from flooding."" Atmospheric scientists, like Kossin, have a pretty good idea about why these storms are slowing down as well. Warming global temperatures, especially the accelerated heating of the Arctic, are disrupting the way air travels through the atmosphere. One of these changes amount to a weakening circulation of tropical air, particularly during the summer. These winds, and others, are hugely influential as they push major storms around ""a bit like a cork in a stream,"" said Kossin. ""It makes physical sense that they should be slowing down,"" said Willoughby, adding that there's still not quite enough historical storm data to say for certain that the storms have slowed as much as the new study shows. ""Stuff happened out in the ocean before 1950 that we didn’t know about,"" said Willoughby. Today, NOAA has a sophisticated group of weather-tracking satellites, so in the coming years scientists' grasp of storm trends will only improve. But at the same time, global temperatures will almost certainly increase, perhaps by 6 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century if the global community fails to rein in carbon emissions. Image: noaa Damage to U.S. communities and coastlines from future hurricanes are expected to hit the U.S. economy quite hard. Research published in the journal Environmental Research Letters found that future storms — enhanced by rising seas and carrying more water — could bring three times the amount of economic damage than infrastructure-pummeling tempests do today. Over the nearly 70 years of hurricane data Kossin analyzed, the planet warmed by half a degree Celsius (about 1 degree Fahrenheit) on average, but it's unknown what will happen with another degree of warming or more, said Kossin. There could be more than a 10 percent drop in storm speed — or perhaps less. What is known, however, is that while deaths from surging stormwaters on U.S. coastlines have gone down over the decades, inland flooding has become a substantially higher risk for death, said Kossin. People generally don't evacuate from these places during hurricanes, said Kossin. ""That's a scary idea,"" he said.","Hurricanes and typhoons — the monstrous, destructive storms that bring extreme wind and rain to coasts around the world — are slowing their pace as they traverse the globe.

"Maddie Stone on Earther, shared by Harrison Weber to Gizmodo","The East Coast is bracing for another nor’easter this week, with the National Weather Service in Boston warning that the city and nearby coastlines could see three to four feet of storm surge flooding. This, in the same winter that the bomb cyclone turned many of Boston’s streets into frozen soup. Parts of the Northeast are getting hammered by frigid temperatures right now, just 24 hours after a … Read more Read Is it the latest sign of the end times? Not really. Winter storms like nor’easters, it turns out, routinely deliver worse flooding than hurricanes to this part of the world, a reality confirmed by a study published earlier this year, the Washington Post ’s Capital Weather Gang noted today. Why’s that, you might ask? The reason has everything to do with the difference in how nor’easters and hurricanes form—a difference that allows nor’easters to maintain hurricane-like central pressures and rip-roaring winds at latitudes where their tropical cousins typically fizzle out. “By the time a hurricane gets off New England, it’s over very cold water and starts to decay,” Jeff Masters, meteorologist and blogger with Weather Underground, told Earther. Hurricanes get their strength from oceanic heat, forming in warm equatorial regions where there’s plenty of evaporating water to condense into storm clouds. Nor’easters get their energy from an entirely different source: as Masters put it, the contrast in density between warm, moist air from the ocean and cold, dry air from the land. When these contrasting air masses collide, the cold dry air sinks, and releases energy. The technical term for the atmospheric set-up that drives the formation of a nor’easter is ‘ baroclinic instability.’ Unlike hurricanes, which form and thrive in tropical waters and feature a warm core, nor’easters form at mid-latitudes, and their cores are cold. Because they don’t rely on ocean heat for their energy, they can maintain hurricane-like central pressures and wind strengths at latitudes where hurricanes struggle to. This can lead to some very bad flooding. “Occasionally you get a strong hurricane up there [in the northeast], but they’re pretty uncommon,” Masters said. “It’s the big ‘nor’easters that dominate the record storm surge,” for the region. Models are calling for this week’s nor’easter to deliver damaging winds, heavy rain, and snowfall to the Eastern seaboard beginning on Thursday night, although the storm’s exact track remains uncertain, the Weather Channel reports. A coastal flood watch is in effect from Friday morning through Saturday afternoon for eastern Massachusetts, with the NWS warning that “moderate to major” coastal flooding that could inundate roads and basements and tear up beaches. Coastal flood watches are also in effect for much of Delaware and New Jersey, and parts of Queens and Long Island. Exacerbating the flood risk is the fact that this storm is due to coincide with the astronomical high tide—the full moon rises tomorrow. When the Sun, Moon and Earth are perfectly aligned, the gravitational tug-of-war causes the most extreme tides of the month. The coastal flood risk is expected to persist over three high tide cycles, thanks to the long-lived nature of this storm. “All three tides are expected to be in the top ten on record [for Boston], maybe in the top five,” Masters said said. Lastly, just in case you thought we were going to get through an entire weather post without mentioning climate change, you should know that for nor’easters as for hurricanes, sea level rise is adding inches to storm surge and making the coastal flooding threat worse. A recent study in Nature found that sea levels along the northern half of the Eastern seaboard have risen about an inch per decade since 1980, three to four times the global average rate. “That makes it a lot easier to get a record-high water level causing substantial damage,” Masters said.

KAREN ZRAICK,"Giving to the Cajun Navy Numerous volunteer rescue groups go by some variation of Cajun Navy. One registered nonprofit, Cajun Navy Relief, said that its volunteers, who include boaters, EMTs and firefighters, have extensive training and have conducted rescues in previous storms, like Hurricane Harvey last year. As Hurricane Florence approached the Carolinas, the Cajun Navy Relief deployed to an area near Lumberton, N.C., with bass boats, airboats and other vessels, said Josh Richard, a spokesman for the organization. The group has a PayPal account for monetary donations, which are needed to fill fuel containers and buy meals for boat teams and evacuees, among other costs. Go here to donate supplies. Animal shelters Before the storm hit, many local animal shelters scrambled to transport their charges to safe locations, or to get them adopted. The Atlanta Humane Society was caring for dozens of cats and dogs from Beaufort, S.C., and rushed to get other animals in shelters on the Carolina coast out of harm’s way. After Irma last year, the organization put up 1,000 animals in an emergency shelter, and if needed, it could reopen such a facility, said Christina Hill, a spokeswoman for the group. That protects animals in case shelters are damaged, and also frees up space for lost or displaced animals that come in after the storm. (Shelters that reach capacity are sometimes forced to euthanize animals after natural disasters.)","Avair Vereen, 39, left, her fiancé and one of her children at a Hurricane Florence evacuation shelter at Conway High School in South Carolina on Thursday.",2018-09-15T15:43:03Z,"{'id': 'the-new-york-times', 'name': 'The New York Times'}",Hurricane Florence: How to Help,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/15/reader-center/how-to-help-hurricane-florence-victims.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/15/us/15xp-shelters/15xp-shelters-facebookJumbo.jpg,the-new-york-times,The New York Times,Hurricane,1

JOHN LELAND,"Making the tapes was his first training for writing Broadway musicals, he said. “It’s the best preparation,” he said. “I’m creating 90 minutes of material for you, I’m shaping the sound. It’s a rollercoaster of fast tempo, slow tempo. I can intercut bits of songs or comedy skits. I’m controlling the flow entirely, and you can’t skip tracks. I’m creating an experience for you of how I feel or how I want you to feel.” Summers he worked for his father, canvassing door-to-door for candidates or writing music for political ads. “Not jingles,” Lin-Manuel said. “But he’d say, ‘I need 30 seconds of Latin jazz for a Sharpton ad,’ or something for Elliot Spitzer,” the short-tenured governor of New York. One of his mixtape friends was Chris Hayes, who is now a host on MSNBC. Mr. Hayes rode the bus to Hunter from the Bronx neighborhood of Riverdale, and acted in plays with Mr. Miranda. Mr. Miranda rattled off songs from a mixtape Mr. Hayes gave him in ninth grade, all political songs, from Bob Dylan to the hip-hop group Digable Planets. Mr. Hayes said he and Mr. Miranda both saw themselves as less privileged than many of their classmates, and saw the bus ride uptown as a “literal manifestation” of their apartness. Years later, when Mr. Hayes saw a very early workshop of “ Hamilton,” still unfinished, he was struck by the parallels between the title character and the creator, he said. “Seeing Hamilton was an immigrant, he lives uptown, he’s got this outer-borough-striver chip on his shoulder that Lin and I both had — like, I’m going to show these fancy people I belong — it felt so him,” Mr. Hayes said. For Mr. Miranda, Inwood is still home, and subways are still part of his travel diet. Last month he joined a successful campaign to save Coogan’s, the Washington Heights Irish bar that celebrated shamrocks and salsa. “Always happy to rep uptown,” he said. On this morning he was just back from London, where a production of “Hamilton” was starting, without him in the cast, and he was preparing to launch a toy drive for Puerto Rico. He has helped to raise more than $20 million for hurricane relief, and promised to bring “Hamilton” to Puerto Rico in 2019, with himself in the title role. “Since Hurricane Maria, that kind of became my full-time job for a couple months,” he said. Though many relatives have left the island, escaping either the hurricane or the economic collapse that preceded it, others were still there and without power, Luis Miranda said.

"Brian Kahn on Earther, shared by Andrew Couts to Gizmodo","Hurricane Florence is the biggest threat in the Atlantic right now, but it’s hardly the only storm. The tropics have gone wild, with three hurricanes spinning at the same time, as you can see for yourself in satellite imagery captured as the sun rose on the Atlantic Monday morning. In addition to rapidly-strengthening Florence (which just hit Category 3 status), Helene and Isaac became hurricanes on Sunday. More than 2,000 miles separates the three hurricanes so the only way to view them all together is from space. Luckily, there’s a way to do that thanks to GOES 16. The next generation satellite was launched last year with the express intent of improving our view of hurricanes to improve forecasts. But it also provides one hell of a view to the public, showing what our planet is capable of from a vantage point of more than 22,000 miles above the Earth’s surface. GOES 16 also has the ability to zoom in on specific hurricanes, providing close-up views that are equal parts beautiful and harrowing. The National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration released imagery on Monday showing the sun rise over the eye of hurricane Florence. The swirl of clouds around the hurricane’s center, which is starting to clear out, are a sign it’s strengthening as expected. If robots in space aren’t enough, may I offer you one last view courtesy of astronauts? The International Space Station passed over the Atlantic on Monday morning, and astronaut Ricky Arnold shared the absolutely wild images of Florence in a tweet on Monday morning. This the eleventh time on record that three hurricanes have been active at the same time in the Atlantic. The most recent time was last year, when Irma, Jose and Maria all reached hurricane status at the same time. The scars of Irma and Maria are still clear in the Caribbean and Florida. The forecasts for Florence and Isaac are disconcerting as well, making it hard to really savor the views from space. While Helene is likely to steer off into the central Atlantic and poses no immediate risk to land, Florence is rapidly strengthening and is likely to reach the Southeast or Mid-Atlantic by Thursday as a very strong hurricane with a major storm surge risk. It’s quite possible it could stall out over land and dump copious rainfall inland, creating the potential for historic flooding. Meanwhile, Isaac is plowing toward the Caribbean and the Lesser Antilles. While it’s a small hurricane, it could still bring rain and storm surge to a number of islands from Barbados to Antigua. Puerto Rico is also within the storm’s forecast cone, though there’s a lot that can happen between now and this weekend to change its exact track. Still, it’s a storm that bears watching.","Hurricane Florence is the biggest threat in the Atlantic right now, but it’s hardly the only storm.

"Samira Said, CNN","Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (CNN) As floodwaters forced some South Carolinians to evacuate in Hurricane Florence's aftermath, the man known as the ""Hurricane Cowboy"" rode into dangerous areas to save abandoned animals. In the past week, Patrick Mckann, a 42-year-old Virginia horse trainer, said he and his friends have rescued six horses, two donkeys, around 14 guinea fowl and lots of chickens threatened by the disaster's encroaching waters. Mckann -- who got his nickname helping folks in Texas after Hurricane Harvey last year -- and longtime friend Travis Holstein traveled a week ago to Burgaw, North Carolina, to join the rescue efforts. Arriving in the town north of Wilmington, they met up with other volunteers from Harvey, Sean Irion and Malachai Huffman. Together, the men were intent on going to hard-hit areas to save animals that otherwise would have drowned or starved. ""We just do what we can do,"" Mckann told CNN. Rather than waste their time in meetings with other volunteers, the men took a traditional cowboy approach to their rescue work, he said. ""As cowboys we just said let's get in a huddle and say, 'You get a rope, I'll do this and get a handle this way,' "" he said. In Burgaw, a veterinarian whose truck had been engulfed in the flooding reached out for help, so the men took Mckann's horse trailer and answered the call. ""The vet had sank her truck in high water,"" he said. ""(While) they checked on her, we roped two donkeys. ""We pulled them back to safety,"" he said. ""They actually pulled us for a while."" 'That's him! That's the Hurricane Cowboy!' Mckann has been around animals all his life and ""cowboying"" since he was a kid, he told CNN. At 5, he started riding auction horses and then at 14, race horses. By the time he was 17, he had moved on to broncos and bulls. But it wasn't until Hurricane Harvey that he earned his moniker. ""I bought a new truck and was listening to CNN on Sirius radio,"" the former bull rider said. ""They were talking about flooding and people down there (in the Houston area). I had this new truck and a trailer... so that's when I said, 'Well, I guess I'm going down there.' "" With the trailer full of supplies donated by friends and other community members, Mckann packed up and drove 1,200 miles to southeast Texas, where he said he helped rescue cows, horses and chickens. He even drove home to Virginia, picked up more supplies and brought them back. ""We put about 25,000 miles on (the new truck),"" he said, between the two trips and driving around the Lone Star State. Mckann was loading up his trailer on a return trip to Virginia when he overheard a woman telling a volunteer she wanted to give her donations to the ""Hurricane Cowboy."" ""You know, the cowboy that loads up his truck and takes it down himself,"" Mckann recalls the woman saying. That's when she turned around and saw Mckann standing there. ""That's him!"" she said, according to Mckann. ""That's the Hurricane Cowboy!"" After helping the vet in Burgaw, Mckann and his fellow cowboys wanted to head to the next town in need. They quickly realized animals in Conway, South Carolina, were in trouble. With rivers converging in the inland town near Myrtle Beach -- and news reports indicating conditions could get worse -- the Hurricane Cowboy and his team wanted to focus their efforts there. ""We took a few minutes, looked at a map, figured out where the water would be high,"" he said. Once in Conway, they went straight to work after a man told them that three of his horses were trapped. He was afraid they would drown, Mckann said. It was the perfect chance for the rescuers to put their skills to the test. They had to walk 4 miles, Mckann said, mostly in floodwater. But they managed to ride the three horses out to safety. A local news outlet did a story on them, and residents began reaching out. One call came from an older couple who said they had to leave their animals behind, Mckann said. He and his friends made the miles-long journey to the couple's house by boat, tractor and then by foot -- at one point walking in water up to Mckann's chest, he said. The men found three horses, one of which was unbroken, Mckann said. But he managed to get things under control, and they saved all three, he said. On Friday night, Mckann headed back to Virginia to pick up more donations with Holstein. He pledges to return to the flood-ravaged region -- either to Conway or Lumberton, North Carolina -- to drop off supplies as soon as they can get back. He said he's only too glad to lend a hand to ""these little towns no one helps."" ""People forget about them,"" he said. ""We're just cowboys out here doing our job.""","As floodwaters forced some South Carolinians to evacuate in Hurricane Florence's aftermath, the man known as the ""Hurricane Cowboy"" rode into dangerous areas to save abandoned animals.",2018-09-29T19:17:47Z,"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",First it was Harvey.

Adrian Florido,"Rafaela Serrano's house in the municipality of Caguas is still roofless eight months after Hurricane Maria. Countless homes on the island remain damaged two weeks before the start of the next hurricane season. Adrian Florido/NPR Standing at a lectern before reporters Thursday, Carlos Acevedo, the head of Puerto Rico's emergency management agency, made an admission. Before Hurricane Maria, he said, the island's government did not take updates to its hurricane response plans seriously. ""Before Maria, updating our plans was very easy,"" Acevedo said. ""We would take the first and last pages, remove them, replace them with new pages, sign them, and there was the new plan."" It came as no surprise then, Acevedo said, that the government's outdated and recycled plan – written for a Category 1 hurricane – was wholly inadequate to guide its response after Hurricane Maria's category 4 winds devastated the island last September. ""I'm very honest,"" Acevedo went on. ""The plan did not say what we would do if the communication systems failed."" Which they did, thwarting the government's ability to coordinate a response. The reason he'd called reporters to the agency's headquarters on the outskirts of San Juan was to get the word out that all that had changed. The agency was finalizing a process that Acevedo said it had never before undertaken. It had re-written its hurricane response plan ""from zero."" Two weeks before the start of hurricane season, local and federal officials in Puerto Rico are eager to assure the island's residents that the government is better prepared than it has ever been to respond should another hurricane hit. But across the island, and especially in communities still recovering from Hurricane Maria, many residents are highly skeptical. It took Rafaela Serrano eight months to save enough to fix her home. She's finally got the money, but says she'll wait until the end of the next hurricane season, just in case. Adrian Florido/NPR ""Just look at my house,"" said Rafaela Serrano, who lives on a sloping cul-de-sac in the municipality of Caguas. Her roof is missing, the gaping hole covered by a blue tarp that federal relief workers installed shortly after the storm. Most of the homes in her neighborhood still display unrepaired damage eight months after the hurricane tore off roofs and blew out windows. ""A lot of people still haven't fixed their houses. So no, we are not prepared for another hurricane,"" Serrano said. Nonetheless, officials insist they are well prepared. The Federal Emergency Management Agency says it has added four new warehouses across the island and filled them with millions of emergency meals and bottles of water and tens of thousands of tarps. Before Hurricane Maria, FEMA had just one warehouse on the island, which made supply distribution difficult. And in the weeks ahead the agency plans to give additional supplies to each of the island's 78 municipalities, so mayors can begin responding immediately should their communities once again be cut off in a storm's aftermath. FEMA is also urging residents to create their own emergency plans, and to stock enough supplies to last ten days. Officials also said they have pre-positioned emergency generators at critical facilities like police and fire stations and hospitals. And Sandra Torres, head of the agency that regulations telecommunications on the island, said work was under way to prevent another total collapse of the island's communication systems. That includes the installation of satellite communications systems at critical facilities and new radio antennas at more than 320 hospitals. She also said that more than 1,000 miles of fiber-optic cables had been buried underground. ""Undergrounding is so important,"" Torres said. ""Not depending on poles owned by the power utility will help a lot, because the weight of the cables had a lot to do with the collapse of that infrastructure."" One of the biggest concerns, of course, is the still fragile electrical grid. Roughly 18,000 homes on the island are still waiting for power, and on Friday, the last of the mainland restoration crews hired by the federal government will pack up and head home, leaving the rest of the job to PREPA, the island's electric utility company. Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's non-voting member of Congress, had in the last week written two urgent letters requesting that FEMA extend the contract of those power crews so that the remaining homes could be energized more quickly. But on Thursday, Michael Byrne, FEMA's top officer in Puerto Rico, said no extension would be granted. Byrne said FEMA would, however, keep 700 emergency generators on the island, as well as the three massive generators hooked up to the island's major power plants. Despite all those preparations, Javier Solis said he was still worried. Javier Solis can't keep metal roofing panels in stock at his roadside hardware shop on the outskirts of San Juan. Adrian Florido/NPR Solis runs a roadside hardware store on the outskirts of San Juan. Every day, he has customers showing up to ask for the corrugated aluminum roofing panels that Hurricane Maria blew off of so many homes on the island. He's still having trouble stocking them, and when he does, they sell out within hours. Solis also makes deliveries. ""I've driven to so many places on the island,"" Solis said, including to areas still without power. ""And I've seen so many homes without roofs, people who are still waiting for help, people who don't have money for repairs, who all need the same thing but can't get it."" Solis thinks the only way that Puerto Rico will avoid massive destruction again is by evading another hurricane. ""Let's hope we don't get another one,"" Solis said. ""Because it's going to be difficult. It's going to be difficult.""","The head of the island's emergency management agency admits the government did not take hurricane preparation seriously before Hurricane Maria, but says all that's changed.",2018-05-18T02:31:40Z,"{'id': None, 'name': 'Npr.org'}","Puerto Rico Officials Say They're Ready for Hurricane Season, But Worries Mount",https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/17/612203204/puerto-rico-officials-say-theyre-ready-for-hurricane-season-but-worries-mount,https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/05/17/serrano-house_wide-3a8630ad6510065f8a3204d6bf436173e67aca0c.jpg?s=1400,,Npr.org,Hurricane,1
Megan Molteni,"Last Wednesday, Hurricane Michael slammed into the Florida Panhandle at 155 miles per hour, flattening neighborhoods, turning subdivisions into rubble, and plunging the coast into darkness. On Friday, Trevor Lewis packed up two trucks with crowbars, chainsaws, sledgehammers, ropes, walkie talkies, and five other guys from Cocoa Beach, where he lives on the east side of the state. As night fell they began the drive up into the worst of the wreckage. By 4 am on Saturday they were responding to their first call for help. Lewis leads a self-funded search-and-rescue unit made up of off-duty police officers, firefighters, and EMTs. They call themselves Salty Water Rescue Services, and most of them have special emergency training on the high-speed powerboat racing circuit off Cocoa Beach. Theyre one of hundreds of volunteer crews that showed up post-Michael to help first responders overwhelmed by 911 calls. They used as their guide a service called Crowdsource Rescue, or CSR, which showed on a map individuals who might need help. On one of Salty Waters visits, the crew met a woman whose house had a gas leak, so Lewis called local authorities. Its an eerie feeling to dial that number thinking someones going to come and it goes straight to a busy signal, he says. The womans family had used CSR to request a wellness check on their relative. The idea behind CSR started out simple: collect calls for help posted on social media, geolocate them, and route volunteers to the distressed parties. Basically, Uber for emergencies. It was a simple enough concept that a pair of developers named Matthew Marchetti and Nate Larson hacked it together in about six soggy hours in Houston last August while Hurricane Harvey howled outside. They expected it to help out a few families in their rapidly flooding neighborhood. By the time the storm was over, Marchetti says at least 25,000 people had been reached using the web service. Turns out, armies of spontaneous samaritans can get a lot more done if technology tells them where to go. The volunteers are going to show up no matter what, says Marchetti. Were just trying to empower them to find more people safely and more effectively. What began as a one-off charitable coding sprint has since evolved into a five-person emergency volunteer mission control center. In their day jobs at a real estate company, Marchetti and Larson built maps. And thats basically what the first version of CSR was. But as more hurricanes rocked the US in quick succession in late 2017first Irma, then Mariathe pair piled on new features as problems arose in real-time. We would change something on the site while there were 60,000 people using it, and if they didnt like it, theyd let us know, says Marchetti. We had no master plan. It was all just reactionary. In January, when the hurricane season had ended, they found time for a more thoughtful redesign. The latest version, released two weeks before Florence hit, includes a mobile app and new safeguards. It allows users to tag hazards such as downed power lines, washed-out roads, and fast-moving water. It also gives CSR the flexibility to block off any areas that emergency management officials have declared dangerous for civilians, so that volunteers without proper training cant see aid requests in those areas. Those precautions are to prevent volunteers from winding up needing rescuing themselves. Thats less of a concern for volunteers like Lewiss Salty Water crew, who used CSR for the first time during Florence, but who are no strangers to treacherous waters. After that September storm swept through, seven of their guys drove to North Carolina with a flat-bottom boat and two tuned-up jet skis with rescue sleds on the back. Over the course of a few sleepless days they checked in on nearly 100 people, delivering supplies, relaying messages to loved ones, and helping the unluckiest few to safety, including about a dozen shivering pets. On the long drive back to Cocoa Beach they decided to formally partner up with the crowdsource platform. But when Michael arrived two months later with its powerful Category 4 winds, Lewis and his teammates had used up most of their vacation time responding to Florence, so they could only stay four days. They had AT&amp;T, which Lewis says was the only carrier with coverage, and switched to walkie-talkies when they hit areas with service outages. If they couldn't relay their findings back to worried families directly, they'd take pictures or video to share using their phones later. He says that in the time they were in Panhandle, his team reached more than 300 people using the app. Yet the rescue that sticks in his mind most vividly wasnt coordinated by CSR. It came about just by chance. She was the neighbor of someone whose family had filed a wellness request; Lewis spotted her as they were preparing to move on to the next ticket, and he asked if she was alright. It soon became clear she wasnt. A widow in her 80s and frail, she lived alone. There was almost no food or water in her house. A section of her roof had been ripped clear of its frame. An immigrant from Thailand, she had no family in the US. No one was looking for her. She had one friend in the city, but with no phone service she couldnt call her. It was heart wrenching, says Lewis. His team reached the friend and waited until she came to pick the old woman up. Then they patched her roof and ripped out her wet carpet, collected her valuables and put them in a safe place to dry. They filed a new CSR ticket so that there was a record. And so that someone follows up. But the incident showed one of the apps biggest limitationson its own it cant locate missing people. Being homeless, phoneless, family-less, or Facebook-less can make dangerous storms even more deadly in the days and weeks after the worst weather has passed. Thats one of the reasons Marchettis team has started to layer social vulnerability indices and flood zones onto its maps of areas where hurricanes are expected to hit. As landfall predictions firm up, CSR places Facebook ads for its app targeted at people living in the path of the storm. They start making calls to churches and local community organizations, trying to raise awareness of the resource. We want to play this role of equalizer, to come in serve as a stopgap, he says. Not having the ability or the funds to evacuate doesnt mean you dont deserve to be helped. Early Wednesday morning, CSR had more than 1,200 open tickets for people not yet verified as safe. But as more people got cell service and volunteers cleared a backlog of requests, that number dropped to 548 by the end of the day. Marchetti says that doesnt necessarily mean that all of those people really are missing and presumed dead. They could be staying with other friends or relatives and unable to communicate. But we are starting to hit that point in every disaster where that number becomes more and more representative of the real thing, he says. A more official number could emerge as soon as Thursday evening, when the Federal Emergency Management Agency expects to complete its search and rescue operations. The agency has 10 crews and a dozen cadaver-sniffing dogs scouring the destruction scattered across Bay, Gulf, and Jackson counties, according to FEMA spokesperson Ruben Brown, reached Wednesday at the agencys interim operating facility in Tallahassee. State officials have not provided a count of the people currently considered to be missing. The states division of emergency management has an online system where people can report missing individuals as well as the locations of people who are trapped or running out of medications and other supplies. But Florida officials did not respond to questions about how those lists are used to coordinate searches. The states website also links to a searchable American Red Cross registry where people can list themselves as safe and well for their loved ones to find.

Marcus Gilmer,"With a monster hurricane spinning towards the east coast, President Donald Trump took a moment during a briefing on Tuesday to herald the awful, delayed response to 2017's Hurricane Maria as an ""unsung success,"" sparking outrage online. Calling it ""one of the best jobs that's ever been done with respect to what this is all about,"" Trump is ignoring what was, in fact, a dreadful response that cost more lives than what the storm death toll originally claimed. SEE ALSO: Hurricane Florence is on its way to the East Coast. Here's what to expect. At the time, the administration committed to a more aggressive response to storms that struck Texas, even as that situation there became more manageable and Puerto Rico desperately needed more assistance. But perhaps worst of all is the fact that Trump is using words like ""tremendous"" and ""success"" to describe a response to a storm that ultimately killed almost 3,000 people, more than the roughly 1,800 killed by Hurricane Katrina and about the same number of people who were killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. As far as Trump's response is concerned, the most lasting image of his involvement with Hurricane Maria will be the time he visited Puerto Rico and threw rolls of paper towels to survivors. As one could imagine, Trump's egregiously tone-deaf statement on Tuesday did not go over well on Twitter. Trump simply does not get it. Thus his neglect towards Puerto Rico cost about 3,000 lives. Unfortunately, it seems he will never get it. — Carmen Yulín Cruz (@CarmenYulinCruz) September 11, 2018 Hey @realDonaldTrump : Almost 3,000 Americans died and it took ELEVEN months for your administration to restore power to #PuertoRico. That doesn't even REMOTELY qualify as a success. Your response was a shameful failure and one of the worst stains of your embarrassing presidency. https://t.co/htnEKRtvZU — Rep.

Roughly as many Americans died because of Trump's failure in Puerto Rico as died on 9/11. Just another example of this administration's indifference to brown people's humanity. — Barred and Boujee (@AudreLawdAMercy) September 11, 2018 None of this gives us any confidence in how Trump will respond to Hurricane Florence's landfall, which is projected to hit somewhere along the Carolina coast later this week.","With a monster hurricane spinning towards the east coast, President Donald Trump took a moment during a briefing on Tuesday to herald the awful, delayed response to 2017's Hurricane Maria as an ""unsung success,"" sparking outrage online.

""For example, they might post about helping people find everything from free transportation to supplies and connecting volunteers with organizations that need help."" It pointed out that Community Help had been used during more than 500 global crises including Hurricane Harvey, the floods in Brazil and Mumbai, the earthquake in Central Mexico and the attack in Barcelona. Through over 750,000 posts, comments and messages, people have accessed and organized volunteer opportunities, emergency shelter as well as food and clothing donations. Facebook is rolling out the feature to businesses and organizations starting now and at launch groups like Direct Relief, Feeding America, International Medical Corps, the California Department of Forestry and Fire, Lyft and Save the Children have access. Facebook says it will become available to more groups in the coming weeks. ""We hope this update makes it even easier for people to get the help they need in times of crisis and will give businesses and organizations an opportunity to build stronger communities around them,"" said Facebook.","Facebook has been evolving its Safety Check feature over the last year, adding complementary capabilities to go alongside it and building it into a crisis hub.
